This month, McMahon/Ryan is \nlaunching its Go Blue 4 Kids campaign to help end child abuse.\n  Go Blue 4 Kids is a first-of-its-kind collaboration among five \ncentral New York healthcare leaders who are focused on raising \nawareness about child abuse prevention. In recognition of April being \nNational Child Abuse Awareness Month, myself and hundreds of my \nconstituents will be wearing blue, painting a blue pinwheel, or \nattending local events to raise awareness about child abuse prevention.\n  As a former Federal prosecutor, I am all too aware that much remains \nto be done if we are to guarantee a safe and happy upbringing for all \nAmerican youths.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me and the 24th District of New York to \njoin the Go Blue 4 Kids campaign.

Mr. Speaker, this week the Cambodian American \ncommunity of Long Beach will observe Remembrance Day, commemorating 41 \nyears since the end of the Cambodian genocide.\n  This horrific event, in which the Khmer Rouge killed approximately \n1.7 million Cambodians from all walks of life, devastated Cambodia for \nyears, depriving the country of a generation of its best and its \nbrightest, and leaving a lifetime of trauma for Cambodians living in \nthe United States and around the world.\n  I have introduced H.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in advance of tax day to address \nthe U.S. Tax Code and its impact on our economy.\n  There is no escaping the fact that our Tax Code is written in a \nmanner that is burdensome to individuals. It is complex and unruly. \nHowever, I want to speak briefly about the dire effects that it has on \nsmall businesses.\n  Over 28 million small businesses in this country are the true \neconomic drivers. As the tax changes continue to plague small \nbusinesses, we have a major problem. Instead of concentrating on \nservicing their customers, growing their company, or creating jobs, \nthey are overwhelmed with tax provision changes. This is a never-ending \nstory.\n  When that small business in Nevada diverts efforts and resources to \ndeal with tax compliance issues, they are not focusing on why they are \nin business. They need a Tax Code that is simpler, fairer, and flatter.\n  As the debate surrounding tax reform continues, let's make sure that \nour Tax Code doesn't impact job creation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1740-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          JACKIE ROBINSON DAY\n\n  (Mr. COHEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today is Jackie Robinson Day, declared such \nby Major League Baseball, but it should be declared such by the United \nStates of America.\n  On April 15, 1947, Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier. For 80-\nsome odd years, there were no African American players in the major \nleagues. Branch Rickey put Jackie Robinson on the Brooklyn Dodgers and \nbaseball became integrated. It truly became America's national pastime.\n  Today, Major League Baseball players will all wear number 42, a \nnumber retired and allowed to be worn only on this day in honor of \nJackie Robinson on the occasion of integrating Major League Baseball.\n  Jackie Robinson was a great American and a great athlete. He lettered \nin four sports at UCLA. He was a great major league player with the \nBrooklyn Dodgers and was honored by being inducted into the Hall of \nFame.\n  Today there is a Jackie Robinson Foundation that gives young people \nscholarships to go to college and to do good deeds. He was very much \ninterested in moving America forward in civil rights, and he did all he \ncould.\n  I was fortunate to travel to Cuba with the President. I met his \nwidow, Rachel, and his daughter, Sharon, who gave me a button--and this \nis a replica of it--designating April 15 as Jackie Robinson Day. I \nthink we should all think about his contributions to America and what \ncontributions we can make to America to make us a more perfect Union.\n  Thank you, Jackie Robinson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1740-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          175TH ANNIVERSARY OF PORTER TOWNSHIP, CLINTON COUNTY\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nthe 175th anniversary of Porter Township, Clinton County, located in \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, which was founded in 1841 \nand named for the current Governor at the time, David Porter.\n  The township was settled by Scotch Irish pioneers and was known in \nits early days for the Washington Iron Works, built in 1809 and \noperated until 1878.\n  Like so much of Clinton County, Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional \nDistrict, and the Commonwealth as a whole, the township has been also \ndependent on the timber industry over its 175-year history. To this \nday, the timber industry remains vital, contributing an estimated $90 \nmillion per year to the county's economy.\n  At 175 years old, Porter County is older than 24 States. This is, \nindeed, a milestone to celebrate. The celebration begins this weekend, \non Saturday, with an opening ceremony that will include guest speakers, \na hymn sing, and an ice cream social. Further events are planned \nthrough the end of the year, including a 5K Color Walk/Run and tours of \ntownship farms.\n  Again, congratulations to the officials and residents of Porter \nTownship on this huge milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1740-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LET'S MOVE FORWARD AND PASS A BUDGET\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, at the end of last year, Congress put aside \npolitical grandstanding and actually made some progress: a budget \nagreement that was supposed to be a framework for 2 years. It wasn't a \nperfect agreement, but it kept us from going off a cliff. It did some \ngood for the folks we represent. It set aside much of the damaging \nacross-the-board cuts and gave Federal agencies, businesses, and \nworkers some certainty and predictability.\n  Congress simply passing a budget at this point is a bit like a dog \nplaying the piano. The song may not sound perfect, but it is a dog \nplaying the piano. Congress actually passed a budget.\n  But here we go again. As I stand here, we, once again, don't have an \nannual budget. I struggle to explain to my constituents how Congress \nis, once again, snatching defeat from the claws of victory and how this \ndysfunction remains the norm.\n  The solution here is simple. Let's stick to the compromise made just \na few months ago. Let's stick with what a majority of the House and \nSenate actually backed just a few months ago. Let's avoid shutdowns and \ndysfunction and get to work on moving this economy and this Congress \nforward.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1740-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1740]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONDITION OF THE GENERAL FARM ECONOMY\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week the Agriculture Subcommittee on \nGeneral Farm Commodities and Risk Management held a hearing--and will \nbe holding more--on the condition of the general farm economy.\n  We see prices of commodities going down extremely from a high just a \ncouple of years ago. Indeed, farm income is down approximately 56 \npercent, according to the USDA.\n  Steps need to be taken to ensure stability in the ag economy because \nit is a large part of the export market for us; and the stability of \nU.S. food prices and the economy in rural America rely on it.\n  We need to have the type of policy that helps keep business in \nAmerica doing well. It isn't just devising policy here in Washington, \nD.C., but also not making a regulatory burden and causing the prices of \ninputs to continue to spiral upward as we watch farm prices at the gate \ngo down.\n  We need to do much more to have a friendly atmosphere for business. \nThat includes agriculture in this country. And we hope to come up with \nsolutions as we put the spotlight on the Agriculture Committee in the \ncoming weeks.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1740-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1740-H1741]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  IMMIGRATION POPULATION SETS RECORDS\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Eshoo) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation \nof Broadband Internet Access Act.\n  From the first indication that the Federal Communications Commission \nintended to reclassify broadband Internet access service as a title II \nservice subject to utility regulation, the Subcommittee on \nCommunications and Technology has made it a priority to ensure that the \nFCC bureaucracy never has the authority to actually get in and \nmicromanage and regulate rates.\n  The Internet is a model of innovation, flourishing under decades of \nlight-touch or no-touch regulation. That is how it has flourished, Mr. \nChairman.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n  In recent years, as the FCC has repeatedly attempted to regulate the \nmanagement of Internet traffic, the potential reach of those \nregulations has grown, prompting concerns that the FCC would retreat to \nthe world of rate regulation that typified the monopoly telephone era.\n  Unfortunately, these fears proved well-founded when the FCC announced \nin early 2015, Mr. Chairman, that it would reclassify the Internet as a \nutility-style service as part of the newest net neutrality rules--rules \nthat are currently being challenged in the courts, I might add.\n  I would like to begin by addressing one of the most common attacks \nagainst this legislation, Mr. Chairman: that we are attempting to \n``gut'' the FCC's authority to implement net neutrality rules. That \nsimply is not the case.\n  We are supportive of clear, bright-line rules of the road for ISPs \nand the way they treat Internet traffic. We are for that. In fact, last \nyear I released a discussion draft bill, along with Chairman Upton and \nSenator Thune, that would codify those very rules.\n  What we don't support is the use of outdated, ill-suited regulations \nto achieve those goals. This bill isn't intended to touch the net \nneutrality rules, and, in fact, an amendment I offered up in committee \nmarkup goes so far as to make an explicit exemption to ensure that the \nbill would not impact the FCC's work to ban paid prioritization. What \nthis bill does is prohibit the FCC from regulating the amount charged \nto a consumer by an ISP for the provision of broadband service, a fact \nmade clear by our definitions.\n  There is another objection, Mr. Chairman, we have heard repeatedly, \nand that is that the FCC had chosen to forbear from several of the \nprovisions in title II and that the Chairman of the FCC had promised \nnot to regulate rates anyway, so this bill is really unnecessary.\n  Again, this is simply not the case. The FCC did forbear from various \nsections of title II, but the authority to regulate rates through \nenforcement was and is still very much on the table. In addition, while \nChairman Wheeler did promise before our subcommittee and multiple other \ncommittees of the Congress that he would not regulate rates, there was \nnothing to bind him or his successors to that commitment.\n  The need for the certainty of a statutory ban on rate regulation \nbecame even clearer just a few weeks ago when the bill's sponsor, \nRepresentative Kinzinger, actually asked the Chairman of the FCC, \nChairman Wheeler, whether he believed the FCC should have the authority \nto regulate rates. Chairman Wheeler's response: ``Yes, sir.''\n  Given the philosophy of the Chairman himself, it is clearly more \npressing than ever that this bill becomes law. The FCC cannot and \nshould not be able to regulate the rates charged by ISPs to their \ncustomers. This sort of regulatory overhang clouds the decisionmaking \nof providers and dissuades them from offering innovative, pro-consumer \npricing plans and service offerings, lest the Commission come back \nafter the fact and penalize them.\n  Take T-Mobile's Binge On service as a prime example. Consumers are \nable to access video offered by any participant in the program without \nthat data counting toward their monthly usage limits or charges. Edge \nproviders win because their content is viewed more often. The service \nprovider wins because they actually attract more customers. It is \ncalled the marketplace. It is innovation in the marketplace responding \nto what consumers want. Most importantly, consumers win because they \nare able to access the desired content with no cost or penalty.\n  Sounds pretty good, doesn't it?\n  Now, I am not here to advocate for one company over another, but this \nis called innovation in the marketplace. This is what entrepreneurship \nis all about. But, unfortunately, under the opaque rules of the FCC, T-\nMobile had no way of knowing whether this sort of Binge On pricing \nscheme would violate the Commission's rules. They didn't know.\n  And while T-Mobile has taken this risk, many providers may now choose \nnot to do so, ultimately depriving customers of choices they otherwise \nwould have. You see, everybody is a little afraid, does this Chairman \nor the next Chairman come back, after the fact, and say: Well, you \nknow, that is really not something we think is too dandy to do, so we \nare going to penalize you. It is called after-the-fact regulation.\n  So, as an unfortunate corollary to this chapter of Internet history, \nthe same kind of flip-flop we are concerned we will see on rate \nregulation is exactly what we have seen with respect to Binge On. You \nsee, Chairman Wheeler was ``okay with it'' until he decided maybe not.\n  As a former businessowner myself, I can tell you that you can't make \nbusiness additions based on a hope and a prayer of your regulator. I \nwas actually regulated by the FCC. I knew the rules. I followed them. \nThey were clear. They were bright-line.\n  In an incredibly innovative marketplace, which the Internet thrives \nin, can you imagine having the lack of clarity and the ability to go \nback after the fact and, in effect, rate regulate? This will stifle \ncompetition, innovation, and consumer choice.\n  Finally, I would like to address charges that this bill would leave \ncustomers helpless to overcharge, or worse, by ISPs. We would all share \nthat concern. We don't want that, and this bill provides protection.\n  The notion that the FCC, an agency that didn't have authority over \nInternet service providers' rates until last year--until last year--is \nthe only line of defense between customers and fraud is, frankly, \nsilly. It is a silly claim.\n  Customers have gotten along just fine without the aid of the FCC \nregulating rates; and this notion that the FCC is the only cop on the \nbeat for consumers would come as a surprise--a real surprise--to many \nStates attorneys general and consumer advocates\n\n[[Page H1742]]\n\nacross the Nation. All those protections, and fraud, abuse still \nprevail out there.\n  This bill is a carefully tailored piece of legislation that is \ntargeted at just one thing--one thing, Mr. Chairman--and that is \nunnecessary bureaucratic, Washington-based rate regulation. We used the \nmost narrow definition, inserted rules of construction, and made \nspecific exemptions to the prohibition, all in an attempt to address \nthe concerns that were raised by the witnesses in our hearings that we \nheld, Mr. Chairman, Members at markup and others who participated in \nthe process.\n  We listened to all of those voices say: How do we make this right? \nHow do we make it narrow? How do we get at just the issue here of a \nbureaucracy that wants to expand and grow and micromanage and rate \nregulate?\n  We sought to prevent unintended consequences, unlike the FCC, who \ncrafted their rules to have the broadest and furthest reaching scope. \nImagine that, Mr. Chairman, from a bureaucracy that writes rules, that \nthey would write rules that are broadly written so they have more power \nfor themselves. In fact, many of the changes we made to the bill at \nfull committee markup were inspired by an amendment offered by \nRepresentative Matsui of California. Drawing on her suggested changes, \nwe amended the bill to be a more targeted draft.\n  We also considered amendments by multiple other Members of Congress \nbut felt that they would not have resulted in the kind of prohibition \nthat this situation narrowly calls for, one that clearly prohibits all \nflavors of ratemaking, not just before-the-fact tariffing where they \nsay you can charge $7, that is it--that would be tariffing before the \nfact--but also after-the-fact regulation, where they come back, Mr. \nChairman, and say: Oh, by the way, whatever you were charging, we have \nnow kind of thought about that, and we think it was too much or too \nlittle or whatever.\n\n  While I am disappointed that so many of my colleagues across the \naisle cannot support this bill, it wasn't for lack of trying. It wasn't \nfor lack of a hearings process or taking many of their suggestions to \nheart and modifying our underlying text. I nonetheless, though, \nstrongly believe that this legislation is an essential step in \nmaintaining the robust and vibrant Internet ecosystem that drives our \neconomy, powers innovations, and prompts and promotes new jobs and \ninvestment like no other service. The last thing we want to throw on \nthere is the cold water of Washington bureaucracy after-the-fact \nregulation that will stifle competition and innovation that has so \nbenefited consumers in this great Internet economy in which we find \nourselves.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2666, and I \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, today we are debating a bill that the majority has \ntitled the No Rate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act. It \nsounds terrific.\n  On the surface, this bill appears to do what Democrats and \nRepublicans both support. We both support this. What we support is very \nclear: preventing the FCC from setting the monthly rate that customers \npay for Internet access service. But in reality, this bill is about \nundermining the FCC's authority to protect consumers and ensure a free \nand open Internet for all.\n  I listened very carefully to the chairman, whom I respect, who is my \nfriend, talking about innovation, talking about the effect that that \nhas on so much that we do.\n  I represent the innovation capital of our country and the world, \nSilicon Valley, so I think that I understand something about innovation \nand the ingredients that make it work. As the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, I have made it very clear that I do not support setting \nrates for customers to pay on Internet access, nor do any of my \nDemocratic colleagues on the committee.\n  In fact--and the chairman left this out. The chairman left this out. \nIn fact, during the subcommittee and full committee markup of this \nbill, I offered an airtight, one-page amendment, right here--right \nhere, one-page amendment--to codify that the FCC will permanently \nforbear from setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access. \nIt is airtight. It is as clear as a bell, but it was rejected twice.\n  Now, why would the majority reject exactly what they say they are \nseeking? It is a good question. It is a rhetorical question, but it \nshould be raised. I think it is because this bill is about more than \nthe FCC setting the rates that customers pay for Internet access.\n  The FCC is the cop on the beat in the communications marketplace. \nThat means the FCC has the responsibility to keep watch over the \ncompanies that provide our cell phone, cable, and Internet services to \nensure that everyone is treated fairly.\n  I think, in the absence of the following, not one consumer \norganization in the country supports the bill that is on the floor \nbecause it is overly broad. The definition of rate regulation in this \nbill leaves the door open for courts to strike down the FCC's authority \nto protect consumers and act in the public interest if they interpret \nany of its actions as impacting broadband Internet rates. That is what \nthis bill does. That is what we object to. We do not object to, \nessentially, what the title of the bill is, No Rate Regulation of \nBroadband Internet Access.\n  These protections include prohibiting Internet service providers, \nISPs, from capping the amount of data that customers can use; outlawing \npay-for-privacy agreements where consumers have to pay fees to avoid \nhaving their data collected and sold to third parties; enforcing net \nneutrality rules against blocking Web sites; and reviewing mergers that \nincrease consolidation and limit choice in the broadband Internet \nmarket.\n  As I said a moment ago, it is no wonder this bill is opposed by over \n70 public interest groups, including the National Hispanic Media \nCoalition, the Consumer Federation of America, and the National \nConsumer Law Center. And the White House has said that it will veto the \nbill.\n  We could have come here with a very simple bill that essentially is \nwhat my amendment stated: no rate regulation. That is what the majority \nsays that they are for, except the bill goes way beyond that.\n  I want to make it clear to my colleagues and to the American people \nthat may be tuned in to this debate: This bill, in its broadness, is an \nattack on consumers and an attack on the FCC's net neutrality rules. \nNow, that is not a surprise because the majority has never supported \nthat. And that is why I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2666.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record three letters from consumer \norganizations.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                                   April 12, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: We understand that \n     floor consideration of H.R. 2666, the ``No Rate Regulation of \n     Broadband Internet Access Act,'' is expected following a \n     meeting of the House Committee on Rules this week.\n       The undersigned groups strongly urge you and your \n     colleagues to vote against H.R. 2666, because it would block \n     the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) from fulfilling \n     its essential consumer-protection responsibilities. This \n     would be disastrous for all of the people and businesses in \n     America that use the Internet. Simply, H.R. 2666 would \n     prevent the FCC from doing its job to protect the American \n     people.\n       H.R. 2666's overly broad definitions and undefined language \n     would create extreme regulatory uncertainty. It would \n     hamstring the FCC's ability to carry out its congressionally-\n     mandated responsibilities. The impacts of this legislation \n     are wide-ranging and difficult to fully enumerate, given the \n     broad definitions of ``rates'' and ``regulation'' in the \n     bill, which conflict with legal precedent. Yet several \n     harmful impacts are readily apparent.\n       First, it is clear that the bill is yet another attempt to \n     undermine the FCC's Open Internet Order and the principles of \n     net neutrality. The Order ``expressly eschew[ed] the future \n     use of prescriptive, industry-wide rate regulation'' and the \n     FCC forbore from the legal authorities that enable it to set \n     rates.\n       Although the FCC is not setting rates, stripping away its \n     authority to review monopoly charges and other unjust and \n     unreasonable business practices would harm everyone. It would \n     especially harm the families and small businesses that rely \n     on an affordable and open Internet to find jobs, do \n     schoolwork, or reach consumers to compete in the 21st century \n     global marketplace.\n\n[[Page H1743]]\n\n       This legislation threatens the FCC's ability to enforce \n     merger conditions that provide low-cost broadband to \n     disadvantaged communities, harming low-income Americans who \n     already have limited broadband access, and further widening \n     the digital divide.\n       It would give a free ride to companies currently imposing \n     punitive data caps and introducing zero-rating schemes, which \n     the FCC has rightly questioned and continues to investigate. \n     And despite the bill's imprecise references to \n     interconnection and paid prioritization, it would leave open \n     the very real possibility that these companies may try to \n     extort and extract additional payments from websites and \n     applications to reach their customers--even though the \n     ability to download and upload the content of their choosing \n     is exactly what broadband customers pay for.\n       By using the term interconnection in an undefined manner, \n     H.R. 2666 also creates significant uncertainty about what, if \n     anything, the FCC can do to protect the public from \n     interconnection-related harms. Congestion at interconnection \n     points--locations where the Internet's backbone \n     infrastructure connects to last-mile providers such as \n     Comcast and AT hurt consumers and online businesses in \n     recent years, and this bill would leave the public vulnerable \n     to those harms.\n       Lastly, the legislation would undermine the FCC's efforts \n     to protect consumer privacy, including oversight of so-called \n     ``pay-for-privacy'' plans that require customers to pay \n     significant additional fees to their broadband provider to \n     avoid having their online data collected and sold to third \n     parties.\n       In sum, the broad definition of ``regulation'' in H.R. 2666 \n     would make it difficult, if not impossible, for the FCC to \n     review and then prohibit even clearly anti-competitive and \n     anti-consumer actions by broadband companies. Under the bill, \n     broadband providers could characterize any and every rule or \n     determination the FCC makes as a ``rate regulation'' if it \n     prevents these ISPs from charging abusive penalties or tolls.\n       Over four million Americans called for the FCC to protect \n     an open Internet. It is time for members of Congress to stop \n     sneak attacks that would allow big cable companies to break \n     net neutrality rules without consequences. We strongly \n     believe that the limited and inadequate exemptions in the \n     current bill are neither credible nor sufficient. These \n     limited exceptions for a small number of regulatory issues \n     are not enough, as they simply create opportunities for \n     companies to circumvent them.\n       Congress has made the FCC the guardian of the public \n     interest. The Commission must be able to protect America's \n     Internet users from unreasonable business practices.\n       It is unfortunate that the Energy & Commerce Committee \n     Majority twice rejected proposed compromises that would have \n     been harmonious with the FCC's decision not to set broadband \n     rates, while ensuring the Commission still had the ability to \n     protect consumers. Instead, this bill is little more than a \n     wolf in sheep's clothing that would reduce the FCC's \n     oversight abilities and strip away communications rights for \n     hundreds of millions of Americans.\n       We respectfully urge you to vote against this bill to show \n     your support for America's consumers and businesses that need \n     the free and open Internet.\n           Sincerely,\n       18MillionRising.org, Alternate ROOTS, Arts & Democracy, \n     Center for Media Justice (CMJ), Center for Rural Strategies, \n     Cogent Communications, Inc., Color Of Change, Common Cause, \n     Common Frequency, Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of \n     America, Consumer Watchdog, Daily Kos, Demand Progress, \n     Engine, Faithful Internet, Families for Freedom, Fight for \n     the Future, Free Press Action Fund, FREE!

Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Mr. Speaker and Madam Leader: Consumers Union, the \n     policy and advocacy division of Consumer Reports, urges the \n     House not to approve H.R. 2666, the ``No Rate Regulation of \n     Broadband Internet Access Act.'' We believe this legislation \n     is unnecessary, and we are concerned that it would undermine \n     the Federal Communications Commission's net neutrality rule \n     and other important responsibilities of the Commission in \n     protecting consumers and competition in the broadband \n     marketplace.\n       We share the concerns voiced during the bill's \n     consideration in Committee, that ``rate'' and ``rate \n     regulation'' could be interpreted to interfere on a broad \n     scale with the Commission's authority to prevent all manner \n     of discriminatory treatment simply because there is some \n     direct or indirect price-related manifestation or effect. \n     Indeed, the Committee states in its report that the term \n     ``rates'' should ``be interpreted broadly, extending beyond a \n     simple price to any provider-offered fee, rate level, rate \n     structure, discount, incentive, or similar customer-facing \n     proposal.'' We are concerned that, other than outright denial \n     of service or interconnection, anticompetitive discrimination \n     would most likely take the form of some kind of price \n     differential--including data caps, throttling, \n     anticompetitive subsidies, and paid prioritization, just to \n     name some of the most obvious.\n       Moreover, there is no indication that the Commission has \n     any intent to regulate rates for broadband service, now or in \n     the future, or that it has seriously entertained the \n     possibility of doing so. Indeed, the Open Internet Order \n     explicitly disclaims such intent. This bill is a flawed and \n     harmful solution to a non-existent and wholly theoretical \n     problem.\n       The Open Internet Order is key to ensuring that the \n     benefits of the Internet are widely available--that everyone \n     has access to it on equal, nondiscriminatory terms. We hope \n     the House will allow the Commission to appropriately enforce \n     the Open Internet Order, without injecting new and \n     unnecessary uncertainty into the scope of its authority. We \n     urge that H.R. 2666 be defeated.\n           Respectfully,\n\n                                             George P. Slover,\n\n                                            Senior Policy Counsel,\n     Consumers Union.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         Computer & Communications\n\n\n                                         Industry Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 14, 2016.\n     Re CCIA Letter on H.R. 2666--No Rate Regulation of Broadband \n         Internet Access Act.\n\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Minority Leader Pelosi: As you know, an open Internet \n     has been a driving force of economic growth, innovation, and \n     a key to American competitiveness. It is a crucial input for \n     businesses large and small, and an essential component of the \n     lives of everyday Americans for expression, education, and \n     work.\n       Unfortunately, H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of \n     Broadband Internet Access Act, threatens the FCC's ability to \n     enforce sensible rules to ensure the Internet remains \n     competitive and open. As you consider this legislation this \n     week, I hope you will take into account the negative \n     consequences this bill would have for consumers and \n     businesses that rely on Internet access.\n       Despite the bill's title, H.R. 2666 goes far beyond rate \n     regulation. A closer look will not just reveal the potential \n     for higher costs to consumers and businesses, but also \n     significant regulatory uncertainty. Of considerable concern \n     are the bill's intentionally broad definitions. For example, \n     the bill's definitions of ``regulation'' and ``regulate'' \n     include the Commission's enforcement authority. This would \n     prevent the Commission from pursuing its longstanding \n     Congressional mandates of promoting competition and consumer \n     protection. Without such authority, the FCC would not be able \n     to review and prohibit anti-competitive actions that could \n     hurt consumers and businesses.\n       During consideration by the Energy & Commerce Committee, \n     Democratic Members sought to find common ground with \n     amendments that would more clearly define what the bill seeks \n     to prevent--ratemaking for broadband. However, these efforts \n     were rejected on party-line votes. The bill's ambiguity \n     remains a significant concern for businesses and will impair \n     the FCC's obligation to ensure that basic rules of the road \n     will protect the openness that has made the Internet so \n     useful. I urge you to consider the effects on the open \n     Internet and vote against H.R. 2666.\n           Sincerely,\n     Ed Black,\n       President & CEO, Computer & Communications Industry \n     Association.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn). She is the vice chairman of the full Energy \nand Commerce Committee and a very important member of our subcommittee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the opportunity to come to \nthe floor today and stand in support of this bill. It is the right \nstep.\n  The gentlewoman from California references the amendment that she had \nwanted, but her amendment was not exactly what that bill is.\n\n[[Page H1744]]\n\n  What we are seeking to do is to encourage the FCC to make good on the \npromise that they have made. In March 2015, Chairman Wheeler was \nspeaking at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona.\n  He was talking about net neutrality and rules and regulations. He \nsaid:\n\n       This is not regulating the Internet. Regulating the \n     Internet is rate regulation, which we don't do.\n\n  Whoops, they do. That is what they are trying to do.\n  Now, there is a difference in what the gentlewoman was seeking to do \nin committee, not have tariffs or regulation. But if they had gone \nahead and done it, then we would have to get into a process of trying \nto undo. That is what people don't like. They don't like that kind of \nmess.\n  What they want is something very explicit. That is what Mr. \nKinzinger's bill does. It very explicitly says: FCC, you cannot, you \nshall not, and you will not do rate regulation. It is not what the \nAmerican people want to see. It is what the FCC has promised they will \nnot do.\n  So what we are doing is helping a federal agency keep their word, \nkeep their promise, and not get into rate regulation. Of course, we all \nknow that what they would like to do is regulate the Internet so they \ncan tax the Internet, so they can then come in and set all the rates, \nand so they can then come in and assign priority and value to content.\n  It is a commerce issue, it is a free speech issue, and it is an issue \nfor the American people who want to make certain that the information \nservice they have known, appreciated, and utilize every day in the \nvirtual marketplace is not going to be regulated by a Federal \nGovernment agency.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I would note that the FCC chairman is not a \nMember of Congress. It is only Congress that can write a statute. The \namendment that I offered codified--codified--that there would be no \nrate regulation of the Internet.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPallone), the distinguished ranking member of the full committee.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleague from \nCalifornia, the ranking member of our subcommittee.\n  Mr. Chairman, today we are considering a deceptively simple bill, \nH.R. 2666. The bill states that the FCC may not regulate rates for \nbroadband Internet access service, but I urge Members on both sides of \nthe aisle to not fall for this rhetoric and misinformation.\n  Just because this bill is short in length does not mean it is narrow \nin scope. It is designed to gut the FCC because, as experts have \npointed out, the definitions in the bill for rate regulation could mean \nalmost anything.\n  While the Republicans claim that they intend the bill to be narrow, \nwe have heard over and over that their draft would swallow vast \nsections of the Communications Act. Most notably, this bill could \nundermine the FCC's ability to protect consumers.\n  Democrats repeatedly offered help to improve this bill. But make no \nmistake, there was not a negotiation. We offered suggestions, but were \nrebuffed time and again. In fact, we raised concerns from the beginning \nthat the original bill failed to define rate regulation.\n  Then, at the eleventh hour, the Republicans provided their own take-\nit-or-leave-it definition with no Democratic input. This is not \nnegotiating.\n  The result of this one-sided conversation is the definition of rate \nregulation that simply confirms our worst fears. The definition is so \nbroad that it effectively would gut the agency.\n  Now, we have said repeatedly that we do not want the FCC to set \nrates. But we can't support a bill that undermines the FCC's core \nmission. We can't support a bill that prevents the agency from acting \nin the interest of the public.\n  We can't support a bill that prevents the agency from protecting \nconsumers from discriminatory practices, and we certainly cannot \nsupport a bill that undercuts the FCC's net neutrality rules. The \nRepublicans rebuffed all of our efforts to narrow H.R. 2666 so that \nconsumers are not harmed.\n  If we are at all serious about passing a narrow bill, then \naccomplishing these goals would not be that hard. Our collective \ninterests should be aligned. But that clearly is not the intent of my \nRepublican colleagues.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge Members to cast a vote against H.R. 2666.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each side \nhas remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The majority has 19 minutes remaining. The minority has \n22\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger). He is the author of this legislation and is a \nvery serious member of the Subcommittee on Communications and \nTechnology and a great patriot for this country.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank the committee, and I \nthank the other side of the aisle. Even though this is something that \nwe are going to put through and we would love to have a lot more \nsupport from the other side of the aisle, we do appreciate the working \nrelationship.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me just say that this is, in my mind, very simple. \nWhen the FCC, in essence, chose to reclassify broadband Internet access \nservice as a common carrier, that gave them the classification and the \nability to regulate rates of private companies.\n  Understanding this, it was the concern, as we looked around, that we \nwant to make sure that the FCC does not have the power to regulate the \nrates charged for Internet access.\n  If you look back in the history of this country and, really, what \ntechnology and what the Internet has been able to do for jobs, for \neconomic growth, and for everything along that line, it has all been \nbecause it is free of government regulation. So let's just put this \ninto law, that the FCC shouldn't have the authority.\n  In a couple of hearings, Chairman Wheeler, the chairman of the FCC, \nwas asked: Do you believe you should have the right or the ability to \nregulate the rates charged for Internet, for broadband access?\n  He said: No. I forbear that.\n  In fact, I asked the chairman: What if we put into law a simple \nstatement that said that the FCC shouldn't have that authority?\n  Amen, basically, is what he said.\n  Now, over the next year, we have run into some more issues. All of a \nsudden 3 weeks ago I asked the chairman the same question again, and he \nadmits that, actually, the FCC should have the ability to regulate \nbroadband Internet access.\n\n  This is Congress simply doing its job. Congress' job is to determine \nwhat authority the FCC should and should not have. That is what we were \ninvented for. That is what we were created for, to determine those laws \nand those rules.\n  All we are doing is taking back a little bit of power from the FCC \nand saying: Look, let's keep the Internet free market. Let's keep \nbroadband free market.\n  Congress is going to have its say in this. I hope the other side of \nthe aisle and my colleagues join me in supporting this measure.\n  It is the right thing for our country, and it is a great first step \nin preserving the Internet as free for future generations.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth). He is an outstanding member of \nthe committee.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I said on Wednesday during debate on the rule, the \nbill before us today is a vague solution in search of a nonexistent \nproblem.\n  While we all share concerns about the idea of broadband Internet rate \nregulation, Chairman Wheeler has made it absolutely clear that the FCC \nwill not seek to regulate those rates.\n  But since this bill is before the House anyway, I thought I would \noffer an amendment that would address an actual problem that can be \nfixed by the FCC.\n  Section 317 of the Communications Act of 1934 requires broadcasters \nto disclose the true identity of political advertising sponsors.\n  The FCC currently relies on an outdated 1979 staff interpretation of \nthe law that does not account for the dramatic changes that have taken \nplace in our campaign system over the last 6 years, including the \nCitizens United and McCutcheon decisions. The rule\n\n[[Page H1745]]\n\nmakes sense. The American people ought to know who is actually trying \nto influence their votes.\n  Unfortunately, sponsors in today's world don't indicate who is \nactually paying for the ad. No. We get sponsors like Americans for \nKittens and Puppies. That is not very helpful in disclosing to the \nAmerican people who is trying to influence them.\n  It would be, for instance, if somebody ran an ad promoting sugared \nsoft drinks and, instead of Coca-Cola or Pepsi being the actual people \npaying for the ad, you would have the advertising agency: This ad is \nsponsored by Ogilvy & Mather or McCann Erickson. That is not very \nhelpful to the American people.\n  So this has resulted in a major loophole in which special interests \nand wealthy donors can anonymously spend limitless amounts of money to \ninfluence the outcomes of our elections. That is not what Congress \nintended.\n  Despite having the authority to do so, the FCC has refused to take \naction to close this loophole. My amendment, by restating the original \nconstitutional intent, would have sent a message to the FCC that it is \ntime to act.\n  We all know how much secret money has flooded our politics, weakened \naccountability in government, and made it harder for voters to develop \na true opinion of the individuals they will send to Congress to \nrepresent them.\n  My amendment would have helped to change that and, hopefully, would \nhave begun to restore a minimum level of honesty in our electoral \nsystem.\n  The amendment was germane within the rules of this body, and the \nsolution it provided was well within the authority of the FCC.\n  Most importantly, an overwhelming majority of Americans--Republicans, \nDemocrats, and Independents--want us to do this. They want us to reform \nand fix our broken campaign finance system.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans on the Rules Committee voted against the \ninterests of a majority of Americans and blocked my amendment from \ncoming to the floor.\n  While they killed my amendment, I am glad the amendment offered by my \ncolleague, Mr. Lujan, will be up for consideration today.\n  It will give us a chance to debate the lack of disclosure and \ntransparency in campaign ads. Unlike the underlying bill, it offers a \nspecific solution to a real problem.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Lance), another terrific member of our Subcommittee on \nCommunications and Technology.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Chairman, as a member of the Communications and \nTechnology Subcommittee, I rise in strong support of Mr. Kinzinger's \nbill.\n  The Internet has dramatically changed the global economy and how \nevery one of us lives daily life. It is the great equalizer, providing \nan open platform to boost innovation and job creation, expand \nexpression and free speech, as much as any invention in history.\n  But some unelected officials here in Washington are eager to regulate \nit, and some in office across the country are eager to tax it. We must \nprevent both.\n  The prosperity and opportunity we have come to know from the Internet \nwill be compromised if Internet access becomes another victim of an \noverweening governmental agency.\n  The apps on your mobile phone and for your online accounts, your \nsocial sphere and your personal and professional information come not \nfrom the permission of unelected officials, but from the work of \ninnovators who have invented this 21st century technology.\n  They must remain empowered to continue their innovation. We cannot \nallow the government a foothold for Internet control.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support H.R. 2666.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nVermont (Mr. Welch), a wonderful and important member of the \nSubcommittee on Communications and Technology.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I thank my ranking member on the \nCommunications and Technology Subcommittee and the chair of the \nCommunications and Technology Subcommittee.\n  There are two questions here. First is net neutrality. One of the \nbiggest decisions that the FCC made was to protect net neutrality.\n  Before they issued their order, they had literally millions of \ncomments from people all across this country, in your district and in \nmine, urging that net neutrality be maintained and preserved. The \nchairman and the FCC did that with their order.\n  Now, that has raised some questions as to whether the assertion of \nFCC authority is going to result in micromanaging through regulation, \nand that would be a legitimate concern if it were a concern.\n  But the chairman has made it extremely clear that he has no intention \nwhatsoever of doing any kind of rate regulation under title II. He is \nnot going to do it. It hasn't been done.\n  So this bill, which is going to ``prohibit rate regulation'' has some \nsignificant and potentially very dangerous consequences for two things, \nnet neutrality and protection of consumers.\n  We need an FCC that is going to be there to protect consumers against \nsome potentially bad practices, like cramming or overbilling, things \nthat traditionally the FCC has done as the agency that is protecting \nconsumers against bad practices.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The reason why many experts believe that this bill would result in \nthat happening is because there is no definition of rate regulation. \nThere is none. The burden on legislators, when we propose something, is \nto be clear and specific as to what it is that is being proposed. There \nis no definition whatsoever in this bill about rate regulation. This \nbill is founded on an apprehension that something bad will happen, but \nit gives an undefined answer to prevent an undefined event from \nhappening. So the effect here is that you have a bill that is playing \non the fear of the unknown.\n  My preference would be for us to not pass this bill, not endanger the \nauthority of the FCC to take steps that help consumers in your district \nand in my district, and to focus where we should be focusing, in my \nview, on steps that we can take to improve broadband access in speeds, \nparticularly for rural areas, rural Vermonters. There is a common goal \nthat we have in our committee to try to get the broadband out and \ndeployed at higher speeds in all of our areas, particularly the rural \nareas that are in jeopardy.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would just like to point out for the Record that on page 4 of the \nbill, H.R. 2666, on line 7, there is a definition of broadband Internet \naccess service. We also have the definition of rate; we have the \ndefinition of regulation all spelled out in the bill. And very specific \nto the issue of cramming and illegal actions on truth-in-billing and \nall, those are also called for in the bill.\n  He may be looking at an old draft of the bill or something, but it is \nnot the legislation before us. We do define what rate regulation is. We \ndo make sure that the FCC continues to enforce subpart Y, part 64, \ntitle 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, relating to truth-in-\nbilling requirements. That is lines 18 through 20 of the bill. So those \nthings actually were addressed in the legislation that is now before \nthe House.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nShimkus).\n  (Mr. SHIMKUS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Chair, it actually was great to follow my colleague \nfrom Vermont, who is a thoughtful individual, who always raises good \nquestions, who really is open to debate, and he stumbles onto the truth \nin this.\n  This does have an issue of net neutrality. Our problem has always \nbeen, we now have a Federal agency imposing what there was no need or \ndesire, by many of us, to fix. So now we are trying to make sure that \nthis Federal agency doesn't kill the goose that laid the golden egg.\n  There is a fear. He was correct in also saying there was a fear.\n  So how do you ease that fear?\n  You enshrine into law the promises made by the administration and by \nthe Chairman of the FCC. You take away the fear. It is not like, well, \nmaybe this is what he said, but maybe he will do\n\n[[Page H1746]]\n\nthis. Just codify it. Then we know what the law is. Then everyone who \nbrings it into litigation can say, well, here is the black and white \nlaw. Of course, we also have trouble with the courts. We would hope \nthat the courts would read the black and white language of the law and \nthen rule that way.\n  All we are trying to do is trust, but verify. What we see is that the \nnet neutrality debate was a fix seeking a problem, which there was no \nproblem. No one can stand on our side today and say we have not \nadvanced greatly by this new technological age and that we need more \ngovernment to help cause it to flourish more.\n  We are afraid of a Federal agency. We are afraid that the FCC has \ngone too far. We need to enshrine this into law. Everybody knows the \nground rules. That is all my colleague, Mr. Kinzinger, is trying to do.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, may I get an update on the time remaining on \neach side?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 13 minutes remaining. The \ngentlewoman from California has 16\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who has an incredible \nbackground in rate regulation and the commission there and is a \nterrific member of our subcommittee.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chair, as the chairman said, I served nearly 10 years \nas a title II rate regulator on the North Dakota Public Service \nCommission, and I know what title II rate regulation looks like. The \nInternet is not an appropriate vehicle or medium for this type of \nregulation. The Internet is not a monopoly railroad, the Internet is \nnot a monopoly telephone company, it is not a monopoly electric or gas \nutility. The Internet is a dynamic, competitive innovator. Even the \nthreat of this type of regulation stifles that innovation, and we do \nnot want that to happen.\n  I want to address the amendment that was referred to by the ranking \nmember of the subcommittee, who I have great respect for. She referred \nto the term ``permanent forbearance.'' That is a contradiction in \nterms. Forbearance is, by definition, temporary. He who has the \nauthority to forebear has the authority to unforebear. That is exactly \nwhat her amendment did. That is why it was not adequate to this bill.\n  This legislation simply codifies that which the President of the \nUnited States and the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission \npromised: to not regulate rates. If they promised to do it, God bless \nthem. But we don't know that the next Chairman and the next President \nwill live up to that promise. This law ensures that that promise is \nkept by codifying it.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority leader of the \nUnited States House of Representatives.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, the biggest goal of the innovation initiative is to bring \ngovernment into the modern age, making the policies that come out of \nWashington reflect and adapt to the world today.\n  What has shaped our world more in the 21st century than the Internet?\n  Education, commerce, communication, information. Everything in our \nlives has changed because of the Internet.\n  How did the Internet become something so important, so useful, and so \nwidespread?\n  Government left it alone. It expanded to reach and help billions \nbecause bureaucrats weren't allowed to micromanage it.\n  I remember hearing this from AOL founder Steve Case. It was back in \n1985. He said only 3 percent of people were online for an average of \njust 1 hour a week. Today, the Internet has reached about 40 percent of \nthe world. That is an amazing growth.\n  Unfortunately, the freedom that led to this amazing success is at \nrisk. Right now, it is an open question whether the FCC can regulate \nInternet rates. Congress needs to clarify that it has no authority to \ndo so.\n  If the FCC were to regulate rates, it could harm every American \nacross the country that has a Wi-Fi connection by imposing artificial \nrestraints on their plans and service options, it would stop needed \ninvestment in expanding and improving the Internet, and it would block \ninnovation that we depend on to create better and faster Internet. \nRegulating rates means its bureaucrats think that they can manage the \nInternet better than the private sector, which has already brought fast \nand affordable connections to millions across the country.\n  I know the FCC and President Obama promised they wouldn't regulate \nbroadband Internet rates from their offices in Washington, and that is \na good thing. But that doesn't mean I am not concerned. I don't know \nabout you, Mr. Chair, but after 7 years of broken promises, I have a \nhard time trusting this administration will follow through.\n  So today we are voting to hold the administration to its word. They \npromised not to regulate rates. This legislation bars the FCC from \nregulating rates. It is as simple as that. I can't imagine why anyone \nwould object.\n  I want to thank Congressman Kinzinger for his work on this \nlegislation, holding the FCC and the Obama administration accountable.\n  The innovation initiative is all about giving the American people the \nfreedom to grow and prosper. With this, the Internet stays a little \nfreer, executive overreach is held back, and we leave space for the \npeople to innovate without the Federal Government trying to control it \nall.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Long), another distinguished member of our Subcommittee \non Communications and Technology.\n  Mr. LONG. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, you don't need a Ph.D. from MIT to understand what is \ngoing on here. Despite President Obama and Federal Communications \nCommission Chairman Wheeler's past promises not to regulate the retail \nrates of Internet service providers, the Chairman announced last week \nthat the FCC will start a new regulatory framework for the evolving \nbusiness data market, and told other House Energy and Commerce \nCommittee members and me last month that the FCC should have the \nauthority to regulate broadband rates.\n  Today, services provided over modern high-speed broadband facilities \nto customers are unregulated. It is a vibrant market where broadband \ncompanies compete vigorously for customers.\n  If the administration gets in their way, the FCC will reverse course, \nprice regulate business services, and create disincentives for further \ninvestment and deployment of high-speed fiber networks throughout the \nNation. These burdens would harm investments, stifle innovation, and \ncost tens of thousands of jobs.\n  Mr. Chair, our economy and American workers cannot afford this \nimpact. I urge my colleagues to join me and support this crucial bill.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chair, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), another member of the Republican leadership, \nwho is also a really important member of our committee and \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank Chairman Walden, and I want to thank my \ncolleague, Congressman Kinzinger, for his leadership on bringing this \nbill to the floor.\n  Mr. Chair, what we are trying to do here is to continue to allow the \ngreat innovation that we have seen from the technology industry. It has \nhappened not because government has sat there and regulated every \naspect of what they do. It is because government, frankly, hasn't \nfigured out how to regulate them because the industry moves so fast. I \nthink that has been a good thing.\n  It has shown that if you allow an industry to go out there and invest \nprivate money in creating great new technologies, great new products, \nand you look at the development and deployment of broadband, it is \nliterally changing people's lives for the good. It\n\n[[Page H1747]]\n\nhas allowed America to be such a great technological leader.\n  But then when you see the threat of the FCC setting rates, regulating \nbroadband, it will send a chilling effect that will not only kill that \ninvestment and slow down the ability and the growth that we have seen \nthat has been so revolutionary in this country, but it will kill jobs \nin this country.\n  We need to stop the threat of the FCC being able to set rates in a \nway that can slow down that growth. We have seen such tremendous growth \nin the technology industry by the government not being in this arena. \nWhat Congressman Kinzinger is doing with this bill protects taxpayers \nand protects the growth and innovation that we need in this country.\n  I urge adoption of the bill.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis), another great member of our committee.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2666, the No \nRate Regulation of Broadband Internet Access Act, which will prohibit \nthe FCC from regulating the rates charged for broadband Internet access \nservice.\n  This bill will help prevent further FCC overreach, save tens of \nthousands of jobs, keep rates affordable for consumers, and provide \ncertainty for the future of broadband regulation.\n  For the last year and a half, the FCC has insisted it would not \nregulate broadband Internet rates. That changed last month when \nChairman Wheeler reversed course and contradicted all previous \ntestimony on the FCC's intent to regulate rates.\n  Many of our local businesses and organizations would suffer from \nfurther FCC overreach. Many already suffer from the uncertainty and \nvague new legal standards that have been imposed by the FCC. Regulating \nrates before and even after they are issued would further infuse the \nworst government meddling into a market that should remain nimble and \ncompetitive.\n  I thank Congressman Kinzinger for his excellent and timely work on \nthis bill, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2666.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), a gentleman who cares deeply about this issue.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my support for H.R. 2666.\n  In 2015, the FCC reclassified Internet service providers as title II \ncommon carriers, giving themselves the ability to regulate Internet \nrates and user privacy. The administration has promised that this new \nagency power will not be used to regulate broadband rates; however, FCC \nChairman Tom Wheeler has admitted that the FCC should have the \nauthority to do so. This regulatory uncertainty is why this bill is \nneeded.\n  H.R. 2666 would prohibit the FCC from regulating rates charged for \nbroadband Internet access and would hold the administration to the \npromise it made to American consumers. Preventing government \ninterference with broadband retail rates would give smaller providers \ngreater confidence when making investments, particularly those that \nwould increase Internet access in rural and small communities.\n  I urge my colleagues to help prevent the government micromanagement \nof Internet access by supporting H.R. 2666.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Clarke), an important member of the committee.\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. I thank our ranking member, Ms. Eshoo, and \nthe chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation of \nBroadband Internet Access Act, which would prohibit the FCC from \nregulating rates for broadband Internet access.\n  I agree with the premise behind the bill. The Commission should not \nbe setting rates for broadband access. In fact, we have heard from FCC \nChairman Wheeler. He has stated several times that he does not intend \nto set rates.\n  Like millions of Americans who made their voices heard last year, I \nsupport a free and open Internet. I do not believe the FCC needs to get \ninto the business of regulating consumer broadband rates. H.R. 2666, \nhowever, is overbroad and far-reaching. The unintended consequences of \nthe bill before us would undermine important consumer protections and \nwould threaten a free and open Internet.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose the bill before us \ntoday.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The gentleman from Oregon \nhas 7 minutes remaining, and the gentlewoman from California has 15\\1/\n2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the chairman for his work on this important bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 2666, the No Rate Regulation \nof Broadband Internet Access Act.\n  The bill does just that--prohibits the Federal Communications \nCommission from unnecessarily regulating broadband rates. This \nlegislation ensures that not only the current Commission but future \nCommissions will not have the option to regulate broadband Internet \nrates, which will protect the free market, encourage competition, and \npromote jobs; and that is what we need to be all about.\n  Plain and simple, unelected Washington bureaucrats at the FCC have \nset out with another solution in search of a problem. By shifting the \nclassification of broadband Internet to be a title II common carrier, \nthe FCC is, simply, reclassifying broadband Internet to fall under \ntheir rulemaking purview.\n  This is nothing more than another power grab by the administration to \nregulate and control yet another industry. It is estimated that, if \nrules regulating broadband services are carried out, it could cost over \n43,000 jobs, and I think we can all agree that it is not time to gamble \nwith American jobs. When bureaucrats in Washington play the regulation \ngame, no one wins.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 2666, and I encourage my colleagues to \njoin me in support of this legislation.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time, and I \nam prepared to close.\n  I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this has been an interesting discussion on the floor \nthis morning. For people who are tuned in, I think that I want to stay \naway from Federal talk, telecommunications talk, governmentese.\n  What this debate is all about is the Internet. There is a clear \ndifference between how the Democrats view the Internet and how to \nprotect its openness and its accessibility, and that rests in net \nneutrality--not a very sexy term. What it means is that no ISP can get \nin the way of the consumer. All you have to do is look in your purse or \nin your pocket. What you take out and the content that you view and \nwhatever the Internet carries, no company can get in the way of that--\nto chop it up, to slow it down, to speed it up, to charge more.\n  Now, our Republican colleagues have fought mightily, and I salute \nthem with their mightily launched campaign in that they don't believe \nin that, and that is really what is underneath this. They talk about \nFederal bureaucracies. They don't like that. They talk about \nbureaucrats. They don't like them. They talk about the President. They \ndon't like him.\n  What is at the heart of all of this is that we believe in that open, \naccessible Internet. We do not believe that the executive branch--in \nthis case, the FCC--should be able to regulate broadband rates. We have \nsaid so. We have said so time and again.\n  The gentleman from North Dakota objected to my amendment. He said \nthat it was an oxymoron. Our amendment codified. No one else codified. \nWe offered codification in the law that not only this FCC Commission \nbut all future Commissions--all future Chairmen--could not exact rate \nregulation. I don't know what needs to be done in order to get to \n``yes'' around here, and it is curious to me that all of the speakers \non the other side never referenced what we put on the table--that there \nis agreement.\n  Really, this bill goes beyond that, and that is what we object to. \nThere is\n\n[[Page H1748]]\n\nnot one consumer organization in our country that supports what the \nmajority is doing. We stand with consumers. They need a cop on the \nbeat--we don't need the rate regulation of broadband by the FCC--just \nthe way other agencies are supposed to look after the best interests of \nthe American people. In fact, in the Communications Act, the public \ninterest is stated over 100 times. We believe in that. The majority has \ngone too far with this bill. It can hurt small businesses, and it will \nhurt consumers. That is where we draw the line.\n  Mr. Chairman, for all of these reasons, I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on H.R. 2666. It goes too far. We were willing to meet and join \nhands and have something sail through the House--and I think it would \nhave in the other body as well--and that is that there be no rate \nregulation of broadband Internet. I don't know. Maybe the majority was \nshocked that we agreed with their talking point. We are serious about \nit. We offered a solution to it that was rejected not once but twice. \nVery disappointing. For all of these reasons and with what my \ncolleagues stated on this side in the magnificent statements that they \nmade, I urge the House to reject this legislation because it goes well \nbeyond its stated intent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I do appreciate the comments by my friend, and I consider her a good \nfriend. We have worked together on a lot of issues successfully and \nhave found common ground time and time again. Then there are days like \ntoday when we just see things differently and, perhaps, read them \ndifferently. That is what democracy is, after all, all about: competing \nideas that come to an open marketplace where we can have an up-or-down \nvote by the people's Representatives.\n  Let me talk about a couple of things, Mr. Chair.\n  First of all, there is the issue of net neutrality, itself. As my \nfriend from California knows, I put together a draft bill in January of \n2015--nearly a year and a half ago now. That bill read: no blocking, no \npaid prioritization, no throttling, and it required transparency, which \nare the core principles of an open Internet order. My colleagues on \nthis side of the aisle are for all of those things. The door remains \nopen for Democrats to join us in sponsoring that legislation. We looked \nforward to that, hopefully, in going forward, but we couldn't reach \nagreement on those very clear positions.\n  My colleague said, Gee, they are for not having the Federal \nCommunications Commission regulate rates for broadband Internet access \nservice. I think that is an accurate description of what the \ngentlewoman said she was for. Let me go to page 3 of the bill and just, \nsimply, read from line 6, section 2: ``Regulation of broadband rates \nprohibited.'' Line 7: ``Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the \nFederal Communications Commission may not regulate the rates charged \nfor broadband Internet access service.'' That is what this bill does.\n  Now, here is where people may get a little confused because, on the \none hand, we say no tariffing. That means no setting of the rates ahead \nof time. We agree that that is a bad idea. You have heard that from \nboth sides of the aisle here. Yet, you see, the door that remains \ncracked open is the one they refuse to close; so the chilling winter \nair of regulatory overreach blows through that crack in the door \nbecause, if you don't close the ability of the agency to come in after \nthe fact and say ``what you did on your rates we no longer think is \ncorrect,'' then you have after-the-fact rate regulation, which is even \nmore uncertain than up-front tariffing, than an up-front setting of the \nrates. It is with this that we find ourselves in disagreement with my \nfriends across the aisle. You see, they are willing to say no tariffing \nin advance, but they are not willing to close the door that allows the \nchilly air that will freeze out innovation--a post-action regulation--\nfrom occurring.\n  Having been in small business for 20-plus years earlier in my life \nand in the radio business, I know what regulation is. I know how to \nfollow them. I know what a public file is. I actually kept them and did \nall of these things in our little radio station; but I cannot imagine \nif, after the fact, my regulator could come back and say: Do you know \nthose ads you sold to the local car dealer? Even though they were \nprinted on your rate card and they were publicly disclosed and all of \nthat, we think, maybe, that was a little too high.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  So you have to go back and you have to change things. There is no \ndefinition of how far back they could go. Could they go back 6 months? \nA year? 2 years? 10 years? I don't know.\n  See, I guess you get to the point that the Internet thrives today in \nan environment where it was never regulated. That is what really made \nit go off the charts, is the innovators in Silicon Valley and I daresay \nin my district, in Oregon, and elsewhere, all over the world literally. \nThere is no central-only point of innovation when it comes to the \nInternet and technology. It is global.\n  The economy has flourished globally and has done all that without \nthree Commissioners--or two Commissioners and one Chairman, three \npeople in America deciding what you can and can't do.\n  You have got to go: Mama, can I? Daddy, can I? Can I after the fact? \nIs it going to be okay? This is the new environment when you treat the \nInternet like an old, black, dial-up phone.\n  Fundamentally, that is what Chairman Wheeler decided to do with \npressure from the White House. They lost their independence as an \nagency when they went down this path to say that the Internet is now \nlike an old phone line. Or, as you heard the former member of the \nPublic Utility Commission from North Dakota, my friend, Mr. Cramer, who \nwas in the rate regulation business, say, the Internet, it is not \nappropriate to regulate it as an old common carrier, an old railroad \nsystem that is a monopoly because the Internet is not a monopoly. We \nwant innovation for consumers. We want the competition in the \nmarketplace that we know drives down prices.\n  When you have three people in America wanting to set the rates after \nthe fact, which is what would happen in the FCC with a partisan \nCommission, as it is constructed today, they get to make the call, not \nconsumers who say: you know, I kind of like that Binge On thing. That \nis new and innovative.\n  And the Chairman will say: Well, yeah. We let that go. We think that \nis okay. That is the point. The Chairman got to say: We think that is \nokay.\n  Prior to title II regulation, the chairman didn't have a say in that. \nThe marketplace did. The consumers could go: I don't like that, so I am \ngoing to that carrier. Some other carrier can say: I don't like what \nthey're doing, and I am going to offer you this.\n  Now all that is going to get second-guessed by a government that is \ntoo big and is too much in our lives, and that is only going to get \nmore regulatory in its scope and scheme.\n  Finally, let me just restate the argument raised earlier that somehow \nconsumers could be hurt by truth-in-billing fraud or paid \nprioritization. We specifically addressed those in the bill that came \nto the floor.\n  We listened to our colleagues. We listened to those who testified. We \nmade changes in the bill. We didn't do everything that everybody wanted \nbecause this is a compromise process.\n  It is a good piece of legislation that protects consumers, encourages \ninnovation, and does what our constituents want us to do: draw clear \nstatutory lines that agencies have to follow, not devolve all authority \nto them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge passage of H.R. 2666.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the amendment in the nature of a substitute \nrecommended by the Committee on Energy and Commerce, printed in the \nbill, shall be considered as an original bill for the purpose of \namendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be considered read.\n  The text of the committee amendment in the nature of a substitute is \nas follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2666\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Rate Regulation of \n     Broadband Internet Access Act''.\n\n[[Page H1749]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 2. REGULATION OF BROADBAND RATES PROHIBITED.\n\n       Notwithstanding any other provision of law, the Federal \n     Communications Commission may not regulate the rates charged \n     for broadband Internet access service.\n\n     SEC. 3.

No amendment to the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute shall be in order except those printed in House \nReport 114-490. Each such amendment may be offered only in the order \nprinted in the report, by a Member designated in the report, shall be \nconsidered read, shall be debatable for the time specified in the \nreport equally divided and controlled by the proponent and an opponent, \nshall not be subject to amendment, and shall not be subject to a demand \nfor division of the question.\n  The Chair understands that amendment No. 1 will not be offered.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Yarmuth\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-490.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, as the designee of the gentleman from New \nMexico (Mr. Ben Ray Lujan), I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 20, strike ``; or'' and insert a semicolon.\n       Page 3, line 22, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       Page 3, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (4) promulgate regulations that require a television \n     broadcast station, AM or FM radio broadcast station, cable \n     operator, direct broadcast satellite service provider, or \n     satellite digital audio radio service provider, to the extent \n     such station, operator, or provider is required to make \n     material in its public inspection file available on, or \n     upload such material to, an Internet website, to make such \n     material available or upload such material in a format that \n     is machine-readable, such that the format supports the \n     automated searching for particular text within and among \n     documents, the bulk downloading of data contained in such \n     material, the aggregation, manipulation, sorting, and \n     analysis of the data contained in such material, and such \n     other functionality as the Commission considers appropriate.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 672, the gentleman \nfrom Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nmake it easier for the American people to figure out who is trying to \ninfluence their vote through campaign ads.\n  Right now, when someone is placing a political commercial on the air, \nthe TV station is required to upload to the FCC public site information \nthat identifies the name of the ad's sponsor, the duration of the ad, \nand the cost of the ad. But the FCC's site is cumbersome, slow, and \nimpossible to search, which defeats the purpose of this requirement.\n  This amendment clarifies that nothing in the underlying bill will \nprevent the FCC from requiring those entities that must submit a public \ninspection file to do so in a machine-readable format, which would \nguarantee that it is easily sortable, searchable, and downloadable.\n  Adopting the Lujan amendment will send a message to the FCC that \nthere is strong congressional support for making this information more \naccessible so that the American people have at least a chance to figure \nout who is trying to influence our elections.\n  Furthermore, this amendment would fix a real-world problem, unlike \nthe underlying bill, which is a vague solution in search of a \nnonexistent problem.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, this amendment states that nothing in the \nbill shall affect the FCC's authority to require that TV and radio \nstations and video and audio satellite providers make their public \ninspection files available online or in a machine-readable format.\n  Mr. Chairman, I was in the radio business for 21 years. I would guess \nI am probably one of the few, if only, people who have actually had to \nmaintain a public file.\n  I don't know if the gentleman knows all the things that are in those \npublic files. I would be happy to go through the very long list of \nthem.\n  I don't think the way the amendment is constructed is perhaps what he \nis seeking. I understand the part about public disclosure of time \npurchase, who is purchasing it, and all of that.\n  But the public file includes all FCC authorizations, applications and \nrelated materials, contour maps, ownership reports and related \nmaterials, portions of Equal Employment Opportunity file, the public \nand broadcasting manual itself, children's television programming \nreports, DTV transition education reports, citizen agreements, then the \npolitical file, letters and emails from the public, material relating \nto FCC investigations and complaints, issues/program lists, donor lists \nfor noncommercials educational channels, records concerning children's \nprogramming commercial limits, local public notice certifications and \nannouncements, time brokerage agreements, must-carry or retransmission \nconsents elections, joint sales agreements, and it goes on and on.\n  Ours was a full drawer. We were just a little AM and FM radio \nstation, and it was a full drawer in a filing cabinet.\n  By the way, if you didn't have each file in the proper order, you \ncould be fined. You had to have the political catechism in there. You \nhad to have all these things.\n  I understand what the gentleman is going for, and I am for \ndisclosure. We had to do it. We did it. People came and looked at the \nfile. It was all open and transparent, and now it does have to be \nonline already.\n  I just think this is an inappropriate place to go down this other \npath, when we are dealing with rate regulation of the Internet. I \nrealize the gentleman cares passionately about the political disclosure \nissue, but I would just argue, Mr. Chair, that this is the wrong place.\n  I think the amendment is clumsily worded in terms of the scope and \nmagnitude that would occur in terms of making all this machine-\nreadable. Because I am thinking about a little AM radio station out \nthere that is barely keeping the doors open, and we are going to tell \nthem they have got to have their contour maps machine-readable? I don't \neven know how to do that. I know some programs like Adobe you can \nclick, and some you can't. I don't know. It is a pretty big new \nrequirement on these stations.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Clarke).\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support the \nLujan, Pallone, Yarmuth, and Clarke amendment.\n  This commonsense amendment would ensure that the FCC can easily \ndetermine who is paying for political ads. More specifically, this \namendment would guarantee that nothing in this bill would prevent the \nFCC from requiring that TV broadcast stations, AM and FM radio \nbroadcast stations, cable operators, direct broadcast satellite service \nproviders, or satellite digital audio radio service providers\n\n[[Page H1750]]\n\nupload the public inspection file in the format that is machine-\nreadable.\n  Unfortunately, there is a large amount of unlimited money moving \nthrough our electoral system. This amendment gives all voters the peace \nof mind of knowing our elections are fair and transparent.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, in response to Chairman Walden--and I know that he shares my \ninterest in creating effective disclosure of campaign contributions and \nads--this amendment does not mandate any particular form of machine-\nreadable information. It only says that the Commission is not \nprohibited from requiring that certain parts of information are \nreadable in machine format.\n  I want to read a few quotes on disclosure:\n  ``Disclosure requirements deter actual corruption and avoid the \nappearance of corruption by exposing large contributions and \nexpenditures to the light of publicity.''\n  ``With modern technology, disclosure now offers a particularly \neffective means of arming the voting public with information.''\n  ``Today, given the Internet, disclosure offers much more robust \nprotections against corruption.''\n  ``Because massive quantities of information can be accessed at the \nclick of a mouse, disclosure is effective to a degree not possible at \nthe time Buckley, or even McConnell, was decided.''\n  All of the quotes are from the majority opinion in McCutcheon v. \nFederal Election Commission, written by Chief Justice Roberts.\n  Now, I don't agree with the decision, but I sure do agree with his \nposition that disclosure is critical to the integrity of our electoral \nsystem in the wake of this decision.\n  I believe that adopting the commonsense Lujan amendment shows that \nCongress values transparency in government and will help restore a \nlevel of trust with the public.\n  I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I rise for my closing statement to oppose \nthe gentleman's amendment.\n  Again, I think it is overly broad. Beyond that, the gentleman from \nKentucky kind of hit it on the head when he said that this doesn't \nrequire the FCC to do anything in terms of the machine-readable \ntechnology and all. Because, in theory, in reality, the way it is \nwritten, it basically says: nothing in this bill prevents them from \ndoing something, by the way, which they can already do.\n  The whole point, though, is this has nothing to do with the issue at \nhand in the legislation. Our constituents really believe we should take \none issue at a time.\n  The issue here is about controlling a bureaucracy from doing \nsomething it has never had the power to do before: giving clarity in \nthe marketplace, that they cannot regulate the rates of Internet \nservice providers, which, in effect, has the ability of regulating \ninnovation in new offerings for consumers.\n  So I must oppose this amendment and ask my colleagues to do the same.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Yarmuth).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. McNerney\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-490.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 20, strike ``; or'' and insert a semicolon.\n       Page 3, line 22, strike the period and insert ``; or''.\n       Page 3, after line 22, insert the following:\n       (4) act in the public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 672, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. McNerney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. \n2666. This amendment would help to rein in some of the unintended \nconsequences of the bill by preserving the FCC's authority to act in \nthe public interest, convenience, and necessity.\n  The public interest is a key principle that the Commission has used \nto protect consumers since Congress first created the agency in 1934, \nand it is just as important today.\n  The FCC has consistently looked to the public interest standard when \ntaking action to protect consumers, foster innovation, and increase \ncompetition.\n  The standard has been a hallmark of many of the most important \npolicies of the Commission. To give you a sense, the words ``public \ninterest'' appear over 100 times in the Communications Act. That is 100 \ntimes. That is how pervasive it is.\n  Even with the amended version of the bill that was reported out of \ncommittee, serious concerns remain that the bill is going to have far-\nreaching and unintended consequences.\n  For example, it could be that the Commission would no longer be able \nto investigate data caps, pay for privacy practices.\n  The Commission could also lose further protections for various types \nof unfair and discriminatory practices that affect how much they pay \nfor broadband.\n  My amendment would seek to limit some of those unintended \nconsequences by ensuring that the Commission continues to have the \nauthority that has historically served it so well.\n  Moreover, by preserving the FCC's authority to act in the public \ninterest, my amendment would safeguard the broad aims that the \nCommunication Act embodies.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  This amendment would continue to appropriately focus the FCC toward \npromoting the public good. I urge my Members to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I must rise in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, this one is a little more insidious than \nthe last one because what it does is precisely what the gentleman says \nit does. It says, ``Nothing in this act can affect the FCC's authority \nto act in the public interest, convenience, or necessity.''\n  And he is right. That term of art is all over communications law. Let \nme make that clear: all over communications--it is so broad, you can \ndrive a rate-regulated truck back through it, a de facto after-the-fact \nregulation. And that is the point.\n  When you give the bureaucracy wide-open language that says ``in the \npublic interest,'' it sounds good on its face, but the practical impact \nfor someone who wants to regulate, it is on their own authority, they \ngo, well, we think that rate is in the public interest to bring down \nafter the fact.\n  See, then what we have done is empower others unelected to make \ndecisions based on a term of art which, while it may be pervasive, is \nalso wide open. That is what we are trying to avoid here, Mr. Chairman.\n  See, the FCC could say, we are not going to rate regulate unless we \nwant to rate regulate because we will determine on our own whether it \nis in the public interest to do so.\n  All that sounds good, ``public interest'' sounds good, and it is good \nand it is an important part of our law, but in this case, remember \nwhere we start. Until Chairman Wheeler was directed, in effect, by the \nWhite House to treat the Internet like an old utility, none of this was \nregulated. That is the vibrant Internet we have today, and that is what \nRepublicans are trying to preserve, an open Internet.\n  We are all with you on blocking and throttling and pay prioritization \nand those issues. I have got draft legislation to legally say no to all \nof that.\n\n[[Page H1751]]\n\nBut when it comes to suffocating innovation in the marketplace and new \nofferings to consumers and really the vibrant competition that has been \nout here to this point, we have to draw a line with our friends.\n  They say you don't want to tariff in advance, and we are with them on \nthat, but the worst thing--the worst thing--when you are in business is \nthe uncertainty of after-the-fact decisionmaking by your regulator--\nafter-the-fact decisionmaking by your regulator. Unfortunately, Mr. \nMcNerney's proposal here, his amendment would allow that door to remain \nopen, allow the agency to have this unfettered authority.\n  Now, we have got provisions throughout the bill and in other law, \nboth at State and Federal level, to protect consumers against fraud and \nto protect consumers on truth-in-billing. All those things are there. \nThose protections remain.\n  Our sole purpose here and why we have been very narrow and specific \nand clear in our legislation is rate regulation is not something the \nFCC should take on. Consumers should have that power and authority, and \npeople who want to innovate against the giant companies out there \nshould be able to enter that marketplace with creative new packages \nthat allow consumers to make choices and not have to go to Washington, \nD.C., and seek privilege and an audience with the chairman to find out \nif what they are proposing might be okay after the fact if they do it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have to rise in opposition to Mr. McNerney's \namendment. He is a good member of the committee. I like working with \nhim, but in this case, the amendment is horribly flawed and would do \ngrave damage to the marketplace.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate--or I sort of \nappreciate the chairman's comments, and I do appreciate the idea of \nbroadness here; but if you look at what the actual bill says, ``may not \nregulate rates charged for broadband Internet services,'' that is the \ndefinition of broad. You can't get any broader than that. So we want to \nrein that in a little bit.\n  We don't want unintended consequences out here, but let me say what \nmy amendment says. ``Act in the public interest, convenience, and \nnecessity.''\n  Would the chairman like it if I took out ``convenience''? Should I \njust say ``act in the public interest and necessity''? Would that be \ngood enough, Mr. Chairman?\n  Mr. WALDEN. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. McNERNEY. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. What I think would be really good is you withdraw your \namendment and vote for the underlying bill that is really clear in its \nscope and faith and is a really good legislative product.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Well, again, I appreciate the chairman's and Mr. \nKinzinger's work on this, and I appreciate working with the chairman on \nthis, but I am going to have to insist that we look at this amendment \nand take it seriously. I do want to protect the public interest. That \nis really what this comes down to.\n  Again, the term shows up 100 times in the act, so let's not turn our \nback on the intent of the act. Let's move forward in a way that \nprotects the public interest.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would again urge opposition to the \namendment of the gentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time as well.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McNerney).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill now resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-490 on \nwhich further proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 2 by Mr. Yarmuth of Kentucky.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. McNerney of California.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Yarmuth\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Kentucky \n(Mr. Yarmuth) on which further proceedings were postponed and on which \nthe noes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The question is on the committee amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHultgren) having assumed the chair, Mr. Graves of Louisiana, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 2666) to prohibit the Federal Communications Commission from \nregulating the rates charged for broadband Internet access service, \nand, pursuant to House Resolution 672, he reported the bill back to the \nHouse with an amendment adopted in the Committee of the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  The question is on the committee amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. YARMUTH. I am in its current form.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order on the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will report the motion to recommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Yarmuth moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2666 to the \n     Committee on Energy Commerce with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n\n       Add at the end the following:\n       Sec. __  Upon enactment of this Act it shall be in order to \n     consider in the House of Representatives the concurrent \n     resolution (H. Con. Res. 125) establishing the congressional \n     budget for the United States Government for fiscal year 2017 \n     and setting forth the appropriate budgetary levels for fiscal \n     years 2018 through 2026. All points of order against \n     consideration of the concurrent resolution are waived. The \n     concurrent resolution shall be considered as read. All points \n     of order against provisions in the concurrent resolution are \n     waived. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the concurrent resolution and on any amendment thereto to \n     adoption without intervening motion except: (1) one hour of \n     debate equally divided and controlled by the chair and \n     ranking minority member of the Committee on the Budget; and \n     (2) one motion to recommit.\n\n  Mr. WALDEN (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading of the motion to recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Oregon?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Kentucky is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, today, April 15, is the deadline for Congress \nto enact a budget resolution; but here we are, set to leave town \nwithout taking any action.\n  To their credit, Republicans did write a budget and it was approved \nby their members of the Budget Committee. So why, after months of \npromises of a return to regular order, would Speaker Ryan refuse to \nallow a floor vote on the Republican budget, the budget of his own \nparty, the party he leads?\n  Our obligation here in Congress is to control the purse strings of \nthe country. So why would a former Budget Committee chair not want a \nvote on his party's budget, unless he didn't want people to know what \nis inside of it.\n  I don't blame him. Our Democratic budget invests in education, \ninfrastructure, medical research, job training, job creation, American \npriorities that improve our communities today and increase revenue in \nthe future. It is why they are called investments. In contrast, the \nRepublicans took the European austerity approach: eviscerating each of \nthose investments and taking health coverage away from 20 million \nAmericans, ending Medicare as we know it, and jeopardizing the \nretirement of millions of Americans. It also makes us less competitive, \nand encourages companies to ship jobs overseas.\n  Nobody knows the backlash from this rebuke of American values better \nthan Speaker Ryan, because the budget he wrote 4 years ago, when he was \nrunning for Vice President, had to be disavowed by his Presidential \ncandidate running mate, Mitt Romney. It was so abhorrent to the \nAmerican people that even his own running mate couldn't support it.\n  So I get it, Mr. Speaker. I like your budget even less than you do. \nBut you have it, and the people deserve to know what is in it and where \ntheir Representatives stand on it.\n  You know, earlier this week, Speaker Ryan gave a speech explaining \nwhy he wasn't going to be a candidate for President, and he said one of \nthe reasons was we have too much work to do here in Congress.\n  Well, he sure is right. So why are we here, and why were we here \nyesterday and the day before working on bills that have no consequence \nto the American people when we should be doing the most important \nbusiness we can, and that is to decide how much money we are going to \nspend and where for the American people.\n  This motion to recommit is simple. It says, upon the bill's passage, \nwe will bring the Republican budget to the floor.\n  So don't hide behind procedural roadblocks to block debate. If you \nbelieve in your budget, make the case before the cameras and the \nAmerican people. Let them see the contrast in our parties' values so \nthey can decide for themselves.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I raise a point of order against the motion \nbecause the instruction contains matter in the jurisdiction of a \ncommittee to which the bill was not referred, thus violating clause 7 \nof rule XVI, which requires the amendment to be germane to the measure \nbeing amended.\n  Committee jurisdiction is a central test of germaneness, and I am \nafraid I must insist on my point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on \nthe point of order?\n  If not, the Chair is prepared to rule.\n  The gentleman from Oregon makes a point of order that the \ninstructions proposed in the motion to recommit offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky are not germane.\n  Clause 7 of rule XVI--the germaneness rule--provides that no \nproposition on a subject different from that under consideration shall \nbe admitted under color of amendment.\n  One of the central tenets of the germaneness rule is that an \namendment may not introduce matter within the jurisdiction of a \ncommittee not represented in the pending measure.\n  The bill, H.R. 2666, as amended, addresses rates for broadband \nInternet access service, which is a matter within the jurisdiction of \nthe Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  The instructions in the motion to recommit propose an amendment \nconsisting of a special order of business of the House, which is a \nmatter within the jurisdiction of the Committee on Rules.\n  As the Chair ruled in similar proceedings yesterday, the instructions \nin the motion to recommit are not germane because they are not within \nthe jurisdiction of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Accordingly, the motion to recommit is not germane. The point of \norder is sustained, and the motion is not in order.\n  The question is on the passage of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, \nnoes 173, not voting 19, as follows:\n\n[[Page

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy) for the purpose of inquiring of the majority leader about the \nschedule for the week to come.\n  (Mr. McCARTHY asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the House will meet at noon for morning hour \nand 2 p.m. for legislative business. Votes will be postponed until \n6:30.\n  On Tuesday and Wednesday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for morning \nhour and at noon for legislative business.\n  On Thursday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nNo votes are expected in the House on Friday.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, since next Monday is Tax Day, the House will also \nconsider four commonsense bills aimed at protecting all taxpayers.\n  First will be H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, \nsponsored by Representative David Rouzer, and will ensure that IRS \nemployees--the very people who are responsible for collecting taxes \nfrom every American--pay their own taxes.\n  H.R. 4885, the IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act, \nsponsored by Representative Jason Smith, will require fees collected by \nthe IRS to be subject to congressional appropriations so that there is \nproper oversight into how the taxpayer money is spent.\n  H.R. 3724, the Ensuring Integrity in the IRS Workforce Act, sponsored \nby Representative Kristi Noem, will prohibit the IRS from rehiring \nsomeone who has been fired for cause.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4890, the IRS Bonuses Tied to Measurable \nMetrics Act, sponsored by Representative Pat Meehan, will ban IRS \nbonuses until they can demonstrate improved customer service. It just \ndoesn't get any more common sense than that.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for that information. I \nwant to ask him just one question on one of those commonsense bills \nthat seeks to remove those employees who work for the IRS who collect \ntaxes, that if they are delinquent, they will be removed.\n  Does that apply to the Congress of the United States as well which \nlevies those taxes, that if we have any Members who are delinquent, \nthat they, too, would be removed?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  The bill solely deals with the IRS, but he can always offer an \namendment.\n\n[[Page H1755]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. HOYER. I may do that.\n  First of all, let me thank the gentleman. We are confronting a \ncrisis, as the gentleman so well knows, in Puerto Rico. On May 1, they \nwill be unable to pay their debts.\n  I want to thank the majority leader who has been leading to reach a \nbipartisan solution. Unfortunately, as the majority leader and I both \nknow, there was a failure in committee this week to move the bill \nforward. But I want to reiterate my appreciation to the gentleman from \nCalifornia, the majority leader, for his efforts to make sure that we \ndo, in fact, address this issue before May 1. I want to thank him for \nthat.\n  It is critical that we do so, it is critical that we do so in a \nbipartisan fashion, and it is critical to have a bill that both sides \ncan support. I have told the majority leader, and I reiterate, we hope \nthat on both restructuring and the composition and the authority of a \nboard of review, an oversight board, that we can come to an agreement \nso that we can have such a vote and have it in the near future.\n  Secondly, can the majority leader tell me where we are? I know the \nbudget has been reported out of committee. The gentleman talks about \nTax Day. Obviously, we are now at the point when a budget was expected \nto be brought to the floor. Can the majority leader tell me where we \nstand on the budget process and the budget coming to the floor of the \nHouse of Representatives?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I will first touch on Puerto Rico. I thank the gentleman for his work \non that. Let me start by saying that any proposal that the House \nconsiders cannot be a bailout of Puerto Rico.\n  I know the committee had a markup and they postponed the vote on it \nsimply because Treasury was still negotiating. We had heard from those \non your side of the aisle that they did not want to pursue or continue \nuntil Treasury was done negotiating. So we look forward to continue \nsolving this problem in a bipartisan manner.\n  I also understand the gentleman asking about the budget. I do believe \nthe budget process is an important one, and we are continuing to work \nthrough it. It is out of the committee, and I look forward to getting \nit onto the floor.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Let me mention two other items briefly because I know the gentleman \nhas a time constraint. Zika and Ebola continue to be challenges to the \nhealth of Americans and, indeed, the health of the international \ncommunity as well.\n  Obviously, we previously committed a significant sum of money to meet \nthe Ebola crisis, which still remains with us. It is not on the front \nburner as it was for a period of time, but it is, nevertheless, as the \ngentleman knows, a very significant and serious one.\n  In addition, of course, we have the crisis that Zika poses to the \nhealth and welfare not only of women who either are or may become \npregnant, but also to others as well.\n  Can the gentleman tell me where the funding--as the gentleman knows, \nthe administration transferred some funds out of the money that was \ndedicated to Ebola. And I want to thank the gentleman for having a \nhearing, which he invited me. We joined in having that hearing, and we \nhad Secretary Burwell of HHS, Tony Fauci of NIH, and Dr. Frieden of \nCDC--a very important hearing. They have transferred some money.\n  Does the gentleman have any information as to when we might move \nforward, both on backfilling the money that has been taken from Ebola \nand responding to the administration's request for funding for response \nto Zika?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding. I do \nthink the gentleman's work is bipartisan on our challenge with Zika and \nas we continue to move forward with it.\n  First, I am very happy to see that the administration did take our \nadvice last week and began using the unused Ebola funding in our \nefforts to combat Zika. I know that was more than half a billion \ndollars. That money is going to go a long way to containing the \ndisease. I had met with the chairman of Appropriations just today. They \nare continuing to look and monitor. We believe this money will take us \nthroughout the rest of this fiscal year, but we will look and monitor \nwhere we need it and what we need to move forward.\n  As the gentleman knows, every day we continue to learn more about \nZika. We are committed on this side, and I know on your side as well, \nto make sure that we eradicate this problem from ever furthering in \nAmerica.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I look forward to \nworking with him on both--continuing to focus on Ebola, while at the \nsame time we focus on the immediate threat of Zika.\n  The last comment I would make, Mr. Speaker, is that Members ought to \nbe disabused of the concept--and I have heard it, as well as the \ngentleman has heard it--that the legislation under consideration for \nPuerto Rico is a bailout. There is no money going to Puerto Rico. There \nis no guarantee of any of their indebtedness going from the United \nStates to Puerto Rico.\n  This is simply whether or not we can construct a mechanism so that \nthey can restructure their debt, which may prolong the period of time \nin which the debt is paid off. It may reduce by some amount the debt \nthat is repaid. But as the gentleman knows--and he is shaking his head \nin agreement--we are not contemplating nor are we moving forward on a \nbailout for Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1755-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1755]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, APRIL 15, 2016, TO MONDAY, APRIL 18, 2016\n\n  Mr. GRIFFITH.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of Tom Bowers. Tom \nis a Commonwealth attorney for the city of Salem, Virginia, who today, \nin a formal award ceremony at Federal Bureau of Investigation \nheadquarters, is receiving the Richmond FBI's 2015 Director's Community \nLeadership Award for his efforts to organize a Heroin Prevention \nInitiative in the Roanoke, Virginia, area.\n  Regrettably, the growing epidemic of heroin use is a plague on \ncommunities throughout the United States. Addressing this nationwide \nproblem will require expanded coordination and involvement by local, \nState, and Federal governments, as well as law enforcement agencies and \nhealthcare professionals.\n  I applaud Commonwealth Attorney Bowers and those working for him on \nthe Heroin Prevention Initiative for their efforts to combat the heroin \nepidemic by bringing awareness to the pervasiveness of prescription \ndrug and heroin use among youth in our area and helping to alleviate \nthe damage to our community.\n  Others involved in this important work in this initiative include the \nRoanoke Area Youth Substance Abuse Coalition, the Prevention Council of \nRoanoke County, the Virginia State Police, the City of Roanoke Police \nDepartment, the Vinton Police Department, and the Roanoke County Police \nDepartment.\n  I also would note, of course, that Tom Bowers represents the city of \nSalem, and the city of Salem folks are involved as well.\n  Congratulations to Commonwealth Attorney Bowers on being presented \nthe Richmond FBI's 2015 Director's Community Leadership Award.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1755-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1755-H1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VICTIMS OF GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to urge the Senate to quickly \nact on House-passed VA accountability legislation.\n  According to recent VA Inspector General reports, wait time \nmanipulation occurred at 40 VA facilities in 19 States. Yet, almost no \none has seriously been held accountable for these failures.\n  This isn't even including the most egregious example of failures, \nlike the VA employee who was convicted of charges related to armed \nrobbery and still couldn't be fired.\n  The House has passed legislation to get at the root of this problem, \nand it is past time the Senate acts.\n  H.R. 1994, the VA Accountability Act, contains my legislation that \nforces VA employees to solve problems for veterans. If they can't, then \nthe VA needs to make room for someone who can. Our veterans are too \nimportant to us, and they are counting on Congress to deliver them the \ncare they need and deserve.\n  We have to send the VA accountability legislation to the President's \ndesk now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1756-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING JUDGE FREDERICK P.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nJudge Frederick P.

He was born and raised in Fullerton, \nCalifornia, and he is the grandson of Mexican immigrants.\n  Judge Aguirre graduated from the University of Southern California \nwith a degree in history, and he earned his law degree at UCLA. His \ncareer in public advocacy began when he attended the League of United \nLatin American Citizens, or LULAC. He began to attend the meetings, and \nby the time he was a senior in high school, he was the president-elect \nof the local chapter.\n  He is the cofounder of the Hispanic Association of Lawyers in Orange \nCounty; the Hispanic Advisory Council for Court Appointed Special \nAdvocates, or CASA as we know it; the founder and the vice president of \nthe Leadership Academy of the Superior Court; and the president of \nLatino Advocates for Education.\n  I know him best because he honors our veterans every year in a very \nlarge ceremony, calling out their service in the different wars.\n  I am honored to recognize Judge Frederick Aguirre for his outstanding \nachievements within the Latino community, the Orange County community, \namongst our veterans, and for all citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1756-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1145\n                    OBAMACARE FOR FINANCIAL PLANNING\n\n  (Mr. LaHOOD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, last Wednesday, the Department of Labor \nfinalized its fiduciary rule--or, as we could call it: ObamaCare for \nfinancial planning. This rule reclassifies and expands the scope of \nindividuals who are considered ``financial advisers'' and adds the \nDepartment of Labor as a new regulator.\n  The investment advisory industry is already among the most regulated, \nbut this rule will force a sweeping overhaul of the financial services \nindustry. Most importantly, it will hurt middle class Americans.\n  This new rule change, which circumvents the Congress and the \nConstitution, will significantly raise legal and compliance costs, \nmaking it expensive, difficult, and impractical for companies like \nState Farm, which is headquartered in my congressional district, and \ntheir advising agents to continue to provide services to small \nbusinesses and hardworking customers.\n  Ultimately, this rule will drastically narrow the access that these \nfamilies, who are trying to save for retirement, will have by making \nfinancial advice more expensive. It will even penalize small businesses \nthat want to provide benefits for their employees, thereby discouraging \nsmall businesses from providing 401(k) plans.\n  I am committed to fighting the implementation of this rule, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1756-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             EQUAL PAY DAY\n\n  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, this week, we marked Equal Pay \nDay, which is the day more than 3 months into the year when women's \nearnings finally catch up to men's from the previous year.\n  Mr. Speaker, it all adds up--$430,000. That is how much the average \nincome loss is for a woman throughout her career as a result of this \nunfair wage gap. This means our mothers and our grandmothers get less \nfor their retirement security, and there are more of them in poverty.\n  Inequality hurts the heart and it hurts the pocketbook. It hurts \nwomen and their families. That is why we need paycheck fairness, \naffordable child care, paid family leave, and retirement security.\n  When women succeed, America succeeds.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1756-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1756]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORTING THE LGBTQ COMMUNITY\n\n  (Mr. FARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise for the 14th consecutive year in order \nto speak out on behalf of the LGBTQ youth community. It is unacceptable \nthat, in 2016, young people are still experiencing discrimination \nacross this country based on their sexual orientation or gender \nidentity.\n  Kaleb Lennon, a young transgender student in my district, sees this \nday as a chance to combat the bullying, the slurs, and the put-downs \nthat these children face on a daily basis. I am proud to lend my voice \nto Kaleb's cause. It is our duty to speak out against the bigotry and \nhatred facing this community. We must celebrate the diversity in this \ncountry and reject all forms of discrimination.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is my last year to take the floor and support these \nyoung people. I ask that, next year, my colleagues stand where I am and \nlend their voices to the support of the LGBTQ community.\n  Today, as youth across the country take a vow of silence to protest \nthe silent response they see to bigotry, I ask one last time that you \nremember that, while you are silent, we here in Congress should not be.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1756-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1756-H1757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 STEERING AND POLICY HEARING ON POVERTY\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight yesterday's Democratic \nSteering and Policy Committee hearing on the ``Failure of Trickle-Down \nEconomics in the War on Poverty.'' The hearing highlighted the daily \nhardships that are faced by more than 46 million Americans. We know \nthat too many families struggle to buy healthy food, to pay rent, and \nto access good-paying jobs.\n  I was very proud that, among the witnesses at the hearing--all of \nwhom were phenomenal--was my constituent,\n\n[[Page H1757]]\n\nOakland resident Violet Henderson, who shared her personal story of \novercoming poverty. After leaving, unfortunately, the criminal justice \nsystem, after being paroled, she told her story. She is a phenomenal \nindividual who is raising her two children and is a student. She \nsucceeded against overwhelming odds. Her story is a powerful example of \nresilience and dedication, which so many struggling Americans have.\n  It should be a call to action for Members of Congress to help more \npeople like Violet by supporting policies that will end poverty. Yet \nour Republican colleagues continue to promote harmful cuts to critical \nsafety net programs despite knowing that these cuts will push more \nfamilies over the edge; and the record of the members on Speaker Ryan's \nso-called Task Force on Poverty, Opportunity, and Upward Mobility are \njust as bad, if not worse. Time and time again, they have voted to cut \nSNAP, to erode higher education funding and Pell Grants, and to weaken \naffordable housing programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I insert in the Record Violet Henderson's testimony.\n\n Testimony of Violet Henderson at House Democratic Steering and Policy \n Committee Hearing: ``The Failure of Trickle Down Economics in the War \n                      on Poverty,'' April 14, 2016\n\n       Thank you Leader Pelosi, Congresswoman DeLauro, \n     Congresswoman Edwards, and Whip Hoyer. Thank you to the other \n     panelists up here with me. And I want to give a special \n     thank-you to my Congresswoman, Congresswoman Barbara Lee. I'm \n     here today because of you, Congresswoman Lee, both because \n     you invited me to this hearing, but in a bigger sense, your \n     leadership in Oakland and support of good reentry and \n     economic policies has made it possible for me to escape \n     poverty and live a life I am proud of and talk to you about \n     today.\n       I am honored to be here, and grateful that you have given \n     me the opportunity to speak about these issues. I am a \n     worker, a mother, a grandmother, a formerly incarcerated \n     person, a churchgoer, and a student.\n       I can speak only for myself but I hope that my testimony \n     today can give voice to the millions of people who, like me, \n     got caught up in the criminal justice system, worked \n     incredibly hard to transform their lives, but still face \n     lifelong stumbling blocks to financial stability. Unlike me, \n     too many people who worked have never escaped poverty despite \n     their hard work.\n       For me, like so many, the challenges started with childhood \n     poverty. My father died when I was four years old. My mother \n     had seven children to care for on her own and she really \n     struggled. I grew up in the Aliso Village housing project in \n     East Los Angeles. I never remember, as a child, having hope \n     or vision about a bright future.\n       My ``escape'' came when I was fourteen years old. My 21-\n     year-old boyfriend took me to Oakland and made me work the \n     streets. At the time, I did not have the privilege of \n     believing that I deserved more and better for my life. I was \n     first arrested for when I was sixteen years old but I was not \n     seen as the victim of sex trafficking. I was treated like a \n     criminal. And I became one. My next boyfriend, who was 25 \n     years older than I was, taught me how to become a thief. When \n     I was 19 years old I was sent to prison for grand theft and \n     conspiracy of several hundred dollars in a street scam.\n       Because I was a high school dropout, I got my G.E.D. while \n     I was in prison, and afterward I took college-level classes. \n     For the first time in my life I was exposed to learning, and \n     I loved it. While in prison I met a mother and a daughter who \n     were incarcerated at the same time. This broke my heart \n     because the daughter had a child whom she missed dearly and \n     tried to escape from prison to get back to her child. The \n     moment I heard that the daughter tried to escape, I made a \n     decision to change my life. I wanted children but I was going \n     to put them through that. I have never looked back.\n       Once I got out, I had two wonderful children and dedicated \n     myself to supporting them. I worked full-time as a \n     cosmetologist but still did not earn enough to feed my \n     family. For a while we survived because we had access to food \n     stamps, which we needed even when I was working multiple \n     full-time jobs. Then, thanks to an affirmative action \n     program, I was able to join the local Laborers Union and I \n     worked heavy construction for the next 20 years. It was hard \n     physical labor but I was grateful for the opportunity because \n     I earned more money than I had ever earned at any other job. \n     It allowed me, as a single parent, to provide for my \n     children, though we still struggled.\n       Working as a laborer became more and more difficult as I \n     grew older and I looked for other work. When I was 54 years \n     old I was denied office jobs because of my convictions, which \n     were then 30 years old. Thanks to free reentry clean slate \n     legal services--which Congresswoman Barbara Lee helped start \n     in Oakland at the East Bay Community Law Center--I was able \n     to clean up my record, and as a result I was able to get a \n     great job, and thankfully one that this sixty-one-year-old \n     body can handle. I'm coordinating the environmental/waste \n     reduction program for a large city agency. It has been an \n     inspiring and wonderful opportunity. I was even able to \n     fulfill my life-long dream of becoming a homeowner and I \n     bought a condo in Oakland.\n       A few years back I enrolled in a community college in \n     Oakland to study Environmental Management, where I take night \n     and evening classes. I have surprised myself by earning a \n     3.92 GPA, and was even more surprised when I was recently \n     invited to transfer to the University of California at \n     Berkeley.\n       But--and this why we are here today--despite my successes, \n     and despite working as hard as a person can work, I have \n     worried constantly about keeping my head above water \n     financially. I have had stable employment, and I have \n     catapulted myself out of the deep poverty my family knew when \n     I was a child. BUT still, even now, I can't say that I have \n     feel economically secure. I struggled mightily to hold onto \n     my condo through the economic recession. I am 61 years old \n     and worried about being able to retire anytime soon.\n       I don't exactly know how to define ``middle class'' but it \n     can't mean what I have done for the last 3 decades of my \n     life: Working full time, being very frugal, but yet also \n     constantly worrying about meeting my basic financial \n     obligations and the threat of eviction. And I am someone who \n     has been exceptionally lucky in terms of the abundance of \n     learning and employment opportunities I have had! I cannot \n     imagine the financial burdens of people who have been less \n     fortunate or live in areas with fewer programs.\n       My plea today is that you work for policies that reward all \n     hard working people in America with a fair chance to support \n     their families. This is the challenge my children face even \n     though both of them are resourceful, intelligent, and have \n     good jobs. I pray that my children will be able to know \n     economic prosperity, which at very least means living without \n     constant worry about day-to-day about making it.\n       I sit before you as a very different person from who I was \n     as lost and hopeless 16-year-old girl on the streets. It has \n     been a long journey of seeking forgiveness for the harm I \n     caused others, and healing myself I hope my story can inspire \n     women who are now struggling on the path I was on thirty \n     years ago. I want them to be encouraged to persevere and make \n     positive changes in their lives, and to have faith in the \n     system. But the system must also have faith in us! Successful \n     reentry requires government policies and programs that remove \n     stumbling blocks to economic security.\n       I am exceptionally grateful to be here but I am not \n     exceptional. I am an example of what's possible when we \n     support people through smart and fair reentry and economic \n     programs.\n       Thank you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1757-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1757]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     THE BUDGET AND THE ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

In Texas, for example, \nwe recently had a Zika virus hearing, and our infectious disease \nexperts told us that this is a devastating disease.\n  Yes, we can take money from someplace else and borrow from Peter to \npay Paul, but I am asking this Congress, in the spirit of the Good \nSamaritan, to pass the President's emergency supplemental request of \n$1.9 billion. I will be asking the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to come to Texas and sit down with our law enforcement and \nhealth professionals in order to make a difference.\n  Finally, let me say, Mr. Speaker, that this is budget day, and we \nhave not passed a budget. We will not pass a Republican budget because \nit kills education; it doesn't protect Social Security; and it is not \nin the spirit of a Good Samaritan. Let us do what is right--pass a \nbudget for the American people and provide for those in the line of \ndanger with the Zika virus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1757-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1757-H1758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         MISSED BUDGET DEADLINE\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, there is something important for the \nAmerican people to know: today is the day, April\n\n[[Page H1758]]\n\n15, that the law requires that Congress enact a budget resolution. \nObviously, that ain't gonna happen. However, the Republican-led Budget \nCommittee did share a budget blueprint with the GOP leadership. \nUltimately, the leadership decided that it wasn't harsh enough on \nfamilies, seniors, or children to pass through a Republican majority.\n  A Federal budget should be a reflection of our values as a Nation, \nand the details of the rumored proposal of a road to ruin that the \nRepublicans want to release are just not good. Apparently, the attempt \nto end the Medicare guarantee for seniors, to repeal the Affordable \nCare Act, and to block investments in good-paying jobs was not \nsufficiently brutal enough for the radicals within the Republican \nParty. If this version of the budget could not muster enough support to \nbe brought to the House floor for a vote, I fear what the Republican \nmajority will actually propose.\n  House Democrats should continue to press for a budget that creates \njobs, grows paychecks, and invests in the future of the American \npeople, like we always do. We believe in those values, and that is what \nwe will continue to fight for.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1758-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1758]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 1670.

As we know, a lady asked him at the Constitutional Convention, \n``What did you give us?'' and he said, ``A Republic, Madam, if you can \nkeep it.'' One of the ways you do not keep representative government--\nself-government through the electing of Representatives to do the will \nof the people--is to go and have those elections and elect people who \npass laws--I mean, the Founders wanted government to have gridlock.\n  As I mentioned before, Justice Scalia, in talking to a group of 50 or \nso senior citizens from my district, explained that the reason we are \nthe freest country in history--or at least we used to be. The \nindicators indicate we are not the freest country anymore, but the \nreason we became, for a while there, the freest country in history was \nthat the Founders did not trust government. They knew that, if it were \ntoo easy for a government to make laws or to just dictate what would \nhappen in a country, then people would not be free.\n  They pledged their lives, liberty, sacred honor--they pledged \neverything. Many--most, actually--of the signers of the Declaration of \nIndependence did not have very pleasant lives after the signing of \nthat. Many lost their treasures, their fortunes. They never lost their \nsacred honor. They pledged it, and they never lost their sacred honor.\n  When you look at all of the sacrifices that were made to try to allow \nus to have representative, self-government--and as difficult as it is \nto pass a bill here in the House and have the Senate pass the same bill \nor a similar bill and, if they are not the same, to go to conference \nand try to work out a bill that is the same and get it passed in both \nHouses and send it to the President and get the President to sign it \nand have the Supreme Court say, yes, that it is consistent with the \nConstitution--that is very difficult.\n  All of those things have happened with regard to our immigration law \nthat the President talked about, as any good ruler would; and, of \ncourse, as any good ruler, he had a Secretary of Homeland Security who \ndid memos and said: Okay. We are going to just not pay any attention to \nthat law. Here is the new law.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  I was amazed to hear all of the major networks, including Fox News, \ntalk about ``Here is the new program,'' ``Here is the new plan'' after \nmemos were concocted that overrode the laws that were duly passed in \nthe House and Senate and signed previously by the President, who just \noverrode the law and said: We are not going to do that. We have, in \ntheir opinion, the discretion to just ignore the law and do what we \nwant.\n  There is a good article out of the Hoover Institution journal written \nby Michael McConnell. It just came out on April 15. I thought it did a \ngood job of discussing these issues that are coming up before the \nSupreme Court on Monday.\n  Also, by way of further preface, the decision originated in the \nSouthern District of Texas before United States District Judge Andrew \nHanen, who happened to be one of the smartest people in his class and, \nactually, going through law school, one of the more liberal people in \nour class in law school, but a brilliant guy.\n  The more he delved into issues, the better lawyer he became. He was \nwith one of the best firms in Houston. He has become a profoundly good \narbitrator of justice as a United States judge.\n  So Judge Hanen wrote a very lengthy order in which he enjoined in \ncarrying out the wishes that were dictated by the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity because they violate the law. They say: We are ignoring the \nlaw. And the judge could see that there are massive consequences.\n  Although right here in this very room the President said that we are \nnot going to cover people that are illegally in the country with his \nObamaCare, it turns out that that wasn't true.\n  We have, apparently, massive numbers who get the income tax credit, \nwhether legally or not. I have people constantly telling me they work \nfor different income tax services and they provide services to people \nthat don't have Social Security numbers that are legitimate.\n  They all know about the earned income tax credit, and they all want \nit on there. They all claim it. Whether they can tell you where their \nkids are or not, they want that credit.\n  There has been some massive projections of just how much in millions \nor billions is being paid out. We previously had reporting about, just \nin one little community, how numerous people claim to live in one home \nand claim to have as many as 30 kids or so in that home so they could \nclaim all those earned income tax credits so they could get a big \nrefund.\n  There is massive amounts of money that is being taken from those who \nearned it and given to those who have come into the country illegally.\n  I don't have the articles in front of me. There are articles out this \nweek talking about that, actually, by more than the current \nunemployment rate--even the real rate, not the one that is just made \nup--it doesn't include the 94 million or so who are eligible to work, \nhave tried to find work and given up trying to find work.\n  But either number you care to use, we have that percentage of people \nwho have immigrated to America. Thank God for legal immigration.\n  Perhaps one in six people working in America are first-generation \nimmigrants. That is great, but the trouble is\n\n[[Page H1759]]\n\nthat a huge portion of those are illegally in the country.\n  The President can say all he wants to: Well, they are doing jobs that \nAmericans won't do. When wages are lower that are being paid to \nAmericans looking for work and working, it affects their homes.\n  It has affected their standard of living. It has caused people to be \nunemployed who would be employed if they weren't competing with people \nthat took lower wages because they are here illegally.\n  Of course, yesterday we learned that the IRS Commissioner, the head \nof the IRS, Koskinen, is an accomplice. He has been complicit in the \nuse of stolen, illegal Social Security numbers because he says: It is \nokay if they use stolen Social Security numbers for a good basis. We \njust don't want them to use it for a bad basis.\n  Apparently, for him, somebody filing a perjured and fraudulent income \ntax return and getting a refund of money that they very well may not be \nentitled to at all and should not be entitled to is one of the good \npurposes.\n  He clearly needs to be impeached and removed from office as head of \nthe Internal Revenue Service. Hopefully, that will be happening in the \nnear future.\n  There has to be consequences for violating the law, for helping \nothers violate the law, by looking the other way and announcing you are \nlooking the other way while people violate the law.\n  America is in trouble. We could very well be Greece right now if it \nweren't for the United States having the dollars, the international \ncurrency, and having our ability to print our own money, neither of \nwhich Greece has.\n  This case being taken up on Monday by the Supreme Court has the \nability to basically make Congress a nullity by saying: You know what--\nlook, the President was elected 8 years ago and 4 years ago.\n  So if he wants to just ignore laws and do what he wants that is not \naccording to the law, shouldn't that be okay? It is incredible how some \neven who have advanced degrees are so uneducated on how you keep a \nrepublic.\n  Well, Michael McConnell says:\n  ``One of the most closely watched cases before the Supreme Court this \nterm is United States v. Texas, the immigration case that is scheduled \nto be argued on April 18. The Supreme Court surprised most observers \nwhen it asked the parties in that case to address a question they did \nnot raise in their briefs: whether President Obama's `Deferred Action \nfor Parents of Americans'' (DAPA) order violates the `Take Care Clause' \nof Article II of the Constitution. The Take Care Clause has never \nbefore been enforced by the Court and most people have probably never \nheard of it.''\n  Let me insert here: My dear friend from Florida, Congressman Ted \nYoho, has been advocating for some time we pass a bill that just sets \nout an enabling statute that says what Take Care means under the \nConstitution and sets some requirements out so we actually have some \nhard requirements against which to measure a President's performance in \norder to determine whether he has violated the Take Care Clause and \nought to be removed from office.\n  Before you can determine the latter, you really need to know has the \nTake Care Clause been violated to a level that would justify high \ncrimes and misdemeanors.\n  I appreciate so much Andrew McCarthy's book regarding impeachment \nwhere he lays out, really, impeachment was intended to be a political \nissue.\n  The Founders did not want impeachment to be like a criminal case \nwhere the prosecution has to prove a case beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  It is a mechanism by which we avoid revolutions and military coups, \nwhich have happened in countries around the world.\n  Here we have not had to have ever, thank God, a military coup or \nanother revolution since 1776. We have had massive movements for which \nwe are grateful, like the abolitionist movement that got rid of the \natrocity of slavery, led mainly by Christian churches, and the \ncivil rights movement, of course, which the ultimate leader was \nReverend Martin Luther King, Jr., an ordained Christian minister.\n\n  So these movements have not required revolution, have not required a \nmilitary coup, because the Founders created something called \nimpeachment.\n  According to Andrew's book--and I'm sorry I can't do it the justice \nit deserves--basically, impeachment is a political mechanism to allow \npeople to remove from office someone who may not have violated a \ncriminal statute beyond a reasonable doubt.\n  But more than half of the country--more than half of those \nrepresentatives elected in the country believe that he should be \nremoved. Then we avoid a revolution, a coup, those kinds of things.\n  This article from the Hoover Institute goes on:\n  ``DAPA is a set of executive branch directives giving some four \nmillion illegal aliens who have given birth to children in the United \nStates what the orders call `legal presence' -- even though they are \nhere in violation of the law.\n  ``This `legal presence' entitles DAPA beneficiaries to work permits, \na picture ID, driver's licenses, Social Security, Earned Income Tax \ncredits, Medicaid, ObamaCare, and other social welfare benefits.\n  ``Until the 2014 election, President Obama repeatedly and \nemphatically stated that he did not have authority to issue such an \norder without congressional action.''\n  Then, when he didn't like the results of the election, he went ahead \nand did it anyway. He had said: I am not a monarch. I can't just do \nthese things.\n  And when he didn't like the result of the election, he decided to go \nahead and be a monarch and do them anyway.\n  The article goes on:\n  ``Twenty-six states have sued the federal government to challenge the \nlegality of DAPA. The courts below held that the orders violate the \nAdministrative Procedure Act because they were issued without public \nnotice and comment, as is required for agency actions with the effect \nof law, and because they are in violation of the underlying statute, \nthe Immigration and Nationality Act (INA).\n  ``By adding the Take Care Clause to the Questions Presented, the \nCourt is taking care that the constitutional dimensions of this case \nwill not be swamped by the administrative law details. But for most \npeople, including most lawyers, the Take Care Clause is a great \nunknown--uncharted territory. So: What is the Take Care Clause and what \ndoes it mean?\n  ``The Take Care Clause, found in Article II of the Constitution, the \nExecutive Power Article, is comprised of only nine words: The President \n`shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.'\n  ``But an understanding of those nine words requires an appreciation \nof their roots in English history. Like many other structural features \nof the United States Constitution, the Take Care Clause derives from \nthe long struggle between Parliament and the Crown over the extent of \n`prerogative powers,' that is, the monarch's asserted powers to create \nlaws or otherwise to act unilaterally.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  ``Absolute monarchs rule by whim. What they say goes. Even before \nParliament existed, however, the barons of England insisted that \nmonarchs rule in accordance with law rather than mere executive whim or \ndecree. King John, 1199-1216 AD, was a major offender against the rule \nof law. He arbitrarily increased taxes, abused the king's court, \nmustered soldiers for military misadventures foreign and domestic, and \nhanged innocents in Wales. Things came to a head in 1215 at Runnymede. \nFaced with armed insurrection, John agreed to the Great Charter, which \nestablished the principle that the king is not a law unto himself; even \nthe king must act through settled law to bind his subjects.\n  ``Thus began a centuries-long struggle between law and royal \nprerogative. The term `prerogative' refers to powers invested in the \nexecutive that are not governed by law.''\n  John Locke, who was read by so many of our Founders and discussed \nduring our Nation's founding, ``John Locke defined the term in his \nSecond Treatise on Government.'' John Locke said this: `` `This power \nto act according to discretion, for the public good, without the \nprescription of the law, and sometimes even against it, is that which \nis called prerogative.' The king's\n\n[[Page H1760]]\n\nprerogative powers included the veto, the pardon, the powers of war and \npeace, the power to create and fill public offices, and the power to \ndissolve the Parliament. All these he could do without the need for \nstatutes passed by Parliament, and statutes passed by Parliament could \nnot touch, limit, or regulate these prerogative powers.\n  ``Prerogative powers are not all inconsistent with constitutional \ngovernment. Under the Constitution, for example, the President has \ncertain defined prerogatives, such as the pardon power and the veto, \nwhich are committed to the President's discretion.''\n  Of course, we know the prerogative of veto can be overridden by \nCongress, so it is not an ultimate prerogative.\n  ``But much of constitutionalism consists of replacing prerogative \nwith law. The Framers of the U.S. Constitution carefully reflected on \nthe various prerogative powers claimed or exercised by the English king \nand granted, denied, or limited those powers when creating the Article \nII executive.''\n  Now, the early controversies over prerogative powers left that ``one \nof the most dangerous prerogative powers asserted by English monarchs \nwas the proclamation power. That is the power to create new law without \nparliamentary approval. The term modern Americans would use for \nproclamations is `executive orders.' Disputes over the proclamation \npower came to the fore during the Tudor dynasty, which was 1485 to \n1603.\n  ``Henry VIII believed his royal proclamations should have the force \nof law, as `though they were made by act of Parliament.' The great 18th \ncentury historian and philosopher David Hume later called this `a total \nsubversion of the English Constitution.' After Henry's death, \nParliament repealed the Act of Proclamations.\n  ``The struggle over prerogative accelerated under the four Stuart \nkings prior to the Glorious Revolution of 1688. James I was an ardent \nbeliever in the divine right of kings; he wrote a book on the topic \nshortly before he ascended to the English throne called `The Trew Law \nof Free Monarchies.' In James I's view, kings are unrestrained by law; \ntheir authority comes from God, and therefore the king is accountable \nonly to God--never to man or law.\n  ``In 1610 James I issued a royal proclamation prohibiting `new \nbuildings in and around London' and `the making of starch of wheat.' \nThe legality of these orders was tested in Case of Proclamations. Lord \nEllesmere, the royalist jurist, argued that the courts should `maintain \nthe power and prerogative of the king' and that `in cases in which \nthere is no authority and precedent,' the judges should `leave it to \nthe king to order it according to his wisdom.' Chief Justice Coke--\nwhose whiggish constitutionalism later informed the views of American \nFramers--held that the king could not lawfully `change any part of the \ncommon law, nor create any offense by his proclamation, which was not \nan offense before, without Parliament.' Coke concluded, `the law of \nEngland is divided into three parts: common law, statute law, and \ncustom; but the king's proclamation is none of them.'\n  ``Chief Justice Coke reiterated the point in the Case of Non \nObstante, or Dispensing Power. Coke observed that the king does have \nsome prerogative powers. For example, a royal pardon grants mercy \nnotwithstanding--or, as English lawyers said at the time, non \nobstante--the lawful conviction. But Coke insisted that the king's non \nobstante, or dispensing, power never can be used to annul statutes. If \nthe king attempted to dispense with a statute, Coke held, the king's \neffort would be `void,' for `an act of Parliament may absolutely bind \nthe king.' ''\n  Parenthetically, of course, since our laws were derived through this \nknowledge of what was done here, the Framers believed that the law \nwould absolutely bind the king that lives in the White House.\n  ``The principles of the Case of Proclamations and the Case of Non \nObstante are part of the American constitutional tradition. The Steel \nSeizure Case of 1952, our Supreme Court's foundational separation-of-\npowers decision, held that the President cannot make law; that is \nexclusively Congress' job. In other words, executive orders have the \nforce of law only when implementing statutes, treaties, and the \nConstitution . . . Notably, many if not all of these controversies over \nthe reach of royal prerogative arose when the king took a precedent \nthat prior monarchs had used in modest and relatively uncontroversial \nways--as Elizabeth had funded defense against the Spanish Armada--and \nstretched it to cover significant usurpations of power in ways contrary \nto the will of Parliament. That has continued to be the pattern in \nAmerican separation of powers struggles, including the one over DAPA.''\n  It is a very good article that goes on and discusses other concepts, \nbut Dan Stein had a good article regarding why United States v. Texas \nis the most important case the Court will decide this year.\n  According to Stein: ``The Supreme Court has decided to review certain \nelements in United States v. Texas.'' He goes further than that. He \nsays: ``The most dramatic of these actions were two programs designed \nto grant de facto amnesty and work authorization to an estimated 4.7 \nmillion illegal aliens. The first of these amnesties was an expansion \nof Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA--a 2012 executive \naction that has thus far benefited some 800,000 illegal aliens who \narrived in the U.S. when they were under the age of 16''--or, at least \nI will add parenthetically, based on what I have observed at the border \nwho said they were under 16. I have been there all hours of the day and \nnight on the border and have been astonished beyond mildly, being \namused that people who clearly could grow full beards would claim to be \nunder 16. I have seen them in the middle of the night when a group of \nthem would have to go through being processed by the Border Patrol \nreading their little pieces of paper they had and exchanging, and then \neach of them showing, this is what I have for identification purposes. \nI was amused how their identities seemed to be interchangeable because \nthey could pass them among each other and decide which identity each \nwanted to take.\n  But this article points out that ``U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen \nissued a temporary injunction halting implementation. That injunction \nwas subsequently upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth \nCircuit. The Obama administration appealed that decision to the Supreme \nCourt,'' and they will hear arguments. That will be on Monday. ``While \nHanen's injunction was based on the government's failure to comply with \nthe requirements of the Administrative Procedure Act, the High Court \nhas indicated that it will also consider whether the executive amnesty \nprograms violate the Take Care Clause of the Constitution.''\n  I also want to insert here, since I know the intellectual integrity \nand brilliance of Judge Andrew Hanen--I have not talked to him in a \nnumber of years, but when I read the order that he drafted, he could \nhave just had a one-page, one-paragraph order implementing in the \ninjunction, but it was lengthy and thorough, and I knew what Judge \nHanen was doing, having been a judge and chief justice. I understood \nexactly.\n  There are times when you don't want the lawyers, as smart as they may \nbe, to misinterpret the actions you have taken, and you know that you \nare capable of writing a good law review article, as Judge Hanen was \nmore than capable and by himself has won an award for a law review \narticle. I knew, as a judge, what I suspected Judge Hanen felt in this \ncase, this could end up before the Supreme Court, and I don't want any \nmisunderstanding or some court coming back down the way that says, oh, \nI probably meant this or I intended to do that when that was not my \nmeaning and it was not my intent.\n  So Judge Hanen issued a very eloquent and lengthy order so that even \nsome of the normal majority of the U.S. Supreme Court would have to \nreally twist and abuse his words in order to get the wrong meaning of \nwhat he was doing. He laid out his legal basis. He laid out the facts, \nand he made very clear that both the law and the facts supported what \nhe did and the reasons for which he did them.\n  So it should be a lesson. I know, as a judge, often it is easier when \na litigant, prevailing litigant--the way it usually goes, they supply \nan order with their motion, with their petition for injunction. Here is \nthe order. And it is a lot easier for a judge just to sign that and go \non.\n\n[[Page H1761]]\n\n  But on important matters, I hope other judges who truly appreciate \nthe Constitution the way Judge Hanen does, will take the time to write \ntheir own order, as he did, and scrupulously so. And I certainly hope, \nMr. Speaker, that come Monday, during and after oral arguments in this \ncase, the Justices on the Supreme Court, some of whom may not be quite \nas smart as Judge Hanen intellectually, will at least give credence to \nthe trouble that he endured in order to write his own order and make \nsure his legal reasoning was as clear as Judge Hanen made it.\n  Well done, good and faithful Judge Hanen.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  This article says: ``Under these two newly announced programs''--\ntalking about DAPA and DACA--``nearly 40 percent of the Nation's \nestimated 12 million illegal aliens would be granted legal presence and \npermission to work in the U.S. According to an analysis by the \nMigration Policy Institute, an organization that is generally \nsupportive of President Obama's immigration policies, combined with the \n40 percent of illegal aliens covered by DACA, DACA+, and DAPA, the \nother policy directives issued by Secretary Johnson would have exempted \n87 percent of all illegal aliens from enforcement actions.''\n  That is extraordinary. If the President doesn't like the law, he \nsays: I have the power to exclude certain people from prosecution and, \nhey, I can issue pardons in specific cases. So I am specifically making \n87 percent of those illegally in the country legal.\n  We might as well pronounce the next President king or queen if they \nare going to have this kind of power.\n  Further down in the article, Mr. Stein says: ``To the contrary, \nCongress has taken explicit actions to limit the discretionary \nauthority of the executive in the area of immigration enforcement. In \nthe Illegal Immigration Reform and Relief Act of 1996, which Congress \npassed and President Clinton signed, Congress indisputably intended `to \nprevent delay in the removal of illegal aliens.'\n  ``Under the INA, Congress has enumerated two mandatory statutory \nresponsibilities to the Secretary of Homeland Security: the `power and \nduty,' to administer and enforce all laws relating to immigration, and \nthe mandatory duty to guard against the illegal entry of aliens.\n  ``Under the Obama administration, neither Secretary Johnson nor his \npredecessor, Janet Napolitano, have faithfully complied with these \nstatutory responsibilities. In fact, through his acts of November 20, \n2014, the Secretary has affirmatively shirked those responsibilities \nand blatantly attempted to substitute Presidential policies in the \nplace of a comprehensive system of constitutionally enacted Federal \nlaws that define who may enter and remain in the United States and \nunder what conditions.\n  ``Needless to say, when the Supreme Court delivers its ruling in \nJune, the implications for U.S. immigration policy will be profound. \nWhat is at stake is nothing less than the entire premise of more than a \ncentury of immigration policy: namely, the legitimacy of laws that \nrestrict immigration in order to protect the social, economic, and \nsecurity interests of the American people.''\n  Let me insert here. Let's look at who is most harmed by these vast \namnesty programs of millions of millions of people to compete with \npeople legally in America for the jobs. You have got over 94 million \nAmericans that are so tired of looking for work and being turned down \nfor jobs, they quit looking. Perhaps some of those 94 million should be \ngiven the chance to have those jobs.\n  And, of course, knowing the way free markets are supposed to work, \nlabor is paid what the free market would require. But you convolute the \nfree market by bringing people in. And I do say bringing them in, \nbecause Homeland Security, as Border Patrolmen have told me, are called \nlogistics by the drug cartels because they get them across the river, \nand then Homeland Security becomes logistics and ships them wherever \nthey want to go in the United States. Or they may be so callous as to \njust give them a notice, whether they are a killer, as has happened \nhere lately, and say: By the way, come back to court some time in the \nfuture, for which they, of course, do not return.\n  But in any event, the article concludes: ``Even those Justices of the \ncourt who might agree with the President's views on immigration policy \ngenerally should appreciate the precedent-setting decision they would \nbe making by allowing the President to run roughshod over the \nconstitutional separation-of-powers doctrine.\n  ``Those who support granting amnesty to illegal aliens should \nrecognize that a ruling in favor of his vast new claims to power to \nchange the law would be a Pyrrhic victory. It would emasculate the \nabilities of Congress to set immigration limits and standards, and it \nwould render the courts irrelevant in ensuring the enforcement of the \nvery same.''\n  So this is a big case coming up. The Supreme Court also has heard \noral arguments on whether or not the President can order the violation \nof deeply held religious Christian convictions and order folks like the \nLittle Sisters of the Poor, who have dedicated their lives to poverty \nand helping those less fortunate.\n  If they want them to violate their religious convictions, as was made \nclear during oral argument, then the administration ought to be able to \norder any American, including churches, according to them, to violate \ntheir Christian beliefs. Because after all, they are the government. \nThey work for the President.\n  Sure, they can order people to violate their Christian beliefs. For \nheaven's sake, these people have no sense of history. They don't even \nknow that one of the things that just infuriated Americans and caused a \nrevolution was a king believing that he could just order people to \nviolate their religious convictions. That is why religion is the first \nthing mentioned in our Bill of Rights.\n  It has been so misconstrued, but the government was to never do what \nthe King of England did when he ordered a new church. The Church of \nEngland is the official church. They never saw it as a problem to have \ndifferent denominations agree to pray in the name of Jesus and to have \nthe same type of prayers begin each day in the Congress and then, \nagain, when we started our first congresses under the Constitution. \nThat was never a problem. They knew they were not violating the First \nAmendment, because many of them helped craft it. We are not \nestablishing a religion and we are not going to prohibit the free \nexercise thereof.\n  So the Court has this before it, with eight Justices sitting, after \nthe untimely death of a real American hero, who has no doubt already \nheard, as John Quincy Adams said when he stood downstairs before the \nSupreme Court and prayed that the Justices of the Supreme Court that \nhave already deceased would have already heard those words: Well done, \ngood and faithful servant. Enter now into the joy of the Lord.\n  That is what John Quincy Adams said specifically before the Supreme \nCourt in the hearing on the Amistad case downstairs when the Supreme \nCourt was here in this building. I have no doubt Justice Scalia has \nalready heard that. He has been a very faithful servant, standing up \nfor religious liberty.\n  So we will see what the other eight Justices, do, and then we will \nsee whether or not politics has become so extraordinarily the purpose \nof the Supreme Court rather than the Constitution. Because, clearly, \nthere is information that is passed and gotten to the Supreme Court. \nApparently it occurred during the decision on whether or not to extend \nthe 24-hour hold on the bankruptcy order that violated the \nConstitution.\n  And God bless Justice Ginsburg when she put that 24-hour hold on an \nunconstitutional, illegal order. According to what one of the Justices \ntold me--without going into detail--the White House submitted \ninformation ex parte, behind the scenes, that if they left that 24-hour \nhold in place, everybody that had any kind of job that related to the \nautomobile industry would lose their job. And it would all be the \nSupreme Court's fault if they left the 24-hour hold in place.\n\n  It certainly appears they got information that affected Chief Justice \nRoberts. It looked like he changed a dissenting opinion into a majority \nopinion in the ObamaCare case. This is\n\n[[Page H1762]]\n\nserious. And this will determine whether or not we are going to follow \nthe Constitution.\n  I am so pleased to be here on the House floor with my friend from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Sanford), the former Governor.\n  Mr. SANFORD. I just want to borrow maybe 5 minutes worth of your time \njust to talk about this issue of Puerto Rico. You have touched on it in \ndifferent ways. You were talking about constitutional issues just a \nmoment ago, and I want to follow up on that thought because I think \nthat what is occurring here has far bigger consequences than we may \nrealize.\n  I would say that at a couple different levels. One is, Charles \nDickens once talked about Christmas past, Christmas present, Christmas \nstill to come. I think that this is a snapshot of Christmas to come if \nwe don't watch out here in the United States.\n  As my colleague from Texas well knows, we are at a financial tipping \npoint, the likes of which our civilization has never seen before. We \nhave never before been at this level of indebtedness in a peacetime \nsituation. We are, again, about to find ourselves between a rock and a \nhard place, which is very much the story of Puerto Rico, as it relates \nto their financial situation.\n  So you think about the number of 2025. In basically less than 10 \nyears, we are only going to have enough money to pay for interest and \nentitlements and nothing else. You think about the way in which \ninterest payments--by congressional budget numbers--are expected to \nballoon from around $200 billion a year to $800 billion a year and the \nfact that we are going to spend more on interest payments than we will \non defense.\n  You can walk through a lot of different numbers that say that we are \nabout to be at a profound, bad spot, which is, again, the way in which \nPuerto Rico, I think, is foretelling. It really talks about the fact \nthat they went out, spent too much, obligated themselves too much, made \npromises they couldn't deliver on. And so we find ourselves in this \npickle.\n  I would also say this. This is an exercise in free markets. If you \nthink about the notion of free markets and what that means, what we \nwould agree on as conservatives is that there are certain absolutes. On \nthe rule of law and private property rights and market-based \nprinciples, Thomas Friedman talks about a flat world and how a kid in \nTexas or in South Carolina competes with kids in Shanghai or New Delhi \nin ways that they never did before.\n  So if you have a corporate rate that is too high, not surprisingly, \ncorporations aren't going to come to your island. If you have a minimum \nwage that doesn't fit with the prevailing wage rate of that area, \ncorporations or businesses, local and small, may not be able to start \nup and compete. If you think about so many of the different building \nblocks that make for a vibrant economy, this is, again, a reminder of \nhow important those things are.\n  And so I look at this and I am perplexed. I am really struggling with \nthis issue.\n  I looked just a little while ago. Puerto Rican bonds are still \ntrading between 65 and 70 cents on the dollar, even though we have a \npure math trap, which is to say financial markets are still betting \nthat, in some form or another, those bondholders are going to get \nbailed out.\n  So that is on the one hand. On the other hand, you look at the plight \nof the people in Puerto Rico, you look at what might come next. I \nempathize with leadership of how do you deal with this issue. But I \nwant to go back to one thing that I think is central to both of us, and \nthat is the rule of law.\n  I actually pulled up a general obligation bond. This was a 2012 \nissue, Public Improvement Refunding Bonds, Commonwealth of Puerto Rico, \n$400 million in size. It says on the first page: ``The bonds are \ngeneral obligations of the Commonwealth. The good faith, credit, and \ntaxing power of the Commonwealth are irrevocably pledged for the prompt \npayment of the principal and interest on the bonds. The Constitution of \nPuerto Rico provides that public debt of the Commonwealth, which \nincludes bonds,'' whatnot, whatnot, whatnot. This on the front page.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  The issue of what is occurring in Puerto Rico has everything to do \nwith the sanctity of the rule of law in this country. It has far-\nreaching implications well beyond the 3\\1/2\\ million people that make \nup the Island of Puerto Rico but, really, the whole of the United \nStates.\n  We have a municipal market in this country of about $2.7 trillion in \nsize. What comes next? Because, if they can change it in the front page \nof what was a $400 million issue for Puerto Rico, can they change it \nfor Illinois? Can they change it for California?\n  Obviously, territories and States are very different, but I do worry \nabout the degree of precedent it sets, because what we are worried \nabout is a public exodus from Puerto Rico. We are worried about a lot \nof different ramifications. Is that not true if Illinois was to end up \nin a real problem spot financially, in terms of what comes next?\n  So I think it has real implications there. I think it is a reminder \nof how important it is that we look at the ingredients of growth.\n  One of my problems with this bill is it is asymmetrical. The cram-\ndown provision, section 3, is absolute and certain. The certainty of \neconomic reforms on that island are not certain. It is asymmetrical in \nthat form.\n  So I look at the Jones Act. I was in a transportation hearing \nyesterday, and it was pointed out that the cost of delivering a 20-foot \ncontainer from the East Coast of the United States is double the cost \nof what it would be to deliver that same container to the Dominican \nRepublic or to Haiti.\n  I look at the corporate tax there. They used to have a very \ncompetitive corporate tax rate on the island of Puerto Rico. That \nFederal clause lapsed, and now they are not so competitive.\n  But why don't we have it in this bill? In other words, if we are \ngoing to have a cram-down provision, which really deals with the \nsanctity of law, general obligation bonds, what they do or don't mean, \nwhy wouldn't we have incorporated, as well, other provisions that could \nmake the island more competitive, whether that deals with the Jones Act \ncorporate tax--or, for instance, we have a bill on the minimum wage.\n  If you look at what has happened in American Samoa, or if you look in \nthe Northern Mariana Islands, other territories of the United States, \nwhat we did as a Congress is to say: You know what? The prevailing wage \nof that region of the Pacific is not the same as what you would see in \nthe domestic United States. Therefore, let's give them discretion in \nhow they set their minimum wage.\n  Our bill says that same thing. The prevailing wage of the Caribbean \nBasin is not the same as you would see in the domestic United States. \nWhy not give them that same option so that they can become more \ncompetitive as they compete with Haiti and the Dominican Republic and \nother neighboring islands down that way?\n  So I am going to continue to study this issue, but I am genuinely \nconcerned about what it could mean.\n  I just want to take one second--can I take one more second?--to read \nthe cram-down provision because, in the bill, under title III, it \nincorporates 1129(b) of the Federal Code. Let me just read that so it \nis on the record.\n  ``Notwithstanding section 510(a) of this title, if all of the \napplicable requirements of subsection (a) of this section other than \nthe paragraph (8) are met with respect to a plan, the court, on request \nof the proponent of the plan, shall confirm the plan notwithstanding \nthe requirements of such paragraph if the plan does not discriminate \nunfairly, and is fair and equitable, with respect to each class of \nclaims or interests that is impaired under . . . the plan.''\n  I could go on. It is Greek. It is written in legalese. But the point \nis this bill has an absolute cram-down provision, which is to open up \nnew territory with regard to how territories handle debt, and I think \nwe need to be very, very, very wary of that provision; and, at minimum, \nif we are going to include something like that, include whole-scale \nchanges that would make the island more competitive so that they can, \nin fact, pay off their debts because, if you don't do anything to \nimprove the economy, we are going to end up back in this same problem, \nwhether it is 12 months from now or 12 years from now.\n\n[[Page H1763]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GOHMERT. The gentleman is exactly right. It seems like the big \npush is to resolve the issue of what is owed to the bondholders who \ninvested money; and, apparently, they are the ones running commercials \nin some people's districts about, oh, don't do a bailout, because they \nwant to get their full money on what they invested. I sure understand \nthat.\n  But as my friend has pointed out, we can't be sure that there will be \nany reforms. I know some of our friends, we think, well, there is such \nmassive unemployment. Well, one cure in some places to help with \nmassive unemployment is to lower the minimum wage and get more people \nto work, and that is being suggested; but in Puerto Rico, I was reading \nthat, for a typical family of three, if someone works a 40-hour-per-\nweek minimum wage job, at the current minimum wage before it is lowered \nlike some people are advocating, the take-home is under $1,200. \nHowever, the welfare payments they would be entitled to, typically, on \naverage, would be about $1,800 a month; so sometimes lowering the \nminimum wage would be a solution.\n  In Puerto Rico, where--and of course I think it is totally \nappropriate and fair, as the Founders said: If they don't elect one \nrepresentative to the body that makes taxes, then they have no right to \nmake taxes on us. So, in Puerto Rico, which is also true of Guam, \nSamoa, the Mariana Islands, any territory where they elect a delegate \nor they don't elect a full voting Representative, because those come \nfrom the several States, they don't pay any Federal income tax.\n  So I had in my mind that, wow, Puerto Rico could be the American Hong \nKong. They have all the Federal benefits. I read one estimate that 20 \npercent of all of the income made by people in Puerto Rico is actually \nwelfare benefits, paid by people of the 50 States.\n\n  But some of the towns--I saw a chart--I think the highest was right \nat 46 percent of the local community work for government. And, you \nknow, you have got communities, 28,000, 35,000, where 40 percent of the \nwhole population works for the government. Something has to be done \nabout that.\n  Our friend, fellow Republican Luis Fortuno, got elected Governor, and \nhe could see the handwriting on the wall. We have got to get our \ngovernment down and under control because, if we are going to expect \nanybody to help us at all, we have got to show we are able to take care \nof our own problems. He was promptly fired at the next election for \ntrying to get the massive government bureaucracy under control. That \nhasn't been dealt with. There is no indication it will actually be \ndealt with.\n  President Obama will make all the appointments of the board we are \ntalking about that will have oversight, but those will come from \nrecommendations from Minority Leader Pelosi, Speaker Ryan, Majority \nLeader McConnell, and Minority Leader Reid; and the President will make \nwhat will be the deciding vote on close calls. So there are no \nassurances that there is going to be reform in these areas.\n  As my friend, Senator Inhofe from Oklahoma, has pointed out, Puerto \nRico had the only area, he was telling me, in the world where all of \nour military branches could come together and do tactical exercises, \nyou know, storm the beach type of things. And that was taken away; and \nthat land, 17,000 or so acres, is owned by the Department of the \nInterior.\n  Puerto Rico, apparently, is part of this deal. They don't want to \nsell any Puerto Rican land, but they are willing to let the Department \nof the Interior sell their land and give that money to Puerto Rico. So \nwe are not giving them direct payments, but the Department of the \nInterior, part of this deal is going to be selling things.\n  Mr. SANFORD. If the gentleman would yield, and then I will leave it \nto you.\n  You hit on Luis Fortuno, and I do want to shout out, I worked with \nhim in a former role in government, and you are absolutely correct. \nWhat he tried to do, I think, was brave in political terms, courageous, \nand he paid a price for it in the political world; but I think that the \nrecord will show that he was trying to do the right thing on that \nfront.\n  I think also, what has happened here is a reminder of how, if \neverybody is in charge, nobody is in charge. And too much of what we \nsee, again, I absolutely empathize with the plight that leadership \nfinds themselves in in terms of: How do you manage these competitive \ninterests of the need to have financial stability on an island like \nPuerto Rico, and how do you manage that with the precedent that it \nmight set for other States and other territories and the overall notion \nof financial responsibility?\n  I see your time is about to wind up, so I am going to stop for you \nsince it was your time. Thank you for letting me borrow a few minutes \nof it.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1763-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Jones (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \npersonal reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/15/house-section/article/H1763-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1763]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
