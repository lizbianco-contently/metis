Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 907) to improve defense cooperation between the United \nStates and the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 907\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``United States-Jordan Defense \n     Cooperation Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) As of January 22, 2015, the United States Government \n     has provided $3,046,343,000 in assistance to the Syria \n     humanitarian response, of which nearly $467,000,000 has been \n     to the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n       (2) As of January 2015, according to the United Nations \n     High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), there are 621,937 \n     registered Syrian refugees in Jordan and 83.8 percent of \n     those refugees live outside refugee camps.\n       (3) In 2000, the United States and Jordan signed a free-\n     trade agreement that went into force in 2001.\n       (4) In 1996, the United States granted Jordan major non-\n     NATO ally status.\n       (5) Jordan is suffering from the Syrian refugee crisis and \n     the threat of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant \n     (ISIL).\n       (6) The Government of Jordan was elected as a non-permanent \n     member of the United Nations Security Council beginning in \n     January 2014 and terminating in December 2015.\n       (7) Enhanced support for defense cooperation with Jordan is \n     important to the national security of the United States, \n     including through creation of a status in law for Jordan \n     similar to the countries in the North Atlantic Treaty \n     Organization, Japan, Australia, the Republic of Korea, \n     Israel, and New Zealand, with respect to consideration by \n     Congress of foreign military sales to Jordan.\n       (8) The Colorado National Guard's relationship with the \n     Jordanian military provides a significant benefit to both the \n     United States and Jordan.\n       (9) Jordanian pilot Moaz al-Kasasbeh was brutally murdered \n     by ISIL.\n       (10) On February 3, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry and \n     Jordanian Foreign Minister Nasser Judeh signed a new \n     Memorandum of Understanding that reflects the intention to \n     increase United States assistance to the Government of Jordan \n     from $660,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 per year for the years \n     2015 through 2017.\n\n     SEC. 3.

SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that expeditious consideration \n     of certifications of letters of offer to sell defense \n     articles, defense services, design and construction services, \n     and major defense equipment to the Hashemite Kingdom of \n     Jordan under section 36(b) of the Arms Export Control Act (22 \n     U.S.C. 2776(b)) is fully consistent with United States \n     security and foreign policy interests and the objectives of \n     world peace and security.\n\n     SEC. 5. ENHANCED DEFENSE COOPERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--For the 3-year period beginning on the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Hashemite Kingdom of \n     Jordan shall be treated as if it were a country listed in the \n     provisions of law described in subsection (b) for purposes of \n     applying and administering such provisions of law.\n       (b) Provisions of Law.--The provisions of law described in \n     this subsection are the following provisions of the Arms \n     Export Control Act:\n       (1) Subsections (b)(2), (d)(2)(B), (d)(3)(A)(i), and (d)(5) \n     of section 3 (22 U.S.C. 2753).\n       (2) Subsections (e)(2)(A), (h)(1)(A), (h)(2) of section 21 \n     (22 U.S.C. 2761).\n       (3) Subsections (b)(1), (b)(2), (b)(6), (c), and (d)(2)(A) \n     of section 36 (22 U.S.C. 2776).\n       (4) Section 62(c)(1) (22 U.S.C. 2796a(c)(1)).\n       (5) Section 63(a)(2) (22 U.S.C. 2796b(a)(2)).\n\n     SEC. 6.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nConnolly) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to submit statements or extraneous \nmaterials for the Record on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n\n[[Page H4780]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 907, which is before us, is a simple, \nstraightforward, commonsense bill that not only helps secure U.S. \nnational security interests, but also the security interests of one of \nour closest allies in the Middle East, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan.\n  This bill will give Jordan the ability to buy defense articles, \ndefense services, and major defense equipment under the Arms Export \nControl Act, as long as any sale is fully consistent with United States \nsecurity and foreign policy interests and objectives.\n  The bill also supports the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan in its \nresponse to the Syrian refugee crisis to help alleviate the domestic \nburden to provide basic needs for the assimilated Syrian refugees, and \nthe bill also calls for greater cooperation with Jordan to fight the \nterrorist threat from the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant--ISIL--\nor any other terrorist organization.\n  Late last year, Mr. Speaker, I introduced this bill after leading a \ncongressional delegation to Jordan. We traveled to Jordan to see how \nthe people of Jordan were dealing with the strains put on them from the \nhumanitarian crisis developing in Syria.\n  The King of Jordan had taken in somewhere in the neighborhood of 1 \nmillion refugees, despite the toll it has taken on his country's \ninfrastructure and resources; but despite the added pressures the \nKingdom was facing from the refugee crisis, the King told us that one \nof the most pressing issues he was facing was the encroachment of ISIL \ntoward his borders.\n  He stressed that he was willing to help lead the fight against ISIL, \nbut he just did not have sufficient military equipment with which to do \nso.\n  I understand how important the stability and security of Jordan is \nnot just for the region, but also for another strong ally of ours, the \ndemocratic Jewish State of Israel. It made sense that, in order to \nmaintain the fragile stability in some of the countries in the region, \nwe would need to help bolster the capabilities of our friends who are \ncommitted to defeating this radical extremist threat.\n  We marked up the bill in November of last year, but simply ran out of \ntime at the end of the Congress. I reintroduced the bill again this \nyear, alongside Mr. Ted Deutch of Florida, the ranking member of the \nMiddle East and North Africa Subcommittee; Kay Granger, chairman of the \nState, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs Appropriations \nSubcommittee; and Nita Lowey, ranking member of the State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs Appropriations Subcommittee.\n  I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel because it is through \ntheir leadership that we were able to pass the bill out of the Foreign \nAffairs Committee unanimously this past April.\n  Mr. Speaker, in Jordan, the U.S. could not ask for a more committed \npartner in the fight against ISIL. King Abdullah is committed to that \nfight. He understands the urgency and need to address ISIL head on, and \nhe has shown that he is willing to take the necessary measures to \ndefeat these extremists, but he needs more resources to fight ISIL. He \nneeds these resources to protect the security of his people.\n  Congress must do everything that we can to help our friends defend \nthemselves and defeat this scourge of terror. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 907, the U.S.-Jordan Defense \nCooperation Act of 2015. As the Middle East has become more unstable \nand as ISIS continues to terrorize the people of Syria, Iraq, and its \nneighbors, Jordan remains resolute. While ISIS threatens its borders \nand terrorizes its people, Jordan has fought back.\n  When Jordan Air Force pilot Captain al-Kasasbeh was brutally \nmurdered--burned alive in a cage, Mr. Speaker--Jordan did not shrink; \nit did not retreat. Instead, it took even a more active role in \nairstrikes against the ISIS threat.\n  The Syrian civil war and instability created by ISIS has placed a \ntremendous pressure on the country of Jordan. Jordan has absorbed \n620,000 Syrian refugees during this crisis. Its healthcare and \neducational systems are under severe strain as a result.\n  The United States has provided over $460 million in response, on top \nof the over $1 billion in bilateral foreign assistance Jordan received \nlast year. In February, the U.S. and Jordanian Governments signed a \nmemorandum of understanding outlining the intention to provide Jordan \nwith $1 billion per year for the next 3 years. This agreement and this \nlegislation seek to ensure that Jordan is able to defend itself in the \nwake of these severe threats.\n  For the next 3 years, the bill would treat Jordan as a NATO member in \nhow weapons sales and maintenance, manufacturing licensing agreements, \nand technical assistance are considered and notified to this Congress. \nThe bill also authorizes a MOU with Jordan to increase economic and \nmilitary assistance, as well as joint military operations.\n  The U.S.-Jordanian relationship is mutually beneficial. Now, more \nthan ever, Jordan needs U.S. support. We need strong Jordanian resolve \nin the face of the threat against ISIS. I urge my colleagues to support \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, we have no further speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, let me close by noting that this bill is \ncrucial because it shows that, if given proper assistance, the region \ncan stand up for itself. This measure does not put U.S. boots on the \nground. U.S. support and leadership is appreciated, of course, but \nJordan is seeking to defend itself with our help.\n  We have had many solemn conversations in this body and on this floor \nabout issues of war and peace. This bill demonstrates U.S. leadership \nin preparing others to fight their own battles, and that is an \nimportant strategy as we move forward. This legislation is consistent \nwith that principle.\n  I urge my colleagues to give this their full support, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my good friend, the gentleman from Virginia, for his \ncomments. I know that it comes from great experience. I believe that he \nalso served as a staff member on the Foreign Relations Committee in the \nSenate. That has definitely helped him form his opinions and expertise.\n\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I yield to the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. I am just amazed that my friend from Florida would be \nin possession of such intricate knowledge. I thank her for \nacknowledging it.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Reclaiming my time, this bill could not come at a \nmore important time, Mr. Speaker.\n  In March, I was honored to join Speaker Boehner on a congressional \ntrip to Jordan in order to discuss the growing threat to that region. I \nhad previously gone there on my own CODEL. Now, going back in March, I \nsee how ISIL has created an even greater threat to the Hashemite \nKingdom of Jordan and the refugee crisis continues to build up for the \nKingdom of Jordan.\n  We expressed our appreciation to His Majesty for his steadfast \ncommitment, to support his efforts to fight this ISIL threat, and help \nhim with the burden of the refugees.\n  The King reiterated again his commitment to defeating ISIL and the \nneed for more assistance from the international community. We told him \nthat we would do what we could to ensure that he had all of the tools \nneeded to win this fight against ISIL.\n  Since the coalition campaign against ISIL began, Mr. Speaker, the \nterror group has made great gains in Iraq and Syria. It has expanded \nits influence across the globe to places like Libya, Tunisia, Sinai, \nEurope, and even here in the United States.\n  Congress needs to do our part. We need to step up. We need to show \nour allies that we are committed to help them. They are taking the \nfight to ISIL. Let's help them with these tools. We need to show ISIL \nand all of our enemies that we will stand by our allies.\n\n[[Page H4781]]\n\nWe will stand by our friends and help them do what is necessary--all \nthat is necessary--to defeat terror and to defeat radical extremism.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital, important bill and \nsupport our key ally, the Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan. I would like to \nthank Mr. Royce and Mr. Engel again for their leadership, as well as \nMr. Deutch, Ms. Granger, and Mrs. Lowey.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 907, U.S.-\nJordan Defense Cooperation Act of 2015.\n  The United States has no stronger partner in the Arab world than \nJordan, and His Majesty King Abdullah II continues to be a pioneer in \nbolstering moderate political voices both in Jordan and throughout the \nMuslim world.\n  During such a tumultuous time in the region, with the rise of ISIL \nand the unprecedented humanitarian needs of millions of refugees, \nstability and security in Jordan remain vital to our own interests.\n  That is why this legislation is so important. It would help \nstrengthen military and economic ties between our two countries.\n  As the Ranking Member of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on \nState and Foreign Operations, I remain committed to our strategic \npartnership with Jordan, and I will continue to work as hard as \npossible to promote stability, economic growth, and prosperity for the \nJordanian people.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 907, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4779-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4779-H4781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          UNITED STATES-JORDAN DEFENSE COOPERATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 907, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H4781-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4781-H4782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        VETERAN'S I.D. CARD ACT\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and concur in \nthe Senate amendment to the bill (H.R. 91) to amend title 38, United \nStates Code, to direct the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue, upon \nrequest, veteran identification cards to certain veterans.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the Senate amendment is as follows:\n  Senate amendment:\n\n       Strike all after the enacting clause and insert the \n     following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Identification Card \n     Act 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. VETERANS IDENTIFICATION CARD.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, veteran identification cards were issued to \n     veterans who have either completed the statutory time-in-\n     service requirement for retirement from the Armed Forces or \n     who have received a medical-related discharge from the Armed \n     Forces.\n       (2) Effective on the day before the date of the enactment \n     of this Act, a veteran who served a minimum obligated time in \n     service, but who did not meet the criteria described in \n     paragraph (1), did not receive a means of identifying the \n     veteran's status as a veteran other than using the Department \n     of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers of the veteran.\n       (3) Goods, services, and promotional activities are often \n     offered by public and private institutions to veterans who \n     demonstrate proof of service in the military, but it is \n     impractical for a veteran to always carry Department of \n     Defense form DD-214 discharge papers to demonstrate such \n     proof.\n       (4) A general purpose veteran identification card made \n     available to veterans would be useful to demonstrate the \n     status of the veterans without having to carry and use \n     official Department of Defense form DD-214 discharge papers.\n       (5) On the day before the date of the enactment of this \n     Act, the Department of Veterans Affairs had the \n     infrastructure in place across the United States to produce \n     photographic identification cards and accept a small payment \n     to cover the cost of these cards.\n       (b) Provision of Veteran Identification Cards.--Chapter 57 \n     of title 38, United States Code, is amended by adding after \n     section 5705 the following new section:\n\n     ``Sec. 5706. Veterans identification card\n\n       ``(a) In General.--The Secretary of Veterans Affairs shall \n     issue an identification card described in subsection (b) to \n     each veteran who--\n       ``(1) requests such card;\n       ``(2) presents a copy of Department of Defense form DD-214 \n     or other official document from the official military \n     personnel file of the veteran that describes the service of \n     the veteran; and\n       ``(3) pays the fee under subsection (c)(1).\n       ``(b) Identification Card.--An identification card \n     described in this subsection is a card issued to a veteran \n     that--\n       ``(1) displays a photograph of the veteran;\n       ``(2) displays the name of the veteran;\n       ``(3) explains that such card is not proof of any benefits \n     to which the veteran is entitled to;\n       ``(4) contains an identification number that is not a \n     social security number; and\n       ``(5) serves as proof that such veteran--\n       ``(A) served in the Armed Forces; and\n       ``(B) has a Department of Defense form DD-214 or other \n     official document in the official military personnel file of \n     the veteran that describes the service of the veteran.\n       ``(c) Costs of Card.--(1) The Secretary shall charge a fee \n     to each veteran who receives an identification card issued \n     under this section, including a replacement identification \n     card.\n       ``(2)(A) The fee charged under paragraph (1) shall equal \n     such amount as the Secretary determines is necessary to issue \n     an identification card under this section.\n       ``(B) In determining the amount of the fee under \n     subparagraph (A), the Secretary shall ensure that the total \n     amount of fees collected under paragraph (1) equals an amount \n     necessary to carry out this section, including costs related \n     to any additional equipment or personnel required to carry \n     out this section.\n       ``(C) The Secretary shall review and reassess the \n     determination under subparagraph (A) during each five-year \n     period in which the Secretary issues an identification card \n     under this section.\n       ``(3) Amounts collected under this subsection shall be \n     deposited in an account of the Department available to carry \n     out this section. Amounts so deposited shall be--\n       ``(A) merged with amounts in such account;\n       ``(B) available in such amounts as may be provided in \n     appropriation Acts; and\n       ``(C) subject to the same conditions and limitations as \n     amounts otherwise in such account.\n       ``(d) Effect of Card on Benefits.--(1) An identification \n     card issued under this section shall not serve as proof of \n     any benefits that the veteran may be entitled to under this \n     title.\n       ``(2) A veteran who is issued an identification card under \n     this section shall not be entitled to any benefits under this \n     title by reason of possessing such card.\n       ``(e) Administrative Measures.--(1) The Secretary shall \n     ensure that any information collected or used with respect to \n     an identification card issued under this section is \n     appropriately secured.\n       ``(2) The Secretary may determine any appropriate \n     procedures with respect to issuing a replacement \n     identification card.\n       ``(3) In carrying out this section, the Secretary shall \n     coordinate with the National Personnel Records Center.\n       ``(4) The Secretary may conduct such outreach to advertise \n     the identification card under this section as the Secretary \n     considers appropriate.\n       ``(f) Construction.--This section shall not be construed to \n     affect identification cards otherwise provided by the \n     Secretary to veterans enrolled in the health care system \n     established under section 1705(a) of this title.''.\n       (c) Clerical Amendment.--The table of sections at the \n     beginning of such chapter is amended by inserting after the \n     item relating to section 5705 the following new item:\n``5706. Veterans identification card.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     take effect on the date that is 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). Pursuant to the rule, the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nadd extraneous material on the Senate amendment to H.R. 91.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Louisiana?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, many businesses show their gratitude to our Nation's \nservicemembers and veterans by offering special discounts on goods and \nservices to those who have served our Nation in uniform.\n  Unfortunately, unless a servicemember is a qualified military \nretiree, DOD does not issue an official ID card as proof of service. \nThat means that millions of veterans cannot easily provide evidence of \ntheir service.\n  This bill, as amended, would change that by directing the Secretary \nof Veterans Affairs to issue a veteran's ID card that would display the \nveteran's name and photograph to any veteran who requests such a card, \nas long as the veteran is not entitled to military retired pay, nor \nenrolled in the VA healthcare system.\n  This card would give those who served in the Armed Forces a \nconvenient way to prove that they are veterans, for the purpose of \nreceiving the\n\n[[Page H4782]]\n\npromotions and discounts offered by many businesses around the country.\n  The bill, as amended, would also require the Secretary to determine a \nfee to be charged that would cover all costs of producing the cards and \nmanaging the program. The bill also specifies that the card does not \nentitle the holder to any VA benefits.\n  H.R. 91 passed the House by a vote of 402-0 on May 18. The Senate \npassed it by unanimous consent on June 22, with an amendment that would \nauthorize VA to provide this card to any person who meets the statutory \ndefinition of a veteran.\n  Under current law, a veteran is defined as ``a person who served in \nthe active military, naval, or air service and who was discharged or \nreleased therefrom under conditions other than dishonorable.''\n  I thank my colleague Mr. Buchanan for his efforts on this commonsense \nlegislation.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 91 passed the House 402-0, as my good friend mentioned, in May. \nIt was amended by the Senate and passed 2 weeks ago. Today, we are \ntaking up the Senate amendment to H.R. 91. This measure will assist \nveterans in proving that they are indeed veterans.\n  In most instances, a veteran must be enrolled with the VA to receive \na VA ID card or utilize their DD-214 to prove their military service, \nwhich may contain personal health information.\n  Veterans who retire from the armed services are issued a Department \nof Defense ID card that serves this purpose. However, the majority of \nservicemembers do not retire in service, leaving millions of veterans \nsometimes challenged to provide proof of their honorable military \nservice.\n  Extending the option of a veterans ID is a simple way to resolve this \nissue and honor America's veterans.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Buchanan).\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Madam Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, today is a good day for our Nation's veterans.\n  My legislation will allow all veterans to receive official ID cards \nthrough the VA. No longer will veterans be forced to carry around \ndocuments that contain sensitive information that puts them at needless \nrisk of identity theft, and it does all this at no cost to the \ntaxpayer.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill is a prime example of what can be \naccomplished when we put partisanship aside and the needs of our \ncountry first.\n  Thank you, and God bless our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Madam Speaker, I join Vietnam Veterans of America, the \nAssociation of the U.S. Navy, American Veterans, and others in \nwholehearted support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 91, the Veterans \nI.D. Card Act of 2015.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1531, introduced by \nour colleague from Virginia (Mr. Connolly). The Land Management \nWorkforce Flexibility Act allows certain temporary workers to compete \nfor full-time positions when vacancies arise.\n  Many of the Federal Government's firefighters work on a temporary \nbasis and gain valuable experience as they return year after year to \nbattle Western wildfires. Current law prevents these experienced \nemployees from competing for full-time jobs under internal merit \npromotion procedures.\n  This commonsense bill will allow Federal land agencies to fully \nconsider the applications of experienced workers when they identify the \nneed for a full-time employee.\n  Covered agencies include the Forest Service, the Bureau of Land \nManagement, the National Park Service, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService, the Bureau of Indian Affairs, and the Bureau of Reclamation.\n  The bill does not change the total number of Federal jobs available \nor the salaries paid to Federal employees; rather, it expands the pool \nof individuals eligible for Federal land management positions.\n  Of course, the bill does impose a few conditions to be eligible to \ncompete for a full-time position, including length of service and \nadherence to performance standards.\n  I urge support for this bipartisan legislation, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank my friend from Georgia (Mr. Carter) for being here today on \nthe floor.\n  Madam Speaker, obviously, I rise in strong support of our bipartisan \nLand Management Workforce Flexibility Act. I want to take a moment to \nrecognize our colleagues, Congressman Don Young of Alaska and \nCongressman Rob Bishop of Utah, two of this Chamber's most dedicated \nadvocates for the men and women who comprise America's hard-working \ntemporary civil service, particularly our Nation's courageous temporary \nseasonal wildland firefighters.\n  It was an honor to join my esteemed colleagues, who have each served \nas chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, to develop and \nintroduce this good government legislation. The spirit of \nbipartisanship that went into creating it is reflected in the equal \nnumber of Democratic and Republican cosponsors.\n  Further, I was pleased that the entire Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform joined us in unanimously supporting this much-needed \nreform to remove arbitrary barriers that prevent talented, long-term \ntemporary seasonal employees from just competing for vacant permanent \npositions, as my friend from Georgia described.\n  As the committee noted favorably in reporting the bill, our \nlegislation will improve government effectiveness by enhancing the \nquality of the pool of applicants for Federal positions.\n  Our commonsense legislation provides long-serving, temporary seasonal \nwildland firefighters and other seasonal employees with the same career \nadvancement opportunities available to all other Federal employees.\n  Specifically, the Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act \nauthorizes qualifying land management agency employees serving under \ntime-limited appointments to compete for vacant permanent positions \nunder internal merit promotion procedures, just as any permanent \nFederal employee is eligible to do.\n  Our bill is deficit neutral, as my friend from Georgia indicated, \nbecause it only strengthens the pool of individuals eligible to compete \nfor vacant Federal permanent positions. It does not create new \npositions.\n  As the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office noted, ``CBO estimates \nthat implementing the legislation would have no significant effect on \nthe Federal budget. Enacting the bill would not affect direct spending \nor revenues because our bipartisan bill would,'' to quote CBO, ``not \nchange the total number of Federal jobs available.''\n  As many of my colleagues understand, particularly those Members who \nrepresent Western constituencies in America, many Federal land \nmanagement employees, including wildland firefighters, are often hired \nunder temporary appointments that amount to less than 6 months or 1,040 \nhours. These individuals, so often called temporary appointments, \nrepeatedly are extended on an annual basis.\n  As Congressman Stephen Lynch, my friend from Massachusetts, the \nformer chairman of the Federal Workforce Subcommittee, observed at a \n2010 hearing: ``Oftentimes, seasonal temporary employees have worked in \nthe same capacity year after year, decade after decade.''\n  Despite those years of service and putting themselves often in harm's \nway, career advancement and opportunities are severely limited. It is \ndifficult to overstate the adverse impact the unfair policy of \nprecluding their ability to compete for the same jobs as full-time \nFederal employees has on Americans serving under term-limited \nappointments since many agencies utilize merit promotion to \ncompetitively fill nonentry-level jobs.\n  Indeed, bipartisan concerns have been raised over a status quo where, \nno matter how long an individual may serve under a term-limited \nappointment, even one that is originally obtained under open, \ncompetitive examination, he or she never can acquire the status that \nwould enable him or her to compete for vacant permanent positions.\n  For example, a former chairman of the House Civil Service \nSubcommittee addressed the illogical inequity of this position at a \n1993 hearing, stating:\n\n       Furthermore, there needs to be better access for all \n     temporary employees, not just term employees, to apply for \n     permanent positions within the Federal Government. It is \n     simply unfair that, after years of employment, a temporary \n     employee applying for a permanent position job is no better \n     off than someone off the street applying for a job. Agencies \n     could save large sums of money on education and training by \n     hiring more temporary employees for permanent positions.\n\n  At the same hearing, former Congressman Dan Burton submitted a \nstatement for the Record, expressing the view: ``One of the best things \nwe can do for temporary employees is to increase their opportunities to \ncompete for permanent positions.''\n  The current barrier to competition placed on our Nation's temporary \nseasonal employees demoralizes the dedicated and courageous corps of \ntemporary civil servants that serve in land management agencies, and it \ncontributes to increased attrition and, ultimately, leads to higher \ntraining costs and a less-experienced and capable workforce.\n  As the devastating 2014 California wildfires demonstrated, our \ncountry cannot afford to degrade its wildland firefighting and \nemergency response capabilities that put themselves in harm's way. Our \nbipartisan bill is consistent with the Office of Personnel Management's \nsupport for the concept.\n  In closing, I strongly urge all my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan Land Management Workforce Flexibility Act.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1531.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4782-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4782-H4783]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               LAND MANAGEMENT WORKFORCE FLEXIBILITY ACT\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 77, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000)(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, this amendment takes $1 million out of \nthe Forest Service land acquisition account and then, for technical \nreasons, inserts it back into the same account with the intent to \nidentify unused land for potential sale.\n  The United States Federal Government currently owns around 640 \nmillion acres of land. That is just a number. But that is 27 percent of \nthe landmass in the United States, owned by Uncle Sam. That is the same \nsize as all of Western Europe, if you can imagine that, that being 27 \npercent of the United States landmass. The Forest Service alone owns \nover 230 million acres of this Federal land.\n  This amendment is very simple. All it does is to have the Federal \nGovernment examine the land that it has in its possession for the \npotential sale back to Americans so that Americans can own America.\n  We are not talking about National Forests. We are not talking about \nthe Grand Canyon. We are talking about unused land that is owned by the \nFederal Government.\n  It will have the Federal Government go through that land--27 percent \nof the landmass in the country--and decide whether some of that might \nactually be better to be in the possession and the property of \nAmericans so that, if Americans then own the land, that land in some \nState--like Utah--can then be developed by Americans, and then those \npeople can pay taxes on the land that would go to the State of Utah, \nfor example. Right now the land is unused. It is not able to be \nproductive.\n  So that is what this amendment would do: have the Forest Service \nstudy the possibility of selling some of that unused land back to the \nUnited States.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 79, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000) (decreased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Chair, we still see approximately 3,000 deaths, \n17,000 injuries, and $3 billion spent annually as a result of wildfires \nacross the country.\n  In many ways, wildfires lack parity with nearly every other natural \ndisaster and are hugely underfunded when it comes to mitigation, \nprevention, and suppression.\n  Despite the fact the fires often occur in rural communities with \nsmaller populations, wildfires demand intensive resources, equipment, \nand infrastructure.\n  The Volunteer Fire Assistance grant program is critical to moving the \nneedle on wildfire management and supporting the men and women who \nserve in our volunteer fire agencies, including in my district in \nColorado. Though this grant program is small and oriented towards \nlesser trafficked communities, its impact is incredible.\n  The Volunteer Fire Assistance program provides matching funds to \nvolunteer fire departments protecting communities with 10,000 or fewer \nresidents to purchase equipment and training for use in wildland fire \nsuppression.\n  Volunteer fire departments provide nearly 80 percent of the initial \nattack on wildfires across the United States, but, unfortunately, these \nvolunteer fire departments frequently lack the financial resources. And \n$1 million makes an enormous difference for our volunteer fire \ndepartments across the country.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, Federal funding for volunteer fire \ndepartments to prepare for wildland fire suppression has dwindled. VFA \nhas seen funding reduced from $16 million in FY 2010 to $15.6 million \nin 2011 and approximately $13 million in FY 2012-2015.\n  Additionally, the Rural Fire Assistance program, which has \nhistorically been funded at $7 to $10 million per year and provided \nmatching grants to fire departments that agreed to assist in responding \nto wildland fires on Federal lands, hasn't been funded since FY 2010.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Chair, Federal support is critical to ensure \nvolunteer fire departments are able to safely and effectively respond \nto wildland fires.\n  The bipartisan amendment I offer today with my colleagues, \nRepresentatives Ruiz of California and Peter King of New York, would \nhelp ensure that we have stronger support for our volunteer fire \ndepartments across our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that has been \nsupported by the Congressional Fire Service Institute, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, and National Volunteer Fire \nCouncil.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 416.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, the overwhelming scientific consensus is \nthat climate change is real. Leaders of the communities of faith, such \nas His Holiness the Pope, are now urging us to take this issue very \nseriously.\n  No matter how often the fossil fuel industry whispers that we have \nnothing to worry about, no matter how much manufactured science they \ngin up to create doubt, climate change is real.\n  We should have begun assessing the costs of climate change decades \nago, but we did not. The legislation before us today would require a \nreport on climate change expenditures. But the purpose of this section \nis not to assess the impacts of climate change; the purpose is to root \nout climate funding in the budget, so that next year's Interior bill \ncan prohibit that spending.\n  Madam Chair, the report requirement as written is not only pointless, \nit is counterproductive. The Obama administration is open about \nresponding to climate change. Most of their climate expenditures are \nclearly labeled and can be discovered by simply reading their budget \nrequest. For the remainder, I would be happy to write the President \nasking him to list these programs, and I suspect he would be pleased to \nanswer.\n  As written, this reporting requirement is a waste of time. We should \nbe instead asking the administration to report back to us on the costs \nof climate change to our health, our environment, and our economy.\n  Earlier this week, the White House issued a report showing that its \nefforts to reduce air pollution and climate change--efforts opposed by \nHouse Republicans, I might add--would provide billions of dollars in \nhealth benefits and save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  A report also out this week from the National Park Service showed \nthat $90 billion of National Park resources are at risk from sea level \nrise caused by global warming, and we all know about the historic \ndrought in California and the lingering costs of recovery from \nSuperstorm Sandy.\n  A full assessment of all the costs of inaction would help inform the \nCongress and the American people about what steps we must take \nimmediately to ensure that climate change does not bring our country to \nits knees. Unfortunately, this bill does not ask for that assessment.\n  Instead, Madam Chair, the section my amendment would strike would \nundertake some kind of witch hunt to root out the meager funding we \nhave in place to respond to this challenge. To support this section is \nto deny climate change.\n  I would tell my colleagues, all the constituent services you provide, \nall the money you can raise, the votes you cast, and the laws you pass \nwill amount to nothing if you are on the wrong side of history on \nclimate change. Climate deniers will join a long list of political \nfigures who failed to respond to the most serious challenge of their \ntime and so are labeled as failures for all time.\n  Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment to strike the \nreporting language in the bill, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, this provision shouldn't be controversial. \nThe language has been included in our enacted bills on a bipartisan \nbasis since 2010. The language simply requires that programs and \nactivities dedicated to climate change are reported in a transparent \nway so the American people know what we are spending their tax dollars \non.\n  With so many climate change programs being initiated, it is important \nto know what is being done across the government to avoid redundancy, \nand there is certainly a significant amount of redundancy in some of \nthese climate change studies. It is in the bill so the committee can \nhave the information it needs to provide critical oversight.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                      prohibition on use of funds\n\n       Sec. 417.

Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 422.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould strike section 422 from the underlying bill. In doing so, this \namendment would allow the EPA and the Army to implement the waters of \nthe United States rule. This rule will ensure protection for the \nNation's public health and aquatic resources and will clarify the scope \nof the waters of the United States protected under this law.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans continue to undermine efforts to protect \nthe Great Lakes as well as other critical water bodies around the \nNation. We cannot afford to delay years of work by the EPA and the Army \nCorps of Engineers that would enhance the protection of our Nation's \naquatic resources and public health.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, it comes as no surprise that I rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  In 2006, the Supreme Court determined the EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers did not have the authority to regulate nonnavigable waters \nunder the Clean Water Act.\n  I am certain the EPA's final rule violates that. From day one, the \nEPA claimed that they were not expanding the waters under their \njurisdiction, but we now know that those permits will be required and \nthat the final rule is worse than proposed.\n  Twenty-seven States have now filed lawsuits challenging the legality \nof EPA's rule, so the Agency again finds itself on shaky legal ground, \nboth on process and substance.\n  The language in the bill protects the authority of the States by \npreventing the EPA from implementing its regulation and expanding its \njurisdiction. The language needs to stay in, so I urge a ``no'' vote on \nthe amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. \nSimpson).\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The language is in there for a very good reason. Everybody assumes \nthat the waters are not covered under the Clean Water Act, that being \nthe navigable waters. That is a definition they came up with somehow--I \ndon't know--but that they are unregulated waters.\n  They are not unregulated waters. They are regulated by the States. \nWhen the court said, ``Navigable waters is kind of an elusive term, so \nmaybe you ought to redefine it,'' the EPA said, ``Okay, we will just \nregulate all the waters,'' and that is what they did with this. They \nhave gone way beyond whatever the intent of the Clean Water Act was.\n  I will tell you most resource groups, most agricultural groups, \neverybody else disagrees with what the EPA has done on this new rule \nthat they are writing. The fact that they have expanded their authority \ninto areas far beyond what was intended in the Clean Water Act, I \nthink, goes beyond the pale and goes beyond what Congress originally \nintended under the Clean Water Act.\n  We are not talking about leaving waters unregulated; they are just \nbeing regulated by the States, and they need to start over in writing \nthis rule.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, can you tell me how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum), my colleague.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague.\n  I rise to support the Lawrence amendment to strike the section \nprohibiting the new rule on the Federal jurisdiction of the waters of \nthe United States.\n  A few weeks ago, the Obama administration issued a final rule that \nclarifies the limits of Federal authority under the Clean Water Act. It \ndoes this by reducing red tape and providing more certainty for the \nregulated community.\n  Instead of confusion in case-by-case determinations about where \nwaters are covered, the rule says physical, measurable boundaries for \nthe first time about where clean water coverage begins and ends.\n  The rule does not expand the waters covered. In fact, it will \nactually reduce the scope of waters protected by the Clean Water Act.\n  Additionally, the rule does not create any new permitting \nrequirements for agriculture. It maintains all previous exemptions and \nexclusions.\n  The rule ensures that the waters protected under the Clean Water Act \nare more precisely defined and predictably measured, making permitting \nless costly, easier, and faster for business and industry.\n  Prohibiting the EPA from implementing the rule will only perpetrate \nconfusion in the jurisdiction of the water.\n  This harmful rider should be struck; therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto support the Lawrence amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment \nas it seeks to strip a commonsense provision included in the base bill \nthat will protect the American people from the EPA's new waters of the \nU.S. regulation, commonly referred to as WOTUS.\n  WOTUS is a terrible Agency proposal that will have disastrous effects \nand economic consequences for agriculture, small business, property \nowners, municipalities, and other water users throughout the country.\n  This job-killing, overreaching water grab being imposed by Washington \nbureaucrats is a dream killer for future generations and local \neconomies. The EPA claims this new regulation was\n\n[[Page H4792]]\n\nshaped by public input; yet we recently learned that the EPA used \ntaxpayer dollars to unleash a propaganda campaign in an attempt to \nrally comments and support for this WOTUS regulation, despite the Anti-\nLobbying Act which bans such actions.\n  Furthermore, States and local governments that have traditionally \nmanaged these waterways and activities were not included in drafting \nthe WOTUS regulation. The Agency failed to comply with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act as required by Federal law and consider the new impact \nthat the WOTUS regulations would have on small businesses.\n  The EPA claims this rule is grounded in law; yet this overreaching \nregulation contradicts prior Supreme Court decisions by expanding \nAgency control over 60 percent of our country's streams and millions of \nacres of wetlands that were previously nonjurisdictional.\n  Despite claiming the WOTUS rule reduces Agency jurisdiction, the \nfinal regulation imposes new regulations for navigable waters and their \ntributaries, potholes, ditches, bays, and even waters that are next to \nrivers and lakes.\n  The new WOTUS regulation has been built on a foundation of \npseudoscience, deception, and lawlessness. This overreach is so extreme \nthat 24 Members of the President's own party joined Members in the \nHouse in passing legislation in May calling for the formal withdrawal \nof the new WOTUS regulation.\n  For these reasons and more, I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's \namendment and urge its defeat.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I would really urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The rule does not create any new permitting requirements for the \nagriculture and maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions. The \nrule ensures that waters protected under the Clean Water Act are more \nprecisely defined and particularly determine making permitting less \ncostly, easier, and faster for business and industry.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Madam Chair, I think the American public must be quite \nconfused about what we are currently debating in this Chamber.\n  The amendment I rise in strong support of strikes section 422 which \nprevents funds from being used to ``develop, adopt, implement, \nadminister or enforce any change . . . pertaining to the definition of \nwaters under the jurisdiction'' of the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n  I would like to remind the other side that, thanks to the Clean Water \nAct, billions of pounds of pollution have been kept out of our rivers, \nand the number of waters that now meet clean water goals nationwide has \nactually doubled with direct benefits for drinking water, public \nhealth, recreation, and wildlife.\n  This is especially true for my home State of Maryland that is within \nthe six-State Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is fed by 110,000 miles of creeks, \nrivers, and streams; covers 64,000 square miles; includes over 11,500 \nmiles of shorelines; contains 150 major rivers and streams; and is home \nto over 17 million people.\n  And this watershed's land-to-water ratio is 14-1, the largest of any \ncoastal water body in the world.\n  Several of its tributaries, including the Anacostia, the Patuxent, \nPotomac, and Severn Rivers flow through the Fourth Congressional \nDistrict. 70 percent of Marylanders get our drinking water from sources \nthat rely on headwater or seasonal streams.\n  Nationwide, 117 million people, or over a third of the total \npopulation, get our water from these waters.\n  However, due to the two Supreme Court decisions, there is, in fact, \nwidespread confusion as to what falls under the protection of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  That is precisely why the Obama administration finalized their rule \nclarifying the limits of Federal jurisdiction under the Act on May 27, \n2015.\n  The agencies finalized the clean water protection rule after over a \nyear of public outreach on their then proposed rule at a scale \nunprecedented in the history of the Clean Water Act, as well as \ncountless congressional hearings.\n  Madam Chair, supporters of this provision have complained about the \nconfusion in the litigation.\n  That is precisely why we needed to get through the final rulemaking, \nwhich has been years in the making.\n  That is what the Supreme Court instructed the Federal Government to \ndo 14 years ago with the 2001 SWANCC decision and, subsequently, the \n2006 Rapanos case.\n  Along with those Supreme Court decisions, the Bush administration \nfollowed the exact same process in issuing two guidance documents in \n2003 and 2008.\n  Up until the final rule issued just over a month ago, they remained \nin force.\n  It is, in fact, these two Bush-era guidance documents that have \ncompounded the confusion, uncertainty, and increased compliance costs \nfaced by our constituents--opponents and proponents alike--who all just \nsay they want clarity.\n  You don't actually have to take my word for it.\n  In fact, let me quote from the comments made by the American Farm \nBureau Federation, something I don't do all that often: ``With no clear \nregulatory definitions to guide their determinations, what has emerged \nis a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories.''\n  Those are the words of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  We all agree that it is confusing.\n  That is why it was so important that this administration finish what \nthe Bush administration started and failed to do, and that is publish a \nfinal rule that gives stakeholders the clarity they have been seeking \nfor 14 years.\n  Madam Chair, despite nearly universal calls for increased clarity and \ncertainty from certain stakeholders, my colleagues have made it a \npriority to prohibit the implementation of the final clean water \nrulemaking entirely.\n  It is really clear that what they want to do is stop these agencies \nfrom doing their jobs at all--no new rules and no clean water, what a \nshame for our natural resources, our public health, and our \nenvironment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Quigley-Edwards amendment to \nstrike this harmful and shameful provision.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             stream buffer\n\n       Sec. 423.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to develop, carry out, or implement (1) any guidance, \n     policy, or directive to reinterpret or change the historic \n     interpretation of 30 C.F.R. 816.57, which was promulgated on \n     June 30, 1983 by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \n     Enforcement of the Department of the Interior (48 Fed. Reg. \n     30312); or (2) proposed regulations or supporting materials \n     described in the Federal Register notice published on June \n     18, 2010 (75 Fed. Reg. 34667) by the Office of Surface Mining \n     Reclamation and Enforcement of the Department of the \n     Interior.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       Beginning at page 122, line 23, strike section 423.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, my amendment would allow the Office of \nSurface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to continue to develop \nregulations designed to protect communities and the environment from \nthe devastating effects of mountaintop removal mining.\n  If you have seen a picture of a mountaintop removal mining site, you \nget an idea of how destructive this process is. Companies literally \nblast the tops off of mountains, scoop out the coal, and dump what used \nto be the mountaintop into the valley below. The scars on the landscape \nare unmistakable, as are the piles of rock filling in what used to be \nmountain valleys and streams.\n  What you don't see in the picture is the health impacts on the people \nliving nearby, although those are just as real and just as terrible. \nPeople who live near mountaintop mining sites have higher rates of lung \ncancer, heart disease, kidney disease, birth defects, hypertension, and \nother health related problems.\n  Despite some confusion in the Natural Resources Committee just last \nmonth, these results are statistically corrected for rates of smoking, \nobesity, and other factors.\n  A paper in the journal Science a few years ago, one of the preeminent \nscientific journals in the world, pointed\n\n[[Page H4793]]\n\nout that mountaintop removal mining with valley fills ``revealed \nserious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot \nsuccessfully address,'' that ``water emerges from the base of valley \nfills containing a variety of solutes toxic and damaging to biota,'' \nand ``recovery of biodiversity in mining waste-impacted streams has not \nbeen documented.''\n  Under our laws governing surface coal mining, streams are supposed to \nbe protected; but the existing regulations, which are over 30 years \nold, have done a poor job of doing just that. Over 2,000 miles of \nstreams have been buried by mountaintop removal mining, and countless \nmore have been polluted by toxic mine runoff. Wildlife habitat is \ndestroyed; fish are killed, and the people in the area suffer.\n  That is why the administration has been working for years on a new \nrule that would do a better job of protecting streams. It has taken \nlonger than I would like for them to propose this rule, and the process \nhas certainly not gone as smoothly as it could have.\n  The majority uses the snags in the process to argue that there \nshouldn't be a rule at all. Never mind that their own partisan \ninvestigation delayed this rule for years without uncovering any \nevidence of political misconduct.\n  The majority also claims that this rule will cause huge job losses, \nbut the draft rule hasn't even been published yet, so we can't possibly \nknow the impacts, and the Director of the Office of Surface Mining says \nthe job losses will be minor at best.\n  Even if the majority does not believe him--and I suspect they might \nnot--they should wait until the draft rule comes out and there can be \nindependent analysis of the impacts, not just wild exaggerations that \nthe mining industry will produce, but real, independent analysis.\n  If they are still not happy with the rule at that point, we can hold \nhearings. We can try to pass constructive laws that protect the \nenvironment and human health and workers all at the same time.\n  A partisan rider in this bill that completely stops the ability of \nthe administration to work on this stream buffer rule to provide badly \nneeded protections to Appalachian communities is the wrong way to go.\n  It has nothing to do with managing spending. In fact, it would just \nresult in the waste of all the money that was required to get to this \nvery point.\n  The rider is bad policy; it is bad for the environment, and it is bad \nfor public health and the health of the people living near these mines.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that would allow the \nstream protection rule to see the light of day.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, in 2008, the Office of Surface Mining \nfinalized revisions to the stream zone buffer rule in an open and \ntransparent manner. After taking office, the Obama administration put a \nhold on the rule and is currently writing a new rule.\n  The administration's approach under the new rule has been anything \nbut collaborative and inclusive, and many States feel they have been \nshut out of the process. When Chairman Rogers required advanced \nanalysis on job impacts, his request was ignored.\n  The American people expect more openness and transparency from their \ngovernment, and that is why this funding prohibition must remain in the \nbase bill.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and reject this \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n      hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal land\n\n       Sec. 424. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the \n     funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal \n     year may be used to prohibit the use of or access to Federal \n     land (as such term is defined in section 3 of the Healthy \n     Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6502)) for \n     hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting if such use or \n     access--\n       (1) was not prohibited on such Federal land as of January \n     1, 2013; and\n       (2) was conducted in compliance with the resource \n     management plan (as defined in section 101 of such Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 6511)) applicable to such Federal land as of January \n     1, 2013.\n       (b) Temporary Closures Allowed.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of \n     Agriculture may temporarily close, for a period not to exceed \n     30 days, Federal land managed by the Secretary to hunting, \n     fishing, or recreational shooting if the Secretary determines \n     that the temporary closure is necessary to accommodate a \n     special event or for public safety reasons. The Secretary may \n     extend a temporary closure for one additional 90-day period \n     only if the Secretary determines the extension is necessary \n     because of extraordinary weather conditions or for public \n     safety reasons.\n       (c) Authority of States.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as affecting the authority, jurisdiction, or \n     responsibility of the several States to manage, control, or \n     regulate fish and resident wildlife under State law or \n     regulations.\n\n          limitation on use of funds for national ocean policy\n\n       Sec. 425.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to further implementation of the coastal and marine \n     spatial planning and ecosystem-based management components of \n     the National Ocean Policy developed under Executive Order \n     13547.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Tsongas\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 124, line 17, strike section 425.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, nearly 3 years ago, Superstorm Sandy caught \nmillions of coastal residents by surprise and cost billions of dollars \nin economic damage. Unfortunately, the weather is not all that has \nbecome more extreme over the past several years.\n  I am disappointed that this misguided and misinformed language to \nblock implementation of the National Ocean Policy keeps coming back, \njust like the recurrent coastal flooding being caused by sea level \nrise, and my amendment would strike that language.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  It shows a lack of respect for science and a lack of appreciation for \nthe magnitude and complexity of the governance challenges we face.\n  It seems some Members of Congress do not want to see government \nsucceed even when government's failure to respond to a disaster, to \npredict a drought, or to properly manage a fishery can devastate the \ncommunities they represent.\n  When you disavow words like ``precaution,'' ``preparedness,'' and \n``planning,'' you stop being conservative and start being reckless.\n  Conservatives always say they want to run government like a business. \nWell, would you invest in a business with different departments that \ndon't talk to each other? Would you invest in a business that is not \nresponsive to its shareholders? Would you invest in a business with no \nbusiness plan?\n  That is essentially what the National Ocean Policy is, a business \nplan for the oceans that seeks to maximize the benefits for \nshareholders, all the American people.\n  The policy is a win-win-win for economic growth, public safety, and \nenvironmental protection. I urge you to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to \nprotect the National Ocean Policy.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have operated a business. Ever since this \nadministration created the National Ocean Policy through executive \norder,\n\n[[Page H4794]]\n\nthe subcommittee has asked the CEQ, the DOI, and the EPA to provide an \nestimate of the impact of the Policy on their budgets, and we have yet \nto receive a substantial answer.\n  The so-called report we were provided last year was fewer than three \npages long. Clearly, this failed to outline expenditures supporting the \nadministration's National Ocean Policy.\n  Our job here is to pay the bills. When we ask how much does the \nNational Ocean Policy cost, we expect to get an answer. We need an \nanswer so that proper congressional oversight can be conducted.\n  I want to point out that this language was included in the House \nfiscal year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. There are \nconcerns about the costs and all of the unknowns related to this policy \nin multiple jurisdictions.\n  The bottom line is, if this administration wants the funds to \nimplement the National Ocean Policy, then tell us how much it is going \nto cost the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum), my colleague.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Madam Chair, Congress has enacted numerous laws that manage the ocean \nand coastal issues across 11 of the 15 Cabinet-level departments and \nfour independent agencies across the Federal Government. As my \ncolleague from Massachusetts pointed out, why wouldn't we want these \nfolks to be working together?\n  Clearly, what the President is trying to do is to just have an action \nthat lets the independent bipartisan commission move forward, including \nthe U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which was appointed entirely by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  The National Ocean Policy is a means by which the Federal agencies \ncan sort through all of the tangles of uncoordinated governance and can \nbring some common sense to the chaos. Wouldn't we want that?\n  If my colleagues have a problem with what government can do on ocean \nmanagement, then they have a problem with laws that are enacted by \nCongress, not with the National Ocean Policy or with the President's \nexecutive order, because what the President is doing through the \nNational Ocean Policy is following a well-established Presidential \ntradition of using an executive order to supervise and guide agencies \nunder the President's charge as they execute existing laws passed by \nCongress.\n  Let us let this agency get to work. Let us find out how we could be \nmore effective with our agencies working together.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert for his work on this bill.\n  Madam Chair, I want to set the record straight. In the year 2000, \nCongress did pass a bill during the 106th Congress to create an ocean \ncommission to review and to make recommendations.\n  Yes, President Bush did appoint persons to that commission. They did \nmake those recommendations, and those recommendations were submitted to \nCongress.\n  Since then, those recommendations have been reviewed by the 108th, \nthe 109th, the 110th, and the 111th Congresses, and each of those \nCongresses decided that no action should be taken.\n  What happened here is the President decided to go into the Article I \npowers, which are reserved for Congress, and to do what Congress does \nnot intend to have done, which is to have an ocean zoning commission \nbuilt from dozens of agencies.\n  They have never asked for an appropriations for this activity, and \nthere is no lawful basis for the activity to exist. The President's \nexecutive order is basically violating the statutes that have been \npassed by Congress, and it is also violating the Constitution.\n  The language that is in the appropriations bill should remain as it \nis. Congress has voted seven times on this language, and it has passed \nall seven times on a bipartisan basis. The other side is that of \nbasically trying to undo what Congress has said it wants to do seven \ntimes on a bipartisan basis.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer), my colleague.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which \nwould allow for the implementation of the National Ocean Policy.\n  Plain and simple, coordinated ocean planning makes common sense and \nis a good economic policy for our coastal communities. It allows for a \ncomprehensive mapping of existing ocean uses that helps to identify and \nresolve conflicts between stakeholders before they play out in specific \npermitting processes.\n  In Virginia, this process has been crucial to preserving public \naccess to the ocean, to sustain economic growth, to address marine \ndebris, to create migration corridors for marine mammals, and to \nsupport promising new ocean industries, such as wind power and marine \naquaculture.\n  In fact, I am proud to note that Virginia was recently selected by \nBOEM to be the first State in the Nation to receive a wind energy \nresearch lease in Federal waters. This rider would eliminate language \nthat would undermine regional collaborative efforts to manage existing \nand future ocean policy challenges.\n  Let's not roll back the valuable work and resources that many States, \nindustries, and communities have already devoted to implementing this \npolicy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert.\n  Madam Chair, again, I want to set the record straight. We are not \nagainst ocean planning, as it makes perfect sense, but only insofar as \nCongress has explicitly authorized those activities.\n  Congress has not allowed the President to do what he is trying to do \nby executive fiat. There are 67 groups, which include fishing, \nagricultural, farming, energy, and other industries, that are concerned \nabout the impact of this Federal overreach. Again, it is an \nunconstitutional Federal overreach, and I would urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I do appreciate that my colleague across \nthe aisle has said that it does make perfect sense to have an ocean \npolicy. The ocean policy is a business plan for the oceans that seeks \nto maximize the benefits for all of its shareholders, the American \npeople.\n  I certainly know that we in Massachusetts have a great appreciation \nfor the complex task it seeks to undertake in order to protect that \nwhich we value most, the ocean off our coast.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                             lead test kit\n\n       Sec. 426.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 429.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.\n  The amendment strikes a rider that would prevent the Environmental \nProtection Agency from updating regulations pertaining to the \ndefinitions of the terms ``fill material'' or ``discharge of fill \nmaterial'' for purposes of the Clean Water Act.\n  Presently, the Army Corps of Engineers issues a section 404 permit if \nthe fill material discharged into a water body raises the bottom \nelevation of that water body or converts the area to dry land.\n  The current rule allows mining waste to be dumped into the rivers and \nstreams without an appropriate environmental review process.\n  Given repeated instances of mining activities resulting in lakes and \nstreams devoid of fish or aquatic life, downstream water users are \nrightly concerned that the section 404 process fails to protect them \nfrom the discharge of hazardous substances.\n  The Clean Water Act section 404 guidelines are not well suited for \nevaluating the environmental effects of discharging hazardous waste, \nsuch as mining refuse and similar materials, into a water body or a \nwetland.\n  The rider that this amendment strikes would block the EPA from making \nnecessary modifications to these guidelines. This rider is a preemptive \nstrike against protecting our drinking water, and it allows mining \ncompanies' interests to trump the protection of the health of our \ncitizens.\n  We should not short-circuit regular order through the appropriations \nprocess. We should not preclude the Corps or the EPA from considering \nany regulatory changes to the current definition and permit process. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike this language \nfrom the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, this language simply maintains the status \nquo regarding the definition of ``fill material'' for the purposes of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  The existing definition was put in place through a rule-making \ninitiated by the Clinton administration and finalized by the Bush \nadministration. That rule harmonized the definitions on the books of \nthe Corps and the EPA so that both agencies were working with the same \ndefinition.\n  Any attempts to redefine this important definition could \nsignificantly negatively impact the ability of all earth-moving \nindustries, road and highway construction, and private and commercial \nenterprises to obtain vital Clean Water Act section 404 permits.\n  Changing the definition of ``fill material'' could result in the loss \nof up to 375,000 high-paying mining jobs and jeopardize over 1 million \njobs that are dependent upon the economic output generated by these \noperations.\n  For these reasons, I support the underlying language and oppose this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I respect the chairman's objections to this, \nbut I would like to point out that all that this amendment does in \nstriking the section is allow the EPA to consider future changes to the \n``fill'' definitions.\n  Clearly, the work begun in the Clinton administration and finalized \nin the George W. Bush administration were the best possible actions at \nthe time.\n  In the meantime, we have discovered that, unfortunately, much mining \nwaste and refuse are ending up in mining streams and rivers, and it has \nseverely affected the health of those people.\n  We are not attempting to eliminate mining jobs or to even impact \nearth moving. It is only reasonable to make sure that our Environmental \nProtection Agency has the latitude and the freedom to evolve future \ndefinitions so as to best protect the health of our citizens.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. I oppose this amendment. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                        contracting authorities\n\n       Sec. 430.  Section 412 of division E of Public Law 112-74 \n     is amended by striking ``fiscal year 2015,'' and inserting \n     ``fiscal year 2017,''.\n\n                       chesapeake bay initiative\n\n       Sec. 431.  Section 502(c) of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative \n     Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-312; 16 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     amended by striking ``2015'' and inserting ``2017''.\n\n                      extension of grazing permits\n\n       Sec. 432.  The terms and conditions of section 325 of \n     Public Law 108-108 (117 Stat. 1307), regarding grazing \n     permits issued by the Forest Service on any lands not subject \n     to administration under section 402 of the Federal Lands \n     Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1752), shall remain in \n     effect for fiscal year 2016.\n\n               availability of vacant grazing allotments\n\n       Sec. 433.  The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to \n     public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to the \n     National Forest System lands, shall make vacant grazing \n     allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease \n     issued by either Secretary if the lands covered by the permit \n     or lease or other grazing lands used by the holder of the \n     permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wildfire, \n     as determined by the Secretary concerned. The terms and \n     conditions contained in a permit or lease made available \n     pursuant to this section shall be the same as the terms and \n     conditions of the most recent permit or lease that was \n     applicable to the vacant grazing allotment made available. \n     Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4332) shall not apply with respect to any Federal \n     agency action under this section.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I offer an amendment to strike section \n433.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 433.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I offer my amendment to strike section 433 \nregarding the availability of vacant grazing allotments and waiving one \nof our key environmental laws.\n  While grazing on our public lands is an important part of our \nNation's culture and economy, this section of the appropriations bill \nis redundant and unnecessary. The BLM and Forest Service already have \nthe authority to transfer permits when grazing lands are deemed \nunusable.\n  Furthermore, this section would have the effect of waiving section \n102 of the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA is one of \nour Nation's bedrock environmental laws, serving to\n\n[[Page H4796]]\n\nestablish policies to protect our air, water, and our natural \nresources. Section 102 of NEPA contains key provisions to make sure \nthat Federal agencies act according to the spirit and letter of the \nlaw.\n  By stating that section 102 shall not apply to agency actions, this \nbill is, in essence, waiving NEPA and putting our public lands at risk. \nOur Federal agencies did not ask for a NEPA waiver, and Congress should \nnot be in the business of dictating to professional land managers when \nthey should or should not have the flexibility to use NEPA in making \nland management decisions.\n  Allowing section 433 to be included in the appropriations bill could \nhave unintended consequences for our public lands and environment, \nparticularly when conditions on the ground change. In this time of \nclimate change, drought, and wildfire, it is vital that agencies have \nthe tools and the flexibility to conduct adequate environmental \nreviews.\n  In the face of these challenges, why should grazers get to jump to \nthe front of the line for new land? What about land for species and \nrecovery and habitat that are displaced by climate change or \nrecreational demands and interests?\n  Congress has tasked the BLM with managing our public lands for \nmultiple uses. I welcome the belated recognition by my Republican \ncolleagues that climate change is impacting these lands, but this \nprovision would waive the balancing process found in NEPA and mandate \nthat grazing gets to trump other uses when lands are destroyed by fire \nor drought.\n  Section 433 benefits one special interest above all others, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting to strike this section from \nthe bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment. The amendment would strike a commonsense provision--repeat, \ncommonsense provision--in this bill that allows the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Forest Service to make available vacant grazing \nallotments when a rancher is forced off his or her existing allotment \ndue to drought or wildfire.\n  It is not that they jump to the front of the line and have special \nprovisions because of this. The fact is, if you don't exclude the NEPA \nprocess, it can take 3 months, 6 months--guess what? Cows and sheep \ndon't go on a diet for 3 months or 6 months. They actually need to put \nthese cows and sheep somewhere, and vacant allotments is what they look \nfor.\n  The gentleman says that this is redundant, that they can already do \nthat. Well, if they can already do it, then what the heck? Why is he \nopposed to this provision?\n  Unfortunately, drought and catastrophic wildfires are all too common \nin the West. Ranchers shouldn't be further penalized when they lose \ntheir allotments due to natural disasters. The provision provides some \nflexibility to the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service to help \nin these circumstances.\n  It doesn't say, ``You will provide these vacant allotments.'' It \nsays, ``You may.'' It is not a must. We are trying to give the Bureau \nof Land Management and the Forest Service the flexibility to use vacant \nallotments when circumstances are required.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Grijalva \namendment. As has been pointed out, BLM already has the authority to \nmake vacant grazing allotments available for permittees on a \ndiscretionary basis where the permittee is adversely impacted by \nwildfire or drought, but unlike the discretionary basis on which the \nBLM currently makes these allotments, this rider would exempt the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, a NEPA review.\n  On page 127, line 25, it reads ``with respect to'' the National \nForest System lands, ``shall''--not may--``shall make vacant,'' and so \nwhat the BLM currently can do is they can conduct a NEPA review in \nareas where they think they have concerns and they can ensure that the \nland, health standards, and resources are not going to be compromised \nbecause the BLM has a role to play in protecting these lands for \ngrazing potential in the future so that they are not harmed or \novergrazed.\n  To me, it makes common sense that the rider should not exempt the BLM \nfrom a regulatory requirement to issue a decision and conduct an \nadministrative review, which they currently can choose to do or choose \nnot to do based on the information that they have. Any grazing that is \nmandated by this rider is likely also to find itself caught up by \nhearings and delays and appeals and judicial review.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike the \nunnecessary rider and to leave the discretion in place so it continues \nto be the National Forest System lands may be made vacant.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I would ask my colleagues just one thing. \nIf you are a rancher and you have had one of these catastrophic \nwildfires come through--and they come through frequently, \nunfortunately--and they have wiped out your grazing allotment, what do \nyou tell your cows? What do you tell your sheep? What do they eat for \nthe next several months as you go through the NEPA process? This is \ngiving some flexibility to the Forest Service and to the BLM.\n  I know we can all say: Oh, gee, they can make arrangements and do it \notherwise and so forth.\n  This is just a commonsense provision, frankly, and we haven't had any \nproblem with it with the time that it has been in existence. I think it \nshould stay in existence, and that is why the chairman has included it \nin this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, the redundancy comes from the fact that \nthat flexibility has existed in BLM and Forest Service; it has existed \nfor years. The situations of wildfires have occurred, and they have \nbeen handled.\n  It is an unnecessary NEPA waiver. It is a redundant amendment, \naddition to it. The NEPA waiver in the writing says it is not optional. \nIt says ``shall.''\n  I urge Members to support my amendment striking section 433.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, this language has been in the bill since \n2003. It hasn't caused any problems. It has fed a lot of cows. I think \nit is a good provision in the bill, and we should defeat this \namendment. It is a bad amendment. Vote against it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       protection of water rights\n\n       Sec. 434.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk to strike \nsection 437.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 437.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, my amendment, which I offer along with Mr. \nLowenthal and Mr. Peters, would simply remove one of the so-called \npolicy riders from this bill. It is a particularly dangerous policy \nrider.\n  What my amendment would do is it would strip the bill of a harmful \nand unrelated restriction that actually would prohibit Federal agencies \nfrom assessing the social cost of carbon, meaning Federal agencies \nwould not be able to look at the monetized impact, the actual costs of \nclimate change.\n  They would be forced to deliberately have a blindfold and not be \nallowed to consider climate change in their planning, just like \nAmerican businesses do, like States do, like municipalities do, but the \nFederal Government would be prohibited from even looking at the costs \nof climate change.\n  According to a recent poll undertaken by Stanford University, 81 \npercent of American people have looked at the science and agree that \nclimate change is at least in part caused by humans; 74 percent of \nAmericans believe the Federal Government should be working hard to \ncombat climate change, and 71 percent of the American people expect \nthat they will be hurt personally or impacted by climate change.\n  Madam Speaker, climate change is not some fallacy. It is not some \nevil plot by leftwing or rightwing extremists. It is simply science. \nClimate change is what major corporations like Coca-Cola and Nike have \ncalled an economically disruptive force that needs to be addressed.\n  Acting on climate change is what the most high profile religious \nleader on the planet has called a moral imperative, an economic \nimperative, a moral imperative. It is what the Department of Defense \nhas called an ``immediate risk to U.S. national security.''\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side to adopt this amendment \nso that we don't ignore the calls of business, Defense, religious \nleaders--among thousands of others--to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment operates with its eyes wide open and not with ideological \nblinders, simply because we don't want to see the truth of what is \noccurring with regard to climate change.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have long been concerned with how EPA \nconducts its cost-benefit analysis to justify its rulemaking. This is \nsomething that the committee has discussed with EPA on a number of \noccasions, and the Supreme Court recently ruled that EPA's approach to \nexamining costs and their regulation was flawed.\n  The administration's revised estimates for the social cost of carbon \nhelp justify on paper larger benefits from reducing carbon emissions in \nany proposed rule. If the administration can inflate the price tag so \nthat the benefits always exceed the costs, the administration can \ngoldplate requirement regulations from any department or any agency.\n  Section 437 says that the administration should convene a working \ngroup to revise the estimates in a more transparent manner and to make \nthat information available to the public.\n  I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment addresses is not simply \nthe creation of some commission or a nuanced look into how cost-benefit \nanalyses are done. It actually would ensure that the costs of climate \nchange are able to be considered in decisionmaking.\n  The answer to the concerns that my colleague raised from the other \nside would be a surgical approach, not to remove the authority to look \nat the cost of climate change, which is what this language does and \nwhat my amendment would fix.\n  This rider is really about the deep ideologically driven agenda of \nclimate deniers and is a terrible waste of both Federal and taxpayer \nmoney to allow its passage because it will lead to poor decisionmaking \nby the Federal Government.\n  Companies are planning for climate change. Municipalities and States \nare planning for climate change. We need to look at the monetized costs \nwith regard to climate change of new rules and regulations.\n  Instead of spending our time here focusing on how to impact and \nbetter understand climate change, we have this opportunity to ensure \nthat that is a factor in future decisionmaking, rather than prohibiting \nagencies from even considering it in the cost of climate change.\n  Blocking proposals and silencing discussion isn't indicative of \nleadership, Mr. Chair. It is indicative of fear of the truth.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider that and support my and my \ncolleague's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, just in closing, I would rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H4798]]\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. 438.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to propose, promulgate, implement, administer, or \n     enforce a national primary or secondary ambient air quality \n     standard for ozone that is lower than the standard \n     established under section 50.15 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on July 2, 2014), until at least 85 \n     percent of the counties that were nonattainment areas under \n     that standard as of July 2, 2014, achieve full compliance \n     with that standard.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, beginning on line 9, strike ``, until at least 85 \n     percent of the counties that were nonattainment areas under \n     that standard as of July 2, 2014, achieve full compliance \n     with that standard''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Calvert, along \nwith the ranking member, for the work he and the committee have done.\n  My amendment prevents the EPA from using any funds in the bill to \nchange ozone regulations, regardless of whether or not all counties \nmeet the 2008 standards.\n  As of 2012 and based on the 2008 ozone standards as designated by the \nEPA, 24 mainland States were in attainment, including my home State of \nFlorida. An additional four States had either partial attainment or \nwhole counties had marginal attainment.\n  What I find most interesting is the areas of our Nation that have \nconsistently been designated as nonattainment by the EPA. This includes \nmost of California, parts of Texas, and the mid-Atlantic States. These \ncounties have had nearly 20 years to change their policies and abide by \nthe ozone standards.\n  Under the newly proposed standards, a fair amount of the country \nwould be designated as nonattainment areas. Why should the remainder of \nthe country be subject to new standards when parts of the country have \nyet to meet the 2008 or even 2009 standards?\n  Making this change will have serious economic implications on the \nStates and counties that have already proactively worked to reduce \ntheir emissions, all at a time when the Nation is still recovering from \none of the worst economic recessions of our lifetime.\n  Furthermore, I would like to remind my colleagues of the recent \nSupreme Court decision, Michigan, et al., v. Environmental Protection \nAgency. At the heart of the case was whether or not the EPA took care \nto include the potential cost to power plants when proposing new \nregulations, and that estimated cost is $9.6 billion and a burden on \nthe American taxpayers. The Supreme Court held that the EPA interpreted \nU.S. Code 7412 ``unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the \ndecision.''\n  I would like to say that this is the exception and not the rule when \nit comes to the EPA, but that simply is not the truth. The EPA has made \nits de facto policy to implement unreasonable regulations with no \nregard to the larger impact it will have on the economy and taxpayers \nand the environment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment would reverse section 438 to block the \nEPA from making critical updates to its ozone standard. The amendment \nmakes an already bad policy rider in this bill even worse.\n  This amendment, however, would completely prohibit the EPA from \nupdating the standard, short-circuiting both current law and the \njudicial process, while putting millions of Americans' health at risk.\n  Ozone is the main component in smog, and it has been scientifically \nproven to aggravate lung disease, increase frequency and severity of \nasthma attacks, and reduce lung function.\n  We hear about those opportunities all the time that we are given now \nwhen the ozone is too high in the air to stay inside. Young children \nshouldn't be out, and people with heart disease and lung disease should \nstay indoors.\n  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review its ozone standard every \n5 years to reflect the most up-to-date science on ozone and its impacts \non public health.\n  The EPA, in fact, is under a court order to issue its final rules by \nOctober of this year. The EPA's update to its ozone standard is based \non strong scientific evidence, including over 1,000 scientific studies \nthat show the harmful effect of ozone on human health and the need for \nhigher standards.\n  The EPA estimates the benefit of updated standards of 70 parts per \nbillion will yield the health benefits of $13 billion each year.\n  On its merits, this amendment is shortsighted and reactionary, and it \nis a backdoor amendment to completely gut the Clean Air Act.\n  Prohibiting the EPA's ability to update ozone standards is reckless, \nand it is out of touch with what Americans want, and that is clear air. \nThe EPA's update is firmly rooted in science and ensures health and \nprotections for the American people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, ozone comes from many different sources. Yes, \nit is true that it comes from hydrocarbons. When the UV light hits it, \nit does do that. It also comes from the oceans. It comes from the \nswamps. It comes from just nature itself.\n  Ozone by itself is not always bad because it is used industrially. It \ndisinfects laundry. It disinfects water in place of chlorine. It \ndeodorizes the air. It kills bacteria on food and contact surfaces. It \nsanitizes swimming pools. The list goes on and on and on.\n  Yes, there have been reports of it causing respiratory problems, but \nthat is also associated with spores and molds and things like that.\n  I think ozone, at this time--especially when you look at the rulings \nfrom 1997 and 2008, those standards--I don't think we should move \nforward at this time, with our Nation in the economic recovery, to put \nnew standards on all of the Nation when yet a large portion of the \nNation is still not under compliance.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I probably live in the most regulated air \nquality area in the United States, southern California.\n  In southern California, our population continues to grow; yet we have \nbeen able to make significant air quality improvements within the South \nCoast Air Quality Management District.\n  The committee set a level at 85 percent of the communities so that \nthe marginal nonattainment communities could have the opportunity to \nachieve compliance with the 2008 standards before further updates are \nconsidered.\n  This amendment would prevent EPA from lowering the ozone standard \nbelow the 2008 levels. This amendment would prevent further updates to \nthe ozone standard for an indefinite and undetermined timeframe, and \nthat is certainly not the committee's intent.\n  We need to make progress in clean air in areas that folks want to see \ncleaner air, but at the same time making sure that technology is there \nin order to do that. This was, I think, compromise language that the \nunderlying bill has that works to move us forward, but at the same time \nnot stopping us from obtaining cleaner air in the future.\n  I am in opposition to this amendment.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to reiterate that ozone is \nincriminated a lot of times when I think\n\n[[Page H4799]]\n\nwe ought to look at particulate matter in dusty environments or in \nurban areas where airflow in apartment buildings may not be like it \nshould be.\n  Ozone is used as an alternative to chlorine for bleaching wood, paper \nproducts, and things like that. Many hospitals around the world use \nlarge ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between \nsurgeries. It is used in industry all the time.\n  I just ask people to support this amendment, so we don't have more \noverreaching regulations from the EPA.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the EPA's update is firmly rooted in \nscience and ensures the health and protections for the American people. \nWe have a responsibility to protect the millions of Americans affected \nby ozone pollution.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Edwards\n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n         Strike section 438.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Maryland and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maryland.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to strike \nsection 438.\n  Section 438 would prohibit any funds in this Act from being used to \neven propose a national ozone standard that is less than that currently \nin law until at least 85 percent of the counties across the country \nthat do not currently meet that standard achieve full compliance.\n  Now, the current ozone standard under title 40 is 75 parts per \nbillion; but, Mr. Chair, we had a series of hearings in our House \nScience Committee earlier this year where we heard strong testimony \nfrom scientists at State pollution control agencies and physicians at \nhospitals all telling us that the current standard is not in line with \nthe current science.\n  The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee declared as far back as \n2008 that they believe that the current standard of 75 parts per \nbillion is insufficient to protect public health. In fact, right now, \nthe ozone standard can mislead people to believe that the air, in fact, \nis safe to breathe when it is not.\n  Studies conducted by the American Lung Association have shown more \nthan 4 out of every 10 people in the United States live in places where \nozone levels often make it dangerous to breathe.\n  The current standard rates, what we now know to be very dangerous air \nquality, as code yellow or moderate. This can lead those who are \nparticularly at risk of ozone-related illness, such as children and \nsenior citizens, to unwittingly be exposed to harmful levels of ozone. \nThis has the potential to impact millions of people in every State \nacross the Nation.\n  Just look at my own home State of Maryland. There are 145,000 \nchildren with pediatric asthma. Over 430,000 adults have asthma. Mr. \nChairman, 246,000 people in my State have chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease or COPD, and 367,000 people in our State have cardiovascular \ndisease that is related to ozone.\n  The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee recommends that, in order \nto protect the public health, the EPA set the primary ozone standard \nbetween 60 and 70 parts per billion. In November of last year, the EPA \ndid exactly what it is supposed to do.\n  It looked at the strong scientific evidence showing the health risks \nof ozone, and it issued a proposed rule to lower the ozone standard \nfrom 75 parts per billion to a standard within the range of 65 to 70 \nparts per billion.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Setting that standard begins a 2-year process designed to identify \nareas with too much ozone. Once those areas are identified, State and \nlocal governments can craft plans tailored to their areas using cost-\neffective approaches.\n  This new standard, based on the most current science, will help to \nprovide a framework for these plans, which, in turn, will help our \nStates continue along the path to clean air. And yet, here we are, and \nthis provision that I am providing to strike would stop the EPA from \neven proposing a standard of 70 parts per billion.\n  This is the responsibility of the EPA. This new standard would \nprotect Americans' health and our environment. In addition, an analysis \nconducted by the EPA shows that, though the annual cost of the proposed \nstandard of 70 parts per billion might be around $3.9 billion, the \nhealth benefits are estimated to reach between $6.4 billion and $13 \nbillion annually.\n  Mr. Chairman, ground level ozone is harmful to the public health. It \ncontributes to asthma attacks, decreased lung function, respiratory \ninfection, and even death. Breathing ozone is dangerous for everyone, \nbut particularly for children, for the elderly and people of all ages \nwho have lung diseases.\n  We need to allow the EPA--in fact, empower the EPA--to follow the \nscience and create minimum standards necessary to protect public \nhealth. I urge my colleagues to protect these vulnerable populations as \nwell as clean air for every American, and vote ``yes'' on this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in clear \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The language that was adopted in the full committee was carefully \ncrafted. It simply allows a majority of nonattainment counties to \nachieve attainment status before the EPA moves the goalposts.\n  In nonattainment areas, the EPA's proposed ozone standards would \nstifle economic growth and cost jobs and revenue. Just last week, the \nSupreme Court admonished the EPA for ignoring the costs of its \nregulations. The costs involved would be devastating to our economy. \nEven the EPA admitted it would cost $15 billion a year. Other studies \nhave estimated that costs could be as high as $140 billion a year.\n  In West Virginia, in my State, it would mean $2 billion in compliance \ncosts, 10,000 lost jobs, and more fees for residents even to operate \ntheir vehicles.\n  It would have significant impacts on agriculture, manufacturing, and \nthe energy industry. Federal highway funds could be frozen and permits \nfor infrastructure could be held up.\n  I am hopeful that some of our colleagues across the aisle will \nrecognize the impact this will have on each of our districts.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, here we have heard again the exaggerated \nclaims about implementation, so let's get to the facts.\n  The first fact, the scientists tell us that this is a standard that \nwe need to protect the public health. The second fact, the EPA \nestimates that the cost might be around $3.9 billion.\n  But let's look at the health benefits, because those are costing us \ncurrently.\n  The health benefits are estimated to reach between $6.4 and $13 \nbillion, and that means that there is a ripple effect when we invest in \nmaking sure that we implement a standard that protects the public \nhealth, and it has a benefit on the public health.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, there is an argument here for the EPA to simply do \nits job, the job that it was charged to do by taxpayers, and that is to \nprotect the public health, to give us clean air, and to make sure that \nwe have ozone standards that in fact meet our responsibility.\n  The EPA is doing its job. Let's stop Congress from keeping the EPA \nfrom keeping our air clean.\n\n[[Page H4800]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Jenkins) for the time and for including commonsense language in \nthe bill that is now being debated.\n  In 2008, EPA set a strict ozone rule that was stuck in legal limbo \nfor years. From big cities to small towns, over 200 counties are still \nin nonattainment.\n  Yet, before we finish that job, EPA wants to move the goalposts. They \nhave issued new ozone rules that are so strict they can't be achieved \nwith our current technology. All of America will be hit hard with job \nlosses.\n  This bill simply includes a pause button on new EPA rules until we \ncan finish the job and reach our current mandates.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Edwards amendment and strip this \nlanguage from this bill.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As mentioned earlier, I live in one of the most, maybe the most, \nregulated air districts in the United States, and I am a strong \nadvocate for clean air. My district has achieved some of the largest \nemission reductions in the country.\n  However, EPA continues to dig the hole deeper as my district \ncontinues to try to work its way out of nonattainment. So EPA and the \nStates need to use the resources we provided in the bill to play catch-\nup on a statutory obligation to help communities implement the 2008 \nstandard.\n  Remember, just last April, EPA finalized the rule for the 2008 \nstandards. When 85 percent of the communities can achieve the latest \nstandards, then EPA should consider whether or not revisions are \nnecessary.\n  I will remind my colleagues that the Clean Air Act only directs EPA \nto review the standards every 5 years. It does not require that EPA \nrevise the standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I thank the \ngentleman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, once again, this is a \nsincere effort to try to set a benchmark and not have the EPA moving \nthe goalposts that will have such economic devastation, billions of \ndollars in cost, and I encourage a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maryland \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, line 5, strike ``primary or''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, according to the American Lung \nAssociation's 2015 State of the Air Report, the Los Angeles \nmetropolitan area, which includes both my district and also the \nAppropriations Subcommittee chair's district, that metropolitan area is \nthe number one in the country for ozone pollution.\n  But ozone pollution is not just a southern California problem. The \nreport shows that more than 40 percent of the United States' population \nlives in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone. Large cities like \nHouston and less populated areas like northwest Ohio also make the \nlist.\n  Power plants, motor vehicles, and chemical solvents contribute to the \nmajority of nitrous oxides and volatile organic compounds, \nNOX and VOCs, which react with each other on hot, sunny days \nto produce ground level ozone.\n  The American Lung Association has pointed out that because hot, sunny \ndays produce the most ozone, climate change is increasing the number of \nunhealthy ozone level days. We are all familiar with those ``high ozone \nlevel'' warnings that happen on really hot, sunny days, and \nunfortunately, they are becoming more and more common due to global \nwarming.\n  Ground level ozone interacts with lung tissue, can cause major \nproblems for children, the elderly, and anyone with lung disease. Ozone \nis known to aggravate health problems such as asthma, and it is also \nlinked to low birth rates, cardiovascular problems, and premature \ndeath.\n  Given the grave consequences and the widespread problem of ozone \npollution, I am glad that EPA is moving forward with updates to its \nnational standards for ozone pollution.\n  Members of the medical and health communities have been calling for a \nlong time for updates of this standard in order to protect the public \nhealth. The current standard of 75 parts per billion is outdated and \ndoes not adequately protect public health, which is what the EPA is \nrequired to do under the Clean Air Act. Thousands of hospital visits \nand premature deaths and up to a million missed schooldays can be \nprevented just by strengthening this standard.\n  But instead of trusting health professionals, some in Congress have \ndecided to protect the financial interests of the polluters. The \nreckless legislative rider in section 438 of this appropriations bill \nblocks the EPA from updating or even proposing scientifically-based \nstandards for ozone to the detriment of the health of at least 40 \npercent of the U.S. population.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to remove this polluter protecting \nsection from the bill, to support the Edwards amendment, and allow the \nEPA to move forward with doing what they are required to do by law, and \nthat is protect the public health.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jenkins included the language in the \nfull committee bill that, I think, came to a reasonable compromise. As \nthe gentleman is aware, many communities cannot reach the old standard, \nthe 2008 standard, that is now the law, and so this just gives the \ncommunities throughout the country that cannot get to attainment \nadditional time to develop the technologies before we go to a new \nstandard.\n  I would remind the gentleman that it was just last April that we came \nto a determination on the 2008 standard, and the administration already \nis talking about a new standard that most of the Nation cannot reach in \nthe short term. So this gives a brief, little bit of time to allow \nthese communities to improve their technologies and to be able to meet \na new standard down the road.\n  So I would oppose the gentleman's amendment and support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, let's just talk about why we need to \nchange the standard.\n  I understand and appreciate that reaching that standard is going to \ntake some work, but remember, the air, by saying that we don't need to \ndo this because the air is cleaner than it was 30 years ago, for \nexample, does nothing to put current air quality in context. Just \nbecause the air is cleaner than it used to be doesn't mean that it is \ncompletely healthy.\n  My district is a great example of this. L.A. County has reduced its \nground ozone by 5 days since 2009, and I am proud of that, but it \ndoesn't mean our air is healthy. We still experienced 217 days of \nunhealthy ozone level days last year.\n  We need to take into account current pollution levels. We need to use \nthe best science available to determine what standards are needed to \nget our ozone pollution below those unhealthy\n\n[[Page H4801]]\n\nlevels. That is why we are doing this, to get the ozone below unhealthy \nlevels. That is what EPA is doing, and we shouldn't block their efforts \nbecause we think that the air is cleaner or it is difficult to reach.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The savings in public health will far outweigh the costs to polluting \nindustries. If the EPA would implement a standard of just 70 parts per \nbillion, the cost of implementation is estimated to be about $3.9 \nbillion, but the savings in public health costs are estimated to be \nanywhere from $6.4 to $13 billion. That is a net savings of $2.5 to $9 \nbillion. If you reduce the standard even lower, to 65 parts per \nbillion, the savings are even greater, from $4 to $23 billion in public \nhealth costs.\n  Ground ozone pollution costs billions of dollars in healthcare \nexpenses around the country. We have a chance to save taxpayers a lot \nof money.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts on \ntrying to clean the ozone out of the South Coast Air Quality Management \nDistrict. We have to suffer the ozone that is being blown from L.A./\nLong Beach over into the Inland Empire. Certainly the ports of L.A. and \nLong Beach, the trains emit a lot of ozone and a lot of pollutants that \nend up in the Inland Empire, so we want to clean that air up.\n  As you know, we can't meet the 2008 standards at this time. We are \ndoing everything we can to meet those standards, but until these \ncommunities can get the technology to meet the existing standard, we \nshouldn't impose a new standard that could cause grave economic harm to \nthe communities.\n  With that, I would say ``no'' to this amendment and move on.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                          hydraulic fracturing\n\n       Sec. 439.  None of the funds made available by this or any \n     other Act may be used to implement, administer, or enforce \n     the final rule entitled ``Hydraulic Fracturing on Federal and \n     Indian Lands'' as published in the Federal Register on March \n     26, 2015 and March 30, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 16127 and 16577, \n     respectively).\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Cartwright\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal), which I do \nintend to withdraw.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, line 14, strike ``or any other''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, the Bureau of Land Management is currently \nworking toward implementation of a rule that would modernize horribly \noutdated oil and gas regulations on Federal land. My amendment would \nstrike a section of this bill that would halt this important work.\n  What we have to do is to allow the BLM to proceed with them \nimplementing this rule to provide a national baseline to protect our \nenvironment, our water, and our Federal lands from hazardous \ncontamination.\n  Since the 1980s, the scale and impacts associated with the oil and \ngas industry have grown dramatically, but BLM's fracking regulations \nhave not kept pace. In March of 2015, the BLM finalized a modest, \ncommonsense rule to update its 30-year-old fracking regulations.\n  With these updates, the BLM is taking responsible steps to improve \nwell integrity, reduce the impact of toxic wastewater, and increase \ntransparency around chemicals used in the fracking process.\n  Importantly, these new regulations will not impact States that \nalready have robust fracking regulations and will simply offer a \nregulatory baseline for the States that do not have current fracking \nregulations.\n  Notably, in 2013, there were still 19 States with operating fracking \nwells that had absolutely no hydraulic fracturing regulations in place.\n  Right now over 90 percent of the more than 2,500 oil and gas wells \ndrilled every year on federally managed lands use hydraulic fracturing.\n  Just this month the EPA released a draft report that concludes that \nthere are above- and below-ground mechanisms by which hazardous \nhydraulic fracturing chemicals have the potential to impact drinking \nwater resources.\n  Because of this, the Federal Government really has to take the \nnecessary steps to ensure that toxic, cancer-causing fracking chemicals \ndo not contaminate America's water supply, America's streams, America's \nrivers, and America's lakes.\n  As many of you know, the fracking fluids injected into oil and gas \nwells contain thousands of chemicals, many of which can harm humans and \nthe environment.\n  In fact, the EPA identified over 1,000 different chemicals that have \nbeen used during the hydraulic fracturing process, with an estimated \n9,100 gallons of chemicals used for each well.\n  Due in large part to fracking loopholes and outdated oil and gas \nregulations, fracking chemical spills and water contaminations have \noccurred.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, for example, there were nearly 600 \ndocumented cases of wastewater and chemical spills in 2013 alone.\n  In fact, the EPA estimates that there are as many as 12 chemical \nspills for every 100 oil and gas wells in the State of Pennsylvania. \nAnd I need to remind the House that there are almost 8,000 active gas \nwells operating in Pennsylvania right now. So that is a lot of spills.\n  Chemical and wastewater spills associated with fracking operations \nharm the environment, and it has been found to contaminate surface \nwater. The EPA's draft study found that 8 percent of studied wastewater \nspills polluted surface or groundwater.\n  Thankfully, the BLM's rule will help prevent fracking chemicals and \nwastewater from contaminating water bodies.\n  It does so by validating the integrity of fracking wells and \nincreasing the standards for storage and recovery of waste fluid. This \nrule will require companies publicly to disclose the chemicals being \npumped into public lands.\n  While I am concerned that the BLM fracking rule does not go far \nenough in some areas, simply stopping the rule in its tracks is just \nirresponsible.\n  I am not opposed to fracking. I believe we have to utilize our \nnatural resources, but we need to do so in a careful and responsible \nmanner.\n  There are bad actors in the oil and gas business just like there are \nsome bad actors in every area, actors that cut corners and don't drill \nand frack properly and safely.\n  The States, unfortunately, don't have all the expertise and resources \nto properly manage this exploding industry. The rule will set a \nrelatively low bar but one that ensures a baseline across the country \nto protect our public lands.\n  I urge you to support my amendment to allow the BLM to implement a \nrule that will prevent fracking chemical contamination and keep our \nNation's water supply pristine and something Americans can be proud of.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 439.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould strike section 439 from the underlying bill. In doing so, this \namendment would allow the Bureau of Land Management to implement \nstandards\n\n[[Page H4802]]\n\nto support safe and responsible fracking operations on public and \nNative American lands.\n  More than 1.5 million public comments were submitted in a transparent \nprocess to regulate fracking on 750 million acres of public and Indian \nlands. More than 100,000 oil and gas wells are situated on these lands.\n  This amendment will ensure that the BLM's rule is fully implemented \nso that fracking for oil and gas continues but with full regard to \npublic health and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  And I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I understand the BLM needed to update its regulation \nrelated to fracking on Federal and Indian lands. BLM regulations are \n25, 30 years old.\n  However, the States have been doing the same thing over the last \nnumber of years. Unfortunately, BLM's rule is duplicative of existing \nState regulation.\n  It forces companies to drill into a double compliance scheme. It also \ncosts them more time, and it significantly lengthens the time in which \nit takes time to get to a permit.\n  None of this is necessary, which is why we adopted this provision \nduring the committee's markup of this bill.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFlores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert for his hard work on this \nsection of the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment. American \nconsumers have benefited from low energy prices, thanks to the American \nenergy revolution and technological advancements in hydraulic \nfracturing and horizontal drilling.\n  For decades, hydraulic fracturing has been successfully regulated by \nthe States. In 2013, the House passed on a bipartisan basis legislation \nwhich I coauthored with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) from the \nother side of the aisle, and that legislation would stop the BLM from \npursuing duplicative and burdensome hydraulic fracturing regulations.\n  Unfortunately, the BLM didn't listen to what Congress said, and it \ncontinued down a path to impose additional red tape on American energy \ndevelopment and to further drive down energy production on energy lands \nwhile State and private production continues to experience record \ngrowth in a safe and efficient manner.\n  This has always been a solution in search of a problem, particularly \nwhen the EPA and the Department of Energy have each agreed that \nhydraulic fracturing is being conducted safely right now.\n  Even the courts agree that there are problems with the BLM's rules, \nas evidenced by the recent stay granted by the U.S. District Court of \nWyoming to stop the BLM from moving forward with their overreaching \nregulatory activity.\n  This amendment is bad for jobs. It would increase energy costs and \nwould limit economic opportunity for hard-working families, \nparticularly those at the bottom end of the income tables. So it hurts \nthose that are struggling to get by today with higher energy costs.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for his work \non including this provision during markup, as well as Chairman Calvert \nfor his support on stopping this regulatory overreach.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment before us would strike the \npolicy rider that prohibits the Bureau of Land Management from \nimplementing a uniform national standard for hydraulic fracking on \npublic lands, on Federal lands.\n  Such standards are necessary to ensure the operations on public and \ntribal lands are safe and that they are conducted in an environmentally \nresponsible way. This only affects Federal lands and tribal lands.\n  Now, of the 32 States with the potential for oil and gas development \non federally managed mineral resources, only slightly more than half of \nthem have rules in place that even address hydraulic fracturing, and \nthose that do have rules in place vary greatly in their requirements.\n  As you can see, there is no consistency in the rules. There is no \nguarantee that there are good quality rules put in place. And we are \ntalking about making sure that, on Federal leases, on Federal lands, \nthat we have a national standard.\n  The BLM continues to offer millions of public lands up for renewable \nenergy production, and that is why it is absolutely critical that they \nhave the confidence and the transparency and the safety and \nenvironmental protections that are put in place on these Federal lands.\n  Prior to the issuance of a hydraulic fracturing rule, the BLM rules \non oil and gas operation were updated over 30 years ago, 30 years ago. \nThey had not kept pace with the significant technology advancements in \nhydraulic fracturing techniques and the tremendous increase of its use.\n  As part of this implementation rule, the BLM office is in the process \nof meeting with their State counterparts--they are working with them--\nundertaking a State-by-State comparison of regulatory requirements in \norder to identify opportunities for variances and to establish \nmemorandums of understanding between the States that will realize \nefficiencies and allow for successful implementation of the rule. So we \nshould be allowing BLM to coordinate with the States and ensure that \nhydraulic fracturing activities are being carried out safely and \neffectively when Federal leases are involved.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, my State of Wyoming is the largest onshore \nproducer of oil and gas from Federal land. The reason our Wyoming court \nstayed the Federal BLM's rules is because Wyoming has been regulating \nfracking through its oil and gas commission from the beginning. There \nhas never been one documented case of drinking water being \ncontaminated. Furthermore, the way that BLM land lays with private land \nand State land is they are all interspersed; yet, underground, because \nof horizontal drilling, the drilling transcends from State land to \nprivate land to Federal land, and back and forth. Those wells are \nunitized so the production can be allocated among the various owners of \nprivate, State, and Federal land. You can't have two layers of surfaces \nState ownership regulation when the drilling is occurring going back \nand forth among State, private, and Federal lands.\n  Wyoming has handled its fracking regulations responsibly. It was the \nfirst in the Nation to do so. I strongly urge you leave it in the hands \nof States who do it best.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, in response to some of the comments that \nwere never made, I would like to offer five points.\n  Number one is BLM doesn't have the statutory authority to do the \nactions that they tried to. The Federal Court was right in granting an \ninjunction. The EPA and the Department of Energy have both said that \nhydraulic fracturing is safe, and that is evidenced by the safe and \nefficient production of much more oil and gas on private and State \nlands while Federal production is going down.\n  Again, this is a solution in search of a problem. So I would urge all \nmy colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I want to say congratulations to the \nState of Wyoming. That is exactly why we need this amendment. We want \nthose same regulations on a national level. Mr. Chairman, 16 to 17 \nStates have no regulation. Wyoming has gotten it right.\n  This amendment will ensure that the BLM rule is fully implemented so \nthat\n\n[[Page H4803]]\n\nfracking for oil and gas continues, but with full regard to the public \nhealth and the environment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       spending reduction account\n\n       Sec. 440.  The amount by which the applicable allocation of \n     new budget authority made by the Committee on Appropriations \n     of the House of Representatives under section 302(b) of the \n     Congressional Budget Act of 1974 exceeds the amount of \n     proposed new budget authority is $0.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Young of Alaska\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n   limitation on use of funds to implement the revised comprehensive \n   conservation plan for the arctic national wildlife refuge, alaska\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement the Revised Comprehensive Conservation \n     Plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska \n     published in the Federal Register on January 27, 2015 (80 Fed \n     Reg. 4303).\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alaska and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  I want to thank Mr. Calvert and his committee for the work they have \ndone on this legislation, and I support the underlying bill. The \nadministration has left no alternative to the people of Alaska and to \nthose with an interest in our national energy policy.\n  This spring, under this President, the Department of the Interior \npublished the management plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nto recommend the entirety of the area be designated as wilderness. This \nwould include the 1002 area that was set aside by Congress for \npotential development in the future, an area that holds 10 billion \nbarrels of oil, at the minimum, and probably 37 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  My amendment would ensure that no funding can be spent implementing \nthis recommendation. The impact of this recommendation should not be \noverlooked, as the recommendation requires immediate management of the \nentire area as wilderness--unilaterally undermining the role of \nCongress through a de facto wilderness designation.\n  This action violates the Statehood Compact, which was founded on \nensuring the development of subsurface resources for the economic well-\nbeing of this Nation. This action also violates the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, which established more than 100 \nmillion acres of conservation areas. And in recognition of the enormity \nof the acreage being locked up, the act drew a line guaranteeing that \nno more conservation areas can be created without an act of Congress--\nour role.\n  There is no need for additional wilderness areas in ANWR, given 92 \npercent of the refuge is already closed to development.\n  Mr. Chairman, Alaska holds 53 percent of Federal wilderness areas in \nthe Nation, and that is not enough for this administration. You think \nabout that a moment. The administration's plan immediately raises \nanother administrative, bureaucratic wall to oil and gas development. \nThis is a betrayal to the Alaskan people and, I believe, to this Nation \nand to this Congress. This plan by the administration handcuffs my \nState from providing for itself and pushes us to be more dependent on \nFederal funds.\n  This is not just an assault on Alaska. This is another example of \nexecutive overreach by this administration undermining the role of \nCongress. This is our role, not this administration's. I don't care \nwhose administration it is; when the President oversteps his bounds, we \nshould take and accept our responsibility. And this is the law he \ncannot do, but he says ``I can do it.''\n  By the way, Mr. Chairman, this was an example, I think, of this whole \nDepartment of the Interior. Between EPA and the Department of the \nInterior, they are trying to cripple this Nation, trying to cripple my \nState, against the law. This is very specific in ANILCA. If you don't \nbelieve me, go back and read it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment offered by my friend from \nAlaska would prohibit any Federal funds from being used to implement \nthe administration's revised comprehensive conservation plan to better \nsustain and manage the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. Chairman, attaching this rider to the Interior Appropriations \nbill would be a mistake. The coastal plain of the Arctic refuge is one \nof the few remaining places in our Nation that remains pristine and \nundisturbed. It provides critical protection for thousands of species--\ncaribou, polar bear, and gray wolves, just to name a few--and they \ndesperately need this important habitat. Roughly 20 million acres \nmanaged by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are some of the best and last \nundisturbed natural areas in this Nation.\n  I understand that the gentleman from Alaska feels strongly about this \nissue, and he has been a great advocate for his State for decades; but \non this important issue, we deeply disagree.\n  Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, the Interior Department released an \nupdated conservation plan to better manage the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, and the President took that opportunity to call on Congress to \npass legislation designating the coastal plain as a wilderness, an even \ngreater level of protection for this incredible area. The protected \narea encompasses a wide range of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems. There \nare unadulterated landforms, and there are native flora and fauna. The \nrefuge has an incredible biological integrity, natural diversity, and \nenvironmental health.\n  I understand that there are differences of opinion how to manage this \nland and that legislation designated in this area as wilderness may not \nget very far in this Congress. But I want to commend the President for \nhis leadership on this issue, and I would hope that the legislative \nprocess could play out and that we not adopt this rider onto this bill \nbecause this issue is just far too important.\n  Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I did not point out one \nmore obvious truth: the President will not sign a bill loaded up with \nantienvironmental riders just like this one. So we only make the path \nfor the bill harder by including it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing it, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I appreciate the comments from the gentlewoman.\n  I would suggest, respectfully, we should follow the law. We have \ngiven up the responsibility in this Congress to the President--not just \nthis President, other Presidents. It is clear in the law nothing more \nthan 5,000 acres can be withdrawn and put in the wilderness, without \nthe okay of the Congress, in Alaska. No more clause. It stands for no \nmore.\n  Now, we have a President that says ``up yours'' to the Congress. That \nis not the way to run this business. We have a responsibility as \nCongressmen to do our job. And when he goes against the law through \nexecutive order, that is against this Constitution of America.\n\n[[Page H4804]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I certainly would urge the adoption of the gentleman's \namendment, and I support his amendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the \n     following new section:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Executive Order 13007, entitled \n     ``Indian Sacred Sites''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would ensure that cultural \nand sacred sites of Indian and Alaska Native tribes are protected by \nmandating that none of the funds in this bill can be used in \ncontravention of Executive Order 13007.\n  Executive Order 13007, issued by President Clinton in 1996, requires \nFederal agencies to accommodate access to and ceremonial use of Indian \nsacred sites and, more importantly, to avoid adversely affecting the \nphysical integrity of such sacred sites.\n  Far too often, Indian sacred sites are an afterthought during the \nFederal Government land management process. When negotiating land swaps \nand when constructing other management decisions, the voice of Indian \nCountry with regard to sacred sites is ignored. But this is not just \nland to the Native people. These are cultural and spiritual areas that \nare part of the tribe's history and its living legacy. These are places \nwhere their ancestors lived, prayed, hunted, gathered, fought, and \ndied. They are part and parcel of tribal identity, and it is our duty \nto ensure they are preserved and protected.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to accept the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Department of the Interior tells me they are already in \ncompliance with the executive order. There is no question that \nproviding Indian tribes with access to their sacred sites is the right \nthing to do, so I would be more than happy to accept the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. The \ngentleman's amendment will ensure that this important executive order \nis respected in such a way that it has my wholehearted support in \nprotecting the liberty and religious rights of Native American Indians.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Poliquin\n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 63.7570(b)(2) of \n     title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Maine and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maine.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, Maine is home to the most skilled paper \nmakers in the world. Our hardworking men and women manufacture paper \nproducts that we use every day. Our paper makers are also some of the \nbest stewards of the environment. They know that we need healthy \nforests to make the high quality wood products sold around the globe.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  When trees are harvested to make paper, the branches and the bark can \nbe left behind to be decomposed; or they can be burned to generate \nenergy to run the machinery to make paper.\n  Either way, the carbon from this biomass is returned to the \nenvironment as part of the natural carbon cycle. What a great idea--\ninstead of ending up in a landfill, this green, renewable energy fuels \nour economy and creates jobs.\n  Now, our Sappi paper mill in Skowhegan, Maine, burns biomass to make \nsome of the finest quality paper in the world. In doing so, it directly \nemploys 800 hard-working Mainers. In addition, loggers and truckers who \nproduce and transport this biomass also earn paychecks for their \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency is attacking this \nrenewable method to power our businesses and to create jobs. All of us \nwho have sat around a campfire have seen that wet wood, branches, and \ngrass emit a darker smoke. However, the same carbon is being recycled \nthrough the environment. It is just a slightly different color.\n  The EPA wants to impose stricter emission standards on companies that \nburn wet wood, branches, and bark instead of dumping them into a \nlandfill. That just doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. Chairman, the EPA is trying to force our Skowhegan mill to spend \nmillions of additional dollars on special smokestack equipment because \nwet biomass burns darker. The mill owners have worked diligently with \nthe regional EPA office in Boston and the Maine Department of \nEnvironmental Protection to put in place a commonsense emissions \nmonitoring system that reflects the burning of biomass. Sadly, the EPA \nheadquarters right here in Washington rejected their sensible solution.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is not fair, and this is not right. Those 800 \nhard-working paper makers at the Sappi mill deserve an EPA that works \nfor them, not against them.\n  Now, our paper mill in Maine could very well be a different mill in \nMichigan, Minnesota, or Georgia that also uses green American biomass \nenergy.\n  America should keep her energy dollars and jobs here at home and not \nship them to the Middle East. Our businesses need that energy to keep \nour manufacturing jobs right here in America and not send them to \nChina. This is a national security issue, as well as a jobs issue, Mr. \nChairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my House Republicans and Democrats today to \nsupport my simple, commonsense bill. Passing it will stop the EPA from \nunfairly penalizing employers who use green, renewable American biomass \nenergy.\n  My amendment prohibits the EPA from reaching beyond some of the \nbiomass emission rules already being enforced by the regional EPA \noffices and the State environmental authorities.\n  Let's show the American people today that Congress supports a \ndomestic energy source that is good for the environment, creates jobs, \nand keeps us safer here at home\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I suspect this issue is not just limited to your State, \nand I hope this language will help bring EPA to the table so that \neveryone can find a path forward for this issue that is important for \nthe country.\n  Certainly, I have no objection to this amendment. In fact, I support \nit.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H4805]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, it is a blanket block to the EPA from \nfully implementing and enforcing air toxic standards for boilers and \nincinerators.\n  Among other things, there are boilers that burn natural gas, coal, \nwood, oil, and other fuel to produce steam, and the steam does produce \nelectricity or provide heat, and incinerators burn waste to dispose of \nit. These boilers and incinerators have the potential of releasing very \ntoxic pollutants such as mercury, lead, dioxin, and other pollutants \nthat are linked to health effects.\n  In 2011, after a robust public process, including three public \nhearings and responding to thousands of public comments, the EPA \nfinalized standards to reduce toxic emissions for existing new boilers \nand commercial industrial solid waste incinerators and sewage sludge \nincinerators.\n  Now, among other things, the rule requires emissions to just meet \ncertain standards. It is a measurement of air pollution based on the \ndegree of which light is blocked by the pollutant from the smokestack.\n  The rule also allows the EPA to approve alternative opacity limits \nunder certain circumstances, so there is flexibility within the rule.\n  Now, the local paper mills in the representative State are exceeding \nor they are expected to exceed the standard in the EPA's final rule, so \nto better fit their circumstances, they want an alternate opinion. That \nis the issue that the EPA is looking at right now. The EPA is looking \nat this right now. They heard the concerns; they are looking at it.\n  Strangely, this amendment would not really address that issue. \nInstead, it would block the EPA from ever approving an alternative \nlimit or implementing or enforcing an alternative limit that had \nalready been improved.\n  I rise because this amendment, unfortunately, just does not make any \nsense to me that we would not keep the dialogue moving forward. The EPA \nhas the responsibility of making sure that standards of emissions with \nmercury and lead and other toxic pollutants are not dangerous to public \nhealth, especially to children. We know statistically now that up to \n8,100 premature deaths, 5,100 heart attacks, and 52 asthma attacks are \nall worked into reducing the emissions, to lower those numbers.\n  We need to stand with the EPA air toxic standards and allow them to \nachieve their intended benefits and to work with industry where it \nmakes sense, and we can have industry move forward but still protect \nthe public health, just not scrap the parts that industry dislikes.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because it would keep \nthe EPA from doing what it is doing right now, and that is to work with \nindustry, oddly enough, to create a win-win for industry and a win-win \nfor public health.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I would strongly disagree with my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle.\n  Those of us or those who have visited our great State know that we \nhave a pristine natural environment. It is part of our brand, Mr. \nChairman. It is something that we protect and will continue to protect \nat all costs.\n  However, as a freshman legislator, I have been here for 6 months, and \nwhat I have learned in those 6 months is that we have almost a fourth \nbranch of government, and that is these regulators that regulate every \npart of our life, whether we are trying to make paper or what have you \nand trying to provide work for our families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 102(a)(1) of Public Law \n     94-579 (43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(1)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, with this amendment, this body has the \nopportunity to say loudly and clearly: Let's keep our public lands \npublic.\n  Public lands are a massive economic generator and are important to \nour health and welfare as Americans. They are beautiful, and they are \nhealing. I recently got to hear from a veteran in Eagle County, and \npart of his recovery process is the time he spends outdoors on our \npublic lands. They are also practical. They help ensure for water \nquality and maintain the critical aspects of rural life like farming, \nranching, grazing, and logging.\n  Public lands are where our hunters and fishermen go to enjoy the \noutdoors. They are where skiers, hikers, bikers, and motorists \nexperience activities that are impossible in other places and are \ninvaluable to their quality of life.\n  Outdoor enthusiasts utilize those areas. It is a vast economic driver \nas well. In fact, over $646 billion is generated economically through \nour public lands, and visiting our public lands supports over 6 million \njobs, including many in my district and many in our great State of \nColorado.\n  When recently polled across six western States, the American people \nsaid with 96 percent support--with unheard of levels of support--that \nprotecting public lands for future generations is one of their top \npriorities and that, above and apart from any other, they see the \nmaintenance for access of outdoor activities on our public lands as a \ncritical focus of our Federal Government.\n  States don't have the resources or expertise to suddenly take on the \nresponsibilities for our Federal lands, nor do State governments even \nwant that authority, Mr. Chairman.\n  Selling these lands outright to private owners or purveyors would \nundoubtedly lead to loss of access to these majestic, treasured spaces \nand, at the same time, would destroy jobs across the West and other \nareas that are blessed to have public lands; yet there has been attempt \nafter attempt to transfer our most precious public spaces to the States \nor to private ownership or to sell them at wholesale.\n  Mr. Chairman, the sportsmen don't want this. The hikers, bikers, \ncampers, skiers, and motorized activists that make up the areas \nsurrounding those held by the Federal Government do not want their land \ntaken away--our land taken away.\n  Those concerned with environmental well-being, water quality, and \npublic health that depends on the stewardship of our public lands do \nnot want our public lands taken away.\n  It is lost to me, Mr. Chairman--and perhaps my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle can speak to this--exactly who is impacted by \nand who does touch and enjoy and rely on our public lands and actually \ndoes want to see them taken away.\n  I would pose this inquiry, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this would just make it difficult and \nimpossible for Federal agencies to dispose or willingly or equitably \nexchange or convey lands to States, local governments, private \nlandowners, and others.\n  I just may point out the Federal Government currently can't manage \nits existing land, which is over 640 million acres or approximately 3 \nout of every 10 acres in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, all my amendment does is ensure that none of \nthe funds made available to this act can be used in contravention to \nthe law of the land. My amendment wouldn't do anything to undermine \ncurrent authority of congressionally and administratively driven land \nexchanges. In fact, I brought several before this body and have seen \nseveral signed into law.\n  My district is 62 percent Federal land, and we always have various \nexchanges, purchases, and sales. Of course, those are consistent with \nthe law, which allows the funds to be used under this bill.\n\n[[Page H4806]]\n\n  I am a strong believer in the ability of our Federal Government and \nCongress to make choices wisely in a thorough public and transparent \nprocess, which we do in this body.\n  What my amendment would do instead is prohibit the use of funds in \nthis bill to pursue any additional extra legal ways to turn our Federal \nland over to private owners. It would prohibit Federal dollars from \nbeing used to support, for instance, a commission around finding \navenues to turn all Federal lands over to private ownership.\n  These kinds of ventures are fiscally wasteful and counterproductive \nand wholly unwanted by the American people who rely and derive \nspiritual support, health, and jobs from our public lands.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect upon who exactly we are working for \nand what our goal is with regard to our public lands.\n  I strongly support ensuring that all the provisions of this \nappropriations bill are limited to the full pursuit of section \n102(a)(1) of Public Law 94-579 with regard to our public lands and that \nnone of this money, which is what this amendment will do, can be \ndiverted to privatize our public lands.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to treat the sonoran desert tortoise as an \n                endangered species or threatened species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     treat the Sonoran desert tortoise as an endangered species or \n     threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a commonsense amendment to \nthe Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  My amendment will protect education, grazing, agriculture, energy, \nhousing interests, as well as assist with preventing dangerous \nwildfires by blocking the Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the \nSonoran desert tortoise as an endangered or threatened species. A \nlisting decision for the Sonoran desert tortoise is expected this \nfiscal year.\n  Of the potential 26.8 million acres that will likely be designated \nfor critical habitat due to such a listing, 15 million acres are \nlocated in the United States, and nearly 4.5 million acres are State \ntrust land.\n  State trust land revenues, which are currently enjoyed by 13 \nbeneficiaries, of which K-12 education is the largest proportional \nshare of those moneys, will be severely impacted.\n  If the Sonoran desert tortoise is listed, these acres of trust land \nwill become less valuable for investment as they are burdened with a \nfederal regulatory nexus. Without this amendment, schools that have \nalready undergone significant budget cuts will see even less money \nflowing into their educational coffers.\n  The Sonoran desert tortoise is also of substantial concern to many \ndifferent types of industry, as its habitat falls within urban \ndevelopment corridors as well as on rural and agricultural landscapes.\n  Listing the species as threatened or endangered will negatively \nimpact commercial, housing and energy developers as well as the \nagriculture and grazing industries.\n  Specifically, a listing would be detrimental for 273 different \ngrazing allotments and would jeopardize nearly 6 million acres used for \nlivestock grazing.\n  Mining will also suffer, as the BLM listed 9,675 new mining claims \nfrom 1990 to 2002, 36 percent of which fall within the Sonoran desert \ntortoise's habitat.\n  Any ground and vegetation-disturbing activities, including fire \nsuppression activities and restorative treatments, would also be \nnegatively impacted by a listing decision for the species.\n  Solar energy would also likely be harmed, as large solar projects on \ndesert floors are considered a potential threat to the Sonoran desert \ntortoise.\n  My amendment will also encourage significant voluntary efforts and \nfinancial contributions for the Sonoran desert tortoise to continue, \nmany of which are already underway at the local level.\n  Important local conservation efforts began for the species in 2010, \nand a Candidate Conservation Agreement was recently signed by 15 \ndifferent agencies in February.\n  Should the Sonoran desert tortoise become listed, these voluntary \nefforts and moneys will dissipate as local property owners, ranchers, \nand developers will no longer have any incentive to work with the \nFederal and State wildlife management agencies on conservation efforts \nfor the species.\n  My amendment is supported by the Public Lands Council, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, Americans for Limited Government, the \nArizona Cattlemen's Association, the Arizona Farm Bureau, the Arizona \nMining Association, the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona, \nand numerous other organizations that are strongly opposed to this \nlisting.\n  I thank the chair and the ranking member for their tireless efforts \nto produce this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would do two things. \nFirst, it would prohibit the Fish and Wildlife Service from treating \nthe Sonoran desert tortoise as threatened or endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act. Secondly, it would restrict the Service from \noffering any of the critical protections to preserve the species.\n  The Sonoran desert tortoise is an iconic species. It has been part of \nthe Sonoran Desert ecosystem for over 150,000 years. In 2010, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service found that the listing for the Sonoran desert \ntortoise was warranted, but it was precluded because it needed to \naddress other higher priorities.\n  So last December the Service announced that it was working on a \nproposed listing determination that is expected to be published within \nthe year.\n  This amendment, if it were to pass, would stop the Fish and Wildlife \nService's efforts and block the Service from meeting a court-ordered \ndeadline to make this listing determination. In other words, they would \nput the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at odds with what the court has \nrequested them to do. This amendment has no place in the appropriations \nprocess, nor does it have any place in this legislative process.\n  Let's just think about the Endangered Species Act for a minute. It \nhas been one of our most effective and important environmental laws, \nand it is supported by over 85 percent of Americans.\n  There has been no law that has been more important in preventing the \nextinction of wildlife, but some Members of this body seem determined \nto undermine the law by placing harmful policy riders on this bill.\n  From my count, as of right now, there are at least 10 species that \nare at risk of losing the Endangered Species Act protections in this \nbill.\n  What type of conservation legacy are we leaving for future \ngenerations? That is why I oppose the amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, the Sonoran desert tortoise is part of a\n\n[[Page H4807]]\n\ngrowing problem involving large settlements with the environmental \ngroups who sue the Fish and Wildlife Service's regulatory protections \nwith regard to a large number of different wildlife and plant species.\n  These multi-district litigation settlements, commonly known as ``sue \nand settle tactics,'' force the Fish and Wildlife Service to make \nlisting decisions on several hundred species, often with little or no \nscientific data supporting these listings and without public input to \nthis process.\n  This possible listing is a result of a lawsuit filed by a few special \ninterest groups aimed at stifling development and has nothing to do \nwith the tortoise.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Tsongas\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n  limitation on use of funds to implement or enforce specific sections\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 117, 121, or 122 of \n     this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which I offer with Mr. Beyer \nof Virginia, would strike three policy riders related to the Endangered \nSpecies Act from the underlying bill, those concerning the greater \nsage-grouse, the northern long-eared bat, and the gray wolf. I want to \nfocus my remarks on the greater sage-grouse.\n  The language in this bill that seeks to block an Endangered Species \nAct listing of the bird is unnecessary and is completely inappropriate, \nputting both the species and the historic quintessentially American \nsagebrush steppe landscape at risk.\n  In 1901, Mark Twain described the sagebrush steppe as a ``forest in \nexquisite miniature.'' At one point, as many as 16 million greater \nsage-grouse called the sagebrush sea home. Settlers traveling west said \nthat flocks of sage-grouse ``blackened the sky.'' Today the population \nhas been reduced to as few as 200,000 birds.\n  Right now there are unprecedented and proactive partnerships \nthroughout the West which are working to conserve sagebrush habitat, to \nencourage predictability for economic development, and to prevent the \nlisting of the greater sage-grouse as endangered or threatened under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Federal agencies, States, sportsmen, ranchers, farmers, and \nconservationists have all come together in this effort. In fact, the 10 \nland management plans released by the Interior Department last month \nare based on plans developed by the States, not one size fits all, but \nindividual plans to suit each State's individual needs. This is all the \nresult of a concerted collaboration.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service and the States themselves agree that, \nas long as these partnerships continue, it is likely that the greater \nsage-grouse will not be listed as endangered or threatened under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Rather than helping communities, the rider in this bill creates \nuncertainty and only undermines the immense coordinated progress \nalready underway. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I will talk about the three different \nprovisions to this amendment. Let me first talk about the sage-grouse.\n  The sage-grouse provision in this bill is meant to give the Fish and \nWildlife Service time to make a determination of whether there ought to \nbe a listing or not. The court has ordered them to make a determination \nby, I think, September 30. We are trying to give them the time \nnecessary.\n  This is going to affect 11 Western States. It is not going to affect \nMassachusetts, by the way, but it is going to affect 11 Western States \nsubstantially.\n  They have recently put out their resource management plans to the \nStates. There is a period in which the States have a chance to interact \nwith the Federal agency and raise their complaints and so forth about \nwhat the problems are with their resource management plans.\n  We are trying to give the Fish and Wildlife Service and the States--\nthe 11 Western States, by the way, not Massachusetts--the time to come \nup with a plan so that we don't list this bird.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service and the States--everybody, \nessentially--agree we don't want sage-grouse listed. The States have \nmade incredible progress and have made incredible sacrifices.\n  The State of Wyoming has taken, I want to say, millions of acres \nwhich have potential resources off the table in order to protect the \nsage-grouse. So we have taken extraordinary efforts to make sure that \nwe don't list this bird.\n  As far as the wolves are concerned, the fact is that the Fish and \nWildlife Service delisted the wolves. It was not us. We didn't want to \ngo against science. We are not going against science. We aren't trying \nto make any species become extinct.\n  It was the Fish and Wildlife Service in their use of science that \ndelisted the wolves. But guess what. Some people weren't happy with \nthat; so, they took them to court. And now we are in a court case. The \nsame thing happened in Idaho and in Montana.\n  This language doesn't take a species off the endangered species list. \nSome people think we are trying to delist species, and we are not. We \nare going back to the decision made by the Fish and Wildlife Service to \ndelist the wolves in the Great Lakes and in the State of Wyoming.\n  I think, if you want to talk about the cost and if you want to \ncomplain about what is going on here, you really ought to complain to \nthe plaintiffs who are causing all of this hassle with wolves when the \nStates have done exactly what they were supposed to do.\n  The wolf populations in the Great Lakes particularly have exploded. \nIn Idaho and Montana, they have exploded. In Wyoming, they have \nexploded. That is why the Fish and Wildlife Service delisted them.\n  This amendment is contrary to every bit of science that there is that \ndeals with endangered species. So I would urge my colleagues to reject \nthis amendment even though it doesn't affect Massachusetts.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to first comment that \nMassachusetts, at one time, was home to the Heath Hen, which is the \ngreater sage-grouse's cousin.\n  Because at that time we did not have an Endangered Species Act, that \nHeath Hen is now, unfortunately, extinct. So we have learned an \nimportant lesson about the great role the Endangered Species Act does \nplay to protect some of our remarkable species.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BEYER. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Chairman, despite what you may hear from some Members of \nCongress, gray wolves have not recovered. In a test by the Fish and \nWildlife Service to remove them from the Endangered Species Act, \nprotections for wolves have failed time and again.\n  Why? It is because scientific experts have shown and the courts have \nconfirmed that the best available science does not justify the removal \nof all ESA protections for gray wolves at this time.\n  In fact, the only instance in which wolves have been delisted has \nbeen through the unprecedented and unfortunate congressional action in \n2011 to remove protections from wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains.\n  These wolves are now endlessly persecuted by hunters and ranchers \ndespite the positive effects they have on the ecosystem and the minimal \ntoll they take on livestock.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Wolf-related tourism around Yellowstone generates more than $35 \nmillion annually for local economies, and recovery in the Pacific \nNorthwest is only beginning.\n\n[[Page H4808]]\n\n  This amendment would prevent Congress from directing the Fish and \nWildlife Service to reissue the delisting of wolves in the western \nGreat Lakes and Wyoming. Now is not the time for Congress to declare \nopen season on one of America's most iconic wild animals. Science, not \npolitics, should guide these delisting decisions.\n  By the way, wolves are not in Massachusetts, they are not in \nVirginia, and they never will be as long as we do not continue our \nefforts to protect wolves and allow them to occupy the old territories \nthey did a few hundred years ago.\n  This amendment would also allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to move \nforward with steps to protect the northern long-eared bat. Over the \npast decade, populations of the bat have declined 98 percent, mostly \nbecause of the deadly effects of white-nose syndrome. As a result, Fish \nand Wildlife Service recently listed the bat as a threatened species. \nWhile scientists and wildlife managers work to fight the spread of \nwhite-nose syndrome, it is important to ensure that the remaining bat \npopulations are safe from other threats.\n  The interim rule currently in effect governing taking of the bat is \nincredibly flexible and was developed in close coordination with \nindustry stakeholders, particularly the timber industry, to ensure that \neconomic activity is not negatively impacted.\n  The final rule is expected to be similarly flexible. The language in \nthis bill will only serve as a delay tactic, causing additional \nuncertainty for businesses and property owners, and this amendment \nwould effectively strike these unnecessary sections from the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. I appreciate the \ngentleman's comments. I do have some gray wolves in Idaho, Montana, \nWyoming, and other places that we will be happy to ship to you if you \nlike. In fact, we didn't have any in Idaho until Fish and Wildlife \nService decided that they were going to reintroduce them in Idaho.\n  When you say the minimal take that it has on cattle, wildlife, and \nother types of things, there were gray wolves in Idaho that one sheep \nrancher lost over 300 head of sheep in one night to some wolves. That \nends his business, essentially. So it is not a minimal take. If you \nlook at the calf-to-cow ratio of elk and deer in Idaho, the numbers \nhave been down substantially, particularly with elk because, guess \nwhat, they like elk, even though we were told that they will go after \ndeer and not elk. Wolves, I guess, like elk better than they do deer.\n  The gentleman says we need to depend on science, not Congress. \nCongress never delisted a species. We didn't delist the gray wolves in \nIdaho and Montana. It was the Fish and Wildlife Service using science. \nWhen you say the gray wolves have not recovered, where is your science? \nWhere do you get that? Where does that statement come from? Fish and \nWildlife Service that has done the investigations said yes, they have. \nSo do we just not trust them?\n  It is you people proposing this amendment that are going against \nscience. We are just trying to make sure that the science is protected, \nand politics doesn't enter. We appreciate the people of Virginia and \nthe people of Massachusetts trying to make sure that the wolves are \nhealthy in Idaho. I can guarantee you they are. They are not \npersecuted, as you said. Yes, they are hunted, but anybody who believed \nwe were going to introduce wolves into Idaho or Montana where they \nhadn't been for a number of years and you weren't going to have to \nmaintain population controls of them was living in a fantasyland.\n  Yes, we do have hunting seasons for wolves, as we do almost all \nspecies, but we have to maintain a certain population, and if that \npopulation isn't maintained, guess what. Fish and Wildlife takes over, \nand they go back on the endangered list. So it is not Congress that is \nmaking these decisions. It is Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that the riders \nin the underlying bill will do nothing to help our native species but, \ninstead, only serve to cause uncertainty and delay, undermining all the \nconcerted effort by many stakeholders, all seeking to avoid a listing, \nparticularly with the sage-grouse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer one final amendment to the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  The amendment is simple. It prohibits the EPA from providing funding \nto the United Nations Environment Programme. The United Nations \nEnvironment Programme, or UNEP--I would call it inept--has a history of \ntaking unusual and extreme policy positions, including advocating for \npopulation control.\n  The United Nations is typically funded in the State Department's \nbudget under contributions to international organizations, or CIL. The \nfunds appropriated by this act are meant to be used domestically, not \nas a slush fund to give to programs at the United Nations.\n  I will quickly highlight some of the names of the UNEP initiatives \nthat the EPA spent millions of dollars on. One is to promote \nenvironmental sound management worldwide. Another one is UNEP Regional \nProgram, Climate Benefits, Asia Pacific. There is even one called \nRussian Federation Support to the National Program of Action for the \nProtection of the Arctic. This last one is money that goes specifically \nto the Russian cause.\n  I will read from the EPA's own Web site the description of this \nprogram:\n\n       This project centers on protection of the Arctic \n     environment in Russia.\n       This work will cover three broad areas:\n       Number one, implementation of Russia's national plan of \n     action for protection of the Arctic marine environment from \n     anthropogenic pollution;\n       Number two, hazardous chemical management;\n       And, three, climate change mitigation adaptation and \n     awareness.\n\n  So let me get this straight. In addition to the billions we \ncontribute to the United Nations through the CIO account, the EPA is \nfunneling millions of tax dollars to this United Nations program, which \nthen gives the money to Russia, who then uses it to implement a Russian \nnational plan and for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and \nawareness.\n  U.S. taxpayers, do I need to say anything further why we need to stop \nthis? Let's keep the United States Environmental Protection Agency \nfocused on issues within the United States. Our favorite out-of-control \nagency need not be concerned with the Asia-Pacific region or with \nRussia.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this commonsense amendment that is \nendorsed by the Americans for Limited Government, the Eagle Forum, the \nTaxpayers Protection Alliance, the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts in \nproducing this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4809]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit any agency \nfrom using funds for the United Nations Environment Programme. Funds \nfor the U.N. are primarily provided through the State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs Subcommittee. The EPA administers \nabout $500,000 of international grants, not the millions or the \nbillions that were referred to in this particular bill. So I strongly \noppose the amendment.\n  I understand, as I said earlier, there is a small amount of funding \nadministered for the U.N. Environment Programme in this bill. The \nprimary source of funding for the international programs, I want to \nstress again, is in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nbill, not this bill.\n  So this amendment seeks to solve a problem that really doesn't exist \nin this bill, but jurisdictional questions aside, we must be an \ninternational partner with respect to the environment. Engagement with \nthe international community allows us to share and learn best practices \non how to manage toxic substances; international engagement helps set \ninternational standards to help our products compete globally; and, \nmore importantly, pollution knows no boundaries. It does not respect \ninternational borders.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, acid rain was a problem both in the United \nStates and Canada, and through domestic legislation and international \nwork with Canada, we have reduced the amount of acid rain that falls \nupon the United States and Canada. Now, right now in my home State of \nMinnesota, we are under a high pollution warning. The culprit is, \nsadly, a series of forest fires that are raging to the north border of \nus in Saskatchewan. Now, if we are going to be committed to clean air \nand clean water on the Canadian-U.S. border, we must be engaged both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  So as a proud Minnesotan and a proud Member of the United States \nCongress, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to work \ntogether in partnership.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Let's set the record straight. CRS, hardly a partisan \neffort, since 2003 reports they spent over $6 million in foreign \nagencies in this very fund. Imagine that. The facts are only convenient \nwhen they help us on our side.\n  If we are going to have a discussion about this, let's put it in the \nState Department budget and let's talk about it, but let's not hide it \nin the EPA. Let's keep the EPA's budget and dealings right here in the \nUnited States where they belong. They hardly have a track record of \nsuccess here in the States.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to stress again that, in \nthis bill, there is $500,000. And I would also like to stress, when it \ncomes to regulating waters in the Great Lakes, our tributary rivers and \nbasins on the northern border--and I am sure the same thing, I can't \nspeak with as much eloquence as to what is happening on our southern \nborder--we need to have these international interlocutors. I would \nappreciate the opportunity for my State and for the Great Lakes States \nto be able to continue the strong partnership with our Canadian \npartners.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, with an over $18 trillion debt, when is enough \nenough? If we are going to talk about foreign expenditures of dollars, \nlet's put it in the State Department budget and make sure we have an \nopen and honest conversation, but it does not belong here. We have to \nstart concentrating on what is important to the United States, not \nRussia. I guess that is Putin's kind of game is that we clean up his \nmesses for him.\n  I ask everybody to adopt this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n            limitation on use of funds with respect to ivory\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 120 of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, at the inception of the debate and \ndiscussion regarding this appropriations bill, I indicated I would \noffer an amendment to prevent language in the bill from driving the \nextinction of the African elephants.\n  I expect the administration to release its proposed ivory rule this \nmonth, and it deserves the support of every Member of this Chamber. \nThis rider that is currently in the language of the bill is another \nunfounded attack on an endangered species that our Nation's top \nscientific experts have concluded will go extinct without the \nprotection of the Endangered Species Act, under which this rule is \nbeing promulgated.\n  I mentioned in my previous statement the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService recently destroyed a one-ton stockpile of illegal elephant \nivory, most of it seized in Philadelphia from an antique dealer named \nVictor Gordon.\n  Gordon imported and sold ivory from freshly killed African elephants \nin violation of U.S. law and the laws of the countries where the \nelephants were poached, and the ivory was stolen. The ivory was \ndoctored so that it looked old enough to pass through a loophole in the \nlaw. All of this ivory is illegal. All of it is nearly impossible to \ndistinguish from antique ivory, and anyone who bought it from Gordon \nand resells it or buys it from a new owner is contributing to the \nongoing slaughter of elephants and the criminal trafficking of ivory \nthat supports organized crime and terrorism.\n  The only way to keep U.S. citizens from being involved in this \nelephant poaching and trafficking crisis is to eliminate the commercial \nimport, export, and trade of African elephant ivory in our country. \nEnding the commercial ivory trade will set an example for China and \nother countries to follow, but they will not act until we do.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Ending the trade will not take away personal possessions, nor will it \nbar the movement of musical instruments or museum pieces; but to save \nelephants, we have to eliminate the value of ivory.\n  Sadly, this rider is just another example of House Republicans \ndriving the extinction of wildlife one species at a time.\n  Please join me in voting ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's thoughtful \ncomments regarding crisis levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking \nand the need to do something about it. This is a deadly serious matter \nwith national security implications. That is why this bill has \nincreased funding by $15 million since fiscal year 2013 in order to \nfight wildlife poachers and traffickers.\n  Without question, Republicans do not want to see elephants go \nextinct; but when the Fish and Wildlife Service made the unilateral \ndetermination to ban the trade and transport of products containing \nivory that have been in the United States legally for years, we heard \nfrom orchestra musicians, art museums, wildlife conservation \norganizations, collectors of fine antiques from chess pieces to pool \ncues to firearms, and nearly everyone in every organization in between.\n  They are united in support for elephants, but they are also united in \ntheir opposition to new Federal restrictions on products that contain \nivory legally obtained. The reality is family heirlooms and rare \nmusical instruments didn't cause the problem, and\n\n[[Page H4810]]\n\nthe Fish and Wildlife Service should be acknowledging as much.\n  This bill keeps the status quo, allowing for continued legal trade \nand transport so that collectors, musicians, and others can get on with \ntheir lives until the Fish and Wildlife Service writes a rule that \nreflects the legitimate concerns of law-abiding U.S. citizens.\n  The administration is rumored to be just days away from publishing a \nrevised rule to address most of these concerns. If that is the case and \nif the revised rule solves the problem, then there will be no need for \nthis provision in the final conference report later in the year.\n  In any case, I remain fully committed to working with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to find a reasonable solution moving \nforward. In the meantime, I must oppose this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also thank the \nchairman for his comments.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of Mr. Grijalva's \namendment. The U.S. is the world's second largest market for ivory. \nOnly China has a greater demand.\n  In February of last year, President Obama announced a ban on the \ncommercial trade of elephant ivory. This ban is the best way to ensure \nthat U.S. markets do not contribute to the further decline of African \nelephants in the wild.\n  The African elephant population has declined by an estimated 50 \npercent over the last 40 years, with approximately 35,000 elephants \npoached every year. That amounts to one elephant poached every 15 \nminutes.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has been undertaking a series of \nadministrative actions, including a proposed rule in order to implement \nthe ban. Section 120 would prevent the Fish and Wildlife Service from \nimplementing this rule and other policies necessary to crack down on \nthe domestic illegal ivory market.\n  I cannot understand why we would not do everything possible to stop \nthe illegal slaughter of African elephants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Grijalva's amendment, which would \nprevent section 120 from being enacted. We must allow the FWS to \ncontinue its efforts to prevent the extinction of the African elephant.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to stop the slaughter of \nAfrican elephants, we need to stop the illegal trade in ivory.\n  This rider has nothing to do with the unprecedented poaching crisis, \nand it ignores the impact of the illegal ivory trade within the United \nStates and the way that it is impacting the African elephants' \nsurvival.\n  The rider also undermines the United States' ability to push other \ncountries with significant ivory markets--like China, Vietnam, and \nThailand--to take stronger actions to restrict ivory trade.\n  In fact, according to a recent Washington Post article, China has \nsignaled that its actions to further restrict ivory trade were \ncontingent on what the United States does to regulate our domestic \ntrade.\n  It is in the national interest of the United States to combat \nwildlife trafficking and to ensure that we don't contribute to the \ngrowing global demand for elephant ivory, which is also funding \nterrorism around the world.\n  We need to come up with a responsible set of regulations that protect \nelephants, while making accommodations to allow certain activities to \ncontinue that do not pose a threat to elephants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Grijalva amendment.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Smith of Texas\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                 environmental programs and management\n\n       Sec. __. Of the funds provided for ``Environmental \n     Protection Agency--Environmental Programs and Management'', \n     not more than $1,713,500 may be available for the Immediate \n     Office of the Administrator and not more than $3,581,500 may \n     be available for the Office of Congressional and \n     Intergovernmental Relations and the aggregate amount \n     otherwise provided under such heading is reduced by \n     $2,735,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment together \nwith my colleagues and fellow committee chairmen, Mr. Conaway from \nTexas and Mr. Chaffetz from Utah.\n  The amendment addresses the Environmental Protection Agency's \ncontinuing pattern of obstruction and delay in response to \ncongressional oversight.\n  Since January 2014, the EPA has proposed or finalized new, far-\nreaching rules that impact almost every aspect of the American economy. \nThese rules involve major expansions of Federal authority, massive \ncosts to the economy, and are based on secret science that the EPA \nkeeps hidden from external review or scrutiny.\n  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to perform rigorous \noversight of the executive branch. However, as chairman of the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology, nearly every request for \ninformation I make to EPA is greeted with repeated delays, partial \nresponses, or outright refusals to cooperate.\n  Earlier this year, the committee was forced to issue a subpoena to \nobtain information related to Administrator Gina McCarthy's deletion of \nalmost 6,000 text messages sent and received on her official Agency \nmobile device. She claimed that all but one was personal.\n  Most recently, the committee requested information and documents \nrelated to the EPA's development of the waters of the U.S. rule and the \nAgency's inappropriate lobbying of and collaboration with outside \norganizations to generate grassroots support.\n  The EPA again failed to provide the requested documents. The \ncommittee was forced to notice its intention to issue a subpoena.\n  However, producing documents in bits and pieces after months or years \nof delay are not the actions of an open and transparent administration. \nThey are the actions of an Agency and administration that has something \nto hide.\n  It is clear that the EPA does not see its job as facilitating \ntransparency and oversight. It seems to believe its mission is to \ndelay, obstruct, and otherwise attempt to stonewall any attempt by \nCongress to fulfill its constitutional oversight obligation on behalf \nof the American people.\n  Congress should not support such an agency. We are taking further \naction with this amendment to reduce funding for EPA's offices. The EPA \nmust refocus its efforts on transparency and cooperation with Congress \nand the American people. At that point, we could consider restoring \ntheir funding.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment clearly is a Republican attempt to cut \nfunding from the Environmental Protection Agency. As an agency that \nprotects the air we all breathe, protects the water we drink, the fish \nwe eat, it means that the EPA works every day to protect the health of \nevery American.\n\n[[Page H4811]]\n\n  This amendment is clearly an attack against the administration for \nwork that they have been doing to enforce those protections.\n  It is entirely counterproductive to complain about a lack of timely \nresponse from the EPA and then turn around and slash the very funding \nthat allows the EPA Administrator and Agency staff to respond to our \nconcerns.\n  Crippling cuts to the office of congressional relations will not only \nmake it more difficult for Members of Congress to get our questions \nanswered--and those of our constituents--by slashing the office of \nintergovernmental agency affairs, this amendment would make it harder \nfor State and local officials to gather the information they need to \nprotect their communities.\n  I don't really believe we want to tell the EPA that they should cut \nback on meeting and getting recommendations from local government \nadvisory committees or tell our elected officials at a State level that \nthey are going to have even a harder time getting a hold of someone at \nthe EPA to help them form agreements to address their priority needs.\n  Our States have a responsibility with the EPA for protecting public \nhealth and the environment, and this amendment would undermine those \npartnerships. This amendment would make it more difficult for the \npeople's representatives at the Federal, State, and local level to \nreach out and get support and answers from the EPA in order to protect \nthe health of their constituents.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing these cuts, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz), the chairman of the Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Smith of Texas and Mr. \nConaway of Texas for their good work on this.\n  In the year 2015, five letters were sent to the EPA from the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee regarding the waters of the \nUnited States rulemaking. All went unanswered until the Science \nCommittee threatened to subpoena.\n  Probably what is the most egregious and most offensive to us is even \nwhen we do bipartisan work--in a bipartisan letter, we asked the EPA to \nprovide a response to a request concerning collections of use of fees \nand fines--and even when we do it in a bipartisan way, those go \nunresponded to. They failed to even provide a staff briefing on the \ncollection and use of fines and penalties, despite repeated requests.\n  We hear on the floor: Well, you can't take away their money, then \nthey won't able to respond.\n  With the money, they don't respond, so they obviously don't need the \nmoney if they are not going to respond--even when we do so in a very \nprofessional, bipartisan way, asking legitimate questions about the use \nof these funds and how this Agency works.\n  In the year 2013, requests were filed for information regarding \nactions of a previous Administrator, among other document requests. \nResponses were inadequate, and a subpoena was filed.\n  The EPA only began searching for the documents 6 months after a \nsubpoena was issued, 6 months after this happened. This is just not \ntolerable. There needs to be consequences for this. They obviously \ndon't need these funds if they are going to be so unresponsive even \nwhen we do so in a bipartisan way.\n  I would urge the passage of the Smith amendment. I think it is a good \namendment. It is a responsible way to move forward. I appreciate the \ngood work the Appropriations Committee has done in their support and \ntheir work. I, again, thank Mr. Smith for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a new contract or agreement or to \n     administer a portion of an existing contract or agreement \n     with a concessioner, a cooperating association, or any other \n     entity that provides for the sale in any facility within a \n     unit of the National Park System of a non-educational item \n     that depicts a Confederate flag on it.\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, that is not the revised amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw this amendment?\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. If it can be substituted with the proper amendment, yes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order on this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, you should have the proper amendment now.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a new contract or agreement or to \n     administer a portion of an existing contract or agreement \n     with a concessioner, a cooperating association, or any other \n     entity that provides for the sale in any facility within a \n     unit of the National Park System of an item with a \n     Confederate flag as a stand-alone feature.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, the tragic shooting in Charleston, South \nCarolina, has forced a national conversation about symbols like the \nConfederate battle flag that represent racism, slavery, and division.\n  Now, like you, I applaud leaders in South Carolina and other Southern \nStates, both Democrat and Republican, who have called on their States \nto end the display of the Confederate flag on government property, \nincluding State houses and license plates. With the consideration of \nthe Interior Appropriations bill, this House now has an opportunity to \nadd its voice by ending the promotion of the cruel, racist legacy of \nthe Confederacy.\n  The National Park Service has asked its gift shops, bookstores, and \nother concessionaires to voluntarily end the sale of standalone items, \nsuch as flags, pins, and belt buckles that contain imagery of the \nConfederate flag. While many concessionaires have agreed to do this, I \nam dismayed by reports that some will continue to sell items with \nConfederate flag imagery. This amendment to the Interior Appropriations \nbill would end these sales. It would prevent the National Park Service \nfrom allowing the continued promotion of the Confederacy through these \nsymbols.\n  Major American retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and eBay are already \ntaking their own steps to ban sales of this type of merchandise, and we \nnow have an obligation to ensure that the Federal agencies that we \noversee act with the same moral clarity.\n  Mr. Chairman, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Without objection, the \ngentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. The language now in this amendment is consistent with \nthe National Park Service policy, and I would support this language as \nyou presently have it drafted. I would urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. \nMcCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  This amendment, as Chairman Calvert pointed out, is consistent with\n\n[[Page H4812]]\n\nthe recent National Park Service actions to further limit the display \nof the Confederate flag in units of the National Park system.\n  Previous National Park Service policy had already provided that the \nConfederate flag would not be flown alone for many park flagpoles.\n  On June 25, Park Director Jon Jarvis further requested that the \nConfederate flag sale items be removed from the National Park \nbookstores and gift shops. This also follows a decision by several \nlarge national retailers, including Walmart, Amazon, and Sears, to stop \nselling items with Confederate flags on them.\n  I agree with these decisions and commend those involved for their \nprompt action.\n  While in certain and very limited instances it may be appropriate in \nnational parks to display an image of the Confederate flag in its \nhistorical context, a general display or sale of Confederate flags is \ninappropriate and divisive.\n  I support limiting their use, and I rise in support of the amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Collins of Georgia\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to reduce or terminate any of the propagation \n     programs listed in the March, 2013, National Fish Hatchery \n     System Strategic Hatchery and Workforce Planning Report.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an \namendment that recognizes and supports the important role of fish \nhatcheries nationwide.\n  Before I get to the amendment, I want to thank you, Mr. Calvert, for \nthe hard work of the committee and your recognition of the importance \nof fish hatcheries already there. I also want to thank my friend from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford) for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  My amendment prohibits funds in the bill from being used to reduce or \nterminate any of the existing propagation programs listed in the March \n2013 National Fish Hatchery System Strategic Hatchery and Workforce \nPlanning Report.\n  This report raised serious concerns that the Fish and Wildlife \nService view hatcheries, and particularly mitigation hatcheries, as a \nlow priority program. Personally, I believe that stocking the \ntailwaters, streams, lakes, and rivers of America should be a higher \npriority. Hatcheries provide an important service, including providing \nour Nation's anglers with the recreational enjoyment and opportunities \nto catch fish; and they can be particularly vital to economic growth in \nrural areas, including northeast Georgia.\n  The importance of our Nation's hatcheries is obvious when you look at \nthe Chattahoochee National Forest Fish Hatchery. This hatchery is \nlocated back home in Georgia's Ninth Congressional District. It stocks \nthe tailwaters of multiple projects for the Army Corps of Engineers and \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority with rainbow trout for the enjoyment of \n160,000 anglers per year. Without this facility, the tailwaters would \nbe barren.\n  The Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery is a critical economic \ndriver in the quiet mountain town of Suches, Georgia, and the \nsurrounding community. This rural town in Fannin County doesn't have \nany major stores or banks, but it does have the hatchery. The hatchery \nhas generated over $30 million in total economic input on just $740,000 \nin investment. It has a $40 return on investment for every dollar spent \nand provides enjoyment to many, many people.\n  The Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery plays an integral role in \nthe sustainability of businesses and communities in northeast Georgia. \nFrom providing environmental education and public outreach \nopportunities to visitors, school groups, and various other \norganizations to facilitating recreational opportunities, northeast \nGeorgia would not be the same without this facility.\n  The work at the hatchery in Suches is one example of the importance \nof propagation programs at national fish hatcheries nationwide. These \nhatcheries are job creators and economic growth engines. They provide \ncritical services to rural America and play an important educational \nrole. They support anglers with recreational services and responsibly \nstock the rivers to keep the habitats in order. Despite this, however, \nthe Department of Fish and Wildlife places propagation programs, \nincluding those in the Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery, among the \nlowest of their funding priorities.\n  My amendment simply ensures that funds to the Fish and Wildlife \nService are consistent with the agency's mission and statutory \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I want the gentleman from Georgia to know \nthat I support his amendment and would urge its adoption.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n    limitation on use of funds in contravention of executive orders \n                        regarding climate change\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be expended in contravention of Executive Order 13514 of \n     October 5, 2009 or Executive Order 13653 of November 1, 2013.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The sum of the harmful consequences of global climate change is the \nexistential crisis of our generation and, perhaps, of our century.\n  Global temperature changes are already causing prolonged droughts, \nextreme weather events, and rising sea levels. Tens of millions of \npeople, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable among us, are at \nrisk unless we act to reverse the disastrous effects of climate change.\n  Our best scientists and our Pope are warning us that unless carbon \nemissions are dramatically cut, we will see ever rising sea levels, \never more extreme weather, and ever worsening public health, poor air \nquality, the spread of tropical diseases, lung and heart and heat \nstress illnesses, and death.\n  Several weeks ago, the EPA issued a comprehensive report quantifying \nthe economic costs of a changing climate across 20 sectors of the \nAmerican economy. Among the findings, the report found that, by 2100, \nmitigating greenhouse global gas emissions could avoid 12,000 deaths \nper year that are associated with extreme temperatures in just 49 U.S. \ncities compared to a future with no emission reductions.\n  The estimated damages to coastal property from sea level rise and \nstorm surge in the contiguous U.S. are $5 trillion through the year \n2100 in a future without carbon emissions.\n  The Department of the Interior also recently released a report \nrevealing that over $40 billion of National Park infrastructure and \nhistoric and cultural resources could be at risk due to sea level rise \ncaused by climate change.\n  Taking acts to address climate change is particularly crucial in \nurban districts that border waterways, like\n\n[[Page H4813]]\n\nmine, where we are already seeing environmental effects. Now is the \ntime when the U.S. should be deepening its commitment to reducing \nclimate change pollution.\n  Federal agency actions, including those of the agencies named in this \nbill, have major impacts on our contributions and reactions to global \nwarning. It is imperative, then, that these agencies maintain \nmindfulness of those impacts and that they seek to avoid actions that \nadd significant amounts of carbon pollution to the atmosphere or \nactions that put people and property in the vulnerable position with \nrespect to climate change.\n  For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment to ensure \nthat no funds are spent on activities that are not in compliance with \nthe President's 2009 executive order on greenhouse gas emissions and \nenergy efficiency and the 2013 executive order on climate change \nadaptation.\n  These orders require agencies to take global warming into account \nwhen making decisions and will save taxpayer dollars while making our \ncommunities safer and cleaner.\n  Our agencies need to be climate smart, because making our Federal \ninvestments and actions climate smart reduces our fiscal exposure to \nthe impacts of climate change.\n  It is the right thing to do to run an efficient and effective \ngovernment. It is the right thing to do to return the highest value to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  It is simple: smarter investments up front mean we can reduce future \ncosts. Communities across the Nation are thinking this way. We need to \nensure that the same is true for the Federal Government.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment to ensure that Federal \nagencies are operating in the manner that accounts for climate change.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, earlier, we debated whether or not to \ncontinue a bipartisan reporting requirement in the bill on climate \nchange expenditures. My colleague on the other side of the aisle wanted \nto remove the requirements, which would have reduced transparency. Now \nhe wants to ensure that funds are being expended on climate and \nefficiency executive orders issued by the President. So I am left to \nwonder whether my colleagues would prefer to know if funds are spent on \nthese programs or not.\n  Regardless, this amendment is simply unnecessary. The President did \nnot consult Congress on these executive orders, so, if anything, we \nshould defund the programs until Congress can have an appropriate \npolicy debate.\n  I see no reason to include this language, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no.''\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from \nCalifornia (Mr. Huffman).\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment which will ensure \nthat no funds are spent on activities that are not in compliance with \nthe President's executive order on greenhouse gas emissions and energy \nefficiency and the 2013 executive order on climate change adaptation.\n  These orders require agencies to simply take global warming into \naccount when making decisions. This will save taxpayers lots of money \nwhile making our communities safer and cleaner.\n  Fighting climate change has to be regarded as the biggest imperative \nof our time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  My State of California has stepped up to this issue and taken \nimportant bold steps to confront it, including passing Assembly Bill \n32, the world's most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction policy. At the \nFederal level, President Obama's efforts, through these orders, are \ncritical steps toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing \nclimate change.\n  Ensuring compliance with these measures is the least we can do on \nthis critical issue; and, frankly, we should be doing much more. So I \nurge my colleagues to support the gentleman from Virginia's (Mr. Beyer) \namendment and continue this effort to combat climate change.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       across-the-board reduction\n\n       Sec. __. Each amount made available by this Act is hereby \n     reduced by 1 percent.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the \ncommittee for the excellent job that they have done under Chairman \nCalvert's leadership with bringing this appropriations bill in under \nbudget. It is $3 billion below the President's request. There is still \n$30.17 billion in proposed funding in this bill.\n  I come before you today to offer an amendment that I regularly offer \nto these appropriations bills, which is a 1 percent across-the-board \nspending cut. Let's go in and let's take one more penny out of every \ndollar and use that to bolster the good work that our committee has \ndone.\n  You know, one of the things that I like about this bill is there is a \n9 percent reduction in the EPA budget compared to last year. We all \nknow we need to rein in the EPA. We are all for clean air, clean water, \nclean environment. We have different ways of getting there.\n  The burdensome regulations that are out there negatively impact--they \nnegatively impact our communities. But we know there is more work that \nwe have to do on this $30 billion budget.\n  My amendment would reduce the discretionary budget authority by $292 \nmillion and would reduce outlays by $193 million.\n  Now, I know that this is not a popular amendment with a lot of those \nwho feel like we have cut, cut, cut and we can't cut any more.\n  I disagree with that. I think that you can look at the GAO reports \nand the inspector general reports and see there is plenty of room to \ncut. We just recently went into the last 4 years of inspector general \nreports. Guess what. We found $165 million of identified waste in the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  It is time to engage our rank-and-file employees in our Federal \nGovernment, to make them a team and a partner with us as we work on \nthis issue of getting our budget right-sized.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. While I commend my colleague for her consistent work to \nprotect taxpayer dollars, this is not an approach I can support.\n  While the President may have proposed a budget that exceeds this \nbill, the increases were paid for with proposals and gimmicks that \nwould never be enacted. This bill makes tough choices within an \nallocation that adheres to current law.\n\n[[Page H4814]]\n\n  While difficult trade-offs had to be made, the bill in its current \nform balances our needs. These trade-offs were carefully weighed for \ntheir respective impacts and are responsible.\n  We prioritize funding for fire suppression, PILT, and meeting our \nmoral obligations in Indian Country, yet the gentlewoman's amendment \nproposes an across-the-board cut on every one of those programs.\n  This amendment makes no distinction between where we need to be \nspending to invest in energy independence and where we need to limit \nspending to meet our deficit reduction goals.\n  And, I may point out, the spending problem is not within these \ndiscretionary appropriation bills, which we are debating at the present \ntime. It exists primarily in entitlement spending.\n  So I hope we can spend as much energy on the entitlement side of the \nbudget as we are on the discretionary side of the budget. If so, we \nwould fix our budget problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Chair, this amendment I strongly oppose. It institutes a 1 \npercent across-the-board cut.\n  A few interesting things about the Interior bill. This bill before us \ntoday is $2 billion, $2 billion below 2010-enacted levels. And when you \nadjust this bill for inflation, it is at 2005 levels.\n  This amendment indiscriminately cuts programs without any thought to \nthe merit of the program that is contained in this bill.\n  For instance, this would result in fewer patients being able to be \nseen at the Indian Health Service; fewer safety inspectors ensuring \naccidents do not occur; deferred maintenance on our Nation's drinking \nwater and sanitation infrastructure, which is already underfunded in \nthis bill.\n  More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and \npublic lands will just be halted, and associated jobs would be lost \nwith it.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is already underfunded, underfunded. \nWhen adjusted for inflation, it is at 2005 levels. This amendment would \nnot encourage agencies to do more with less. It would simply force \nagencies and our constituents to do less with less.\n  So I urge Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, just a couple of comments.\n  Underfunded? No. We are overspent in this town. We have $18 trillion \nworth of debt, and it is time to get a handle on that.\n  Moral obligations? How about the moral obligation to our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  Admiral Mullen has said the greatest threat to our Nation's security \nis our Nation's debt.\n  Let's put the focus on our priorities: keeping our sovereignty and \nkeeping our Nation safe and secure.\n  This is something we do for our children. It is something we can do \nfor our national security. A penny on a dollar to get this spending \nunder control.\n  Our approach? Guess what. State and local government use this all the \ntime. They can't go print money and run up debt.\n  When I was in the State Senate in Tennessee, what did we do? We \ndidn't go home until we balanced the budget because we had an \nobligation to get it done right the first time, before we walked out \nthe door.\n  And I do hope that we will put attention on our entitlements. But \nthat is no excuse for not addressing what is in front of us today. To \nnot address what is in front of us today is to kick the can down the \nroad.\n  I have a lot of constituents who aren't making and taking home as \nmuch as they were in 2005. They think we should reduce Federal spending \neven more, reduce the Federal workforce even more, because government \nis getting too expensive to afford.\n  Let's engage Federal employees in this process. It has worked for the \nStates. It will work for the Federal Government. Let's get our fiscal \nhouse in order. A good place to start is right here with this amendment \nthat would save another $193 million in outlays and $292 million in \ndiscretionary budget authority.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, the last point. I appreciate the \ngentlewoman's concern about the deficit that we have.\n  When I came here 24 years ago, 40 percent of our expenditures were on \nthe entitlement side of the budget. Today it is over 60 percent, over \n60 percent. So we need to attack that side of the budget line.\n  If we placed as much energy on entitlement spending as we have on \ndiscretionary, not only would the budget be balanced, but we would be \nmoving toward paying off our national debt.\n  With that, I reluctantly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHeck of Nevada) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, \nenvironment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4783-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4783-H4814]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CALVERT.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 77, line 14, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $1,000,000)(increased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Chair, this amendment takes $1 million out of \nthe Forest Service land acquisition account and then, for technical \nreasons, inserts it back into the same account with the intent to \nidentify unused land for potential sale.\n  The United States Federal Government currently owns around 640 \nmillion acres of land. That is just a number. But that is 27 percent of \nthe landmass in the United States, owned by Uncle Sam. That is the same \nsize as all of Western Europe, if you can imagine that, that being 27 \npercent of the United States landmass. The Forest Service alone owns \nover 230 million acres of this Federal land.\n  This amendment is very simple. All it does is to have the Federal \nGovernment examine the land that it has in its possession for the \npotential sale back to Americans so that Americans can own America.\n  We are not talking about National Forests. We are not talking about \nthe Grand Canyon. We are talking about unused land that is owned by the \nFederal Government.\n  It will have the Federal Government go through that land--27 percent \nof the landmass in the country--and decide whether some of that might \nactually be better to be in the possession and the property of \nAmericans so that, if Americans then own the land, that land in some \nState--like Utah--can then be developed by Americans, and then those \npeople can pay taxes on the land that would go to the State of Utah, \nfor example. Right now the land is unused. It is not able to be \nproductive.\n  So that is what this amendment would do: have the Forest Service \nstudy the possibility of selling some of that unused land back to the \nUnited States.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 79, line 17, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(increased by $1,000,000) (decreased by $1,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Chair, we still see approximately 3,000 deaths, \n17,000 injuries, and $3 billion spent annually as a result of wildfires \nacross the country.\n  In many ways, wildfires lack parity with nearly every other natural \ndisaster and are hugely underfunded when it comes to mitigation, \nprevention, and suppression.\n  Despite the fact the fires often occur in rural communities with \nsmaller populations, wildfires demand intensive resources, equipment, \nand infrastructure.\n  The Volunteer Fire Assistance grant program is critical to moving the \nneedle on wildfire management and supporting the men and women who \nserve in our volunteer fire agencies, including in my district in \nColorado. Though this grant program is small and oriented towards \nlesser trafficked communities, its impact is incredible.\n  The Volunteer Fire Assistance program provides matching funds to \nvolunteer fire departments protecting communities with 10,000 or fewer \nresidents to purchase equipment and training for use in wildland fire \nsuppression.\n  Volunteer fire departments provide nearly 80 percent of the initial \nattack on wildfires across the United States, but, unfortunately, these \nvolunteer fire departments frequently lack the financial resources. And \n$1 million makes an enormous difference for our volunteer fire \ndepartments across the country.\n  Unfortunately, in recent years, Federal funding for volunteer fire \ndepartments to prepare for wildland fire suppression has dwindled. VFA \nhas seen funding reduced from $16 million in FY 2010 to $15.6 million \nin 2011 and approximately $13 million in FY 2012-2015.\n  Additionally, the Rural Fire Assistance program, which has \nhistorically been funded at $7 to $10 million per year and provided \nmatching grants to fire departments that agreed to assist in responding \nto wildland fires on Federal lands, hasn't been funded since FY 2010.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The reservation of the point of order is withdrawn.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Chair, Federal support is critical to ensure \nvolunteer fire departments are able to safely and effectively respond \nto wildland fires.\n  The bipartisan amendment I offer today with my colleagues, \nRepresentatives Ruiz of California and Peter King of New York, would \nhelp ensure that we have stronger support for our volunteer fire \ndepartments across our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that has been \nsupported by the Congressional Fire Service Institute, the \nInternational Association of Fire Chiefs, and National Volunteer Fire \nCouncil.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                flame wildfire suppression reserve fund\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       For necessary expenses for large fire suppression \n     operations of the Department of Agriculture and as a reserve \n     fund for suppression and Federal emergency response \n     activities, $315,000,000, to remain available until expended: \n     Provided, That such amounts are only available for transfer \n     to the ``Wildland Fire Management'' account following a \n     declaration by the Secretary in accordance with section 502 \n     of the FLAME Act of 2009 (43 U.S.C. 1748a).\n\n               administrative provisions, forest service\n\n                     (including transfers of funds)\n\n       Appropriations to the Forest Service for the current fiscal \n     year shall be available for: (1) purchase of passenger motor \n     vehicles; acquisition of passenger motor vehicles from excess \n     sources, and hire of such vehicles; purchase, lease, \n     operation, maintenance, and acquisition of aircraft to \n     maintain the operable fleet for use in Forest Service \n     wildland fire programs and other Forest Service programs; \n     notwithstanding other provisions of law, existing aircraft \n     being replaced may be sold, with proceeds derived or trade-in \n     value used to offset the purchase price for the replacement \n     aircraft; (2) services pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 2225, and not to \n     exceed $100,000 for employment under 5 U.S.C. 3109; (3) \n     purchase, erection, and alteration of buildings and other \n     public improvements (7 U.S.C. 2250); (4) acquisition of land, \n     waters, and interests therein pursuant to 7 U.S.C. 428a; (5) \n     for expenses pursuant to the Volunteers in the National \n     Forest Act of 1972 (16 U.S.C. 558a, 558d, and 558a note); (6) \n     the cost of uniforms as authorized by 5 U.S.C. 5901-5902; and \n     (7) for debt collection contracts in accordance with 31 \n     U.S.C. 3718(c).\n       Any appropriations or funds available to the Forest Service \n     may be transferred to the Wildland Fire Management \n     appropriation for forest firefighting, emergency \n     rehabilitation of burned-over or damaged lands or waters \n     under its jurisdiction, and fire preparedness due to severe \n     burning conditions upon the Secretary's notification of the \n     House and Senate Committees on Appropriations that all fire \n     suppression funds appropriated under the headings ``Wildland \n     Fire Management''\n\n[[Page H4786]]\n\n     and ``FLAME Wildfire Suppression Reserve Fund'' will be \n     obligated within 30 days: Provided, That all funds used \n     pursuant to this paragraph must be replenished by a \n     supplemental appropriation which must be requested as \n     promptly as possible.\n       Funds appropriated to the Forest Service shall be available \n     for assistance to or through the Agency for International \n     Development in connection with forest and rangeland research, \n     technical information, and assistance in foreign countries, \n     and shall be available to support forestry and related \n     natural resource activities outside the United States and its \n     territories and possessions, including technical assistance, \n     education and training, and cooperation with U.S., private, \n     and international organizations.

Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 416.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, the overwhelming scientific consensus is \nthat climate change is real. Leaders of the communities of faith, such \nas His Holiness the Pope, are now urging us to take this issue very \nseriously.\n  No matter how often the fossil fuel industry whispers that we have \nnothing to worry about, no matter how much manufactured science they \ngin up to create doubt, climate change is real.\n  We should have begun assessing the costs of climate change decades \nago, but we did not. The legislation before us today would require a \nreport on climate change expenditures. But the purpose of this section \nis not to assess the impacts of climate change; the purpose is to root \nout climate funding in the budget, so that next year's Interior bill \ncan prohibit that spending.\n  Madam Chair, the report requirement as written is not only pointless, \nit is counterproductive. The Obama administration is open about \nresponding to climate change. Most of their climate expenditures are \nclearly labeled and can be discovered by simply reading their budget \nrequest. For the remainder, I would be happy to write the President \nasking him to list these programs, and I suspect he would be pleased to \nanswer.\n  As written, this reporting requirement is a waste of time. We should \nbe instead asking the administration to report back to us on the costs \nof climate change to our health, our environment, and our economy.\n  Earlier this week, the White House issued a report showing that its \nefforts to reduce air pollution and climate change--efforts opposed by \nHouse Republicans, I might add--would provide billions of dollars in \nhealth benefits and save hundreds of thousands of lives.\n  A report also out this week from the National Park Service showed \nthat $90 billion of National Park resources are at risk from sea level \nrise caused by global warming, and we all know about the historic \ndrought in California and the lingering costs of recovery from \nSuperstorm Sandy.\n  A full assessment of all the costs of inaction would help inform the \nCongress and the American people about what steps we must take \nimmediately to ensure that climate change does not bring our country to \nits knees. Unfortunately, this bill does not ask for that assessment.\n  Instead, Madam Chair, the section my amendment would strike would \nundertake some kind of witch hunt to root out the meager funding we \nhave in place to respond to this challenge. To support this section is \nto deny climate change.\n  I would tell my colleagues, all the constituent services you provide, \nall the money you can raise, the votes you cast, and the laws you pass \nwill amount to nothing if you are on the wrong side of history on \nclimate change. Climate deniers will join a long list of political \nfigures who failed to respond to the most serious challenge of their \ntime and so are labeled as failures for all time.\n  Therefore, I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment to strike the \nreporting language in the bill, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, this provision shouldn't be controversial. \nThe language has been included in our enacted bills on a bipartisan \nbasis since 2010. The language simply requires that programs and \nactivities dedicated to climate change are reported in a transparent \nway so the American people know what we are spending their tax dollars \non.\n  With so many climate change programs being initiated, it is important \nto know what is being done across the government to avoid redundancy, \nand there is certainly a significant amount of redundancy in some of \nthese climate change studies. It is in the bill so the committee can \nhave the information it needs to provide critical oversight.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                      prohibition on use of funds\n\n       Sec. 417.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds made available\n\n[[Page H4791]]\n\n     in this Act or any other Act may be used to promulgate or \n     implement any regulation requiring the issuance of permits \n     under title V of the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7661 et seq.) \n     for carbon dioxide, nitrous oxide, water vapor, or methane \n     emissions resulting from biological processes associated with \n     livestock production.\n\n                 greenhouse gas reporting restrictions\n\n       Sec. 418.  Notwithstanding any other provision of law, none \n     of the funds made available in this or any other Act may be \n     used to implement any provision in a rule, if that provision \n     requires mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions from \n     manure management systems.\n\n                             recreation fee\n\n       Sec. 419.  Section 810 of the Federal Lands Recreation \n     Enhancement Act (16 U.S.C. 6809) is amended by striking ``10 \n     years after the date of the enactment of this Act'' and \n     inserting ``on September 30, 2017''.\n\n                      modification of authorities\n\n       Sec. 420.

None of the funds made available by this or any \n     other Act may be used to regulate the lead content of \n     ammunition, ammunition components, or fishing tackle under \n     the Toxic Substances Control Act (15 U.S.C. 2601 et seq.) or \n     any other law.\n\n                      waters of the united states\n\n       Sec. 422.  None of the funds made available in this Act or \n     any other Act for any fiscal year may be used to develop, \n     adopt, implement, administer, or enforce any change to the \n     regulations and guidance in effect on October 1, 2012, \n     pertaining to the definition of waters under the jurisdiction \n     of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251, \n     et seq.), including the provisions of the rules dated \n     November 13, 1986, and August 25, 1993, relating to said \n     jurisdiction, and the guidance documents dated January 15, \n     2003, and December 2, 2008, relating to said jurisdiction.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 422.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould strike section 422 from the underlying bill. In doing so, this \namendment would allow the EPA and the Army to implement the waters of \nthe United States rule. This rule will ensure protection for the \nNation's public health and aquatic resources and will clarify the scope \nof the waters of the United States protected under this law.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans continue to undermine efforts to protect \nthe Great Lakes as well as other critical water bodies around the \nNation. We cannot afford to delay years of work by the EPA and the Army \nCorps of Engineers that would enhance the protection of our Nation's \naquatic resources and public health.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support my amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, it comes as no surprise that I rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  In 2006, the Supreme Court determined the EPA and the Corps of \nEngineers did not have the authority to regulate nonnavigable waters \nunder the Clean Water Act.\n  I am certain the EPA's final rule violates that. From day one, the \nEPA claimed that they were not expanding the waters under their \njurisdiction, but we now know that those permits will be required and \nthat the final rule is worse than proposed.\n  Twenty-seven States have now filed lawsuits challenging the legality \nof EPA's rule, so the Agency again finds itself on shaky legal ground, \nboth on process and substance.\n  The language in the bill protects the authority of the States by \npreventing the EPA from implementing its regulation and expanding its \njurisdiction. The language needs to stay in, so I urge a ``no'' vote on \nthe amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. \nSimpson).\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The language is in there for a very good reason. Everybody assumes \nthat the waters are not covered under the Clean Water Act, that being \nthe navigable waters. That is a definition they came up with somehow--I \ndon't know--but that they are unregulated waters.\n  They are not unregulated waters. They are regulated by the States. \nWhen the court said, ``Navigable waters is kind of an elusive term, so \nmaybe you ought to redefine it,'' the EPA said, ``Okay, we will just \nregulate all the waters,'' and that is what they did with this. They \nhave gone way beyond whatever the intent of the Clean Water Act was.\n  I will tell you most resource groups, most agricultural groups, \neverybody else disagrees with what the EPA has done on this new rule \nthat they are writing. The fact that they have expanded their authority \ninto areas far beyond what was intended in the Clean Water Act, I \nthink, goes beyond the pale and goes beyond what Congress originally \nintended under the Clean Water Act.\n  We are not talking about leaving waters unregulated; they are just \nbeing regulated by the States, and they need to start over in writing \nthis rule.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, can you tell me how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Michigan has 4 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum), my colleague.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague.\n  I rise to support the Lawrence amendment to strike the section \nprohibiting the new rule on the Federal jurisdiction of the waters of \nthe United States.\n  A few weeks ago, the Obama administration issued a final rule that \nclarifies the limits of Federal authority under the Clean Water Act. It \ndoes this by reducing red tape and providing more certainty for the \nregulated community.\n  Instead of confusion in case-by-case determinations about where \nwaters are covered, the rule says physical, measurable boundaries for \nthe first time about where clean water coverage begins and ends.\n  The rule does not expand the waters covered. In fact, it will \nactually reduce the scope of waters protected by the Clean Water Act.\n  Additionally, the rule does not create any new permitting \nrequirements for agriculture. It maintains all previous exemptions and \nexclusions.\n  The rule ensures that the waters protected under the Clean Water Act \nare more precisely defined and predictably measured, making permitting \nless costly, easier, and faster for business and industry.\n  Prohibiting the EPA from implementing the rule will only perpetrate \nconfusion in the jurisdiction of the water.\n  This harmful rider should be struck; therefore, I urge my colleagues \nto support the Lawrence amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nGosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Madam Chair, I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment \nas it seeks to strip a commonsense provision included in the base bill \nthat will protect the American people from the EPA's new waters of the \nU.S. regulation, commonly referred to as WOTUS.\n  WOTUS is a terrible Agency proposal that will have disastrous effects \nand economic consequences for agriculture, small business, property \nowners, municipalities, and other water users throughout the country.\n  This job-killing, overreaching water grab being imposed by Washington \nbureaucrats is a dream killer for future generations and local \neconomies. The EPA claims this new regulation was\n\n[[Page H4792]]\n\nshaped by public input; yet we recently learned that the EPA used \ntaxpayer dollars to unleash a propaganda campaign in an attempt to \nrally comments and support for this WOTUS regulation, despite the Anti-\nLobbying Act which bans such actions.\n  Furthermore, States and local governments that have traditionally \nmanaged these waterways and activities were not included in drafting \nthe WOTUS regulation. The Agency failed to comply with the Regulatory \nFlexibility Act as required by Federal law and consider the new impact \nthat the WOTUS regulations would have on small businesses.\n  The EPA claims this rule is grounded in law; yet this overreaching \nregulation contradicts prior Supreme Court decisions by expanding \nAgency control over 60 percent of our country's streams and millions of \nacres of wetlands that were previously nonjurisdictional.\n  Despite claiming the WOTUS rule reduces Agency jurisdiction, the \nfinal regulation imposes new regulations for navigable waters and their \ntributaries, potholes, ditches, bays, and even waters that are next to \nrivers and lakes.\n  The new WOTUS regulation has been built on a foundation of \npseudoscience, deception, and lawlessness. This overreach is so extreme \nthat 24 Members of the President's own party joined Members in the \nHouse in passing legislation in May calling for the formal withdrawal \nof the new WOTUS regulation.\n  For these reasons and more, I strongly oppose the gentlewoman's \namendment and urge its defeat.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I urge opposition to this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Chair, I would really urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  The rule does not create any new permitting requirements for the \nagriculture and maintains all previous exemptions and exclusions. The \nrule ensures that waters protected under the Clean Water Act are more \nprecisely defined and particularly determine making permitting less \ncostly, easier, and faster for business and industry.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Madam Chair, I think the American public must be quite \nconfused about what we are currently debating in this Chamber.\n  The amendment I rise in strong support of strikes section 422 which \nprevents funds from being used to ``develop, adopt, implement, \nadminister or enforce any change . . . pertaining to the definition of \nwaters under the jurisdiction'' of the Clean Water Act (CWA).\n  I would like to remind the other side that, thanks to the Clean Water \nAct, billions of pounds of pollution have been kept out of our rivers, \nand the number of waters that now meet clean water goals nationwide has \nactually doubled with direct benefits for drinking water, public \nhealth, recreation, and wildlife.\n  This is especially true for my home State of Maryland that is within \nthe six-State Chesapeake Bay Watershed.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Watershed is fed by 110,000 miles of creeks, \nrivers, and streams; covers 64,000 square miles; includes over 11,500 \nmiles of shorelines; contains 150 major rivers and streams; and is home \nto over 17 million people.\n  And this watershed's land-to-water ratio is 14-1, the largest of any \ncoastal water body in the world.\n  Several of its tributaries, including the Anacostia, the Patuxent, \nPotomac, and Severn Rivers flow through the Fourth Congressional \nDistrict. 70 percent of Marylanders get our drinking water from sources \nthat rely on headwater or seasonal streams.\n  Nationwide, 117 million people, or over a third of the total \npopulation, get our water from these waters.\n  However, due to the two Supreme Court decisions, there is, in fact, \nwidespread confusion as to what falls under the protection of the Clean \nWater Act.\n  That is precisely why the Obama administration finalized their rule \nclarifying the limits of Federal jurisdiction under the Act on May 27, \n2015.\n  The agencies finalized the clean water protection rule after over a \nyear of public outreach on their then proposed rule at a scale \nunprecedented in the history of the Clean Water Act, as well as \ncountless congressional hearings.\n  Madam Chair, supporters of this provision have complained about the \nconfusion in the litigation.\n  That is precisely why we needed to get through the final rulemaking, \nwhich has been years in the making.\n  That is what the Supreme Court instructed the Federal Government to \ndo 14 years ago with the 2001 SWANCC decision and, subsequently, the \n2006 Rapanos case.\n  Along with those Supreme Court decisions, the Bush administration \nfollowed the exact same process in issuing two guidance documents in \n2003 and 2008.\n  Up until the final rule issued just over a month ago, they remained \nin force.\n  It is, in fact, these two Bush-era guidance documents that have \ncompounded the confusion, uncertainty, and increased compliance costs \nfaced by our constituents--opponents and proponents alike--who all just \nsay they want clarity.\n  You don't actually have to take my word for it.\n  In fact, let me quote from the comments made by the American Farm \nBureau Federation, something I don't do all that often: ``With no clear \nregulatory definitions to guide their determinations, what has emerged \nis a hodgepodge of ad hoc and inconsistent jurisdictional theories.''\n  Those are the words of the American Farm Bureau Federation.\n  We all agree that it is confusing.\n  That is why it was so important that this administration finish what \nthe Bush administration started and failed to do, and that is publish a \nfinal rule that gives stakeholders the clarity they have been seeking \nfor 14 years.\n  Madam Chair, despite nearly universal calls for increased clarity and \ncertainty from certain stakeholders, my colleagues have made it a \npriority to prohibit the implementation of the final clean water \nrulemaking entirely.\n  It is really clear that what they want to do is stop these agencies \nfrom doing their jobs at all--no new rules and no clean water, what a \nshame for our natural resources, our public health, and our \nenvironment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Quigley-Edwards amendment to \nstrike this harmful and shameful provision.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n                             stream buffer\n\n       Sec. 423.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to develop, carry out, or implement (1) any guidance, \n     policy, or directive to reinterpret or change the historic \n     interpretation of 30 C.F.R. 816.57, which was promulgated on \n     June 30, 1983 by the Office of Surface Mining Reclamation and \n     Enforcement of the Department of the Interior (48 Fed. Reg. \n     30312); or (2) proposed regulations or supporting materials \n     described in the Federal Register notice published on June \n     18, 2010 (75 Fed. Reg. 34667) by the Office of Surface Mining \n     Reclamation and Enforcement of the Department of the \n     Interior.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       Beginning at page 122, line 23, strike section 423.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, my amendment would allow the Office of \nSurface Mining Reclamation and Enforcement to continue to develop \nregulations designed to protect communities and the environment from \nthe devastating effects of mountaintop removal mining.\n  If you have seen a picture of a mountaintop removal mining site, you \nget an idea of how destructive this process is. Companies literally \nblast the tops off of mountains, scoop out the coal, and dump what used \nto be the mountaintop into the valley below. The scars on the landscape \nare unmistakable, as are the piles of rock filling in what used to be \nmountain valleys and streams.\n  What you don't see in the picture is the health impacts on the people \nliving nearby, although those are just as real and just as terrible. \nPeople who live near mountaintop mining sites have higher rates of lung \ncancer, heart disease, kidney disease, birth defects, hypertension, and \nother health related problems.\n  Despite some confusion in the Natural Resources Committee just last \nmonth, these results are statistically corrected for rates of smoking, \nobesity, and other factors.\n  A paper in the journal Science a few years ago, one of the preeminent \nscientific journals in the world, pointed\n\n[[Page H4793]]\n\nout that mountaintop removal mining with valley fills ``revealed \nserious environmental impacts that mitigation practices cannot \nsuccessfully address,'' that ``water emerges from the base of valley \nfills containing a variety of solutes toxic and damaging to biota,'' \nand ``recovery of biodiversity in mining waste-impacted streams has not \nbeen documented.''\n  Under our laws governing surface coal mining, streams are supposed to \nbe protected; but the existing regulations, which are over 30 years \nold, have done a poor job of doing just that. Over 2,000 miles of \nstreams have been buried by mountaintop removal mining, and countless \nmore have been polluted by toxic mine runoff. Wildlife habitat is \ndestroyed; fish are killed, and the people in the area suffer.\n  That is why the administration has been working for years on a new \nrule that would do a better job of protecting streams. It has taken \nlonger than I would like for them to propose this rule, and the process \nhas certainly not gone as smoothly as it could have.\n  The majority uses the snags in the process to argue that there \nshouldn't be a rule at all. Never mind that their own partisan \ninvestigation delayed this rule for years without uncovering any \nevidence of political misconduct.\n  The majority also claims that this rule will cause huge job losses, \nbut the draft rule hasn't even been published yet, so we can't possibly \nknow the impacts, and the Director of the Office of Surface Mining says \nthe job losses will be minor at best.\n  Even if the majority does not believe him--and I suspect they might \nnot--they should wait until the draft rule comes out and there can be \nindependent analysis of the impacts, not just wild exaggerations that \nthe mining industry will produce, but real, independent analysis.\n  If they are still not happy with the rule at that point, we can hold \nhearings. We can try to pass constructive laws that protect the \nenvironment and human health and workers all at the same time.\n  A partisan rider in this bill that completely stops the ability of \nthe administration to work on this stream buffer rule to provide badly \nneeded protections to Appalachian communities is the wrong way to go.\n  It has nothing to do with managing spending. In fact, it would just \nresult in the waste of all the money that was required to get to this \nvery point.\n  The rider is bad policy; it is bad for the environment, and it is bad \nfor public health and the health of the people living near these mines.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment that would allow the \nstream protection rule to see the light of day.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, in 2008, the Office of Surface Mining \nfinalized revisions to the stream zone buffer rule in an open and \ntransparent manner. After taking office, the Obama administration put a \nhold on the rule and is currently writing a new rule.\n  The administration's approach under the new rule has been anything \nbut collaborative and inclusive, and many States feel they have been \nshut out of the process. When Chairman Rogers required advanced \nanalysis on job impacts, his request was ignored.\n  The American people expect more openness and transparency from their \ngovernment, and that is why this funding prohibition must remain in the \nbase bill.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and reject this \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n      hunting, fishing, and recreational shooting on federal land\n\n       Sec. 424. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the \n     funds made available by this or any other Act for any fiscal \n     year may be used to prohibit the use of or access to Federal \n     land (as such term is defined in section 3 of the Healthy \n     Forests Restoration Act of 2003 (16 U.S.C. 6502)) for \n     hunting, fishing, or recreational shooting if such use or \n     access--\n       (1) was not prohibited on such Federal land as of January \n     1, 2013; and\n       (2) was conducted in compliance with the resource \n     management plan (as defined in section 101 of such Act (16 \n     U.S.C. 6511)) applicable to such Federal land as of January \n     1, 2013.\n       (b) Temporary Closures Allowed.--Notwithstanding subsection \n     (a), the Secretary of the Interior or the Secretary of \n     Agriculture may temporarily close, for a period not to exceed \n     30 days, Federal land managed by the Secretary to hunting, \n     fishing, or recreational shooting if the Secretary determines \n     that the temporary closure is necessary to accommodate a \n     special event or for public safety reasons. The Secretary may \n     extend a temporary closure for one additional 90-day period \n     only if the Secretary determines the extension is necessary \n     because of extraordinary weather conditions or for public \n     safety reasons.\n       (c) Authority of States.--Nothing in this section shall be \n     construed as affecting the authority, jurisdiction, or \n     responsibility of the several States to manage, control, or \n     regulate fish and resident wildlife under State law or \n     regulations.\n\n          limitation on use of funds for national ocean policy\n\n       Sec. 425.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to further implementation of the coastal and marine \n     spatial planning and ecosystem-based management components of \n     the National Ocean Policy developed under Executive Order \n     13547.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Tsongas\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Beginning at page 124, line 17, strike section 425.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, nearly 3 years ago, Superstorm Sandy caught \nmillions of coastal residents by surprise and cost billions of dollars \nin economic damage. Unfortunately, the weather is not all that has \nbecome more extreme over the past several years.\n  I am disappointed that this misguided and misinformed language to \nblock implementation of the National Ocean Policy keeps coming back, \njust like the recurrent coastal flooding being caused by sea level \nrise, and my amendment would strike that language.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  It shows a lack of respect for science and a lack of appreciation for \nthe magnitude and complexity of the governance challenges we face.\n  It seems some Members of Congress do not want to see government \nsucceed even when government's failure to respond to a disaster, to \npredict a drought, or to properly manage a fishery can devastate the \ncommunities they represent.\n  When you disavow words like ``precaution,'' ``preparedness,'' and \n``planning,'' you stop being conservative and start being reckless.\n  Conservatives always say they want to run government like a business. \nWell, would you invest in a business with different departments that \ndon't talk to each other? Would you invest in a business that is not \nresponsive to its shareholders? Would you invest in a business with no \nbusiness plan?\n  That is essentially what the National Ocean Policy is, a business \nplan for the oceans that seeks to maximize the benefits for \nshareholders, all the American people.\n  The policy is a win-win-win for economic growth, public safety, and \nenvironmental protection. I urge you to vote ``yes'' on my amendment to \nprotect the National Ocean Policy.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentlewoman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have operated a business. Ever since this \nadministration created the National Ocean Policy through executive \norder,\n\n[[Page H4794]]\n\nthe subcommittee has asked the CEQ, the DOI, and the EPA to provide an \nestimate of the impact of the Policy on their budgets, and we have yet \nto receive a substantial answer.\n  The so-called report we were provided last year was fewer than three \npages long. Clearly, this failed to outline expenditures supporting the \nadministration's National Ocean Policy.\n  Our job here is to pay the bills. When we ask how much does the \nNational Ocean Policy cost, we expect to get an answer. We need an \nanswer so that proper congressional oversight can be conducted.\n  I want to point out that this language was included in the House \nfiscal year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill. There are \nconcerns about the costs and all of the unknowns related to this policy \nin multiple jurisdictions.\n  The bottom line is, if this administration wants the funds to \nimplement the National Ocean Policy, then tell us how much it is going \nto cost the taxpayer. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing this \namendment.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum), my colleague.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Madam Chair, Congress has enacted numerous laws that manage the ocean \nand coastal issues across 11 of the 15 Cabinet-level departments and \nfour independent agencies across the Federal Government. As my \ncolleague from Massachusetts pointed out, why wouldn't we want these \nfolks to be working together?\n  Clearly, what the President is trying to do is to just have an action \nthat lets the independent bipartisan commission move forward, including \nthe U.S. Commission on Ocean Policy, which was appointed entirely by \nPresident George W. Bush.\n  The National Ocean Policy is a means by which the Federal agencies \ncan sort through all of the tangles of uncoordinated governance and can \nbring some common sense to the chaos. Wouldn't we want that?\n  If my colleagues have a problem with what government can do on ocean \nmanagement, then they have a problem with laws that are enacted by \nCongress, not with the National Ocean Policy or with the President's \nexecutive order, because what the President is doing through the \nNational Ocean Policy is following a well-established Presidential \ntradition of using an executive order to supervise and guide agencies \nunder the President's charge as they execute existing laws passed by \nCongress.\n  Let us let this agency get to work. Let us find out how we could be \nmore effective with our agencies working together.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert for his work on this bill.\n  Madam Chair, I want to set the record straight. In the year 2000, \nCongress did pass a bill during the 106th Congress to create an ocean \ncommission to review and to make recommendations.\n  Yes, President Bush did appoint persons to that commission. They did \nmake those recommendations, and those recommendations were submitted to \nCongress.\n  Since then, those recommendations have been reviewed by the 108th, \nthe 109th, the 110th, and the 111th Congresses, and each of those \nCongresses decided that no action should be taken.\n  What happened here is the President decided to go into the Article I \npowers, which are reserved for Congress, and to do what Congress does \nnot intend to have done, which is to have an ocean zoning commission \nbuilt from dozens of agencies.\n  They have never asked for an appropriations for this activity, and \nthere is no lawful basis for the activity to exist. The President's \nexecutive order is basically violating the statutes that have been \npassed by Congress, and it is also violating the Constitution.\n  The language that is in the appropriations bill should remain as it \nis. Congress has voted seven times on this language, and it has passed \nall seven times on a bipartisan basis. The other side is that of \nbasically trying to undo what Congress has said it wants to do seven \ntimes on a bipartisan basis.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer), my colleague.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment, which \nwould allow for the implementation of the National Ocean Policy.\n  Plain and simple, coordinated ocean planning makes common sense and \nis a good economic policy for our coastal communities. It allows for a \ncomprehensive mapping of existing ocean uses that helps to identify and \nresolve conflicts between stakeholders before they play out in specific \npermitting processes.\n  In Virginia, this process has been crucial to preserving public \naccess to the ocean, to sustain economic growth, to address marine \ndebris, to create migration corridors for marine mammals, and to \nsupport promising new ocean industries, such as wind power and marine \naquaculture.\n  In fact, I am proud to note that Virginia was recently selected by \nBOEM to be the first State in the Nation to receive a wind energy \nresearch lease in Federal waters. This rider would eliminate language \nthat would undermine regional collaborative efforts to manage existing \nand future ocean policy challenges.\n  Let's not roll back the valuable work and resources that many States, \nindustries, and communities have already devoted to implementing this \npolicy. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert.\n  Madam Chair, again, I want to set the record straight. We are not \nagainst ocean planning, as it makes perfect sense, but only insofar as \nCongress has explicitly authorized those activities.\n  Congress has not allowed the President to do what he is trying to do \nby executive fiat. There are 67 groups, which include fishing, \nagricultural, farming, energy, and other industries, that are concerned \nabout the impact of this Federal overreach. Again, it is an \nunconstitutional Federal overreach, and I would urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I do appreciate that my colleague across \nthe aisle has said that it does make perfect sense to have an ocean \npolicy. The ocean policy is a business plan for the oceans that seeks \nto maximize the benefits for all of its shareholders, the American \npeople.\n  I certainly know that we in Massachusetts have a great appreciation \nfor the complex task it seeks to undertake in order to protect that \nwhich we value most, the ocean off our coast.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                             lead test kit\n\n       Sec. 426.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 429.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I rise in support of this amendment.\n  The amendment strikes a rider that would prevent the Environmental \nProtection Agency from updating regulations pertaining to the \ndefinitions of the terms ``fill material'' or ``discharge of fill \nmaterial'' for purposes of the Clean Water Act.\n  Presently, the Army Corps of Engineers issues a section 404 permit if \nthe fill material discharged into a water body raises the bottom \nelevation of that water body or converts the area to dry land.\n  The current rule allows mining waste to be dumped into the rivers and \nstreams without an appropriate environmental review process.\n  Given repeated instances of mining activities resulting in lakes and \nstreams devoid of fish or aquatic life, downstream water users are \nrightly concerned that the section 404 process fails to protect them \nfrom the discharge of hazardous substances.\n  The Clean Water Act section 404 guidelines are not well suited for \nevaluating the environmental effects of discharging hazardous waste, \nsuch as mining refuse and similar materials, into a water body or a \nwetland.\n  The rider that this amendment strikes would block the EPA from making \nnecessary modifications to these guidelines. This rider is a preemptive \nstrike against protecting our drinking water, and it allows mining \ncompanies' interests to trump the protection of the health of our \ncitizens.\n  We should not short-circuit regular order through the appropriations \nprocess. We should not preclude the Corps or the EPA from considering \nany regulatory changes to the current definition and permit process. I \nurge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike this language \nfrom the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, this language simply maintains the status \nquo regarding the definition of ``fill material'' for the purposes of \nthe Clean Water Act.\n  The existing definition was put in place through a rule-making \ninitiated by the Clinton administration and finalized by the Bush \nadministration. That rule harmonized the definitions on the books of \nthe Corps and the EPA so that both agencies were working with the same \ndefinition.\n  Any attempts to redefine this important definition could \nsignificantly negatively impact the ability of all earth-moving \nindustries, road and highway construction, and private and commercial \nenterprises to obtain vital Clean Water Act section 404 permits.\n  Changing the definition of ``fill material'' could result in the loss \nof up to 375,000 high-paying mining jobs and jeopardize over 1 million \njobs that are dependent upon the economic output generated by these \noperations.\n  For these reasons, I support the underlying language and oppose this \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Madam Chair, I respect the chairman's objections to this, \nbut I would like to point out that all that this amendment does in \nstriking the section is allow the EPA to consider future changes to the \n``fill'' definitions.\n  Clearly, the work begun in the Clinton administration and finalized \nin the George W. Bush administration were the best possible actions at \nthe time.\n  In the meantime, we have discovered that, unfortunately, much mining \nwaste and refuse are ending up in mining streams and rivers, and it has \nseverely affected the health of those people.\n  We are not attempting to eliminate mining jobs or to even impact \nearth moving. It is only reasonable to make sure that our Environmental \nProtection Agency has the latitude and the freedom to evolve future \ndefinitions so as to best protect the health of our citizens.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. I oppose this amendment. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                        contracting authorities\n\n       Sec. 430.  Section 412 of division E of Public Law 112-74 \n     is amended by striking ``fiscal year 2015,'' and inserting \n     ``fiscal year 2017,''.\n\n                       chesapeake bay initiative\n\n       Sec. 431.  Section 502(c) of the Chesapeake Bay Initiative \n     Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-312; 16 U.S.C. 461 note) is \n     amended by striking ``2015'' and inserting ``2017''.\n\n                      extension of grazing permits\n\n       Sec. 432.  The terms and conditions of section 325 of \n     Public Law 108-108 (117 Stat. 1307), regarding grazing \n     permits issued by the Forest Service on any lands not subject \n     to administration under section 402 of the Federal Lands \n     Policy and Management Act (43 U.S.C. 1752), shall remain in \n     effect for fiscal year 2016.\n\n               availability of vacant grazing allotments\n\n       Sec. 433.  The Secretary of the Interior, with respect to \n     public lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management, \n     and the Secretary of Agriculture, with respect to the \n     National Forest System lands, shall make vacant grazing \n     allotments available to a holder of a grazing permit or lease \n     issued by either Secretary if the lands covered by the permit \n     or lease or other grazing lands used by the holder of the \n     permit or lease are unusable because of drought or wildfire, \n     as determined by the Secretary concerned. The terms and \n     conditions contained in a permit or lease made available \n     pursuant to this section shall be the same as the terms and \n     conditions of the most recent permit or lease that was \n     applicable to the vacant grazing allotment made available. \n     Section 102 of the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 \n     (42 U.S.C. 4332) shall not apply with respect to any Federal \n     agency action under this section.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I offer an amendment to strike section \n433.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 433.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I offer my amendment to strike section 433 \nregarding the availability of vacant grazing allotments and waiving one \nof our key environmental laws.\n  While grazing on our public lands is an important part of our \nNation's culture and economy, this section of the appropriations bill \nis redundant and unnecessary. The BLM and Forest Service already have \nthe authority to transfer permits when grazing lands are deemed \nunusable.\n  Furthermore, this section would have the effect of waiving section \n102 of the National Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA. NEPA is one of \nour Nation's bedrock environmental laws, serving to\n\n[[Page H4796]]\n\nestablish policies to protect our air, water, and our natural \nresources. Section 102 of NEPA contains key provisions to make sure \nthat Federal agencies act according to the spirit and letter of the \nlaw.\n  By stating that section 102 shall not apply to agency actions, this \nbill is, in essence, waiving NEPA and putting our public lands at risk. \nOur Federal agencies did not ask for a NEPA waiver, and Congress should \nnot be in the business of dictating to professional land managers when \nthey should or should not have the flexibility to use NEPA in making \nland management decisions.\n  Allowing section 433 to be included in the appropriations bill could \nhave unintended consequences for our public lands and environment, \nparticularly when conditions on the ground change. In this time of \nclimate change, drought, and wildfire, it is vital that agencies have \nthe tools and the flexibility to conduct adequate environmental \nreviews.\n  In the face of these challenges, why should grazers get to jump to \nthe front of the line for new land? What about land for species and \nrecovery and habitat that are displaced by climate change or \nrecreational demands and interests?\n  Congress has tasked the BLM with managing our public lands for \nmultiple uses. I welcome the belated recognition by my Republican \ncolleagues that climate change is impacting these lands, but this \nprovision would waive the balancing process found in NEPA and mandate \nthat grazing gets to trump other uses when lands are destroyed by fire \nor drought.\n  Section 433 benefits one special interest above all others, and I \nurge my colleagues to join me in supporting to strike this section from \nthe bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment. The amendment would strike a commonsense provision--repeat, \ncommonsense provision--in this bill that allows the Bureau of Land \nManagement and the Forest Service to make available vacant grazing \nallotments when a rancher is forced off his or her existing allotment \ndue to drought or wildfire.\n  It is not that they jump to the front of the line and have special \nprovisions because of this. The fact is, if you don't exclude the NEPA \nprocess, it can take 3 months, 6 months--guess what? Cows and sheep \ndon't go on a diet for 3 months or 6 months. They actually need to put \nthese cows and sheep somewhere, and vacant allotments is what they look \nfor.\n  The gentleman says that this is redundant, that they can already do \nthat. Well, if they can already do it, then what the heck? Why is he \nopposed to this provision?\n  Unfortunately, drought and catastrophic wildfires are all too common \nin the West. Ranchers shouldn't be further penalized when they lose \ntheir allotments due to natural disasters. The provision provides some \nflexibility to the Bureau of Land Management and Forest Service to help \nin these circumstances.\n  It doesn't say, ``You will provide these vacant allotments.'' It \nsays, ``You may.'' It is not a must. We are trying to give the Bureau \nof Land Management and the Forest Service the flexibility to use vacant \nallotments when circumstances are required.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Madam Chair, I rise in support of the Grijalva \namendment. As has been pointed out, BLM already has the authority to \nmake vacant grazing allotments available for permittees on a \ndiscretionary basis where the permittee is adversely impacted by \nwildfire or drought, but unlike the discretionary basis on which the \nBLM currently makes these allotments, this rider would exempt the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, a NEPA review.\n  On page 127, line 25, it reads ``with respect to'' the National \nForest System lands, ``shall''--not may--``shall make vacant,'' and so \nwhat the BLM currently can do is they can conduct a NEPA review in \nareas where they think they have concerns and they can ensure that the \nland, health standards, and resources are not going to be compromised \nbecause the BLM has a role to play in protecting these lands for \ngrazing potential in the future so that they are not harmed or \novergrazed.\n  To me, it makes common sense that the rider should not exempt the BLM \nfrom a regulatory requirement to issue a decision and conduct an \nadministrative review, which they currently can choose to do or choose \nnot to do based on the information that they have. Any grazing that is \nmandated by this rider is likely also to find itself caught up by \nhearings and delays and appeals and judicial review.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment to strike the \nunnecessary rider and to leave the discretion in place so it continues \nto be the National Forest System lands may be made vacant.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, I would ask my colleagues just one thing. \nIf you are a rancher and you have had one of these catastrophic \nwildfires come through--and they come through frequently, \nunfortunately--and they have wiped out your grazing allotment, what do \nyou tell your cows? What do you tell your sheep? What do they eat for \nthe next several months as you go through the NEPA process? This is \ngiving some flexibility to the Forest Service and to the BLM.\n  I know we can all say: Oh, gee, they can make arrangements and do it \notherwise and so forth.\n  This is just a commonsense provision, frankly, and we haven't had any \nproblem with it with the time that it has been in existence. I think it \nshould stay in existence, and that is why the chairman has included it \nin this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, the redundancy comes from the fact that \nthat flexibility has existed in BLM and Forest Service; it has existed \nfor years. The situations of wildfires have occurred, and they have \nbeen handled.\n  It is an unnecessary NEPA waiver. It is a redundant amendment, \naddition to it. The NEPA waiver in the writing says it is not optional. \nIt says ``shall.''\n  I urge Members to support my amendment striking section 433.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Madam Chair, this language has been in the bill since \n2003. It hasn't caused any problems. It has fed a lot of cows. I think \nit is a good provision in the bill, and we should defeat this \namendment. It is a bad amendment. Vote against it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       protection of water rights\n\n       Sec. 434.  None of the funds made available in this or any \n     other Act may be used to condition the issuance, renewal, \n     amendment, or extension of any permit, approval, license, \n     lease, allotment, easement, right-of-way, or other land use \n     or occupancy agreement on the transfer of any water right, \n     including sole and joint ownership, directly to the United \n     States, or any impairment of title, in whole or in part, \n     granted or otherwise recognized under State law, by Federal \n     or State adjudication, decree, or other judgment, or pursuant \n     to any interstate water compact.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk to strike \nsection 437.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Strike section 437.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, my amendment, which I offer along with Mr. \nLowenthal and Mr. Peters, would simply remove one of the so-called \npolicy riders from this bill. It is a particularly dangerous policy \nrider.\n  What my amendment would do is it would strip the bill of a harmful \nand unrelated restriction that actually would prohibit Federal agencies \nfrom assessing the social cost of carbon, meaning Federal agencies \nwould not be able to look at the monetized impact, the actual costs of \nclimate change.\n  They would be forced to deliberately have a blindfold and not be \nallowed to consider climate change in their planning, just like \nAmerican businesses do, like States do, like municipalities do, but the \nFederal Government would be prohibited from even looking at the costs \nof climate change.\n  According to a recent poll undertaken by Stanford University, 81 \npercent of American people have looked at the science and agree that \nclimate change is at least in part caused by humans; 74 percent of \nAmericans believe the Federal Government should be working hard to \ncombat climate change, and 71 percent of the American people expect \nthat they will be hurt personally or impacted by climate change.\n  Madam Speaker, climate change is not some fallacy. It is not some \nevil plot by leftwing or rightwing extremists. It is simply science. \nClimate change is what major corporations like Coca-Cola and Nike have \ncalled an economically disruptive force that needs to be addressed.\n  Acting on climate change is what the most high profile religious \nleader on the planet has called a moral imperative, an economic \nimperative, a moral imperative. It is what the Department of Defense \nhas called an ``immediate risk to U.S. national security.''\n  I would ask my colleagues on the other side to adopt this amendment \nso that we don't ignore the calls of business, Defense, religious \nleaders--among thousands of others--to ensure that the Federal \nGovernment operates with its eyes wide open and not with ideological \nblinders, simply because we don't want to see the truth of what is \noccurring with regard to climate change.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Madam Chair, I have long been concerned with how EPA \nconducts its cost-benefit analysis to justify its rulemaking. This is \nsomething that the committee has discussed with EPA on a number of \noccasions, and the Supreme Court recently ruled that EPA's approach to \nexamining costs and their regulation was flawed.\n  The administration's revised estimates for the social cost of carbon \nhelp justify on paper larger benefits from reducing carbon emissions in \nany proposed rule. If the administration can inflate the price tag so \nthat the benefits always exceed the costs, the administration can \ngoldplate requirement regulations from any department or any agency.\n  Section 437 says that the administration should convene a working \ngroup to revise the estimates in a more transparent manner and to make \nthat information available to the public.\n  I oppose the gentleman's amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, what this amendment addresses is not simply \nthe creation of some commission or a nuanced look into how cost-benefit \nanalyses are done. It actually would ensure that the costs of climate \nchange are able to be considered in decisionmaking.\n  The answer to the concerns that my colleague raised from the other \nside would be a surgical approach, not to remove the authority to look \nat the cost of climate change, which is what this language does and \nwhat my amendment would fix.\n  This rider is really about the deep ideologically driven agenda of \nclimate deniers and is a terrible waste of both Federal and taxpayer \nmoney to allow its passage because it will lead to poor decisionmaking \nby the Federal Government.\n  Companies are planning for climate change. Municipalities and States \nare planning for climate change. We need to look at the monetized costs \nwith regard to climate change of new rules and regulations.\n  Instead of spending our time here focusing on how to impact and \nbetter understand climate change, we have this opportunity to ensure \nthat that is a factor in future decisionmaking, rather than prohibiting \nagencies from even considering it in the cost of climate change.\n  Blocking proposals and silencing discussion isn't indicative of \nleadership, Mr. Chair. It is indicative of fear of the truth.\n  I urge my colleagues to consider that and support my and my \ncolleague's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, just in closing, I would rise in \nopposition to this amendment.\n  I would urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H4798]]\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. 438.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to propose, promulgate, implement, administer, or \n     enforce a national primary or secondary ambient air quality \n     standard for ozone that is lower than the standard \n     established under section 50.15 of title 40, Code of Federal \n     Regulations (as in effect on July 2, 2014), until at least 85 \n     percent of the counties that were nonattainment areas under \n     that standard as of July 2, 2014, achieve full compliance \n     with that standard.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, beginning on line 9, strike ``, until at least 85 \n     percent of the counties that were nonattainment areas under \n     that standard as of July 2, 2014, achieve full compliance \n     with that standard''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Calvert, along \nwith the ranking member, for the work he and the committee have done.\n  My amendment prevents the EPA from using any funds in the bill to \nchange ozone regulations, regardless of whether or not all counties \nmeet the 2008 standards.\n  As of 2012 and based on the 2008 ozone standards as designated by the \nEPA, 24 mainland States were in attainment, including my home State of \nFlorida. An additional four States had either partial attainment or \nwhole counties had marginal attainment.\n  What I find most interesting is the areas of our Nation that have \nconsistently been designated as nonattainment by the EPA. This includes \nmost of California, parts of Texas, and the mid-Atlantic States. These \ncounties have had nearly 20 years to change their policies and abide by \nthe ozone standards.\n  Under the newly proposed standards, a fair amount of the country \nwould be designated as nonattainment areas. Why should the remainder of \nthe country be subject to new standards when parts of the country have \nyet to meet the 2008 or even 2009 standards?\n  Making this change will have serious economic implications on the \nStates and counties that have already proactively worked to reduce \ntheir emissions, all at a time when the Nation is still recovering from \none of the worst economic recessions of our lifetime.\n  Furthermore, I would like to remind my colleagues of the recent \nSupreme Court decision, Michigan, et al., v. Environmental Protection \nAgency. At the heart of the case was whether or not the EPA took care \nto include the potential cost to power plants when proposing new \nregulations, and that estimated cost is $9.6 billion and a burden on \nthe American taxpayers. The Supreme Court held that the EPA interpreted \nU.S. Code 7412 ``unreasonably when it deemed cost irrelevant to the \ndecision.''\n  I would like to say that this is the exception and not the rule when \nit comes to the EPA, but that simply is not the truth. The EPA has made \nits de facto policy to implement unreasonable regulations with no \nregard to the larger impact it will have on the economy and taxpayers \nand the environment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment would reverse section 438 to block the \nEPA from making critical updates to its ozone standard. The amendment \nmakes an already bad policy rider in this bill even worse.\n  This amendment, however, would completely prohibit the EPA from \nupdating the standard, short-circuiting both current law and the \njudicial process, while putting millions of Americans' health at risk.\n  Ozone is the main component in smog, and it has been scientifically \nproven to aggravate lung disease, increase frequency and severity of \nasthma attacks, and reduce lung function.\n  We hear about those opportunities all the time that we are given now \nwhen the ozone is too high in the air to stay inside. Young children \nshouldn't be out, and people with heart disease and lung disease should \nstay indoors.\n  The Clean Air Act requires the EPA to review its ozone standard every \n5 years to reflect the most up-to-date science on ozone and its impacts \non public health.\n  The EPA, in fact, is under a court order to issue its final rules by \nOctober of this year. The EPA's update to its ozone standard is based \non strong scientific evidence, including over 1,000 scientific studies \nthat show the harmful effect of ozone on human health and the need for \nhigher standards.\n  The EPA estimates the benefit of updated standards of 70 parts per \nbillion will yield the health benefits of $13 billion each year.\n  On its merits, this amendment is shortsighted and reactionary, and it \nis a backdoor amendment to completely gut the Clean Air Act.\n  Prohibiting the EPA's ability to update ozone standards is reckless, \nand it is out of touch with what Americans want, and that is clear air. \nThe EPA's update is firmly rooted in science and ensures health and \nprotections for the American people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, ozone comes from many different sources. Yes, \nit is true that it comes from hydrocarbons. When the UV light hits it, \nit does do that. It also comes from the oceans. It comes from the \nswamps. It comes from just nature itself.\n  Ozone by itself is not always bad because it is used industrially. It \ndisinfects laundry. It disinfects water in place of chlorine. It \ndeodorizes the air. It kills bacteria on food and contact surfaces. It \nsanitizes swimming pools. The list goes on and on and on.\n  Yes, there have been reports of it causing respiratory problems, but \nthat is also associated with spores and molds and things like that.\n  I think ozone, at this time--especially when you look at the rulings \nfrom 1997 and 2008, those standards--I don't think we should move \nforward at this time, with our Nation in the economic recovery, to put \nnew standards on all of the Nation when yet a large portion of the \nNation is still not under compliance.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I probably live in the most regulated air \nquality area in the United States, southern California.\n  In southern California, our population continues to grow; yet we have \nbeen able to make significant air quality improvements within the South \nCoast Air Quality Management District.\n  The committee set a level at 85 percent of the communities so that \nthe marginal nonattainment communities could have the opportunity to \nachieve compliance with the 2008 standards before further updates are \nconsidered.\n  This amendment would prevent EPA from lowering the ozone standard \nbelow the 2008 levels. This amendment would prevent further updates to \nthe ozone standard for an indefinite and undetermined timeframe, and \nthat is certainly not the committee's intent.\n  We need to make progress in clean air in areas that folks want to see \ncleaner air, but at the same time making sure that technology is there \nin order to do that. This was, I think, compromise language that the \nunderlying bill has that works to move us forward, but at the same time \nnot stopping us from obtaining cleaner air in the future.\n  I am in opposition to this amendment.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to reiterate that ozone is \nincriminated a lot of times when I think\n\n[[Page H4799]]\n\nwe ought to look at particulate matter in dusty environments or in \nurban areas where airflow in apartment buildings may not be like it \nshould be.\n  Ozone is used as an alternative to chlorine for bleaching wood, paper \nproducts, and things like that. Many hospitals around the world use \nlarge ozone generators to decontaminate operating rooms between \nsurgeries. It is used in industry all the time.\n  I just ask people to support this amendment, so we don't have more \noverreaching regulations from the EPA.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the EPA's update is firmly rooted in \nscience and ensures the health and protections for the American people. \nWe have a responsibility to protect the millions of Americans affected \nby ozone pollution.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Edwards\n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n         Strike section 438.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Maryland and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maryland.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to strike \nsection 438.\n  Section 438 would prohibit any funds in this Act from being used to \neven propose a national ozone standard that is less than that currently \nin law until at least 85 percent of the counties across the country \nthat do not currently meet that standard achieve full compliance.\n  Now, the current ozone standard under title 40 is 75 parts per \nbillion; but, Mr. Chair, we had a series of hearings in our House \nScience Committee earlier this year where we heard strong testimony \nfrom scientists at State pollution control agencies and physicians at \nhospitals all telling us that the current standard is not in line with \nthe current science.\n  The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee declared as far back as \n2008 that they believe that the current standard of 75 parts per \nbillion is insufficient to protect public health. In fact, right now, \nthe ozone standard can mislead people to believe that the air, in fact, \nis safe to breathe when it is not.\n  Studies conducted by the American Lung Association have shown more \nthan 4 out of every 10 people in the United States live in places where \nozone levels often make it dangerous to breathe.\n  The current standard rates, what we now know to be very dangerous air \nquality, as code yellow or moderate. This can lead those who are \nparticularly at risk of ozone-related illness, such as children and \nsenior citizens, to unwittingly be exposed to harmful levels of ozone. \nThis has the potential to impact millions of people in every State \nacross the Nation.\n  Just look at my own home State of Maryland. There are 145,000 \nchildren with pediatric asthma. Over 430,000 adults have asthma. Mr. \nChairman, 246,000 people in my State have chronic obstructive pulmonary \ndisease or COPD, and 367,000 people in our State have cardiovascular \ndisease that is related to ozone.\n  The Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee recommends that, in order \nto protect the public health, the EPA set the primary ozone standard \nbetween 60 and 70 parts per billion. In November of last year, the EPA \ndid exactly what it is supposed to do.\n  It looked at the strong scientific evidence showing the health risks \nof ozone, and it issued a proposed rule to lower the ozone standard \nfrom 75 parts per billion to a standard within the range of 65 to 70 \nparts per billion.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Setting that standard begins a 2-year process designed to identify \nareas with too much ozone. Once those areas are identified, State and \nlocal governments can craft plans tailored to their areas using cost-\neffective approaches.\n  This new standard, based on the most current science, will help to \nprovide a framework for these plans, which, in turn, will help our \nStates continue along the path to clean air. And yet, here we are, and \nthis provision that I am providing to strike would stop the EPA from \neven proposing a standard of 70 parts per billion.\n  This is the responsibility of the EPA. This new standard would \nprotect Americans' health and our environment. In addition, an analysis \nconducted by the EPA shows that, though the annual cost of the proposed \nstandard of 70 parts per billion might be around $3.9 billion, the \nhealth benefits are estimated to reach between $6.4 billion and $13 \nbillion annually.\n  Mr. Chairman, ground level ozone is harmful to the public health. It \ncontributes to asthma attacks, decreased lung function, respiratory \ninfection, and even death. Breathing ozone is dangerous for everyone, \nbut particularly for children, for the elderly and people of all ages \nwho have lung diseases.\n  We need to allow the EPA--in fact, empower the EPA--to follow the \nscience and create minimum standards necessary to protect public \nhealth. I urge my colleagues to protect these vulnerable populations as \nwell as clean air for every American, and vote ``yes'' on this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in clear \nopposition to this amendment.\n  The language that was adopted in the full committee was carefully \ncrafted. It simply allows a majority of nonattainment counties to \nachieve attainment status before the EPA moves the goalposts.\n  In nonattainment areas, the EPA's proposed ozone standards would \nstifle economic growth and cost jobs and revenue. Just last week, the \nSupreme Court admonished the EPA for ignoring the costs of its \nregulations. The costs involved would be devastating to our economy. \nEven the EPA admitted it would cost $15 billion a year. Other studies \nhave estimated that costs could be as high as $140 billion a year.\n  In West Virginia, in my State, it would mean $2 billion in compliance \ncosts, 10,000 lost jobs, and more fees for residents even to operate \ntheir vehicles.\n  It would have significant impacts on agriculture, manufacturing, and \nthe energy industry. Federal highway funds could be frozen and permits \nfor infrastructure could be held up.\n  I am hopeful that some of our colleagues across the aisle will \nrecognize the impact this will have on each of our districts.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, here we have heard again the exaggerated \nclaims about implementation, so let's get to the facts.\n  The first fact, the scientists tell us that this is a standard that \nwe need to protect the public health. The second fact, the EPA \nestimates that the cost might be around $3.9 billion.\n  But let's look at the health benefits, because those are costing us \ncurrently.\n  The health benefits are estimated to reach between $6.4 and $13 \nbillion, and that means that there is a ripple effect when we invest in \nmaking sure that we implement a standard that protects the public \nhealth, and it has a benefit on the public health.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, there is an argument here for the EPA to simply do \nits job, the job that it was charged to do by taxpayers, and that is to \nprotect the public health, to give us clean air, and to make sure that \nwe have ozone standards that in fact meet our responsibility.\n  The EPA is doing its job. Let's stop Congress from keeping the EPA \nfrom keeping our air clean.\n\n[[Page H4800]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Olson).\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from West Virginia \n(Mr. Jenkins) for the time and for including commonsense language in \nthe bill that is now being debated.\n  In 2008, EPA set a strict ozone rule that was stuck in legal limbo \nfor years. From big cities to small towns, over 200 counties are still \nin nonattainment.\n  Yet, before we finish that job, EPA wants to move the goalposts. They \nhave issued new ozone rules that are so strict they can't be achieved \nwith our current technology. All of America will be hit hard with job \nlosses.\n  This bill simply includes a pause button on new EPA rules until we \ncan finish the job and reach our current mandates.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the Edwards amendment and strip this \nlanguage from this bill.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As mentioned earlier, I live in one of the most, maybe the most, \nregulated air districts in the United States, and I am a strong \nadvocate for clean air. My district has achieved some of the largest \nemission reductions in the country.\n  However, EPA continues to dig the hole deeper as my district \ncontinues to try to work its way out of nonattainment. So EPA and the \nStates need to use the resources we provided in the bill to play catch-\nup on a statutory obligation to help communities implement the 2008 \nstandard.\n  Remember, just last April, EPA finalized the rule for the 2008 \nstandards. When 85 percent of the communities can achieve the latest \nstandards, then EPA should consider whether or not revisions are \nnecessary.\n  I will remind my colleagues that the Clean Air Act only directs EPA \nto review the standards every 5 years. It does not require that EPA \nrevise the standard.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I thank the \ngentleman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Chairman, once again, this is a \nsincere effort to try to set a benchmark and not have the EPA moving \nthe goalposts that will have such economic devastation, billions of \ndollars in cost, and I encourage a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Maryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maryland \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, line 5, strike ``primary or''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, according to the American Lung \nAssociation's 2015 State of the Air Report, the Los Angeles \nmetropolitan area, which includes both my district and also the \nAppropriations Subcommittee chair's district, that metropolitan area is \nthe number one in the country for ozone pollution.\n  But ozone pollution is not just a southern California problem. The \nreport shows that more than 40 percent of the United States' population \nlives in areas with unhealthy levels of ozone. Large cities like \nHouston and less populated areas like northwest Ohio also make the \nlist.\n  Power plants, motor vehicles, and chemical solvents contribute to the \nmajority of nitrous oxides and volatile organic compounds, \nNOX and VOCs, which react with each other on hot, sunny days \nto produce ground level ozone.\n  The American Lung Association has pointed out that because hot, sunny \ndays produce the most ozone, climate change is increasing the number of \nunhealthy ozone level days. We are all familiar with those ``high ozone \nlevel'' warnings that happen on really hot, sunny days, and \nunfortunately, they are becoming more and more common due to global \nwarming.\n  Ground level ozone interacts with lung tissue, can cause major \nproblems for children, the elderly, and anyone with lung disease. Ozone \nis known to aggravate health problems such as asthma, and it is also \nlinked to low birth rates, cardiovascular problems, and premature \ndeath.\n  Given the grave consequences and the widespread problem of ozone \npollution, I am glad that EPA is moving forward with updates to its \nnational standards for ozone pollution.\n  Members of the medical and health communities have been calling for a \nlong time for updates of this standard in order to protect the public \nhealth. The current standard of 75 parts per billion is outdated and \ndoes not adequately protect public health, which is what the EPA is \nrequired to do under the Clean Air Act. Thousands of hospital visits \nand premature deaths and up to a million missed schooldays can be \nprevented just by strengthening this standard.\n  But instead of trusting health professionals, some in Congress have \ndecided to protect the financial interests of the polluters. The \nreckless legislative rider in section 438 of this appropriations bill \nblocks the EPA from updating or even proposing scientifically-based \nstandards for ozone to the detriment of the health of at least 40 \npercent of the U.S. population.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote to remove this polluter protecting \nsection from the bill, to support the Edwards amendment, and allow the \nEPA to move forward with doing what they are required to do by law, and \nthat is protect the public health.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, Mr. Jenkins included the language in the \nfull committee bill that, I think, came to a reasonable compromise. As \nthe gentleman is aware, many communities cannot reach the old standard, \nthe 2008 standard, that is now the law, and so this just gives the \ncommunities throughout the country that cannot get to attainment \nadditional time to develop the technologies before we go to a new \nstandard.\n  I would remind the gentleman that it was just last April that we came \nto a determination on the 2008 standard, and the administration already \nis talking about a new standard that most of the Nation cannot reach in \nthe short term. So this gives a brief, little bit of time to allow \nthese communities to improve their technologies and to be able to meet \na new standard down the road.\n  So I would oppose the gentleman's amendment and support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, let's just talk about why we need to \nchange the standard.\n  I understand and appreciate that reaching that standard is going to \ntake some work, but remember, the air, by saying that we don't need to \ndo this because the air is cleaner than it was 30 years ago, for \nexample, does nothing to put current air quality in context. Just \nbecause the air is cleaner than it used to be doesn't mean that it is \ncompletely healthy.\n  My district is a great example of this. L.A. County has reduced its \nground ozone by 5 days since 2009, and I am proud of that, but it \ndoesn't mean our air is healthy. We still experienced 217 days of \nunhealthy ozone level days last year.\n  We need to take into account current pollution levels. We need to use \nthe best science available to determine what standards are needed to \nget our ozone pollution below those unhealthy\n\n[[Page H4801]]\n\nlevels. That is why we are doing this, to get the ozone below unhealthy \nlevels. That is what EPA is doing, and we shouldn't block their efforts \nbecause we think that the air is cleaner or it is difficult to reach.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The savings in public health will far outweigh the costs to polluting \nindustries. If the EPA would implement a standard of just 70 parts per \nbillion, the cost of implementation is estimated to be about $3.9 \nbillion, but the savings in public health costs are estimated to be \nanywhere from $6.4 to $13 billion. That is a net savings of $2.5 to $9 \nbillion. If you reduce the standard even lower, to 65 parts per \nbillion, the savings are even greater, from $4 to $23 billion in public \nhealth costs.\n  Ground ozone pollution costs billions of dollars in healthcare \nexpenses around the country. We have a chance to save taxpayers a lot \nof money.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's efforts on \ntrying to clean the ozone out of the South Coast Air Quality Management \nDistrict. We have to suffer the ozone that is being blown from L.A./\nLong Beach over into the Inland Empire. Certainly the ports of L.A. and \nLong Beach, the trains emit a lot of ozone and a lot of pollutants that \nend up in the Inland Empire, so we want to clean that air up.\n  As you know, we can't meet the 2008 standards at this time. We are \ndoing everything we can to meet those standards, but until these \ncommunities can get the technology to meet the existing standard, we \nshouldn't impose a new standard that could cause grave economic harm to \nthe communities.\n  With that, I would say ``no'' to this amendment and move on.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                          hydraulic fracturing\n\n       Sec. 439.

Reg. 16127 and 16577, \n     respectively).\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Cartwright\n\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, I rise to offer an amendment on behalf of \nmyself and the gentleman from California (Mr. Lowenthal), which I do \nintend to withdraw.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 132, line 14, strike ``or any other''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Chair, the Bureau of Land Management is currently \nworking toward implementation of a rule that would modernize horribly \noutdated oil and gas regulations on Federal land. My amendment would \nstrike a section of this bill that would halt this important work.\n  What we have to do is to allow the BLM to proceed with them \nimplementing this rule to provide a national baseline to protect our \nenvironment, our water, and our Federal lands from hazardous \ncontamination.\n  Since the 1980s, the scale and impacts associated with the oil and \ngas industry have grown dramatically, but BLM's fracking regulations \nhave not kept pace. In March of 2015, the BLM finalized a modest, \ncommonsense rule to update its 30-year-old fracking regulations.\n  With these updates, the BLM is taking responsible steps to improve \nwell integrity, reduce the impact of toxic wastewater, and increase \ntransparency around chemicals used in the fracking process.\n  Importantly, these new regulations will not impact States that \nalready have robust fracking regulations and will simply offer a \nregulatory baseline for the States that do not have current fracking \nregulations.\n  Notably, in 2013, there were still 19 States with operating fracking \nwells that had absolutely no hydraulic fracturing regulations in place.\n  Right now over 90 percent of the more than 2,500 oil and gas wells \ndrilled every year on federally managed lands use hydraulic fracturing.\n  Just this month the EPA released a draft report that concludes that \nthere are above- and below-ground mechanisms by which hazardous \nhydraulic fracturing chemicals have the potential to impact drinking \nwater resources.\n  Because of this, the Federal Government really has to take the \nnecessary steps to ensure that toxic, cancer-causing fracking chemicals \ndo not contaminate America's water supply, America's streams, America's \nrivers, and America's lakes.\n  As many of you know, the fracking fluids injected into oil and gas \nwells contain thousands of chemicals, many of which can harm humans and \nthe environment.\n  In fact, the EPA identified over 1,000 different chemicals that have \nbeen used during the hydraulic fracturing process, with an estimated \n9,100 gallons of chemicals used for each well.\n  Due in large part to fracking loopholes and outdated oil and gas \nregulations, fracking chemical spills and water contaminations have \noccurred.\n  In my home State of Pennsylvania, for example, there were nearly 600 \ndocumented cases of wastewater and chemical spills in 2013 alone.\n  In fact, the EPA estimates that there are as many as 12 chemical \nspills for every 100 oil and gas wells in the State of Pennsylvania. \nAnd I need to remind the House that there are almost 8,000 active gas \nwells operating in Pennsylvania right now. So that is a lot of spills.\n  Chemical and wastewater spills associated with fracking operations \nharm the environment, and it has been found to contaminate surface \nwater. The EPA's draft study found that 8 percent of studied wastewater \nspills polluted surface or groundwater.\n  Thankfully, the BLM's rule will help prevent fracking chemicals and \nwastewater from contaminating water bodies.\n  It does so by validating the integrity of fracking wells and \nincreasing the standards for storage and recovery of waste fluid. This \nrule will require companies publicly to disclose the chemicals being \npumped into public lands.\n  While I am concerned that the BLM fracking rule does not go far \nenough in some areas, simply stopping the rule in its tracks is just \nirresponsible.\n  I am not opposed to fracking. I believe we have to utilize our \nnatural resources, but we need to do so in a careful and responsible \nmanner.\n  There are bad actors in the oil and gas business just like there are \nsome bad actors in every area, actors that cut corners and don't drill \nand frack properly and safely.\n  The States, unfortunately, don't have all the expertise and resources \nto properly manage this exploding industry. The rule will set a \nrelatively low bar but one that ensures a baseline across the country \nto protect our public lands.\n  I urge you to support my amendment to allow the BLM to implement a \nrule that will prevent fracking chemical contamination and keep our \nNation's water supply pristine and something Americans can be proud of.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mrs. Lawrence\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 439.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould strike section 439 from the underlying bill. In doing so, this \namendment would allow the Bureau of Land Management to implement \nstandards\n\n[[Page H4802]]\n\nto support safe and responsible fracking operations on public and \nNative American lands.\n  More than 1.5 million public comments were submitted in a transparent \nprocess to regulate fracking on 750 million acres of public and Indian \nlands. More than 100,000 oil and gas wells are situated on these lands.\n  This amendment will ensure that the BLM's rule is fully implemented \nso that fracking for oil and gas continues but with full regard to \npublic health and the environment. I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  And I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I understand the BLM needed to update its regulation \nrelated to fracking on Federal and Indian lands. BLM regulations are \n25, 30 years old.\n  However, the States have been doing the same thing over the last \nnumber of years. Unfortunately, BLM's rule is duplicative of existing \nState regulation.\n  It forces companies to drill into a double compliance scheme. It also \ncosts them more time, and it significantly lengthens the time in which \nit takes time to get to a permit.\n  None of this is necessary, which is why we adopted this provision \nduring the committee's markup of this bill.\n  I certainly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nFlores).\n  Mr. FLORES. I thank Chairman Calvert for his hard work on this \nsection of the appropriations bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to the amendment. American \nconsumers have benefited from low energy prices, thanks to the American \nenergy revolution and technological advancements in hydraulic \nfracturing and horizontal drilling.\n  For decades, hydraulic fracturing has been successfully regulated by \nthe States. In 2013, the House passed on a bipartisan basis legislation \nwhich I coauthored with the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar) from the \nother side of the aisle, and that legislation would stop the BLM from \npursuing duplicative and burdensome hydraulic fracturing regulations.\n  Unfortunately, the BLM didn't listen to what Congress said, and it \ncontinued down a path to impose additional red tape on American energy \ndevelopment and to further drive down energy production on energy lands \nwhile State and private production continues to experience record \ngrowth in a safe and efficient manner.\n  This has always been a solution in search of a problem, particularly \nwhen the EPA and the Department of Energy have each agreed that \nhydraulic fracturing is being conducted safely right now.\n  Even the courts agree that there are problems with the BLM's rules, \nas evidenced by the recent stay granted by the U.S. District Court of \nWyoming to stop the BLM from moving forward with their overreaching \nregulatory activity.\n  This amendment is bad for jobs. It would increase energy costs and \nwould limit economic opportunity for hard-working families, \nparticularly those at the bottom end of the income tables. So it hurts \nthose that are struggling to get by today with higher energy costs.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Cole) for his work \non including this provision during markup, as well as Chairman Calvert \nfor his support on stopping this regulatory overreach.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chair, I yield such time as she may consume to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment before us would strike the \npolicy rider that prohibits the Bureau of Land Management from \nimplementing a uniform national standard for hydraulic fracking on \npublic lands, on Federal lands.\n  Such standards are necessary to ensure the operations on public and \ntribal lands are safe and that they are conducted in an environmentally \nresponsible way. This only affects Federal lands and tribal lands.\n  Now, of the 32 States with the potential for oil and gas development \non federally managed mineral resources, only slightly more than half of \nthem have rules in place that even address hydraulic fracturing, and \nthose that do have rules in place vary greatly in their requirements.\n  As you can see, there is no consistency in the rules. There is no \nguarantee that there are good quality rules put in place. And we are \ntalking about making sure that, on Federal leases, on Federal lands, \nthat we have a national standard.\n  The BLM continues to offer millions of public lands up for renewable \nenergy production, and that is why it is absolutely critical that they \nhave the confidence and the transparency and the safety and \nenvironmental protections that are put in place on these Federal lands.\n  Prior to the issuance of a hydraulic fracturing rule, the BLM rules \non oil and gas operation were updated over 30 years ago, 30 years ago. \nThey had not kept pace with the significant technology advancements in \nhydraulic fracturing techniques and the tremendous increase of its use.\n  As part of this implementation rule, the BLM office is in the process \nof meeting with their State counterparts--they are working with them--\nundertaking a State-by-State comparison of regulatory requirements in \norder to identify opportunities for variances and to establish \nmemorandums of understanding between the States that will realize \nefficiencies and allow for successful implementation of the rule. So we \nshould be allowing BLM to coordinate with the States and ensure that \nhydraulic fracturing activities are being carried out safely and \neffectively when Federal leases are involved.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Chairman, my State of Wyoming is the largest onshore \nproducer of oil and gas from Federal land. The reason our Wyoming court \nstayed the Federal BLM's rules is because Wyoming has been regulating \nfracking through its oil and gas commission from the beginning. There \nhas never been one documented case of drinking water being \ncontaminated. Furthermore, the way that BLM land lays with private land \nand State land is they are all interspersed; yet, underground, because \nof horizontal drilling, the drilling transcends from State land to \nprivate land to Federal land, and back and forth. Those wells are \nunitized so the production can be allocated among the various owners of \nprivate, State, and Federal land. You can't have two layers of surfaces \nState ownership regulation when the drilling is occurring going back \nand forth among State, private, and Federal lands.\n  Wyoming has handled its fracking regulations responsibly. It was the \nfirst in the Nation to do so. I strongly urge you leave it in the hands \nof States who do it best.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Flores).\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Chairman, in response to some of the comments that \nwere never made, I would like to offer five points.\n  Number one is BLM doesn't have the statutory authority to do the \nactions that they tried to. The Federal Court was right in granting an \ninjunction. The EPA and the Department of Energy have both said that \nhydraulic fracturing is safe, and that is evidenced by the safe and \nefficient production of much more oil and gas on private and State \nlands while Federal production is going down.\n  Again, this is a solution in search of a problem. So I would urge all \nmy colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I want to say congratulations to the \nState of Wyoming. That is exactly why we need this amendment. We want \nthose same regulations on a national level. Mr. Chairman, 16 to 17 \nStates have no regulation. Wyoming has gotten it right.\n  This amendment will ensure that the BLM rule is fully implemented so \nthat\n\n[[Page H4803]]\n\nfracking for oil and gas continues, but with full regard to the public \nhealth and the environment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Lawrence).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Michigan \nwill be postponed.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n                       spending reduction account\n\n       Sec. 440.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n   limitation on use of funds to implement the revised comprehensive \n   conservation plan for the arctic national wildlife refuge, alaska\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement the Revised Comprehensive Conservation \n     Plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, Alaska \n     published in the Federal Register on January 27, 2015 (80 Fed \n     Reg. 4303).\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alaska and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment.\n  I want to thank Mr. Calvert and his committee for the work they have \ndone on this legislation, and I support the underlying bill. The \nadministration has left no alternative to the people of Alaska and to \nthose with an interest in our national energy policy.\n  This spring, under this President, the Department of the Interior \npublished the management plan for the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge \nto recommend the entirety of the area be designated as wilderness. This \nwould include the 1002 area that was set aside by Congress for \npotential development in the future, an area that holds 10 billion \nbarrels of oil, at the minimum, and probably 37 trillion cubic feet of \nnatural gas.\n  My amendment would ensure that no funding can be spent implementing \nthis recommendation. The impact of this recommendation should not be \noverlooked, as the recommendation requires immediate management of the \nentire area as wilderness--unilaterally undermining the role of \nCongress through a de facto wilderness designation.\n  This action violates the Statehood Compact, which was founded on \nensuring the development of subsurface resources for the economic well-\nbeing of this Nation. This action also violates the Alaska National \nInterest Lands Conservation Act, which established more than 100 \nmillion acres of conservation areas. And in recognition of the enormity \nof the acreage being locked up, the act drew a line guaranteeing that \nno more conservation areas can be created without an act of Congress--\nour role.\n  There is no need for additional wilderness areas in ANWR, given 92 \npercent of the refuge is already closed to development.\n  Mr. Chairman, Alaska holds 53 percent of Federal wilderness areas in \nthe Nation, and that is not enough for this administration. You think \nabout that a moment. The administration's plan immediately raises \nanother administrative, bureaucratic wall to oil and gas development. \nThis is a betrayal to the Alaskan people and, I believe, to this Nation \nand to this Congress. This plan by the administration handcuffs my \nState from providing for itself and pushes us to be more dependent on \nFederal funds.\n  This is not just an assault on Alaska. This is another example of \nexecutive overreach by this administration undermining the role of \nCongress. This is our role, not this administration's. I don't care \nwhose administration it is; when the President oversteps his bounds, we \nshould take and accept our responsibility. And this is the law he \ncannot do, but he says ``I can do it.''\n  By the way, Mr. Chairman, this was an example, I think, of this whole \nDepartment of the Interior. Between EPA and the Department of the \nInterior, they are trying to cripple this Nation, trying to cripple my \nState, against the law. This is very specific in ANILCA. If you don't \nbelieve me, go back and read it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment offered by my friend from \nAlaska would prohibit any Federal funds from being used to implement \nthe administration's revised comprehensive conservation plan to better \nsustain and manage the entire Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n  Mr. Chairman, attaching this rider to the Interior Appropriations \nbill would be a mistake. The coastal plain of the Arctic refuge is one \nof the few remaining places in our Nation that remains pristine and \nundisturbed. It provides critical protection for thousands of species--\ncaribou, polar bear, and gray wolves, just to name a few--and they \ndesperately need this important habitat. Roughly 20 million acres \nmanaged by U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service are some of the best and last \nundisturbed natural areas in this Nation.\n  I understand that the gentleman from Alaska feels strongly about this \nissue, and he has been a great advocate for his State for decades; but \non this important issue, we deeply disagree.\n  Mr. Chairman, earlier this year, the Interior Department released an \nupdated conservation plan to better manage the Arctic National Wildlife \nRefuge, and the President took that opportunity to call on Congress to \npass legislation designating the coastal plain as a wilderness, an even \ngreater level of protection for this incredible area. The protected \narea encompasses a wide range of Arctic and subarctic ecosystems. There \nare unadulterated landforms, and there are native flora and fauna. The \nrefuge has an incredible biological integrity, natural diversity, and \nenvironmental health.\n  I understand that there are differences of opinion how to manage this \nland and that legislation designated in this area as wilderness may not \nget very far in this Congress. But I want to commend the President for \nhis leadership on this issue, and I would hope that the legislative \nprocess could play out and that we not adopt this rider onto this bill \nbecause this issue is just far too important.\n  Lastly, Mr. Chairman, I would be remiss if I did not point out one \nmore obvious truth: the President will not sign a bill loaded up with \nantienvironmental riders just like this one. So we only make the path \nfor the bill harder by including it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I hope my colleagues will join me in opposing it, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. I appreciate the comments from the gentlewoman.\n  I would suggest, respectfully, we should follow the law. We have \ngiven up the responsibility in this Congress to the President--not just \nthis President, other Presidents. It is clear in the law nothing more \nthan 5,000 acres can be withdrawn and put in the wilderness, without \nthe okay of the Congress, in Alaska. No more clause. It stands for no \nmore.\n  Now, we have a President that says ``up yours'' to the Congress. That \nis not the way to run this business. We have a responsibility as \nCongressmen to do our job. And when he goes against the law through \nexecutive order, that is against this Constitution of America.\n\n[[Page H4804]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I certainly would urge the adoption of the gentleman's \namendment, and I support his amendment.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the \n     following new section:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Executive Order 13007, entitled \n     ``Indian Sacred Sites''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would ensure that cultural \nand sacred sites of Indian and Alaska Native tribes are protected by \nmandating that none of the funds in this bill can be used in \ncontravention of Executive Order 13007.\n  Executive Order 13007, issued by President Clinton in 1996, requires \nFederal agencies to accommodate access to and ceremonial use of Indian \nsacred sites and, more importantly, to avoid adversely affecting the \nphysical integrity of such sacred sites.\n  Far too often, Indian sacred sites are an afterthought during the \nFederal Government land management process. When negotiating land swaps \nand when constructing other management decisions, the voice of Indian \nCountry with regard to sacred sites is ignored. But this is not just \nland to the Native people. These are cultural and spiritual areas that \nare part of the tribe's history and its living legacy. These are places \nwhere their ancestors lived, prayed, hunted, gathered, fought, and \ndied. They are part and parcel of tribal identity, and it is our duty \nto ensure they are preserved and protected.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am happy to accept the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Department of the Interior tells me they are already in \ncompliance with the executive order. There is no question that \nproviding Indian tribes with access to their sacred sites is the right \nthing to do, so I would be more than happy to accept the gentleman's \namendment.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's amendment. The \ngentleman's amendment will ensure that this important executive order \nis respected in such a way that it has my wholehearted support in \nprotecting the liberty and religious rights of Native American Indians.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the ranking member, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Poliquin\n\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 63.7570(b)(2) of \n     title 40, Code of Federal Regulations (as in effect on the \n     date of enactment of this Act).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Maine and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maine.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, Maine is home to the most skilled paper \nmakers in the world. Our hardworking men and women manufacture paper \nproducts that we use every day. Our paper makers are also some of the \nbest stewards of the environment. They know that we need healthy \nforests to make the high quality wood products sold around the globe.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  When trees are harvested to make paper, the branches and the bark can \nbe left behind to be decomposed; or they can be burned to generate \nenergy to run the machinery to make paper.\n  Either way, the carbon from this biomass is returned to the \nenvironment as part of the natural carbon cycle. What a great idea--\ninstead of ending up in a landfill, this green, renewable energy fuels \nour economy and creates jobs.\n  Now, our Sappi paper mill in Skowhegan, Maine, burns biomass to make \nsome of the finest quality paper in the world. In doing so, it directly \nemploys 800 hard-working Mainers. In addition, loggers and truckers who \nproduce and transport this biomass also earn paychecks for their \nfamilies.\n  Unfortunately, the Environmental Protection Agency is attacking this \nrenewable method to power our businesses and to create jobs. All of us \nwho have sat around a campfire have seen that wet wood, branches, and \ngrass emit a darker smoke. However, the same carbon is being recycled \nthrough the environment. It is just a slightly different color.\n  The EPA wants to impose stricter emission standards on companies that \nburn wet wood, branches, and bark instead of dumping them into a \nlandfill. That just doesn't make sense.\n  Mr. Chairman, the EPA is trying to force our Skowhegan mill to spend \nmillions of additional dollars on special smokestack equipment because \nwet biomass burns darker. The mill owners have worked diligently with \nthe regional EPA office in Boston and the Maine Department of \nEnvironmental Protection to put in place a commonsense emissions \nmonitoring system that reflects the burning of biomass. Sadly, the EPA \nheadquarters right here in Washington rejected their sensible solution.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is not fair, and this is not right. Those 800 \nhard-working paper makers at the Sappi mill deserve an EPA that works \nfor them, not against them.\n  Now, our paper mill in Maine could very well be a different mill in \nMichigan, Minnesota, or Georgia that also uses green American biomass \nenergy.\n  America should keep her energy dollars and jobs here at home and not \nship them to the Middle East. Our businesses need that energy to keep \nour manufacturing jobs right here in America and not send them to \nChina. This is a national security issue, as well as a jobs issue, Mr. \nChairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my House Republicans and Democrats today to \nsupport my simple, commonsense bill. Passing it will stop the EPA from \nunfairly penalizing employers who use green, renewable American biomass \nenergy.\n  My amendment prohibits the EPA from reaching beyond some of the \nbiomass emission rules already being enforced by the regional EPA \noffices and the State environmental authorities.\n  Let's show the American people today that Congress supports a \ndomestic energy source that is good for the environment, creates jobs, \nand keeps us safer here at home\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I suspect this issue is not just limited to your State, \nand I hope this language will help bring EPA to the table so that \neveryone can find a path forward for this issue that is important for \nthe country.\n  Certainly, I have no objection to this amendment. In fact, I support \nit.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Thank you very much, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H4805]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, it is a blanket block to the EPA from \nfully implementing and enforcing air toxic standards for boilers and \nincinerators.\n  Among other things, there are boilers that burn natural gas, coal, \nwood, oil, and other fuel to produce steam, and the steam does produce \nelectricity or provide heat, and incinerators burn waste to dispose of \nit. These boilers and incinerators have the potential of releasing very \ntoxic pollutants such as mercury, lead, dioxin, and other pollutants \nthat are linked to health effects.\n  In 2011, after a robust public process, including three public \nhearings and responding to thousands of public comments, the EPA \nfinalized standards to reduce toxic emissions for existing new boilers \nand commercial industrial solid waste incinerators and sewage sludge \nincinerators.\n  Now, among other things, the rule requires emissions to just meet \ncertain standards. It is a measurement of air pollution based on the \ndegree of which light is blocked by the pollutant from the smokestack.\n  The rule also allows the EPA to approve alternative opacity limits \nunder certain circumstances, so there is flexibility within the rule.\n  Now, the local paper mills in the representative State are exceeding \nor they are expected to exceed the standard in the EPA's final rule, so \nto better fit their circumstances, they want an alternate opinion. That \nis the issue that the EPA is looking at right now. The EPA is looking \nat this right now. They heard the concerns; they are looking at it.\n  Strangely, this amendment would not really address that issue. \nInstead, it would block the EPA from ever approving an alternative \nlimit or implementing or enforcing an alternative limit that had \nalready been improved.\n  I rise because this amendment, unfortunately, just does not make any \nsense to me that we would not keep the dialogue moving forward. The EPA \nhas the responsibility of making sure that standards of emissions with \nmercury and lead and other toxic pollutants are not dangerous to public \nhealth, especially to children. We know statistically now that up to \n8,100 premature deaths, 5,100 heart attacks, and 52 asthma attacks are \nall worked into reducing the emissions, to lower those numbers.\n  We need to stand with the EPA air toxic standards and allow them to \nachieve their intended benefits and to work with industry where it \nmakes sense, and we can have industry move forward but still protect \nthe public health, just not scrap the parts that industry dislikes.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment because it would keep \nthe EPA from doing what it is doing right now, and that is to work with \nindustry, oddly enough, to create a win-win for industry and a win-win \nfor public health.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Chairman, I would strongly disagree with my \ncolleague on the other side of the aisle.\n  Those of us or those who have visited our great State know that we \nhave a pristine natural environment. It is part of our brand, Mr. \nChairman. It is something that we protect and will continue to protect \nat all costs.\n  However, as a freshman legislator, I have been here for 6 months, and \nwhat I have learned in those 6 months is that we have almost a fourth \nbranch of government, and that is these regulators that regulate every \npart of our life, whether we are trying to make paper or what have you \nand trying to provide work for our families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 102(a)(1) of Public Law \n     94-579 (43 U.S.C. 1701(a)(1)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, with this amendment, this body has the \nopportunity to say loudly and clearly: Let's keep our public lands \npublic.\n  Public lands are a massive economic generator and are important to \nour health and welfare as Americans. They are beautiful, and they are \nhealing. I recently got to hear from a veteran in Eagle County, and \npart of his recovery process is the time he spends outdoors on our \npublic lands. They are also practical. They help ensure for water \nquality and maintain the critical aspects of rural life like farming, \nranching, grazing, and logging.\n  Public lands are where our hunters and fishermen go to enjoy the \noutdoors. They are where skiers, hikers, bikers, and motorists \nexperience activities that are impossible in other places and are \ninvaluable to their quality of life.\n  Outdoor enthusiasts utilize those areas. It is a vast economic driver \nas well. In fact, over $646 billion is generated economically through \nour public lands, and visiting our public lands supports over 6 million \njobs, including many in my district and many in our great State of \nColorado.\n  When recently polled across six western States, the American people \nsaid with 96 percent support--with unheard of levels of support--that \nprotecting public lands for future generations is one of their top \npriorities and that, above and apart from any other, they see the \nmaintenance for access of outdoor activities on our public lands as a \ncritical focus of our Federal Government.\n  States don't have the resources or expertise to suddenly take on the \nresponsibilities for our Federal lands, nor do State governments even \nwant that authority, Mr. Chairman.\n  Selling these lands outright to private owners or purveyors would \nundoubtedly lead to loss of access to these majestic, treasured spaces \nand, at the same time, would destroy jobs across the West and other \nareas that are blessed to have public lands; yet there has been attempt \nafter attempt to transfer our most precious public spaces to the States \nor to private ownership or to sell them at wholesale.\n  Mr. Chairman, the sportsmen don't want this. The hikers, bikers, \ncampers, skiers, and motorized activists that make up the areas \nsurrounding those held by the Federal Government do not want their land \ntaken away--our land taken away.\n  Those concerned with environmental well-being, water quality, and \npublic health that depends on the stewardship of our public lands do \nnot want our public lands taken away.\n  It is lost to me, Mr. Chairman--and perhaps my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle can speak to this--exactly who is impacted by \nand who does touch and enjoy and rely on our public lands and actually \ndoes want to see them taken away.\n  I would pose this inquiry, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this would just make it difficult and \nimpossible for Federal agencies to dispose or willingly or equitably \nexchange or convey lands to States, local governments, private \nlandowners, and others.\n  I just may point out the Federal Government currently can't manage \nits existing land, which is over 640 million acres or approximately 3 \nout of every 10 acres in the United States.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, all my amendment does is ensure that none of \nthe funds made available to this act can be used in contravention to \nthe law of the land. My amendment wouldn't do anything to undermine \ncurrent authority of congressionally and administratively driven land \nexchanges. In fact, I brought several before this body and have seen \nseveral signed into law.\n  My district is 62 percent Federal land, and we always have various \nexchanges, purchases, and sales. Of course, those are consistent with \nthe law, which allows the funds to be used under this bill.\n\n[[Page H4806]]\n\n  I am a strong believer in the ability of our Federal Government and \nCongress to make choices wisely in a thorough public and transparent \nprocess, which we do in this body.\n  What my amendment would do instead is prohibit the use of funds in \nthis bill to pursue any additional extra legal ways to turn our Federal \nland over to private owners. It would prohibit Federal dollars from \nbeing used to support, for instance, a commission around finding \navenues to turn all Federal lands over to private ownership.\n  These kinds of ventures are fiscally wasteful and counterproductive \nand wholly unwanted by the American people who rely and derive \nspiritual support, health, and jobs from our public lands.\n  I urge my colleagues to reflect upon who exactly we are working for \nand what our goal is with regard to our public lands.\n  I strongly support ensuring that all the provisions of this \nappropriations bill are limited to the full pursuit of section \n102(a)(1) of Public Law 94-579 with regard to our public lands and that \nnone of this money, which is what this amendment will do, can be \ndiverted to privatize our public lands.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to treat the sonoran desert tortoise as an \n                endangered species or threatened species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     treat the Sonoran desert tortoise as an endangered species or \n     threatened species under the Endangered Species Act of 1973 \n     (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a commonsense amendment to \nthe Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.\n  My amendment will protect education, grazing, agriculture, energy, \nhousing interests, as well as assist with preventing dangerous \nwildfires by blocking the Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the \nSonoran desert tortoise as an endangered or threatened species. A \nlisting decision for the Sonoran desert tortoise is expected this \nfiscal year.\n  Of the potential 26.8 million acres that will likely be designated \nfor critical habitat due to such a listing, 15 million acres are \nlocated in the United States, and nearly 4.5 million acres are State \ntrust land.\n  State trust land revenues, which are currently enjoyed by 13 \nbeneficiaries, of which K-12 education is the largest proportional \nshare of those moneys, will be severely impacted.\n  If the Sonoran desert tortoise is listed, these acres of trust land \nwill become less valuable for investment as they are burdened with a \nfederal regulatory nexus. Without this amendment, schools that have \nalready undergone significant budget cuts will see even less money \nflowing into their educational coffers.\n  The Sonoran desert tortoise is also of substantial concern to many \ndifferent types of industry, as its habitat falls within urban \ndevelopment corridors as well as on rural and agricultural landscapes.\n  Listing the species as threatened or endangered will negatively \nimpact commercial, housing and energy developers as well as the \nagriculture and grazing industries.\n  Specifically, a listing would be detrimental for 273 different \ngrazing allotments and would jeopardize nearly 6 million acres used for \nlivestock grazing.\n  Mining will also suffer, as the BLM listed 9,675 new mining claims \nfrom 1990 to 2002, 36 percent of which fall within the Sonoran desert \ntortoise's habitat.\n  Any ground and vegetation-disturbing activities, including fire \nsuppression activities and restorative treatments, would also be \nnegatively impacted by a listing decision for the species.\n  Solar energy would also likely be harmed, as large solar projects on \ndesert floors are considered a potential threat to the Sonoran desert \ntortoise.\n  My amendment will also encourage significant voluntary efforts and \nfinancial contributions for the Sonoran desert tortoise to continue, \nmany of which are already underway at the local level.\n  Important local conservation efforts began for the species in 2010, \nand a Candidate Conservation Agreement was recently signed by 15 \ndifferent agencies in February.\n  Should the Sonoran desert tortoise become listed, these voluntary \nefforts and moneys will dissipate as local property owners, ranchers, \nand developers will no longer have any incentive to work with the \nFederal and State wildlife management agencies on conservation efforts \nfor the species.\n  My amendment is supported by the Public Lands Council, the National \nCattlemen's Beef Association, Americans for Limited Government, the \nArizona Cattlemen's Association, the Arizona Farm Bureau, the Arizona \nMining Association, the Home Builders Association of Central Arizona, \nand numerous other organizations that are strongly opposed to this \nlisting.\n  I thank the chair and the ranking member for their tireless efforts \nto produce this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would do two things. \nFirst, it would prohibit the Fish and Wildlife Service from treating \nthe Sonoran desert tortoise as threatened or endangered under the \nEndangered Species Act. Secondly, it would restrict the Service from \noffering any of the critical protections to preserve the species.\n  The Sonoran desert tortoise is an iconic species. It has been part of \nthe Sonoran Desert ecosystem for over 150,000 years. In 2010, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service found that the listing for the Sonoran desert \ntortoise was warranted, but it was precluded because it needed to \naddress other higher priorities.\n  So last December the Service announced that it was working on a \nproposed listing determination that is expected to be published within \nthe year.\n  This amendment, if it were to pass, would stop the Fish and Wildlife \nService's efforts and block the Service from meeting a court-ordered \ndeadline to make this listing determination. In other words, they would \nput the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service at odds with what the court has \nrequested them to do. This amendment has no place in the appropriations \nprocess, nor does it have any place in this legislative process.\n  Let's just think about the Endangered Species Act for a minute. It \nhas been one of our most effective and important environmental laws, \nand it is supported by over 85 percent of Americans.\n  There has been no law that has been more important in preventing the \nextinction of wildlife, but some Members of this body seem determined \nto undermine the law by placing harmful policy riders on this bill.\n  From my count, as of right now, there are at least 10 species that \nare at risk of losing the Endangered Species Act protections in this \nbill.\n  What type of conservation legacy are we leaving for future \ngenerations? That is why I oppose the amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to oppose it as well.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, the Sonoran desert tortoise is part of a\n\n[[Page H4807]]\n\ngrowing problem involving large settlements with the environmental \ngroups who sue the Fish and Wildlife Service's regulatory protections \nwith regard to a large number of different wildlife and plant species.\n  These multi-district litigation settlements, commonly known as ``sue \nand settle tactics,'' force the Fish and Wildlife Service to make \nlisting decisions on several hundred species, often with little or no \nscientific data supporting these listings and without public input to \nthis process.\n  This possible listing is a result of a lawsuit filed by a few special \ninterest groups aimed at stifling development and has nothing to do \nwith the tortoise.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Tsongas\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n  limitation on use of funds to implement or enforce specific sections\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 117, 121, or 122 of \n     this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment, which I offer with Mr. Beyer \nof Virginia, would strike three policy riders related to the Endangered \nSpecies Act from the underlying bill, those concerning the greater \nsage-grouse, the northern long-eared bat, and the gray wolf. I want to \nfocus my remarks on the greater sage-grouse.\n  The language in this bill that seeks to block an Endangered Species \nAct listing of the bird is unnecessary and is completely inappropriate, \nputting both the species and the historic quintessentially American \nsagebrush steppe landscape at risk.\n  In 1901, Mark Twain described the sagebrush steppe as a ``forest in \nexquisite miniature.'' At one point, as many as 16 million greater \nsage-grouse called the sagebrush sea home. Settlers traveling west said \nthat flocks of sage-grouse ``blackened the sky.'' Today the population \nhas been reduced to as few as 200,000 birds.\n  Right now there are unprecedented and proactive partnerships \nthroughout the West which are working to conserve sagebrush habitat, to \nencourage predictability for economic development, and to prevent the \nlisting of the greater sage-grouse as endangered or threatened under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Federal agencies, States, sportsmen, ranchers, farmers, and \nconservationists have all come together in this effort. In fact, the 10 \nland management plans released by the Interior Department last month \nare based on plans developed by the States, not one size fits all, but \nindividual plans to suit each State's individual needs. This is all the \nresult of a concerted collaboration.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service and the States themselves agree that, \nas long as these partnerships continue, it is likely that the greater \nsage-grouse will not be listed as endangered or threatened under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Rather than helping communities, the rider in this bill creates \nuncertainty and only undermines the immense coordinated progress \nalready underway. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I will talk about the three different \nprovisions to this amendment. Let me first talk about the sage-grouse.\n  The sage-grouse provision in this bill is meant to give the Fish and \nWildlife Service time to make a determination of whether there ought to \nbe a listing or not. The court has ordered them to make a determination \nby, I think, September 30. We are trying to give them the time \nnecessary.\n  This is going to affect 11 Western States. It is not going to affect \nMassachusetts, by the way, but it is going to affect 11 Western States \nsubstantially.\n  They have recently put out their resource management plans to the \nStates. There is a period in which the States have a chance to interact \nwith the Federal agency and raise their complaints and so forth about \nwhat the problems are with their resource management plans.\n  We are trying to give the Fish and Wildlife Service and the States--\nthe 11 Western States, by the way, not Massachusetts--the time to come \nup with a plan so that we don't list this bird.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service and the States--everybody, \nessentially--agree we don't want sage-grouse listed. The States have \nmade incredible progress and have made incredible sacrifices.\n  The State of Wyoming has taken, I want to say, millions of acres \nwhich have potential resources off the table in order to protect the \nsage-grouse. So we have taken extraordinary efforts to make sure that \nwe don't list this bird.\n  As far as the wolves are concerned, the fact is that the Fish and \nWildlife Service delisted the wolves. It was not us. We didn't want to \ngo against science. We are not going against science. We aren't trying \nto make any species become extinct.\n  It was the Fish and Wildlife Service in their use of science that \ndelisted the wolves. But guess what. Some people weren't happy with \nthat; so, they took them to court. And now we are in a court case. The \nsame thing happened in Idaho and in Montana.\n  This language doesn't take a species off the endangered species list. \nSome people think we are trying to delist species, and we are not. We \nare going back to the decision made by the Fish and Wildlife Service to \ndelist the wolves in the Great Lakes and in the State of Wyoming.\n  I think, if you want to talk about the cost and if you want to \ncomplain about what is going on here, you really ought to complain to \nthe plaintiffs who are causing all of this hassle with wolves when the \nStates have done exactly what they were supposed to do.\n  The wolf populations in the Great Lakes particularly have exploded. \nIn Idaho and Montana, they have exploded. In Wyoming, they have \nexploded. That is why the Fish and Wildlife Service delisted them.\n  This amendment is contrary to every bit of science that there is that \ndeals with endangered species. So I would urge my colleagues to reject \nthis amendment even though it doesn't affect Massachusetts.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I would like to first comment that \nMassachusetts, at one time, was home to the Heath Hen, which is the \ngreater sage-grouse's cousin.\n  Because at that time we did not have an Endangered Species Act, that \nHeath Hen is now, unfortunately, extinct. So we have learned an \nimportant lesson about the great role the Endangered Species Act does \nplay to protect some of our remarkable species.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. BEYER. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Chairman, despite what you may hear from some Members of \nCongress, gray wolves have not recovered. In a test by the Fish and \nWildlife Service to remove them from the Endangered Species Act, \nprotections for wolves have failed time and again.\n  Why? It is because scientific experts have shown and the courts have \nconfirmed that the best available science does not justify the removal \nof all ESA protections for gray wolves at this time.\n  In fact, the only instance in which wolves have been delisted has \nbeen through the unprecedented and unfortunate congressional action in \n2011 to remove protections from wolves in the Northern Rocky Mountains.\n  These wolves are now endlessly persecuted by hunters and ranchers \ndespite the positive effects they have on the ecosystem and the minimal \ntoll they take on livestock.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Wolf-related tourism around Yellowstone generates more than $35 \nmillion annually for local economies, and recovery in the Pacific \nNorthwest is only beginning.\n\n[[Page H4808]]\n\n  This amendment would prevent Congress from directing the Fish and \nWildlife Service to reissue the delisting of wolves in the western \nGreat Lakes and Wyoming. Now is not the time for Congress to declare \nopen season on one of America's most iconic wild animals. Science, not \npolitics, should guide these delisting decisions.\n  By the way, wolves are not in Massachusetts, they are not in \nVirginia, and they never will be as long as we do not continue our \nefforts to protect wolves and allow them to occupy the old territories \nthey did a few hundred years ago.\n  This amendment would also allow the Fish and Wildlife Service to move \nforward with steps to protect the northern long-eared bat. Over the \npast decade, populations of the bat have declined 98 percent, mostly \nbecause of the deadly effects of white-nose syndrome. As a result, Fish \nand Wildlife Service recently listed the bat as a threatened species. \nWhile scientists and wildlife managers work to fight the spread of \nwhite-nose syndrome, it is important to ensure that the remaining bat \npopulations are safe from other threats.\n  The interim rule currently in effect governing taking of the bat is \nincredibly flexible and was developed in close coordination with \nindustry stakeholders, particularly the timber industry, to ensure that \neconomic activity is not negatively impacted.\n  The final rule is expected to be similarly flexible. The language in \nthis bill will only serve as a delay tactic, causing additional \nuncertainty for businesses and property owners, and this amendment \nwould effectively strike these unnecessary sections from the bill.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. I appreciate the \ngentleman's comments. I do have some gray wolves in Idaho, Montana, \nWyoming, and other places that we will be happy to ship to you if you \nlike. In fact, we didn't have any in Idaho until Fish and Wildlife \nService decided that they were going to reintroduce them in Idaho.\n  When you say the minimal take that it has on cattle, wildlife, and \nother types of things, there were gray wolves in Idaho that one sheep \nrancher lost over 300 head of sheep in one night to some wolves. That \nends his business, essentially. So it is not a minimal take. If you \nlook at the calf-to-cow ratio of elk and deer in Idaho, the numbers \nhave been down substantially, particularly with elk because, guess \nwhat, they like elk, even though we were told that they will go after \ndeer and not elk. Wolves, I guess, like elk better than they do deer.\n  The gentleman says we need to depend on science, not Congress. \nCongress never delisted a species. We didn't delist the gray wolves in \nIdaho and Montana. It was the Fish and Wildlife Service using science. \nWhen you say the gray wolves have not recovered, where is your science? \nWhere do you get that? Where does that statement come from? Fish and \nWildlife Service that has done the investigations said yes, they have. \nSo do we just not trust them?\n  It is you people proposing this amendment that are going against \nscience. We are just trying to make sure that the science is protected, \nand politics doesn't enter. We appreciate the people of Virginia and \nthe people of Massachusetts trying to make sure that the wolves are \nhealthy in Idaho. I can guarantee you they are. They are not \npersecuted, as you said. Yes, they are hunted, but anybody who believed \nwe were going to introduce wolves into Idaho or Montana where they \nhadn't been for a number of years and you weren't going to have to \nmaintain population controls of them was living in a fantasyland.\n  Yes, we do have hunting seasons for wolves, as we do almost all \nspecies, but we have to maintain a certain population, and if that \npopulation isn't maintained, guess what. Fish and Wildlife takes over, \nand they go back on the endangered list. So it is not Congress that is \nmaking these decisions. It is Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that the riders \nin the underlying bill will do nothing to help our native species but, \ninstead, only serve to cause uncertainty and delay, undermining all the \nconcerted effort by many stakeholders, all seeking to avoid a listing, \nparticularly with the sage-grouse.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the United Nations Environment Programme.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer one final amendment to the \nDepartment of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations Act.\n  The amendment is simple. It prohibits the EPA from providing funding \nto the United Nations Environment Programme. The United Nations \nEnvironment Programme, or UNEP--I would call it inept--has a history of \ntaking unusual and extreme policy positions, including advocating for \npopulation control.\n  The United Nations is typically funded in the State Department's \nbudget under contributions to international organizations, or CIL. The \nfunds appropriated by this act are meant to be used domestically, not \nas a slush fund to give to programs at the United Nations.\n  I will quickly highlight some of the names of the UNEP initiatives \nthat the EPA spent millions of dollars on. One is to promote \nenvironmental sound management worldwide. Another one is UNEP Regional \nProgram, Climate Benefits, Asia Pacific. There is even one called \nRussian Federation Support to the National Program of Action for the \nProtection of the Arctic. This last one is money that goes specifically \nto the Russian cause.\n  I will read from the EPA's own Web site the description of this \nprogram:\n\n       This project centers on protection of the Arctic \n     environment in Russia.\n       This work will cover three broad areas:\n       Number one, implementation of Russia's national plan of \n     action for protection of the Arctic marine environment from \n     anthropogenic pollution;\n       Number two, hazardous chemical management;\n       And, three, climate change mitigation adaptation and \n     awareness.\n\n  So let me get this straight. In addition to the billions we \ncontribute to the United Nations through the CIO account, the EPA is \nfunneling millions of tax dollars to this United Nations program, which \nthen gives the money to Russia, who then uses it to implement a Russian \nnational plan and for climate change mitigation, adaptation, and \nawareness.\n  U.S. taxpayers, do I need to say anything further why we need to stop \nthis? Let's keep the United States Environmental Protection Agency \nfocused on issues within the United States. Our favorite out-of-control \nagency need not be concerned with the Asia-Pacific region or with \nRussia.\n  I urge my colleagues to adopt this commonsense amendment that is \nendorsed by the Americans for Limited Government, the Eagle Forum, the \nTaxpayers Protection Alliance, the Council for Citizens Against \nGovernment Waste, and the Yavapai County Board of Supervisors.\n  I thank the chairman and ranking member for their tireless efforts in \nproducing this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4809]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit any agency \nfrom using funds for the United Nations Environment Programme. Funds \nfor the U.N. are primarily provided through the State, Foreign \nOperations, and Related Programs Subcommittee. The EPA administers \nabout $500,000 of international grants, not the millions or the \nbillions that were referred to in this particular bill. So I strongly \noppose the amendment.\n  I understand, as I said earlier, there is a small amount of funding \nadministered for the U.N. Environment Programme in this bill. The \nprimary source of funding for the international programs, I want to \nstress again, is in the State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs \nbill, not this bill.\n  So this amendment seeks to solve a problem that really doesn't exist \nin this bill, but jurisdictional questions aside, we must be an \ninternational partner with respect to the environment. Engagement with \nthe international community allows us to share and learn best practices \non how to manage toxic substances; international engagement helps set \ninternational standards to help our products compete globally; and, \nmore importantly, pollution knows no boundaries. It does not respect \ninternational borders.\n  In the 1970s and 1980s, acid rain was a problem both in the United \nStates and Canada, and through domestic legislation and international \nwork with Canada, we have reduced the amount of acid rain that falls \nupon the United States and Canada. Now, right now in my home State of \nMinnesota, we are under a high pollution warning. The culprit is, \nsadly, a series of forest fires that are raging to the north border of \nus in Saskatchewan. Now, if we are going to be committed to clean air \nand clean water on the Canadian-U.S. border, we must be engaged both \nhere at home and abroad.\n  So as a proud Minnesotan and a proud Member of the United States \nCongress, I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment and to work \ntogether in partnership.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Let's set the record straight. CRS, hardly a partisan \neffort, since 2003 reports they spent over $6 million in foreign \nagencies in this very fund. Imagine that. The facts are only convenient \nwhen they help us on our side.\n  If we are going to have a discussion about this, let's put it in the \nState Department budget and let's talk about it, but let's not hide it \nin the EPA. Let's keep the EPA's budget and dealings right here in the \nUnited States where they belong. They hardly have a track record of \nsuccess here in the States.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to stress again that, in \nthis bill, there is $500,000. And I would also like to stress, when it \ncomes to regulating waters in the Great Lakes, our tributary rivers and \nbasins on the northern border--and I am sure the same thing, I can't \nspeak with as much eloquence as to what is happening on our southern \nborder--we need to have these international interlocutors. I would \nappreciate the opportunity for my State and for the Great Lakes States \nto be able to continue the strong partnership with our Canadian \npartners.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, with an over $18 trillion debt, when is enough \nenough? If we are going to talk about foreign expenditures of dollars, \nlet's put it in the State Department budget and make sure we have an \nopen and honest conversation, but it does not belong here. We have to \nstart concentrating on what is important to the United States, not \nRussia. I guess that is Putin's kind of game is that we clean up his \nmesses for him.\n  I ask everybody to adopt this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n            limitation on use of funds with respect to ivory\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce section 120 of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, at the inception of the debate and \ndiscussion regarding this appropriations bill, I indicated I would \noffer an amendment to prevent language in the bill from driving the \nextinction of the African elephants.\n  I expect the administration to release its proposed ivory rule this \nmonth, and it deserves the support of every Member of this Chamber. \nThis rider that is currently in the language of the bill is another \nunfounded attack on an endangered species that our Nation's top \nscientific experts have concluded will go extinct without the \nprotection of the Endangered Species Act, under which this rule is \nbeing promulgated.\n  I mentioned in my previous statement the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService recently destroyed a one-ton stockpile of illegal elephant \nivory, most of it seized in Philadelphia from an antique dealer named \nVictor Gordon.\n  Gordon imported and sold ivory from freshly killed African elephants \nin violation of U.S. law and the laws of the countries where the \nelephants were poached, and the ivory was stolen. The ivory was \ndoctored so that it looked old enough to pass through a loophole in the \nlaw. All of this ivory is illegal. All of it is nearly impossible to \ndistinguish from antique ivory, and anyone who bought it from Gordon \nand resells it or buys it from a new owner is contributing to the \nongoing slaughter of elephants and the criminal trafficking of ivory \nthat supports organized crime and terrorism.\n  The only way to keep U.S. citizens from being involved in this \nelephant poaching and trafficking crisis is to eliminate the commercial \nimport, export, and trade of African elephant ivory in our country. \nEnding the commercial ivory trade will set an example for China and \nother countries to follow, but they will not act until we do.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Ending the trade will not take away personal possessions, nor will it \nbar the movement of musical instruments or museum pieces; but to save \nelephants, we have to eliminate the value of ivory.\n  Sadly, this rider is just another example of House Republicans \ndriving the extinction of wildlife one species at a time.\n  Please join me in voting ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I rise in opposition to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's thoughtful \ncomments regarding crisis levels of poaching and wildlife trafficking \nand the need to do something about it. This is a deadly serious matter \nwith national security implications. That is why this bill has \nincreased funding by $15 million since fiscal year 2013 in order to \nfight wildlife poachers and traffickers.\n  Without question, Republicans do not want to see elephants go \nextinct; but when the Fish and Wildlife Service made the unilateral \ndetermination to ban the trade and transport of products containing \nivory that have been in the United States legally for years, we heard \nfrom orchestra musicians, art museums, wildlife conservation \norganizations, collectors of fine antiques from chess pieces to pool \ncues to firearms, and nearly everyone in every organization in between.\n  They are united in support for elephants, but they are also united in \ntheir opposition to new Federal restrictions on products that contain \nivory legally obtained. The reality is family heirlooms and rare \nmusical instruments didn't cause the problem, and\n\n[[Page H4810]]\n\nthe Fish and Wildlife Service should be acknowledging as much.\n  This bill keeps the status quo, allowing for continued legal trade \nand transport so that collectors, musicians, and others can get on with \ntheir lives until the Fish and Wildlife Service writes a rule that \nreflects the legitimate concerns of law-abiding U.S. citizens.\n  The administration is rumored to be just days away from publishing a \nrevised rule to address most of these concerns. If that is the case and \nif the revised rule solves the problem, then there will be no need for \nthis provision in the final conference report later in the year.\n  In any case, I remain fully committed to working with my colleagues \non both sides of the aisle to find a reasonable solution moving \nforward. In the meantime, I must oppose this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I also thank the \nchairman for his comments.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of Mr. Grijalva's \namendment. The U.S. is the world's second largest market for ivory. \nOnly China has a greater demand.\n  In February of last year, President Obama announced a ban on the \ncommercial trade of elephant ivory. This ban is the best way to ensure \nthat U.S. markets do not contribute to the further decline of African \nelephants in the wild.\n  The African elephant population has declined by an estimated 50 \npercent over the last 40 years, with approximately 35,000 elephants \npoached every year. That amounts to one elephant poached every 15 \nminutes.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has been undertaking a series of \nadministrative actions, including a proposed rule in order to implement \nthe ban. Section 120 would prevent the Fish and Wildlife Service from \nimplementing this rule and other policies necessary to crack down on \nthe domestic illegal ivory market.\n  I cannot understand why we would not do everything possible to stop \nthe illegal slaughter of African elephants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support Mr. Grijalva's amendment, which would \nprevent section 120 from being enacted. We must allow the FWS to \ncontinue its efforts to prevent the extinction of the African elephant.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, if we are going to stop the slaughter of \nAfrican elephants, we need to stop the illegal trade in ivory.\n  This rider has nothing to do with the unprecedented poaching crisis, \nand it ignores the impact of the illegal ivory trade within the United \nStates and the way that it is impacting the African elephants' \nsurvival.\n  The rider also undermines the United States' ability to push other \ncountries with significant ivory markets--like China, Vietnam, and \nThailand--to take stronger actions to restrict ivory trade.\n  In fact, according to a recent Washington Post article, China has \nsignaled that its actions to further restrict ivory trade were \ncontingent on what the United States does to regulate our domestic \ntrade.\n  It is in the national interest of the United States to combat \nwildlife trafficking and to ensure that we don't contribute to the \ngrowing global demand for elephant ivory, which is also funding \nterrorism around the world.\n  We need to come up with a responsible set of regulations that protect \nelephants, while making accommodations to allow certain activities to \ncontinue that do not pose a threat to elephants.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Grijalva amendment.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA.

Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment together \nwith my colleagues and fellow committee chairmen, Mr. Conaway from \nTexas and Mr. Chaffetz from Utah.\n  The amendment addresses the Environmental Protection Agency's \ncontinuing pattern of obstruction and delay in response to \ncongressional oversight.\n  Since January 2014, the EPA has proposed or finalized new, far-\nreaching rules that impact almost every aspect of the American economy. \nThese rules involve major expansions of Federal authority, massive \ncosts to the economy, and are based on secret science that the EPA \nkeeps hidden from external review or scrutiny.\n  Congress has a constitutional responsibility to perform rigorous \noversight of the executive branch. However, as chairman of the \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology, nearly every request for \ninformation I make to EPA is greeted with repeated delays, partial \nresponses, or outright refusals to cooperate.\n  Earlier this year, the committee was forced to issue a subpoena to \nobtain information related to Administrator Gina McCarthy's deletion of \nalmost 6,000 text messages sent and received on her official Agency \nmobile device. She claimed that all but one was personal.\n  Most recently, the committee requested information and documents \nrelated to the EPA's development of the waters of the U.S. rule and the \nAgency's inappropriate lobbying of and collaboration with outside \norganizations to generate grassroots support.\n  The EPA again failed to provide the requested documents. The \ncommittee was forced to notice its intention to issue a subpoena.\n  However, producing documents in bits and pieces after months or years \nof delay are not the actions of an open and transparent administration. \nThey are the actions of an Agency and administration that has something \nto hide.\n  It is clear that the EPA does not see its job as facilitating \ntransparency and oversight. It seems to believe its mission is to \ndelay, obstruct, and otherwise attempt to stonewall any attempt by \nCongress to fulfill its constitutional oversight obligation on behalf \nof the American people.\n  Congress should not support such an agency. We are taking further \naction with this amendment to reduce funding for EPA's offices. The EPA \nmust refocus its efforts on transparency and cooperation with Congress \nand the American people. At that point, we could consider restoring \ntheir funding.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment clearly is a Republican attempt to cut \nfunding from the Environmental Protection Agency. As an agency that \nprotects the air we all breathe, protects the water we drink, the fish \nwe eat, it means that the EPA works every day to protect the health of \nevery American.\n\n[[Page H4811]]\n\n  This amendment is clearly an attack against the administration for \nwork that they have been doing to enforce those protections.\n  It is entirely counterproductive to complain about a lack of timely \nresponse from the EPA and then turn around and slash the very funding \nthat allows the EPA Administrator and Agency staff to respond to our \nconcerns.\n  Crippling cuts to the office of congressional relations will not only \nmake it more difficult for Members of Congress to get our questions \nanswered--and those of our constituents--by slashing the office of \nintergovernmental agency affairs, this amendment would make it harder \nfor State and local officials to gather the information they need to \nprotect their communities.\n  I don't really believe we want to tell the EPA that they should cut \nback on meeting and getting recommendations from local government \nadvisory committees or tell our elected officials at a State level that \nthey are going to have even a harder time getting a hold of someone at \nthe EPA to help them form agreements to address their priority needs.\n  Our States have a responsibility with the EPA for protecting public \nhealth and the environment, and this amendment would undermine those \npartnerships. This amendment would make it more difficult for the \npeople's representatives at the Federal, State, and local level to \nreach out and get support and answers from the EPA in order to protect \nthe health of their constituents.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing these cuts, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz), the chairman of the Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chairman, I thank Mr. Smith of Texas and Mr. \nConaway of Texas for their good work on this.\n  In the year 2015, five letters were sent to the EPA from the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee regarding the waters of the \nUnited States rulemaking. All went unanswered until the Science \nCommittee threatened to subpoena.\n  Probably what is the most egregious and most offensive to us is even \nwhen we do bipartisan work--in a bipartisan letter, we asked the EPA to \nprovide a response to a request concerning collections of use of fees \nand fines--and even when we do it in a bipartisan way, those go \nunresponded to. They failed to even provide a staff briefing on the \ncollection and use of fines and penalties, despite repeated requests.\n  We hear on the floor: Well, you can't take away their money, then \nthey won't able to respond.\n  With the money, they don't respond, so they obviously don't need the \nmoney if they are not going to respond--even when we do so in a very \nprofessional, bipartisan way, asking legitimate questions about the use \nof these funds and how this Agency works.\n  In the year 2013, requests were filed for information regarding \nactions of a previous Administrator, among other document requests. \nResponses were inadequate, and a subpoena was filed.\n  The EPA only began searching for the documents 6 months after a \nsubpoena was issued, 6 months after this happened. This is just not \ntolerable. There needs to be consequences for this. They obviously \ndon't need these funds if they are going to be so unresponsive even \nwhen we do so in a bipartisan way.\n  I would urge the passage of the Smith amendment. I think it is a good \namendment. It is a responsible way to move forward. I appreciate the \ngood work the Appropriations Committee has done in their support and \ntheir work. I, again, thank Mr. Smith for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a new contract or agreement or to \n     administer a portion of an existing contract or agreement \n     with a concessioner, a cooperating association, or any other \n     entity that provides for the sale in any facility within a \n     unit of the National Park System of a non-educational item \n     that depicts a Confederate flag on it.\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, that is not the revised amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw this amendment?\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. If it can be substituted with the proper amendment, yes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I reserve a point of order on this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the amendment is withdrawn.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, you should have the proper amendment now.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a new contract or agreement or to \n     administer a portion of an existing contract or agreement \n     with a concessioner, a cooperating association, or any other \n     entity that provides for the sale in any facility within a \n     unit of the National Park System of an item with a \n     Confederate flag as a stand-alone feature.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, the tragic shooting in Charleston, South \nCarolina, has forced a national conversation about symbols like the \nConfederate battle flag that represent racism, slavery, and division.\n  Now, like you, I applaud leaders in South Carolina and other Southern \nStates, both Democrat and Republican, who have called on their States \nto end the display of the Confederate flag on government property, \nincluding State houses and license plates. With the consideration of \nthe Interior Appropriations bill, this House now has an opportunity to \nadd its voice by ending the promotion of the cruel, racist legacy of \nthe Confederacy.\n  The National Park Service has asked its gift shops, bookstores, and \nother concessionaires to voluntarily end the sale of standalone items, \nsuch as flags, pins, and belt buckles that contain imagery of the \nConfederate flag. While many concessionaires have agreed to do this, I \nam dismayed by reports that some will continue to sell items with \nConfederate flag imagery. This amendment to the Interior Appropriations \nbill would end these sales. It would prevent the National Park Service \nfrom allowing the continued promotion of the Confederacy through these \nsymbols.\n  Major American retailers like Walmart, Amazon, and eBay are already \ntaking their own steps to ban sales of this type of merchandise, and we \nnow have an obligation to ensure that the Federal agencies that we \noversee act with the same moral clarity.\n  Mr. Chairman, with that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Without objection, the \ngentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CALVERT. The language now in this amendment is consistent with \nthe National Park Service policy, and I would support this language as \nyou presently have it drafted. I would urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. \nMcCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman's \namendment.\n  This amendment, as Chairman Calvert pointed out, is consistent with\n\n[[Page H4812]]\n\nthe recent National Park Service actions to further limit the display \nof the Confederate flag in units of the National Park system.\n  Previous National Park Service policy had already provided that the \nConfederate flag would not be flown alone for many park flagpoles.\n  On June 25, Park Director Jon Jarvis further requested that the \nConfederate flag sale items be removed from the National Park \nbookstores and gift shops. This also follows a decision by several \nlarge national retailers, including Walmart, Amazon, and Sears, to stop \nselling items with Confederate flags on them.\n  I agree with these decisions and commend those involved for their \nprompt action.\n  While in certain and very limited instances it may be appropriate in \nnational parks to display an image of the Confederate flag in its \nhistorical context, a general display or sale of Confederate flags is \ninappropriate and divisive.\n  I support limiting their use, and I rise in support of the amendment.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I respectfully request an ``aye'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Collins of Georgia\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to reduce or terminate any of the propagation \n     programs listed in the March, 2013, National Fish Hatchery \n     System Strategic Hatchery and Workforce Planning Report.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an \namendment that recognizes and supports the important role of fish \nhatcheries nationwide.\n  Before I get to the amendment, I want to thank you, Mr. Calvert, for \nthe hard work of the committee and your recognition of the importance \nof fish hatcheries already there. I also want to thank my friend from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford) for cosponsoring this amendment.\n  My amendment prohibits funds in the bill from being used to reduce or \nterminate any of the existing propagation programs listed in the March \n2013 National Fish Hatchery System Strategic Hatchery and Workforce \nPlanning Report.\n  This report raised serious concerns that the Fish and Wildlife \nService view hatcheries, and particularly mitigation hatcheries, as a \nlow priority program. Personally, I believe that stocking the \ntailwaters, streams, lakes, and rivers of America should be a higher \npriority. Hatcheries provide an important service, including providing \nour Nation's anglers with the recreational enjoyment and opportunities \nto catch fish; and they can be particularly vital to economic growth in \nrural areas, including northeast Georgia.\n  The importance of our Nation's hatcheries is obvious when you look at \nthe Chattahoochee National Forest Fish Hatchery. This hatchery is \nlocated back home in Georgia's Ninth Congressional District. It stocks \nthe tailwaters of multiple projects for the Army Corps of Engineers and \nthe Tennessee Valley Authority with rainbow trout for the enjoyment of \n160,000 anglers per year. Without this facility, the tailwaters would \nbe barren.\n  The Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery is a critical economic \ndriver in the quiet mountain town of Suches, Georgia, and the \nsurrounding community. This rural town in Fannin County doesn't have \nany major stores or banks, but it does have the hatchery. The hatchery \nhas generated over $30 million in total economic input on just $740,000 \nin investment. It has a $40 return on investment for every dollar spent \nand provides enjoyment to many, many people.\n  The Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery plays an integral role in \nthe sustainability of businesses and communities in northeast Georgia. \nFrom providing environmental education and public outreach \nopportunities to visitors, school groups, and various other \norganizations to facilitating recreational opportunities, northeast \nGeorgia would not be the same without this facility.\n  The work at the hatchery in Suches is one example of the importance \nof propagation programs at national fish hatcheries nationwide. These \nhatcheries are job creators and economic growth engines. They provide \ncritical services to rural America and play an important educational \nrole. They support anglers with recreational services and responsibly \nstock the rivers to keep the habitats in order. Despite this, however, \nthe Department of Fish and Wildlife places propagation programs, \nincluding those in the Chattahoochee National Fish Hatchery, among the \nlowest of their funding priorities.\n  My amendment simply ensures that funds to the Fish and Wildlife \nService are consistent with the agency's mission and statutory \nresponsibility.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I want the gentleman from Georgia to know \nthat I support his amendment and would urge its adoption.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Beyer\n\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n    limitation on use of funds in contravention of executive orders \n                        regarding climate change\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be expended in contravention of Executive Order 13514 of \n     October 5, 2009 or Executive Order 13653 of November 1, 2013.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The sum of the harmful consequences of global climate change is the \nexistential crisis of our generation and, perhaps, of our century.\n  Global temperature changes are already causing prolonged droughts, \nextreme weather events, and rising sea levels. Tens of millions of \npeople, especially the poorest and the most vulnerable among us, are at \nrisk unless we act to reverse the disastrous effects of climate change.\n  Our best scientists and our Pope are warning us that unless carbon \nemissions are dramatically cut, we will see ever rising sea levels, \never more extreme weather, and ever worsening public health, poor air \nquality, the spread of tropical diseases, lung and heart and heat \nstress illnesses, and death.\n  Several weeks ago, the EPA issued a comprehensive report quantifying \nthe economic costs of a changing climate across 20 sectors of the \nAmerican economy. Among the findings, the report found that, by 2100, \nmitigating greenhouse global gas emissions could avoid 12,000 deaths \nper year that are associated with extreme temperatures in just 49 U.S. \ncities compared to a future with no emission reductions.\n  The estimated damages to coastal property from sea level rise and \nstorm surge in the contiguous U.S. are $5 trillion through the year \n2100 in a future without carbon emissions.\n  The Department of the Interior also recently released a report \nrevealing that over $40 billion of National Park infrastructure and \nhistoric and cultural resources could be at risk due to sea level rise \ncaused by climate change.\n  Taking acts to address climate change is particularly crucial in \nurban districts that border waterways, like\n\n[[Page H4813]]\n\nmine, where we are already seeing environmental effects. Now is the \ntime when the U.S. should be deepening its commitment to reducing \nclimate change pollution.\n  Federal agency actions, including those of the agencies named in this \nbill, have major impacts on our contributions and reactions to global \nwarning. It is imperative, then, that these agencies maintain \nmindfulness of those impacts and that they seek to avoid actions that \nadd significant amounts of carbon pollution to the atmosphere or \nactions that put people and property in the vulnerable position with \nrespect to climate change.\n  For that reason, Mr. Chairman, I am offering an amendment to ensure \nthat no funds are spent on activities that are not in compliance with \nthe President's 2009 executive order on greenhouse gas emissions and \nenergy efficiency and the 2013 executive order on climate change \nadaptation.\n  These orders require agencies to take global warming into account \nwhen making decisions and will save taxpayer dollars while making our \ncommunities safer and cleaner.\n  Our agencies need to be climate smart, because making our Federal \ninvestments and actions climate smart reduces our fiscal exposure to \nthe impacts of climate change.\n  It is the right thing to do to run an efficient and effective \ngovernment. It is the right thing to do to return the highest value to \nthe American taxpayer.\n  It is simple: smarter investments up front mean we can reduce future \ncosts. Communities across the Nation are thinking this way. We need to \nensure that the same is true for the Federal Government.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment to ensure that Federal \nagencies are operating in the manner that accounts for climate change.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, earlier, we debated whether or not to \ncontinue a bipartisan reporting requirement in the bill on climate \nchange expenditures. My colleague on the other side of the aisle wanted \nto remove the requirements, which would have reduced transparency. Now \nhe wants to ensure that funds are being expended on climate and \nefficiency executive orders issued by the President. So I am left to \nwonder whether my colleagues would prefer to know if funds are spent on \nthese programs or not.\n  Regardless, this amendment is simply unnecessary. The President did \nnot consult Congress on these executive orders, so, if anything, we \nshould defund the programs until Congress can have an appropriate \npolicy debate.\n  I see no reason to include this language, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote ``no.''\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to my colleague from \nCalifornia (Mr. Huffman).\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I support this amendment which will ensure \nthat no funds are spent on activities that are not in compliance with \nthe President's executive order on greenhouse gas emissions and energy \nefficiency and the 2013 executive order on climate change adaptation.\n  These orders require agencies to simply take global warming into \naccount when making decisions. This will save taxpayers lots of money \nwhile making our communities safer and cleaner.\n  Fighting climate change has to be regarded as the biggest imperative \nof our time.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  My State of California has stepped up to this issue and taken \nimportant bold steps to confront it, including passing Assembly Bill \n32, the world's most aggressive greenhouse gas reduction policy. At the \nFederal level, President Obama's efforts, through these orders, are \ncritical steps toward reducing greenhouse gas emissions and addressing \nclimate change.\n  Ensuring compliance with these measures is the least we can do on \nthis critical issue; and, frankly, we should be doing much more. So I \nurge my colleagues to support the gentleman from Virginia's (Mr. Beyer) \namendment and continue this effort to combat climate change.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to oppose this amendment\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Virginia \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mrs. Blackburn\n\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       across-the-board reduction\n\n       Sec. __. Each amount made available by this Act is hereby \n     reduced by 1 percent.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I want to begin by thanking the \ncommittee for the excellent job that they have done under Chairman \nCalvert's leadership with bringing this appropriations bill in under \nbudget. It is $3 billion below the President's request. There is still \n$30.17 billion in proposed funding in this bill.\n  I come before you today to offer an amendment that I regularly offer \nto these appropriations bills, which is a 1 percent across-the-board \nspending cut. Let's go in and let's take one more penny out of every \ndollar and use that to bolster the good work that our committee has \ndone.\n  You know, one of the things that I like about this bill is there is a \n9 percent reduction in the EPA budget compared to last year. We all \nknow we need to rein in the EPA. We are all for clean air, clean water, \nclean environment. We have different ways of getting there.\n  The burdensome regulations that are out there negatively impact--they \nnegatively impact our communities. But we know there is more work that \nwe have to do on this $30 billion budget.\n  My amendment would reduce the discretionary budget authority by $292 \nmillion and would reduce outlays by $193 million.\n  Now, I know that this is not a popular amendment with a lot of those \nwho feel like we have cut, cut, cut and we can't cut any more.\n  I disagree with that. I think that you can look at the GAO reports \nand the inspector general reports and see there is plenty of room to \ncut. We just recently went into the last 4 years of inspector general \nreports. Guess what. We found $165 million of identified waste in the \nDepartment of the Interior.\n  It is time to engage our rank-and-file employees in our Federal \nGovernment, to make them a team and a partner with us as we work on \nthis issue of getting our budget right-sized.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. While I commend my colleague for her consistent work to \nprotect taxpayer dollars, this is not an approach I can support.\n  While the President may have proposed a budget that exceeds this \nbill, the increases were paid for with proposals and gimmicks that \nwould never be enacted. This bill makes tough choices within an \nallocation that adheres to current law.\n\n[[Page H4814]]\n\n  While difficult trade-offs had to be made, the bill in its current \nform balances our needs. These trade-offs were carefully weighed for \ntheir respective impacts and are responsible.\n  We prioritize funding for fire suppression, PILT, and meeting our \nmoral obligations in Indian Country, yet the gentlewoman's amendment \nproposes an across-the-board cut on every one of those programs.\n  This amendment makes no distinction between where we need to be \nspending to invest in energy independence and where we need to limit \nspending to meet our deficit reduction goals.\n  And, I may point out, the spending problem is not within these \ndiscretionary appropriation bills, which we are debating at the present \ntime. It exists primarily in entitlement spending.\n  So I hope we can spend as much energy on the entitlement side of the \nbudget as we are on the discretionary side of the budget. If so, we \nwould fix our budget problems.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the chairman for yielding me the time.\n  Mr. Chair, this amendment I strongly oppose. It institutes a 1 \npercent across-the-board cut.\n  A few interesting things about the Interior bill. This bill before us \ntoday is $2 billion, $2 billion below 2010-enacted levels. And when you \nadjust this bill for inflation, it is at 2005 levels.\n  This amendment indiscriminately cuts programs without any thought to \nthe merit of the program that is contained in this bill.\n  For instance, this would result in fewer patients being able to be \nseen at the Indian Health Service; fewer safety inspectors ensuring \naccidents do not occur; deferred maintenance on our Nation's drinking \nwater and sanitation infrastructure, which is already underfunded in \nthis bill.\n  More generally, investments in our environmental infrastructure and \npublic lands will just be halted, and associated jobs would be lost \nwith it.\n  As I said earlier, this bill is already underfunded, underfunded. \nWhen adjusted for inflation, it is at 2005 levels. This amendment would \nnot encourage agencies to do more with less. It would simply force \nagencies and our constituents to do less with less.\n  So I urge Members to oppose this amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, just a couple of comments.\n  Underfunded? No. We are overspent in this town. We have $18 trillion \nworth of debt, and it is time to get a handle on that.\n  Moral obligations? How about the moral obligation to our children and \ngrandchildren?\n  Admiral Mullen has said the greatest threat to our Nation's security \nis our Nation's debt.\n  Let's put the focus on our priorities: keeping our sovereignty and \nkeeping our Nation safe and secure.\n  This is something we do for our children. It is something we can do \nfor our national security. A penny on a dollar to get this spending \nunder control.\n  Our approach? Guess what. State and local government use this all the \ntime. They can't go print money and run up debt.\n  When I was in the State Senate in Tennessee, what did we do? We \ndidn't go home until we balanced the budget because we had an \nobligation to get it done right the first time, before we walked out \nthe door.\n  And I do hope that we will put attention on our entitlements. But \nthat is no excuse for not addressing what is in front of us today. To \nnot address what is in front of us today is to kick the can down the \nroad.\n  I have a lot of constituents who aren't making and taking home as \nmuch as they were in 2005. They think we should reduce Federal spending \neven more, reduce the Federal workforce even more, because government \nis getting too expensive to afford.\n  Let's engage Federal employees in this process. It has worked for the \nStates. It will work for the Federal Government. Let's get our fiscal \nhouse in order. A good place to start is right here with this amendment \nthat would save another $193 million in outlays and $292 million in \ndiscretionary budget authority.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, the last point. I appreciate the \ngentlewoman's concern about the deficit that we have.\n  When I came here 24 years ago, 40 percent of our expenditures were on \nthe entitlement side of the budget. Today it is over 60 percent, over \n60 percent. So we need to attack that side of the budget line.\n  If we placed as much energy on entitlement spending as we have on \ndiscretionary, not only would the budget be balanced, but we would be \nmoving toward paying off our national debt.\n  With that, I reluctantly oppose the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHeck of Nevada) having assumed the chair, Mr. Carter of Georgia, Acting \nChair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, \nreported that that Committee, having had under consideration the bill \n(H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the Interior, \nenvironment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending September \n30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H4814-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4814-H4815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  MOTION TO PERMIT CLOSED CONFERENCE MEETINGS ON H.R. 1735, NATIONAL \n             DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue a grazing permit or lease in contravention \n     of section 4110.1 or 4130.1-1(b) of title 43, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nreaffirm Congress' support for the enforcement of grazing fees on \npublic lands.\n  Grazing on public lands is a privilege, not a right, and it is \ncritical that individual ranchers who use these lands abide by the law \nand pay their fair share.\n  My commonsense amendment simply confirms that grazing permits or \nleases should not be issued to anyone who does not comply with BLM \nregulations. My amendment does not penalize people for forgetting to \nrepair a fence or for forgetting to make a payment once or twice.\n  Rather, this amendment ensures that egregious violations of grazing \nregulations are not going to be allowed to happen under the taxpayers' \nwatch, as there are American taxpayers who work every day to ensure \nthat all of their regulations are met.\n  Mr. Chairman, revenues from grazing fees go toward the management, \nmaintenance, and improvement of public rangeland. The vast majority of \nranchers understands how important these efforts are and pay their fees \non time, but some ranchers are outright refusing to pay their grazing \nfees.\n  One particular rancher, who is well known to the media, has been more \nthan $1 million in arrears since 1993. He has ignored the executive and \njudicial branches of our government, expanding his herds further onto \nour lands without permission.\n  Unauthorized grazing, such as in this case, has the potential to \ndestroy habitat for protected species and to damage public property. In \naddition, he has instigated volatile situations that has put the lives \nof local and Federal Government officials at risk.\n  Unbelievably, some in this body have actually applauded these \ndangerous actions. That is simply irresponsible. Mr. Chairman, I \nstrongly suspect that, if anyone in my congressional district in \nPhoenix forcibly resisted paying the Federal Government more than $1 \nmillion, he or she would be in handcuffs instead of on television or \nmeeting with potential Presidential candidates.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Ultimately, however, this amendment is about more than one man. It is \nabout upholding the basic principles that our laws should be applied \nfairly to everyone who lives in this country and uses its public lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that egregious violations of grazing \nregulations are not financed by the American taxpayer. To that end, I \nhope all Members will support this critical amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Pearce\n\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to increase the rate of any royalty required to be \n     paid to the United States for oil and gas produced on Federal \n     land, or to prepare or publish a proposed rule relating to \n     such an increase.\n\n\n[[Page H4817]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, Washington recently issued the advanced notice \nof rulemaking in which they declared they were going to consider \nraising the royalty rates on oil and gas production on Federal land. \nNow, there is several reasons that we would want to consider that \nbefore we implemented it, and so our amendment simply says let's stop \nthe process.\n  First of all, what it does is it is going to drive the royalty rates \nup on Federal lands. It will be one more impediment to producing the \noil and gas that fuels this Nation's economy.\n  Secondly, small businesses, small independent producers are already \nunder pressure to try to just stay in business, and it would increase \ntheir operating costs. For a small State like ours, rural States, the \nsmall businesses, these local producers are sources of prosperity that \nare desperately missing from the rural parts of the country.\n  If we are going to have an economy that is healthy, if we are going \nto have an economy that provides jobs for the future, then we need \nenergy that is both affordable and a predictable supply. Nothing is \nbetter than producing our own. When we have to import oil from other \nnations, some of those nations are unstable politically. Some just \ndon't like us as a country; and so why not produce our own energy, \nproviding our own jobs and providing revenues to the Federal \nGovernment?\n  Anytime you increase taxes on a given item, then you are going to see \nless of that item, and oil and gas is no exception. Let's let the \ndepartment think about this just a bit more before we rush into a \nroyalty rate which will decrease America's energy supply and make us \nmore dependent on foreign oil.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, the amendment would prohibit the Bureau of \nLand Management from using its legal authorities to modernize its \nroyalty rate structure, which would result in less revenue to the \nTreasury.\n  The Department of the Interior's oil and gas royalties have been the \nsubject of repeated study by the Government Accountability Office and \nother entities for many years. In 2008, the GAO said the United States \ncould be forgoing billions of dollars in revenue from the production of \nFederal oil and gas resources due to the lack of price flexibility in \nroyalty rates and the inability to change the fiscal terms on existing \nleases. In 2013, the GAO issued another report that noted concern that \nthe Department of the Interior had not taken the steps to change the \nonshore royalty rate regulations.\n  Modernizing the Bureau of Land Management's rate structures can \nprovide critical flexibility, especially given the dramatic growth of \noil development on public and tribal lands, where production has \nincreased in each of the past 6 years and combined production was up 81 \npercent in 2004 versus 2008.\n  It seems to me that it is critical that the Department of the \nInterior is ensuring that the public is receiving a fair return from \nthe production of oil and gas from Federal leases. This amendment would \nguarantee a sweetheart deal for Big Oil companies at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my cosponsors on this \namendment: Mr. Tipton, Mr. Cramer, Mr. Lamborn, and Mr. Zinke. I \nappreciate their presence here.\n  The gentlewoman raises a significant question whether or not revenues \nwould increase or decrease. We have got a couple of charts here showing \nexactly what is happening.\n  First of all, the average number of leases that the BLM issued during \neach administration, we can see back in the Reagan administration the \nhighest level. It decreases down to--you can see the relative position \nof the Obama administration. If the administration were really \ninterested in revenues, it seems like they would be producing the \npermits at a little faster rate.\n  Then this chart shows the oil production; the increase in oil \nproduction in blue is shown here on private lands while the decrease in \noil production on the public lands is being shown in the red.\n  Again, if the administration were very interested, it seems like they \nwould modernize not the royalty rate, but the way in which they approve \nthese wells. Sometimes, wells go for 6 months or a year without being \npermitted, where States can offer 30-day processing of the permits.\n  The same is happening with natural gas. Again, we just see the blue \non private lands where natural gas production is increasing, dramatic \ndecreases in production of natural gas on Federal lands. Again, it \nlooks like, if the agency were worried about the revenues, they would \nseek to modernize and update their procedures first.\n  I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for this amendment. I think it is a \ngood amendment. I certainly understand his concern.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. PEARCE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The \nBureau of Land Management has only just begun the process of examining \nwhether royalty rates and rentals for oil and gas leases on public \nlands should be increased. That process should be allowed to continue.\n  GAO recently found that, based upon the results of a number of \nstudies, the U.S. Government receives one of the lowest government \ntakes, commonly understood to be the total revenue, as a percentage of \nthe value of oil and natural gas produced in the entire world.\n  For example, royalty rates on public land are at 12.5 percent, \nconsiderably less than the royalty rates even on State lands, which \nrange from a low of 16.67 percent to 25 percent-plus. These low royalty \nrates cheat the American taxpayers and keep them from receiving a fair \nreturn for the extraction of their oil and gas resources.\n  However, rental rates are even worse. To secure very valuable mineral \nrights, sometimes worth hundreds of millions of dollars, companies only \nhave to bid a minimum, and I repeat, a minimum of $2 an acre upfront to \nwin the lease and then $1.50 per acre each year to keep the lease. That \nis right, a rental of $1.50 per acre per year. This low price was last \nset by Congress in the 1980s and has not been adjusted since.\n  This can and should change. Oil companies, some of which generate \nbillions of dollars per quarter in profits, should pay their fair share \nto the American people for the development of the Nation's public \nresources. Imagine if your rent had not increased since Ronald Reagan \nwas President or if the local grocery store had not raised their prices \nsince 1987.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. This scenario may sound too good to be true, but in \nfact, that is exactly the sweetheart deal that we are currently giving \noil and gas industries, a sweetheart deal that should end. All \nAmericans must deal with the unavoidable reality of inflation; so why \nshouldn't oil and gas companies?\n  It is long past time for the BLM to assess better ways for the public \nto receive their fair share. Blocking the BLM from doing that is \nfiscally irresponsible, a giveaway to the oil and gas companies.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Mexico has 1 minute \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from Maine has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, the assumption that the royalty rates are \nabnormally low in the United States simply ignores the fact that we \nhave lease\n\n[[Page H4818]]\n\nsales on top of the royalties. Many countries fail to have those.\n  The United States has the most extreme environmental regulations, so \nthe regulatory burden gladly borne by the oil companies is an \nadditional cost that many nations do not have. In addition, we have got \nincome taxes paid by the companies, and many countries don't charge \nthat on top of the royalty.\n  What we are hearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle \nabout the sweetheart deals, I think, take a look and see actually how \nmuch the oil and gas companies are paying. In our State, they have \ncontributed to two of the largest permanent funds in the world held by \nour State. I think oil and gas companies are paying their fair share by \na lot.\n  What other industry is paying truck drivers $100,000 a year to drive \na truck for a contractor? I think that those sorts of computations are \nsimply ignored by the GAO.\n  Again, I would urge Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, in spite of the arguments that my colleague \nfrom New Mexico has made, I still say this amendment, in my opinion, \ndoesn't pass the straight face test.\n  I can't imagine my constituents thinking that we should make things \nany easier for the oil and gas companies or that we should be giving \naway the opportunity to earn taxpayer revenue on our Federal lands.\n  The Federal onshore royalty rate has not been increased since 1920. \nThat is 95 years. The offshore royalty rate is 18.75 percent; yet the \nonshore rates have been stuck at 12.5 percent for 95 years. Where is \nthe equity in that?\n  As far as I am concerned, I think it is time for the American \ntaxpayers to get a fair return on the use of public resources, \nespecially from some of the most profitable companies in the world. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement National Park Service Director's Order \n     61 as it pertains to allowing a grave in any Federal cemetery \n     to be decorated with a Confederate flag.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate very much the bipartisan support and passage of my \nearlier amendment, which would end the practice of concessionaires in \nour national parks selling Confederate flags and memorabilia of the \nConfederacy.\n  We now, with this Interior Appropriations bill, have a second \nopportunity to speak on this very important national debate that we are \nhaving regarding symbols of the Confederacy. This additional amendment \nwill end the practice of allowing groups to display Confederate flags \non federally managed cemeteries.\n  The American Civil War was fought, in Abraham Lincoln's words, to \n``save the last best hope of Earth.'' We can honor that history without \ncelebrating the Confederate flag and all of the dreadful things that it \nsymbolizes.\n  I request an ``aye'' of my colleagues, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Walberg\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                          limitation on funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to lobby in \n     contravention of section 1913 of title 18, United States \n     Code, on behalf of the proposed rule entitled ``Definition of \n     `Waters of the United States' Under the Clean Water Act'' (79 \n     Fed. Reg. 22188; April 21, 2014).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, my amendment tells the Environmental \nProtection Agency to follow the law and clearly establishes the view of \nCongress that the EPA cannot lobby on behalf of the waters of the U.S. \nrule, in violation of the Anti-Lobbying Act.\n  Over the past few years, the EPA has been pushing the limits of its \nstatutory authority to the issue of the waters of the U.S. rule. Now, \nwe have learned that, as part of their efforts to regulate every pond, \nstream, and ditch in America, the EPA may have violated the Anti-\nLobbying Act to garner public comments in support of the proposed rule, \neven though the Department of Justice has consistently stated that the \nact prohibits Federal agencies from engaging in substantial grassroots \nlobbying.\n  In fact, The New York Times recently reported:\n\n       In a campaign that tests the limits of Federal lobbying \n     law, the Agency orchestrated a drive to counter political \n     opposition from Republicans and enlist public support in \n     concert with liberal environmental groups and a grassroots \n     organization aligned with President Obama.\n\n  The New York Times went on to say as well:\n\n       The most contentious part of the EPA's campaign was \n     deploying Thunderclap, a social media tool that spread the \n     Agency's message to hundreds of thousands of people, a \n     ``virtual flash mob,'' in the words of Travis Loop, the head \n     of communications for EPA's water division.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this is unseemly. The EPA Administrator later used the \nskewed results as evidence of public support before Congress.\n  For this reason, my amendment is needed to make clear that the EPA \nshall not violate the Anti-Lobbying Act while pursuing the completion \nof the waters of the U.S.\n  I respectfully urge all my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WALBERG. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I agree with the gentleman and with The New York Times that this is \nwhy the underlying bill reduces funding for certain offices within EPA \nthat were responsible for these questionable actions.\n  Therefore, this language is complementary to the approach the \ncommittee has already taken in the bill, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. WALBERG. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. The gentleman's amendment would prohibit funds in the \nact from being used to lobby on the waters of the U.S. There is an \nexisting prohibition on lobbying that applies to all Federal employees \nthat has been in place since 1919, so this is an unnecessary and \nredundant amendment.\n  I would remind my colleagues that Federal employees are not \nprohibited from providing information to Congress on legislation, \npolicies, or programs. There must be an open dialogue between the \nlegislative and executive branches to ensure that laws are being \nimplemented appropriately and programs achieve their intended goals.\n  We should not and cannot operate in an information vacuum. We don't \nneed\n\n[[Page H4819]]\n\nto add extraneous, redundant provisions to a bill that is already \noverburdened with harmful legislative riders.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.\n  It is the law, and that is all I am trying to substantiate, but I \nhave read to you not from an organ of the conservative Republican Party \nside, but from The New York Times.\n  They also went on to say:\n\n       The architect of the EPA's new public outreach strategy is \n     Thomas Reynolds, a former Obama campaign aid who was \n     appointed in 2013 as an associate administrator.\n\n  He said this in relationship to flash mob tactics and the lobbying \nefforts:\n\n       We are just borrowing new methods that have proven \n     themselves as being effective.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it may be effective, but it is unseemly that EPA, an \nagency of the Federal Government, would violate the law in lobbying and \ntrying then to show Congress through trumped up evidence that they have \nproduced through lobbying the private sector that they have support for \nthe waters of the U.S. rule.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why I think we need to establish it here very \nclearly in this appropriations bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enforce section 435 of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would not allow any funds to \nenforce section 435 of this bill, which is another harmful policy rider \nthat limits the ability of our environmental agencies to take action to \nimprove public health and fight the root causes of climate change.\n  This section blocks the EPA's ongoing efforts to regulate \nhydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which is the wrong approach. HFCs are \nfactory-made gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration and are \nup to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide. This potency has \nled to HFCs being referred to as a superpollutant. Unless we act now, \nUnited States emissions are expected to double by 2020 and triple by \n2030.\n  While not as abundant as carbon dioxide, superpollutants, also known \nas short-lived climate pollutants--including HFCs, methane, and black \ncarbon--have contributed up to 40 percent of observed global warming.\n  By limiting the EPA's authority under the Clean Water Act to propose, \nfinalize, or enforce any regulation or guidance regarding HFCs, we \nundercut their ability to protect public health and demonstrate \nAmerican leadership in emission reductions.\n  The EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy Program, or SNAP, \nrequires us to evaluate substitutes for superpollutants like HFCs that \nare harming public health and our environment. Through SNAP, we can \nensure a more smooth transition to safer alternatives for our country's \nindustrial sector.\n  Within the last week, EPA finalized a new rule on HFCs that the \nEnvironmental Investigation Agency estimates will avoid superpollutant \nemissions equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 21 \nmillion cars by 2030. It will allow heavy users of HFCs, including \nsupermarkets, which are the largest source of HFC emissions, to \ncontinue developing cleaner alternatives.\n  As we continue international negotiations to phase down HFCs, the \nUnited States should be a leader in reducing the use of HFCs and other \nsuperpollutants. The standard set by EPA will drive U.S. and \ninternational innovation and market development of low-emission and \nenergy-efficient refrigeration, air conditioning, foam-blowing agents, \nand aerosol technologies.\n  These innovations will actually get at one of the root causes of \nclimate change before we are forced to react to increasingly extreme \nweather and sea level rise.\n  American industry has already begun creating alternatives that both \nhave a lower emissions profile and are more energy efficient than \ncurrent HFCs, and last September, we saw major companies--including \nCoca-Cola, Carrier, DuPont, Honeywell, PepsiCo, and other industry \nleaders--commit to voluntarily reducing harmful HFC emissions.\n  My amendment simply bars funding to enforce section 435 of this bill \nso we can instead continue with existing rules and move our country's \nglobal leadership in finding innovative solutions to reducing emissions \nforward. We should not be handcuffing the important work being done at \nEPA to reduce superpollutants.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. The committee still has concerns about the costs, \ntechnology requirements, and compliance periods in the final rule. It \nis not clear why EPA divided some categories into subcategories and \nprovided different deadlines for similar products.\n  The EPA clearly chose winners and losers. For the losers, the \ntimetables remain unworkable. Manufacturers need time to implement \nengineering and technology changes and address new risk and safety \nchallenges. Historic experience with the Montreal Protocol indicates \nthat manufacturers need approximately 6-plus years to successfully \ntransition between new materials.\n  This new rule will particularly be hard on small businesses. The \nlarge businesses that the gentleman mentioned have the resources and \nthe technologies available to them to comply quicker. These smaller \nbusinesses will find it very difficult to comply with DOE's energy \nconservation standards.\n  EPA's proposal is not being driven by a statutory mandate, so the \ncommittee believes additional time is warranted. The EPA left critical \ndecisions regarding energy, efficiency, and system performance up to \nthe manufacturers; and they need time to get this right.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the constructive \ncomments by my colleague, the gentleman from California. I would just \nsuggest this is not the way to deal with these issues, but rather to \naddress them via policy approach.\n  Section 435 of this bill will just take out the legs from all work we \nwould do on HFCs and superpollutants, and it is just too broad a brush \nto paint with.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mr. Walden\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n                       resource management plans\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to complete or implement the revision of the resource \n     management plans for the Coos Bay, Eugene, Medford, Roseburg, \n     or Salem Districts of the Bureau of Land Management or the \n     Klamath\n\n[[Page H4820]]\n\n     Falls Field Office of the Lakeview District of the Bureau of \n     Land Management proposed in the Bureau of Land Management \n     Notice of Availability of the Draft Resource Management Plan \n     Revisions and Draft Environmental Impact Statement for \n     Western Oregon published in the Federal Register on April 24, \n     2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 23046).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, the past several decades have been really \nhard on Oregon's forested communities as timber harvest from Federal \nlands dropped more than 90 percent because of, in part, litigation, \nlack of management, government regulation.\n  Across the State, we have lost more than 300 forest product mills. \nThey have closed. We have lost more than 30,000 forest-related jobs. \nThis has left our communities in really bad shape, nearing bankruptcy \nin some cases in our counties, high poverty rates in our communities. \nUnemployment rates are high in these forested areas and, of course, we \nface, without active management, these enormous forest fires that \ncontribute massively to the carbon buildup.\n  Recently, the BLM released a proposed update to their two-decade, 20-\nyear-old management plan in western Oregon. The vast majority of the \nforests covered by these plans are what are called O lands, which are \nmanaged by a very unique Federal statute called the O Act. That law \ncalls for sustainable timber production and revenue to local counties. \nIt is different than the other forest laws.\n  Now, despite that clear mandate in Federal law, the BLM's proposal \nwould allow for harvesting on about 22 percent is all, 22 percent of \nthe land base. It would lock up the remainder in various reserves.\n  Oregon's forested counties, some of which have more than 70 percent \nof their land controlled by the Federal Government, rely on receipts \nfrom Federal timber projects to fund basic needs like law enforcement, \nschools, and other essential services. Unfortunately, under BLM's \nproposal, these counties would receive an estimated 27 percent is all \nof their historical average receipt--27 percent.\n  Now, while the BLM's proposed plans fall far short of meeting these \ncommunities' needs, it seems the agency is determined to push forward \nanyway with these plans.\n  In a bipartisan effort, the entire Oregon Congressional Delegation \nrequested a 120-day extension of the comment period so that the \ncounties and other interested parties have time to thoroughly review \nthe more than 1,500 pages of analysis and provide some useful input and \ncomment.\n  Apparently, the BLM isn't interested in that input, since I \nunderstand they will be rejecting our request and moving forward with \ntheir plan under their current timeline. That is really disappointing. \nYou see, these local communities are most affected by the management \nchanges on the Federal land that surrounds them, and the BLM, I wish, \nwould care more about their input than a self-imposed deadline likely \nout of some office back here.\n  This amendment would simply delay the BLM's implementation of these \nproposed plans. That would give more time for our counties and \ninterested parties to thoroughly review the more than 1,500 pages of \nanalysis. It would also give the agency time to consider additional \nalternatives that better incorporate the clear mandates of the O Act.\n  I want to quote, Mr. Chairman, from the Portland Oregonian. This is \nthe statewide newspaper that probably leans a little more to the left. \nThey said: ``Minimally, BLM needs to extend its comment period and \ndevelop more alternatives to be considered. But it is unlikely to \ndevelop any alternative that would be acceptable to the industry, \ncounties and environmental advocates. Congress, not a government \nagency, needs to step up and help solve this long-festering problem.''\n  Mr. Chairman, with Oregon's wildfire season well off to a terrible \nstart, we need time to review these plans, get active management on \nthese forestlands, and by passing this amendment, we will give the \ntaxpayers, the people who live there, a better opportunity to weigh in. \nSo I urge support.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering the \namendment and yielding me time.\n  I appreciate the concerns that he brings to us today. It is troubling \nthat the Bureau of Land Management has proposed land use plans that \nappear to contradict its multiple-use mandate. So with that, I would \nhappily accept his amendment.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maine for \n5 minutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concerns raised by the \ngentleman from Oregon, but this amendment would prohibit the Bureau of \nLand Management from completing or implementing updates to certain \nresource management plans in western Oregon.\n  These updated plans cover 2.5 million acres of land that play an \nimportant role in the social, economic, and ecological well-being of \nwestern Oregon, as well as to the American public generally. The plans \ndetermine how BLM-administered lands will be managed to further the \nrecovery of threatened and endangered species, provide for clean water, \nrestore fire-adapted ecosystems, produce a sustained yield of timber \nproducts, and coordinate land management of surrounding tribal land.\n  The amendment would suspend the BLM's authority to implement a new \nresource management plan in western Oregon. As a result, the BLM would \nbe forced to rely on a 20-year-old outdated plan that doesn't \nincorporate significant new information. For example, the old plan does \nnot include important conservation activities, such as the northern \nspotted owl recovery plan. The amendment would block one of the most \ncomprehensive and detailed landscape plans that the BLM has ever \ndeveloped and would ignore significant public input. The public has a \nright to engage in the management decisions of their Federal lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that the spotted owl is \ncovered by their planning process today in some measure because it \ncertainly contributed to the downfall of our communities, absent this \nplan.\n  Look, all we are asking for is time for people to have a better \nchance to review what this Federal agency, after 20 years, has finally \ncome up with--1,500 pages. I think they should have a chance, as do my \ncolleagues, including Mr. Schrader, a member of your party, supporting \nthis amendment. So it is a bipartisan Oregon approach that I would hope \nmy colleague from Maine would share that we need to do better managing \nAmerica's Federal forests.\n  Turn on the TV. They are going up in flames right now. I don't like \nthat for the habitat. I don't like that for the communities. I don't \nlike that for what the firefighters have to face.\n  I think we can do better. Most observers in the State think we can do \nbetter, and I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, again, I just want to say I appreciate the \nconcerns that the gentleman from Oregon has raised, and other Members \nfrom Oregon who share those concerns. I thought it was important to \naddress some of the considerations and concerns that we have with this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to require \ncompanies to follow the law if they want to export crude oil from the \nUnited States.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page H4821]]\n\nlimitation on use of funds to issue any new federal oil and gas leases \n                          and drilling permits\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue any new Federal oil and gas lease or \n     drilling permit to any person that does not commit to \n     following Department of Commerce regulations regarding the \n     requirement of obtaining a license for exporting crude oil.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, I offer this amendment \nto require companies to follow the law if they want to export crude oil \nfrom the United States.\n  I want to make it clear. This amendment is not about whether we \nshould lift the crude oil export ban altogether. That is a debate for a \ndifferent time and a different bill. This is about those narrow cases \nwhere companies are currently able to export crude oil in limited \nquantities but are also choosing not to follow the rules.\n  Last summer, the Commerce Department ruled that two companies could \nexport very light crude oil, called condensate, after it had been \nlightly processed. That decision meant that those companies would not \nneed to obtain a license to export crude oil even though licenses are \nrequired for all other crude oil exports.\n  Because of that ruling, which I believe was inappropriate, another \ncompany decided that they, too, would begin exporting their own light \ncrude oil without even asking the Commerce Department for a decision \nfirst, let alone try to get a license.\n  Since then, exports have skyrocketed. From January 2010 until June \n2014, when the Commerce Department made that ruling, we exported about \n97,000 barrels of crude oil a day, mostly to Canada. Since that day in \nJune of 2014, our oil exports have quadrupled to an average of over \n400,000 barrels a day, hitting all-time record levels, with more and \nmore of that crude oil going to Europe and to Asia.\n  I don't think we should be exporting so much of our domestic oil when \nwe are still importing roughly 7 million barrels every day. We may be \nthe world's number one oil producer, but we are still the world's \nnumber one oil importer.\n  If we want to change that, we shouldn't be letting oil companies \nsimply ship American crude oil anywhere in the world that they want to. \nWe should certainly also not let them ignore existing laws and \nregulations in order to do so. First and foremost, oil produced in \nAmerica, particularly oil from America's public lands that belong to \nthe American people, should remain in this country for the benefit of \nthe American people.\n  If we are going to allow these companies to export oil, they must \nfollow the law. They simply can't take matters into their own hands and \ndecide whether they need or do not need a license before shipping this \noil all over the world.\n  My amendment is a simple, commonsense solution to this problem. It \nsimply states, if you are going to drill on public land, you must \nfollow the legal process for getting an export license if you want to \nship that oil elsewhere.\n  This is not an onerous restriction. It only applies to public land, \nonly requires companies to commit to following the existing process for \ngetting a license with the Department of Commerce. That way, the \nCommerce Department can evaluate these options on a case-by-case basis \nto determine if they are in the national interest.\n  The concept of exporting American crude oil is too important to let \nthe companies make that call on their own.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n\n   Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO.

Accordingly, the noes have it, and the amendment is not \nadopted.\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Hardy\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to make a Presidential declaration by public \n     proclamation of a national monument under chapter 3203 of \n     title 54, United States Code in the counties of Mohave and \n     Coconino in the State of Arizona, in the counties of Modoc \n     and Siskiyou in the State of California, in the counties of \n     Chaffee, Moffat, and Park in the State of Colorado, in the \n     counties of Lincoln, Clark, and Nye in the State of Nevada, \n     in the county of Otero in the State of New Mexico, in the \n     counties of Jackson, Josephine and, Malheur in the State of \n     Oregon, or in the counties of Wayne, Garfield, and Kane in \n     the State of Utah.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Nevada and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with my \ngood friends from Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, \nand Utah to prohibit public land management agencies in this bill from \nmaking declarations under the Antiquities Act in counties where there \nis significant local opposition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by stating my strong support for \nour Nation's public lands. As an active hunter and an outdoorsman, I \nmarvel at the beauty of our landscapes, our unique flora, and the \nabundant animal species that roam our terrain.\n  With that being said, I also come from Nevada, a State where roughly \n85 percent of the land is controlled by the Federal Government.\n  Addressing this concentration of land use decisionmaking power in the \nhands of Washington bureaucrats has been one of the strong motivating \nfactors during my time in this body, as I am sure that it has been for \nmany of my colleagues in the Western States.\n  While this concentration is certainly a topic that should be \naddressed by the authorizing committees, I believe that we can and \nshould take an important step here today.\n  A recent prominent example demonstrating the need for this amendment \nis the administration's draft proclamation to establish the Basin and \nRange National Monument on more than 700,000 acres of land in Lincoln \nand Nye Counties in my district.\n  Not only is the sheer size of the proposed monument staggering, being \nnearly as large as many of the Eastern States, it also poses some \nsignificant risks, both local and national in scope.\n  Nevada's economy was one of the hardest hit by the Great Recession, \nand far too many in our State are still struggling to get by. Nevada's \nrural county economies are particularly sensitive, and any decision \nthat restricts ranching, recreation, and types of land use activities \nshould have much of the local input as possible.\n  Earlier this year I spoke on the floor of the House about the \nnational security implications of designating the Basin and Range, \ngiven that most of the acreage in the proposed monument falls directly \nunder the airspace of the Nevada Test and Training Range, one of the \nmost heavily used military operating areas, or MOAs, in the United \nStates. Establishing this monument could drastically impair vital \nground-based training activities tied to the NTTR.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Arizona (Mr. \nGosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Arizona, a few special \ninterest groups have been pushing the President to unilaterally \ndesignate a massive new 1.7-million-acre national monument in the Grand \nCanyon watershed.\n  Twenty-six Members of Congress have joined me in opposing this \nmisguided effort, and there is significant local opposition.\n\n[[Page H4822]]\n\n  Here is a sample of those resolutions, and I would like to share a \nfew of their comments here:\n  ``The creation of a national monument by Presidential declaration \ndoes not allow for input from local communities . . . and could result \nin negative impacts for . . . grazing, hunting, water development and \nforest restoration . . . which would result in negative economic and \npublic health impacts to the City of Williams.\n  ``The Arizona Game and Fish Commission is concerned that the \npotential monument . . . 'will impede proactive and effective \nmanagement of wildlife populations and habitats . . . and may result in \nreduced hunter opportunities and loss of revenues that directly support \nconservation and local communities.' ''\n  I could provide several more examples but will stop there.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I now ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Nevada has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARDY. I yield 1 minute to my distinguished colleague from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this Antiquities Act was passed \nover a century ago in 1906, when four States weren't even in the Union \nat that time. They were still territories.\n  There are absolutely no environmental laws that we had at that \nparticular time protecting anything. Yet, this act was not used by \nevery President. In fact, most Presidents never used it. Ronald Reagan \nnever used it. Most Presidents only used it one time.\n  It was changed, starting with the Jimmy Carter administration, so \nthat no longer is this act that was supposed to protect antiquities--\nthus, the name the Antiquities Act--used to protect antiquities. It was \nused as a political weapon and abused as a political weapon. The \nsaddest part is there is absolutely no input that has to be guaranteed \nby this act.\n  In fact, the vast majority of monuments that were created through \nthis Antiquities Act, there was no public input whatsoever. Any public \ninput that took place was purely by accident, purely by coincidence.\n  The people in the counties that are designated in this amendment need \nto have the right to have some input in how land decisions are used \nthat area. That is what this amendment does.\n  Give them the chance to be heard because, under the present \nAntiquities Act, they are not heard.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would place uncalled-for \nrestrictions and undercut any President from using their authority \nunder the Antiquities Act to establish a national monument, an \nauthority, I should add, that has been available to Presidents for 100 \nyears.\n  The Antiquities Act is an important tool that enables the President \nto protect and strengthen America's heritage. Since Theodore Roosevelt \nfirst designated the national monument Devil's Tower in Wyoming, 16 \nPresidents from both parties have used the Antiquities Act to protect \nmore than 160 of America's best known and loved landscapes. Only three \nPresidents have not.\n  National monuments tell the story of the American people. Out of 460 \nnational monuments and national parks, 113 reflect the diverse \ncommunity that makes up our Nation. Nineteen recognize the achievements \nof the Latino community, twenty-six of the African American community, \nand eight for women.\n  It should be noted that an important factor in the designation \nprocess is the First Americans, the Native Americans, their legacy, \ntheir heritage, and their cultural and historic resources on the land.\n  But with the Antiquities Act, the lack of diversity reflected in our \npublic units, whether it is parks or national monuments, is changing.\n  President Obama has been using the Antiquities Act to diversify the \nstory of public lands with new designations such as the Cesar Chavez \nNational Monument in Keene, California, which he recently designated.\n\n  Since the beginning of his administration, the President used this \nauthority to create national monuments that recognize the contributions \nof Africa Americans and other diverse voices in this country.\n  The Center for American Progress published a report that found that \n33 percent of presidential designations are inclusive of the American \npeople, compared to only 20 percent of the designations done by \nCongress.\n  America's public places are becoming more inclusive, more \nrepresentative of all Americans because of the Antiquities Act. This \namendment would jeopardize that progress. I urge its defeat.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. How much time remains, Mr. Chairman?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Nevada has 30 seconds remaining. \nThe gentleman from Arizona has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, let me point out some obvious points.\n  This amendment, as I said earlier, would undermine conservation of \npublic lands and stall efforts to ensure that our public places tell \nthe very important diverse story of America and be representative of \nall Americans.\n  Development and conservation--to say that this would deny jobs and \nopportunities to particular regions is not true.\n  Over 9 million acres are available right now under energy leases from \nthe Obama administration compared to--those were added to it--only 4.1 \nmillion acres that are now land that is protected.\n  Since its enactment in 1906, 16 Presidents have used it. 160 of \nAmerica's best known landscapes have been preserved. National monuments \ndesignated under the Antiquities Act are comprised of existing Federal \nlands only. No new lands are added to the Federal estate by these \ndesignations.\n  National monument designations have better reflected the complexity--\nand Presidents have used that--of our Nation, ensuring that the voices \nof a changing and diverse community, which is this country, is told as \nwe change and as we go forward.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote. Undercutting an authority that existed \nfor 100 years that has brought benefit to the Nation, enhanced the \ncultural, historic, and conservation ethics of this Nation should be \npreserved.\n  With that, I urge a ``no'' vote amendment. It is unneeded, \nrestrictive, and goes against a tradition and an authority that has \nexisted in this country for 100 years.\n  I hope this effort is not about who is President at this time, but it \nis an authority that has been with us for 100 years.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just like to reiterate \nto my colleagues that voting for this amendment is a vote for \nempowering the communities and the local stakeholders most affected by \nthe monument designations.\n  Doing so will increase transparency, allow local input, and provide \nimproved management of our public lands. It will fulfill the \nresponsibility to ensure these communities have a legitimate voice in \nthe process.\n  I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Engel\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of the Interior, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, or any other Federal agency to lease or \n     purchase new light duty vehicles for\n\n[[Page H4823]]\n\n     any executive fleet, or for an agency's fleet inventory, \n     except in accordance with Presidential Memorandum--Federal \n     Fleet Performance, dated May 24, 2011.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, on May 24, 2011, President Obama issued a \nmemorandum on Federal fleet performance that required that all new \nlight-duty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternative fuel \nvehicles, such as hybrid, electric, natural gas, or biofuel by December \n31, 2015.\n  My amendment echoes the President's memorandum by prohibiting funds \nin this act from being used to lease or purchase new light-duty \nvehicles unless that purchase is made in accord with the President's \nmemorandum.\n  I have submitted identical amendments to 18 different appropriations \nbills over the past few years, and every time they have been accepted \nby both the majority and the minority. I hope my amendment will receive \nsimilar support today.\n  Global oil prices are down. We no longer pay $147 per barrel. But \ndespite increased production here in the United States, the global \nprice of oil is still largely determined by OPEC.\n  Spikes in oil prices have profound repercussions for our economy. The \nprimary reason is that our cars and trucks run only on petroleum.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  We can change that with alternative technologies that exist today. \nThe Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light-duty \nvehicles in America, over 633,000 vehicles. Almost 35,000 of these \nvehicles are within the jurisdiction of this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I was in Brazil a few years ago, I saw how they \ndiversified their fuel use. People there can drive to a gas station and \nchoose whether to fill their vehicle with gasoline or with ethanol. \nThey make their choice based on cost or whatever criteria they deem \nimportant.\n  I want the same choice for American consumers. That is why I am also \nproposing a bill this Congress, a bipartisan bill, as I have done many \ntimes in the past, which will provide for cars built in America to be \nable to run on a fuel instead of or in addition to gasoline. It is \nvirtually very inexpensive, under $100 per car; and if they do it in \nBrazil, we can do it here.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, expanding the role these alternative \ntechnologies play in our transportation economy will help break the \nleverage that foreign government controlled oil companies hold over \nAmericans. It will increase our Nation's domestic security and protect \nconsumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that my colleagues support the Engel amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to propose or develop legislation to redirect funds \n     allocated under section 105(a)(2)(A) of the Gulf of Mexico \n     Energy Security Act of 2006 (43 U.S.C. 1331 note).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, my straightforward amendment would prohibit \nany effort to redirect funds allocated under the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act, also referred to as GOMESA.\n  GOMESA was passed in 2006 and created a revenue sharing agreement for \noffshore oil revenue between the Federal Government and four States in \nthe Gulf of Mexico: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and my home State of \nAlabama.\n  Under GOMESA, 37.5 percent of the revenues generated from selected \noil and gas lease sales in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of \nMexico is returned to these Gulf States. There is a reason the law was \nstructured this way.\n  These Gulf States not only provide the lion's share of the \ninfrastructure and workforce for the industry in the Gulf of Mexico; we \nalso have inherent environmental and economic risks. The BP oil spill 5 \nyears ago should tell us all what that means.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, in his budget proposal this year, \nPresident Obama has recommended that the Bureau of Ocean Energy \nManagement, under the Department of the Interior, redirect the \ndistribution of expanded revenue payments expected to start in 2018 for \nthe Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leases away from the Gulf Coast and \ninstead be spent all around the country.\n  Not only does this proposal directly contradict the current Federal \nstatute, it vastly undermines the purpose of the law, to keep revenues \nfrom these lease sales in the States that supply the workforce and have \nthe inherent risk of a potential environmental and economic disaster.\n  My amendment today is simple, to protect the clearly defined statute \nand prevent the President from using these revenue sharing agreements \nas a slush fund for politically driven environmental projects across \nthe country.\n  Regardless of whether you are from a Gulf Coast State or not, I would \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important amendment to \nprotect the rule of law to support our coastal communities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nwould urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to express a \nfew concerns.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment is an overreaction to a \npolicy proposal in the administration's--in the administration's--2016 \nbudget request.\n  The President's budget requested to propose to direct funds currently \nallocated to payments to States and shift them more towards Federal \nprograms that serve the Nation more broadly.\n  Now, this is a proposal that the President suggested in his budget, \nand it wasn't included in this bill because the Appropriations \nCommittee just flat out rejected it. This is an appropriations process. \nThat is what it is. It is a process.\n  The administration submitted a proposal. The committee evaluated it. \nIt had the power to accept it or reject it. The proposal lay with the \ncommittee as to what to do. As I said, the committee rejected it.\n  This amendment would unnecessarily stifle any proposals to amend \ncurrent formula, which is unnecessary because Congress would need to \nenact legislation before any changes could be made to the formula.\n  The Department of the Interior doesn't have the authority to change \nthe formula through rulemaking or other administrative action. \nBasically, this amendment would prohibit the Department from even \nsuggesting an idea for Congress to consider.\n  I just wanted to claim the time in opposition, Mr. Chair, just to say \nI really think this amendment--although it appears that the majority is \ngoing to take it and I am not going to ask for a vote or anything on \nit--is just really, in my opinion, political overreach.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I wish that these sorts of amendments were \nunnecessary, but the way this administration plays fast and loose with \nits interpretation of the law, particularly through these \nadministrative agencies, I am afraid it is necessary to protect a law \npassed by this Congress in 2006 in recognition of the inherent risk \nthat these four Gulf States have produced so much energy for this \ncountry have, and\n\n[[Page H4824]]\n\nwithout it, we will have an agency that will take the laws that exist--\neven this appropriations bill--and interpret it the way they want to, \nand this amendment makes it very clear they can't do that, that these \nfour coastal States will retain control over these moneys as it was \nenacted by this Congress in 2006.\n  Mr. Chairman, I respect the gentlewoman's point of view. I wish it \nwere unnecessary, but given the behavior of this administration through \nthese administrative agencies, I am afraid it is necessary.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for the Members to support this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to finalize, implement, or enforce subparts F and J \n     of part 1206 of the proposed rule by the Department of the \n     Interior entitled ``Consolidated Federal Oil & Gas and \n     Federal & Indian Coal Valuation Reform'' and dated January 6, \n     2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 608).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Montana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of economic \nopportunity for local communities across the Nation.\n  In my home State of Montana, the Crow Nation suffers from \nunemployment rates as high as 50 percent, despite having over $1 \nbillion in coal reserves. Similar situations play out in communities \nacross America. This administration has waged a war against coal. In \nthe words of Crow Chairman Old Coyote: ``A war on coal is a war on the \nCrow people.''\n  Republicans and Democrats agree; we all want clean air and water and \naffordable power. Thankfully, advances in technology have made it \npossible to have both, making it possible to use our vast resources of \nclean coal to power American homes and manufacturers and put Americans \nback to work. We can't power the American economy on pixie dust and \nhope; it takes innovation and investment in areas like clean coal.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, this administration is fighting a more \naggressive war against American coal than they are against ISIS. We all \nknow of countless attempts to kill coal with regulations, cap-and-\ntrade, and carbon taxes.\n  Now, the most recent attempt is by the Department of the Interior. \nThe DOI is planning to change how coal on Federal lands and \nreservations is valued, creating an unpredictable and unstable market \nthat threatens the livelihoods of our local communities and tribes.\n  When oil, gas, and coal resources are sold, local communities receive \ntax revenues and royalties to help fund everything from education to \ninfrastructure. However, this administration's one-size-fits-all plan \nputs funding in jeopardy; places heavier burdens on States and local \ngovernments; and also stifles innovation, investment, and job creation.\n  The national labor participation is the lowest it has been in the \npast 30 years. Wages are stagnant; the cost of living is going up, and \nenergy prices for home heating and manufacturing are skyrocketing. Our \ncommunities simply can't afford another Federal assault on our economy.\n  These jobs are real, Mr. Chairman. I have been to the Rosebud Mine in \nColstrip where union jobs earn their paychecks to provide for their \nfamilies. This is not just a couple hundred jobs in Montana. There are \nthousands more like them in Kentucky, West Virginia, Utah, and beyond.\n  Whether the coal is mined in Montana or turned into electricity to \nbuild cars in Michigan, coal is a critical part of our American \neconomy. Again, I am reminded of the words of Chairman Old Coyote: \n``For the Crow people, there are no jobs that compare to a coal job--\nthe wages and benefits exceed anything else that is available.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for \nAmerican workers and American jobs by supporting my amendment to block \nfunding for the Obama administration to continue their war on coal.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nurge the adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  It is a good amendment.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment which would deny the American public, especially Native \nAmericans, a fair return for the use of their coal resources.\n  The current coal valuation regulations have been in effect since \n1989. A lot has happened in the intervening 26 years since these \nregulations were last updated. It has now been nearly 3 years since it \nwas first reported that coal companies were skirting Federal royalty \npayments by selling coal to sister companies in order to value exported \ncoal at low domestic prices rather than the much higher prices these \nsister companies were selling the exported coal for in overseas \nmarkets.\n  Now, while there has been a boom for Western coal companies, it has \nmeant the Federal Government and Western States--where we share 50-50 \nof the royalties--have forgone hundreds of millions of dollars that are \nrightly due the American people.\n  These coal royalty valuations especially hurt Native Americans who \ndepend on these royalties for their income. The proposed regulations \nwere a response to States such as Wyoming pleading with the Department \nof the Interior: Do not allow coal producers to create affiliates to \nreduce the royalties paid.\n\n[[Page H4825]]\n\n  This amendment offers Members a stark contrast. Do they want to side \nwith the coal industry which has been gaming the existing royalty \nsystem? Or do they stand with the American public, especially Native \nAmericans, in seeing that coal is fairly priced and that the royalties \ndue Western States, tribes, and the Federal Government are paid?\n  I, for one, will stand with the American people and especially my \nNative American brothers and sisters to make sure that they are treated \nfairly.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Montana has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\3/4\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Montana for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, current Federal coal valuation rules have provided \nstable and significant royalty revenue to State, tribal, and Federal \ngovernments. Despite this tract record, the Department of the Interior \nhas carelessly proposed to modify the valuation of Federal and Indian \ncoal by granting the Office of Natural Resources Revenue new authority \nto deem sales, potentially disallow costs, and use the default rule to \nassert arbitrary values for royalty purposes.\n  These broad new authorities come without clear or transparent \nguidelines for regulators and regulated parties alike, setting the \nstage for inconsistent valuation and protracted litigation. \nFurthermore, the arbitrary regulatory environment created by this rule \ncould jeopardize affordable and reliable energy production, American \njobs, and crucial revenue for State, Federal, and tribal governments.\n  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment and to stop funding for this new rule until the Department of \nthe Interior can demonstrate the need, if there is any--and I am \nskeptical--to radically alter the way royalties are accessed on Federal \ncoal.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, as the sole Representative of the great \nState of Montana, I do represent, and am proud to represent, the Crows, \nthe Northern Cheyenne, the Assiniboine Sioux, and our American Indian \ntribes and great nations and understand the value of having a \nprosperous economy.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like the support of all Members.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to repeat, it has now been nearly \n3 years since it was first reported. Coal companies were skirting \nFederal royalty payments by selling coal to sister companies in order \nto value exported coal at low domestic prices rather than the much \nhigher prices these sister companies were selling the exported coal for \nin overseas markets.\n  It is our job--it is our job--to see that coal is fairly priced and \nthat the royalties due to Western States, tribes, and the Federal \nGovernment are paid.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Montana will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Norcross\n\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n                       revision of dollar amounts\n\n       Sec. __. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the amount made available for \n     ``Department of the Interior--Office of the Secretary--\n     Departmental Operations'' for payments in lieu of taxes under \n     chapter 69 of title 31, United States Code, and increasing \n     the aggregate amount made available for ``Environmental \n     Protection Agency--Hazardous Substance Superfund'', by \n     $22,884,840.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from New Jersey and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is a very simple amendment that would increase funding for the \nSuperfund with the intention the money go specifically to the cleanup \nprogram account. Superfund cleanup is right for the environment and \ncertainly right for the U.S. economy, which is right for the U.S.\n  I come from New Jersey, the Garden State. We have great tomatoes, \ncorn, and it is blueberry season. But what we also have, particularly \nin the southern half of the State, is a history of heavy industry.\n  New Jersey found out the hard way that you just can't take those \nresources after they are finished and dump them into the backyard. We \nhave more than 200 sites in New Jersey listed as being in serious \nviolation of at least one of four Federal environmental laws. The \ncompany offenders, they are gone, and left the constituents, my \nconstituents, holding the bags.\n  My predecessor, Representative Jim Florio, back in the early \neighties, was the author of the Superfund bill. He had the vision of \nwhat we have to do to protect our citizens.\n  I just want to tell a quick story, two of them.\n  The first one is one site, $1 billion, and it is about a quarter of a \nmile from where I live. It is the Welsbach & General Gas Mantle in \nGloucester City, New Jersey. As part of that process of making gas \nmantles almost a half century ago, radium, the substance that was used \nto make it glow brighter, was dumped throughout the city. This material \nis now sitting there. Radium has a half-life of 1,600 years--1,600 \nyears. The process started in 1996, and it is about two-thirds \nfinished. There is no company to go back to.\n  The second story is Sherwin Williams in Gibbsboro, which was a \ngorgeous spot. But as we all know, years ago, that lead paint is now in \nthe water system and impacting that area horribly. The site includes \nKirkwood Lake. The soil under the lake is contaminated. They can't use \nthe lake.\n  These are two very simple stories. I have 15 Superfund sites in my \ndistrict--15.\n  It is our responsibility to protect our citizens. There are no \ncompanies to go back to. That is why I offer this simple amendment. The \ndamage is already done, and we must continue to protect our citizens by \nfunding this amendment correctly.\n  I want to thank the chairman, with the understanding that this \namendment will be ruled out of order.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment with \nthe hope that we continue to work on this important issue in a very \nbipartisan way to protect our citizens.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Jolly\n\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to research, investigate, or study offshore drilling \n     in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As a nation, we continually strive to achieve both energy \nindependence, as well as protect the environment, our critical \nhabitats, and the quality of life\n\n[[Page H4826]]\n\nin communities like Pinellas County, Florida, that I have the \nopportunity to represent.\n  One way we strike that balance is represented in how we currently \nmanage the Gulf of Mexico when it comes to oil drilling. Under a 2006 \nact, we allow for drilling exploration in the central and western Gulf \noff the coast of Texas and Louisiana and other States, but we have a \nban that protects the State of Florida. That ban currently protects the \nState of Florida with a drilling ban of about 125 miles or, in some \ncases, 235 miles.\n  This ban has been in place for 32 years through the operations of the \nAppropriations Committee. And while the current statute allows for the \nban through 2022, year after year, those on the other side of this \ndebate, very respectfully, attempt to erode that ban.\n  The truth is we don't need any additional drilling in the eastern \nGulf of Florida to achieve energy independence. There are nearly 1,000 \nactive leaseholds in the central and western Gulf. There are probably \nnearly 3,000 more available. And to change the ban is just something \nthat we don't need.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says none of the funds may be used \nto study, prepare for, research, investigate any increased offshore oil \ndrilling in the eastern Gulf contemplating the expiration of a ban in \n2022.\n  I am pleased to be joined in offering this amendment by my colleague \nfrom Bonita Springs, Mr. Clawson; my colleague from Tallahassee, Ms. \nGraham; and my colleague from Jupiter, Mr. Murphy.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, as in the case of a number of offshore-\nrelated amendments that we will deal with today, the Interior \nAppropriations bill is not the appropriate venue, though I do \nunderstand it has been used in the past.\n  I understand this amendment dovetails with the current congressional \nmoratorium, and the Department of the Interior has no intention of \nacting in a manner that is contrary to congressional intent. The \nDepartment is focused on the next 5-year oil and gas leasing plan, \nwhich is limited to 2017-2022, so many departmental activities in \nfiscal year 2016 are already limited in scope through 2022. If my \ncolleagues wish to see the moratorium extended beyond 2022, then they \nshould work with the appropriate authorizing committees.\n  With that, I would oppose the amendment, and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's understanding of \nthe interest of those in the State of Florida and the current debate \ncurrently from those on the other side that wish to actually lift the \nban. It is important that, as a delegation, we have the opportunity to \nhave this debate.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson), my \ncolleague from Bonita Springs.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I start by thanking \nRepresentative Jolly for his leadership and persistence on this issue--\nit is so important to my district--and to the chairman for allowing \ndisagreement. Disagreement allows learning, and we appreciate your \nleadership in this regard.\n  I speak in full support of Representative Jolly's amendment. I base \nmy support on the enormous all-time high, proven reserves elsewhere in \nour country and a conviction that we can focus in areas other than the \nGulf.\n  The private sector definitely needs cheap oil, and our businesses, \nour manufacturing companies, cannot be successful without low energy \nprices. I know it, because I lived it.\n  But let's drill where drilling makes sense. And to us, it doesn't \nmake sense to drill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The recent BP \nsettlement, the highest such settlement ever, is evidence that the \neconomic and environmental risk of drilling in the Gulf greatly offset \nany potential returns.\n  For those of us who live, work, or have business in the Gulf, we were \ntold that an oil disaster could never happen, and then it happened. \nFool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\n  I say it is not worth the risk. I say let's do everything we can to \nnever have more drilling in the eastern Gulf.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that, again, I am in \nreluctant opposition to this amendment. This should be dealt with in \nthe authorizing committees.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I would close by offering my colleagues \nthere is authorizing legislation that would extend the ban past the \nyear 2022.\n  This language simply says a ban is a ban is a ban. And while there is \na ban on activities on drilling and the like, this simply says that no \nplanning may occur for post-2022 drilling.\n  With that, I would urge a ``yea'' vote, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in \n     contravention of Executive Order 13693.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I think I will start this discussion \nwith the words of a rather influential individual: Pope Francis. In his \nrecent encyclical, he wrote: ``If present trends continue, this century \nmay well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented \ndestruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us.'' \nThat is Pope Francis.\n  In this legislation, the appropriation bill, there are numerous \nefforts to deny the reality of climate change. And, specifically, what \nI want to deal with on this amendment is Executive Order No. 13693: \nPlanning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade.\n  The intention of this amendment is to support the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent \nover the next decade relative to 2008.\n  This bill will save taxpayers money--about $18 billion--in avoided \nenergy costs, and it will increase the share of electricity the Federal \nGovernment consumes from renewable resources by up to 30 percent. \nTwenty-six million metric tons of greenhouse gases would be eliminated.\n  So why in the face of all of the scientific evidence and why in the \nface of the reality that the climate is, indeed, changing, when we have \nthroughout the State of California and around the Nation local \ngovernments planning for the eventually, not the reality, of higher sea \nlevels, would we put forth a bill that would prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from planning for climate change?\n  Let me just cite some of the ways in which the current legislation, \nthis proposal, deals with it:\n  It prohibits Federal funds for any rulemaking or guidance with regard \nto the social cost of climate change.\n  It prohibits the EPA from limiting carbon pollution from new and \nrenovated power plants, and there has been much discussion about that \non the floor today.\n  It prohibits the funding to update and revise the EPA's ozone \nstandards.\n  It prohibits the funding for any change to the status of HFCs. These \nare fluorocarbons.\n  It also prohibits the reporting detailing the Federal funding for \ndomestic and international climate change programs. This is denial, \ndenial, denial about what is really happening.\n  My amendment would simply say that there is no money to carry out \nthese provisions in the current bill. It is really time for all of us \nhere to recognize that there is a serious challenge, and it is one that \nPope Francis points out so clearly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4827]]\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, climate change is winning the amendment \ncontest tonight. We have had a number of amendments on that subject.\n  Earlier we debated whether or not to continue a bipartisan reporting \nrequirement in the bill on climate change expenditures.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to remove that \nrequirement, which would have reduced transparency. Now my friend wants \nto ensure that funds are being expended on climate and efficiency \nexecutive orders issued by the President.\n  So I am left to wonder whether my colleagues would prefer to know if \nthe funds are spent on these programs or not.\n  Regardless, this amendment is certainly unnecessary. The President \ndid not consult Congress on these executive orders. If anything, we \nshould defund these programs until Congress can have an appropriate \npolicy debate. I see no reason to include this language, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, the executive order by the President is \nvery straightforward. It basically says that the Federal Government \nshall reduce greenhouse gases, and he is using his appropriate \nauthority as the administrative agent of our government to find ways to \ndo that.\n  Certain goals are set in the executive order, for example, reducing \ngreenhouse gases by 40 percent over the next decade. What could be \nwrong with that when you save $18 billion in the process and create \nmore opportunities for renewable energy by up to 30 percent?\n  Why would we pass a bill in this appropriation bill that would go in \nexactly the opposite direction, one that would actually create greater \ngreenhouse gases and lead more directly and more imminently to the \nclimate crisis?\n  I fail to understand why we would want to take up a piece of \nlegislation that has so many provisions in it that deny the reality of \nclimate change, that puts this government on the course to spend more \nmoney on programs that actually create a crisis that will be \nextraordinarily expensive.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, which would maintain the \nPresident's executive order and keep America on a path that all the \nworld should carry out.\n  Pay attention to what Pope Francis said: ``If present trends \ncontinue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change \nand an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious \nconsequences for all of us.''\n  This is not something we should deny. This is something we should, in \nfact, pay attention to, and we ought to be able to maintain the \nPresident's executive order.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, the President did make his unilateral \ndetermination in an executive order. We have an opportunity to vote \n``no'' on this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Crawford\n\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to enforce the requirements of part 112 of title 40, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to any farm (as \n     that term is defined in section 112.2 of such title).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment in defense of \nagricultural producers across our Nation who are facing the heavy hand \nof EPA regulations.\n  The EPA's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule for on-\nfarm fuel storage requires farmers and ranchers to make costly \ninfrastructure improvements to their oil storage facilities to reduce \nthe possibility of an oil spill.\n  These regulations fail to take into account the relative risk of oil \nspills on farms, and they do not factor in the simple fact that family \nfarmers are already careful stewards of our land and water. No one has \nmore at stake in the health of their land than those who work on the \nground from which they derive their livelihoods.\n  The USDA itself discovered little evidence of oil spills on farms and \ndetermined in a recent study that more than 99 percent of farmers have \nnever experienced a spill.\n  To require that all of our producers make a significant investment to \nprevent such an unlikely event seems out of touch with reality and \ndisregards the already overwhelming number of safeguards our farmers \nalready employ.\n  My amendment would restrict the EPA's ability to enforce SPCC \nregulations on farms so that farmers and ranchers can go about their \nbusiness of producing food and fiber without having to worry about \nunnecessary compliance costs and red tape.\n  On three separate occasions, the House unanimously passed my \nbipartisan legislation, the FUELS Act, which rolled back these same \nSPCC regulations on farms. I urge my colleagues to again support our \nfarmers and ranchers by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would urge the adoption of the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would stop the EPA from \nrequiring farms to submit a plan on how they will prevent oil from \nentering navigable waters.\n  I come from Minnesota; so, this seems like a pretty commonsense \nrequirement to me. If a facility has large amounts of oil, it should \ntell the agency responsible for an inland oil spill cleanup how it will \nprevent an environmental disaster.\n  Why shouldn't the holder of gallons of oil have a plan even if it is \nan agriculture business? It should have a plan. And there are criteria \nto make sure that a facility truly should be subject to the Spill \nPrevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule.\n  It has to meet three criteria. It must be nontransported. It must \nhave an aggregate aboveground storage capacity greater than 1,320 \ngallons or a completely buried storage capacity greater than 42,000 \ngallons. We are talking about a lot of oil.\n  The third point is that there must be a reasonable expectation that, \nif something were to go wrong and if there were a discharge, it would \ngo into navigable waters of the United States or of adjoining \nshorelines.\n  In other words, if there is an accident and if there is water nearby, \nyou would need to have a plan in place so that not only would oil not \nseep in and ruin your land, but that it would not flow into waters past \nthe boundaries of your water and just keep polluting.\n  The preparation of the SPCC plan is the responsibility of a facility \nowner or operator or it can be prepared by an engineer or a consultant, \nbut it must be certified by a registered professional engineer.\n  Let's just think about it. You have 42,000 gallons of oil stored \nunderground, and you have 1,320 gallons of oil above. All this does is \nsay you need to have an emergency plan if, when that accident would \noccur--and it can\n\n[[Page H4828]]\n\noccur--there would be the possibility of having that oil go into \nnavigable waters and spread onto other property owners' land or State \nland or Federal land.\n  I think these sound like reasonable requirements. It is a small step \nto help work with the farmer to prevent an environmental disaster that \nwould most likely end up being cleaned up with taxpayers' funds.\n  I always think you should hope for the best, but you always need to \nhave a plan just in case something goes wrong. This rule requirement \nmakes sure that these facilities that meet these criteria have a plan \nin place.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The question is on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Jeffries\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available to the National \n     Park Service by this Act may be used for the purchase or \n     display of a confederate flag with the exception of specific \n     circumstances where the flags provide historical context as \n     described in the National Park Service memorandum entitled \n     ``Immediate Action Required, No Reply Needed: Confederate \n     Flags'' and dated June 24, 2015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the use of \nfunds made available to the National Park Service by this Act for the \npurchase or display of a Confederate flag with the exception of \nspecific circumstances when such flags provide historical context as \nset forth by the National Park Service in their memo to all park \nsuperintendents, dated June 24, 2015.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  The National Park Service has jurisdiction over operation of the \nNational Park System, associated sites such as national heritage areas, \nand various State grant accounts.\n  In light of recent events, the display of the Confederate flag has \nbeen at the forefront of discussion throughout our Nation. This \namendment is consistent with a bipartisan effort across the country to \npromote harmony and not division in this great Nation.\n  On June 17, we were all shocked by the heinous massacre that took the \nlives of nine God-fearing African American churchgoers in Charleston, \nSouth Carolina. This act of domestic terror was carried out by an \nindividual who idolized the Confederate flag and harbored racist \nbeliefs, calling for a return to the human subjugation of others on the \nbasis of race.\n  Unfortunately, that same Confederate flag flew on the grounds of the \nState capitol amidst the funeral of a State senator and dedicated \npastor who taught that we are all God's children at the historic \nEmanuel AME Church.\n  We have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to \ngo in our march toward a more perfect Union. The cancer of racial \nhatred continues to adversely impact our society, and people of good \nwill must unite to eradicate it. Limiting the use of Federal funds \nconnected to the purchase or display of the Confederate flag is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Earlier today, lawmakers in South Carolina from both sides of the \naisle came together to support removing the Confederate battle flag \nfrom their State capitol grounds. This evening, the United States House \nof Representatives has the opportunity to further limit the public \ndisplay of this divisive symbol that is so closely associated with \ndefense of the institution of slavery.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their consideration. \nFor the aforementioned reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I am very happy that this opportunity has \nbeen presented for us to have a discussion on the House floor and the \nNational Park Service doing the right thing about the removal of this \nsymbol of what has become racist hate speech.\n  I thank the gentleman for bringing forward the amendment, and I rise \nin support of it.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to propose, \n     finalize, implement, or revise any regulation in which the \n     research data relied on to support such action is subject to \n     OMB Circular A-110 and is withheld in contravention of the \n     Freedom of Information Act as prescribed under OMB Circular \n     A-110 or if the Science Advisory Board of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency fails to provide scientific advice as may \n     be requested on such regulation to the Congress in \n     contravention of section 4365 of title 42, United States \n     Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment reflects the core \nprinciples of two bills passed by the House earlier this year with \nbipartisan support. They are H.R. 1029, the EPA Science Advisory Board \nReform Act, and H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology's former Subcommittee on Environment chairman, \nRepresentative David Schweikert, who sponsored the original version of \nthe Secret Science bill in 2014.\n  The amendment simply requires the Environmental Protection Agency to \nbase its regulations on publicly available data that can be verified. \nWhy would the administration want to hide this information from the \nAmerican people? We must make sure that Federal regulations are based \non science that is available for independent review.\n  Many Americans are unaware that some of the EPA's most expensive and \nburdensome regulations, such as its proposed climate and ozone rules, \nare based on underlying data that not even the EPA has seen.\n  This amendment ensures that the decisions that affect every American \nare based on independently verified, unbiased, scientific research \ninstead of on secret data that is hidden from the American people. That \nis called the scientific method.\n  This amendment also ensures that the EPA Science Advisory Board is \nable to provide meaningful, balanced, and independent assessments of \nthe science behind the EPA regulations. The EPA frequently undermines \nthe SAB's independence and prevents it from being able to provide \nadvice to Congress. As a result, the valuable advice these experts can \nprovide is often ignored or silenced.\n  The public's right to know must be protected in a democracy. This \namendment ensures that happens. The EPA has a responsibility to be open \nand transparent with the people it serves and whose money it uses.\n  Anyone who supports government transparency and accountability should \nbe able to support this amendment. It helps EPA and the Obama \nadministration keep their promise to be open and honest with the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert), the Appropriations subcommittee \nchairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. I certainly rise in \nsupport of this amendment. Having chaired that subcommittee for 6 years \nand knowing the good work of that subcommittee, I think the intent of \nthe\n\n[[Page H4829]]\n\nlanguage aligns with the two authorizing bills passed by the House \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology earlier this year. I \ncertainly voted for them both times.\n  I think it is a good amendment, so I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his \ncomments. I very much appreciate his support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment seeks to stop \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from issuing regulations through \ntwo different mechanisms.\n  The first one would prevent the EPA from issuing regulations if \nsupporting research data is withheld under the Freedom of Information \nAct.\n  Second, it would withhold regulations if the Agency's Science \nAdvisory Board does not provide the requested advice and information to \nCongress.\n  I would just like to take a moment to address each one of these \nissues fully. Last year, for example, the EPA received 10,500 FOIA \nrequests--Freedom of Information requests--or an average of 40 per \nworkday.\n  These requests required nearly $11 million--$11 million--in personnel \ncosts to process; yet the EPA receives less than $1 million to collect \nfees for these requests. They get $11 million in personnel costs to \nprocess; yet they get less than $1 million to collect the fees for \nthese requests. You can simply do the math.\n  There are only nine allowable exemptions under the law that would \nprevent the EPA from complying with FOIA requests in the first place. \nThese exemptions range from classified national defense, foreign \nrelations information, to confidential business information and matters \nof personal privacy, things which we discuss in this room all the time.\n  The amendment is simply another attempt to stop the EPA from issuing \nregulations, many of which are required by law and are designed to \nimprove human health and the environment.\n  Now, that was in regards to the first point about EPA issuing \nregulations on the Freedom of Information Act, lack of funding \navailable to do it, and then they are following the laws with the nine \nexemptions.\n  Now, with regard to the Science Advisory Board, let me remind my \ncolleagues that these boards are comprised of nearly four dozen experts \nfrom academia. For example, there are academics from the University of \nTexas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas; the Environmental \nSystems and Research Institute in Redlands, California; and from the \nUniversity of Minnesota, my home State.\n  Now, in my opinion, it is very disingenuous to suggest that this \nAdvisory Board's subject matter of experts would withhold information \nto Congress. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which \nsimply puts two more roadblocks in the EPA regulations.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds simply to \npoint out that this amendment does not prevent the EPA from issuing any \nregulations.\n  In fact, it doesn't take a position on regulations. It simply says \nthat the underlying data that the EPA is using to justify regulations \nneeds to be made public. I don't know who could oppose transparency and \nhonesty by this administration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), who as I mentioned a while \nago is a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy of the Committee \non Science, Space, and Technology and is now a member of the Committee \non Financial Services.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire into the remaining time \non our side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chair, in this 45 seconds, I want to walk through \na couple mechanical things really quickly. First off, this amendment is \nbased on the OMB's circular that actually said this data is supposed to \nbe public.\n  Number two, the release of data, if you are making rules, does not \npre-assume that the reg is too tough, too little, too soft. What it \nmeans is, if you are going to be doing public policy--public policy--\ndoesn't the public deserve access to public data because there is lots \nof smart people out there on the left and the right or just academia \nthat should have this information, this raw data, to decide are we \ndoing it the most rational, the most powerful way?\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to once again reiterate \nthere are only nine allowable exemptions under this law that would \nprevent the EPA from complying with FOIA requests.\n  These exemptions range from classified national defense, foreign \nrelations information, confidential business information, and matters \nof personal privacy.\n  Once again, Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nwhich simply works to put roadblocks in front of the EPA ever being \nable to issue a regulation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Speier\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the final rule \n     following the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for \n     the Dog Management Plan (Plan/SEIS), Golden Gate National \n     Recreation Area (GGNRA), California (78 Fed. Reg. 55094; \n     September 9, 2013).\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman from California and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, ``Ruff.'' That is what my dog Buddy says \nwhen he wants to go out for a walk, and that is what dogs throughout \nthe bay area have been accustomed to doing in the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area for decades.\n  I, like them, believe that the GGNRA should be able to afford the \nopportunity for people to recreate, whether one wants to watch a bird, \nride a horse, walk a path, or climb a hill. Some of these uses are \nincompatible, but that doesn't mean we should ban them. That means that \nwe should create opportunity for all.\n  In San Mateo County, in my district, the GGNRA is proposing zero off-\nleash dog areas, closing down one site that has been in operation for \nover many decades.\n  For 40 years, people and their dogs have been welcome at the beaches \nand trails of the GGNRA, which compromises 80,000 acres across San \nFrancisco, Marin, and San Mateo Counties. This public land provides \nmuch-needed recreational space in the densely populated bay area.\n  Today, that access is at risk. The National Park Service is trying to \ndramatically change how it manages recreational areas in the bay area \nby turning the majority of open space in the GGNRA into what are called \ncontrolled zones, where visitor access and activities could be highly \nrestricted. Public use could be denied for longstanding activities in \nthe GGNRA, like hiking, surfing, bike riding, horseback riding, and dog \nwalking.\n  The bay area is densely populated, and open space is precious. For \nmany, the GGNRA is the only option for time outdoors.\n  My amendment would slow the National Park Service's regulatory \noverreach and ensure that people in the bay\n\n[[Page H4830]]\n\narea continue to have recreational access to these urban parks.\n  People and nature aren't incompatible. We can be good stewards and \nalso allow those in the GGNRA to have access to this very beautiful \narea.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote, Mr. Chairman, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination as to whether a rule ``follows'' a specified \nEnvironmental Impact Statement.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Rice of South Carolina\n\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n      limitation on use of funds for offshore oil and gas leasing\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue any oil and gas lease under the 2017-2022 \n     Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program unless \n     the Secretary of the Interior has entered into revenue \n     sharing agreement with each affected State.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from South Carolina \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, my amendment withholds \nfunding for permitting of offshore oil exploration until the Secretary \nof the Interior reaches revenue-sharing agreements with coastal States.\n  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's 2017-2022 Outer Continental \nShelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program opens the mid- and south Atlantic \nregions to oil and gas development after several decades of being off-\nlimits.\n  While advanced drilling techniques and spill response have made \nenvironmentally safe access to oil and gas reserves in the Atlantic \npossible, coastal States should consider and prepare for impacts that \noffshore energy development present.\n  Sharing of revenues with coastal States will help address the risk \nand responsibilities that States and coastal counties assume with \noffshore energy development. These revenues would help State \ngovernments expand coastal management and conservation, build necessary \ninfrastructure, fund emergency preparation and response, and expand \npublic service to support the influx of new industry and workforce.\n  Involving the coastal infrastructure and management will add to the \noverall economic well-being of the coastal communities. Before our \ncoastal States agree to share in the burden of offshore drilling, we \nought to ensure that our coastal States are able to share in the \neconomic blessings of such drilling.\n  My amendment would prohibit funding for implementation of BOEM's plan \nuntil the Secretary of the Interior enters into a revenue sharing \nagreement with the States affected.\n  While it may not be possible this evening to adopt my amendment for \ncoastal States, as we move forward with energy exploration off our \ncoastlines, please be mindful of revenue sharing.\n  Because I understand my amendment is subject to a point of order, I \nplan to withdraw this amendment. But before I withdraw my amendment, I \nask for the chairman's consideration to assist in development of \nrevenue sharing agreements to compensate the coastal States and help \nthem to mitigate risk.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I would be happy to work with the gentleman in the \nfuture to see if there is a methodology where we can move your idea \nforward and see if we can't get the Federal Government and States to \ncooperate to their mutual, I think, benefit on this issue.\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the \nchairman's consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n           prohibition on transfer of fire preparedness funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to transfer funds made available by this Act for fire \n     preparedness activities to the Wildland Fire Management \n     appropriation for fire suppression activities.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I am trying to figure out where to start \nwith this, because we are making progress. I guess the purpose of this \namendment is to give this whole process a swift kick so we can actually \ndo something that is absolutely necessary.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee really has it \ncorrect. And I want to read the language of the appropriations bill, \nwhich I happen to agree with this evening, but not the result.\n\n       In 7 of the last 10 years, the Forest Service and the \n     Department of the Interior have exceeded their wildland fire \n     suppression budgets despite being fully funded at the 10-year \n     suppression average for such costs.\n       Fire seasons have grown longer and more destructive, \n     putting people, communities, and ecosystems at greater risk. \n     Fire borrowing has now become routine rather than \n     extraordinary. Borrowing from nonfire accounts to pay \n     suppression costs results in the Forest Service and \n     Department of the Interior having fewer resources for forest \n     management activities, including hazardous fuels management \n     and other proven efforts, to improve overall forest health \n     and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildland fires.\n\n  Mr. Chairman of the subcommittee, you have it right. You and your \ncommittee staff have done the right analysis but haven't completed the \nfollow-through to achieve that goal.\n  I see our good friend from Idaho standing nearby, and he has a very, \nvery fine bill to deal with this. It would basically create two \nseparate accounts. Now, understanding the necessity of proper order and \nbeing out of order, which sometimes I am, I am not proposing that we \nadopt the good gentleman from Idaho's bill in this bill, but I have got \na different idea. I am going to take this idea from my Republican \ncolleagues who have created so many fiscal crises, otherwise known as \ncliffs, to create one.\n  Basically, what I am doing here with this amendment is saying you \ncan't borrow from other accounts, and when you run out of money, my \ngoodness, we have a crisis. We will have to then adopt my good friend \nfrom Idaho's legislation and solve the problem once and for all.\n  So that is what this amendment does. It says you can't borrow from \nother accounts to fight wildfires, which means that we are going to \nhave to come to grips with the reality of our funding crisis--where we \ncannot get ahead of the wildland fires, where there is a necessity for \nus to spend money on\n\n[[Page H4831]]\n\nprotecting the forests and forest health, thinning and other kinds of \nthings, firebreaks and the like, so we don't just burn down all the \nforests to get around with the proper management. This is what you call \nkicking the issue into gear.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I understand what the gentleman is trying to do, and we \nare on the same page, actually, in ultimately what we want to \naccomplish with this.\n  The fact is that we appropriate money--the Interior Subcommittee has \ndone it for several years now, and Chairman Calvert has done it in this \nbill--where, under the FLAME Act, we fund the 10-year average of what \nit costs to fight wildfires. Unfortunately, I think it is in 8 of the \nlast 10 years we have exceeded that 10-year average. Consequently, when \nmoney runs out for fighting wildfires, what the Forest Service does is \nborrow that money from other accounts.\n  We sometimes complain that the Forest Service doesn't go out and do \nthe thinning that is necessary or do the restoration that is necessary \nor do the trail maintenance that is necessary. The reason they can't do \nit is because we have borrowed all the money to fight wildfires, and we \nare trying to prevent that wildfire borrowing.\n  It is one thing to try to prevent it in a manner that will address \nthe problem and another to just say you just can't borrow, because I \nwould hate to be in the situation where we run up against a fire year \nwhere we are going to exceed the 10-year average, we run out of \nfirefighting money, and there is no way to get the resources in order \nto fund the fires that are occurring in the latter part of the year. \nThis would put pressure on for Congress to probably do something.\n  As you know, there is a challenge with the Budget Committee that we \nhave been working with in trying to address this issue.\n  There is some language, as I understand it, in the Senate Interior \nbill dealing with the wildfire-fighting costs and how we handle that. \nThere is some language in a bill that will be before us I think this \nweek, the Healthy Forest bill out of the Resources Committee.\n  I think more and more people are starting to realize that we have got \nto address this problem. There is absolutely no reason that wildfires \nshould not be treated as other natural disasters are--hurricanes, \ntornadoes, earthquakes, and other things. But for some reason, we treat \nwildfires differently, and that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  So we have had various proposals. I have talked with the \nadministration, with the Department of the Interior, with the Forest \nService, and with many other people, trying to come to a resolution on \nthis, and there are many people on both the Republican and the \nDemocratic side of the aisle that are trying to address this.\n  I am hopeful that we are inching ever closer, because you know things \ndon't move as quickly as we like oftentimes in Congress. We are moving, \ninching closer, I would hope, to finding the solution to this. There \nare different ideas out there about how to go about doing exactly what \nthe gentleman from California, myself, and the chairman all want to do, \nand that is quit the fire borrowing so that the Forest Service can do \nthe job that we appropriate the money for them to do.\n  Given that this could create some real problems, I appreciate what \nthe gentleman is trying to do, but I would have to oppose the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members not to traffic the \nwell.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. My good friend from Idaho has it right. His bill ought \nto become law. And you did find a way to fund it: the same way we fund \nhurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and the like--out of FEMA.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Good bill--by the way, I am a coauthor of it. Thank you very much. \nOnly you can prevent forest fires. How many times have we seen Smokey \nthe Bear? Congress can help.\n  I want to congratulate and I really want to thank my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle because you are in a position to lead on \nthis. This amendment is in a position to cause action. That is all it \nis.\n  Would we have a disaster? We are going to have a fire disaster; there \nis no doubt about it.\n  Would we have a financing disaster? Probably, but we can solve it--we \ncan solve it both with legislation, and then we can solve it with a \npiece of legislation moving through this House that would reach back to \nthe FEMA money, where we always stack a huge stash of money for the \neventuality of a disaster. We would reach back and say: Okay. That is \nhow we are going to do it going forward.\n  I think it is about time for me to yield. I probably don't have much \nmore time, but I am kind of stirring the pot here. I am trying to kick \nthis into gear, and I am delighted to work with the good language that \nthe chairman of the committee has put into the bill.\n  Had I the time, I would read, once again, your analysis of the \nproblem and also your analysis of the solution. That is found in, this \nyear, H.R. 167, a fine piece of legislation by an outstanding gentleman \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for his comments and his help on \ntrying to get us to a resolution on this. I am sure, working together, \nwe can solve this problem eventually.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\nlimitation on use of funds to treat gray wolves in washington, oregon, \n          and utah as endangered species or threatened species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Interior or the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to treat any gray wolf (Canis \n     lupus) in Washington, Oregon, or Utah as an endangered \n     species or threatened species under the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould prohibit the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service from using funds to continue listing the gray wolf \nunder the Endangered Species Act in the States of Washington, Oregon, \nand Utah.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a very serious issue of extreme importance to \nmy home State of Washington, where the gray wolf is listed in the \nwestern two-thirds of the State, but is delisted in the eastern third. \nThis fragmented listing means that there are no geographic barriers to \nprevent the wolves from traveling between listed and delisted areas, \nposing a risk to people living, farming, and ranching in the region.\n  Unfortunately, this issue should already have been settled. In June \nof 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a proposed rule \nto remove the gray wolf from the list of endangered and threatened \nwildlife under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service made this determination after \nevaluating this ``classification status of gray wolves currently listed \nin the contiguous United States'' and found the ``best available \nscience and commercial information indicates that the currently listed \nentity is not a valid species under the Act.''\n  On June 30 of this year, the Service released its response to a \npetition seeking to reclassify all gray wolves in the U.S. as a \nthreatened species under ESA. In its response, the Fish and Wildlife \nService states that it determined there was not substantial information \nto indicate that such a reclassification was warranted, and as a \nresult, the Fish and Wildlife Service will take no further action on \nthe petition.\n\n[[Page H4832]]\n\n  Furthermore, the statutory purpose of ESA is to recover a species to \nthe point where it is no longer considered endangered or threatened. \nThe gray wolf is currently found in nearly 50 countries around the \nworld, and the wolf specialist group of the International Union for \nConservation of Nature has placed the species in the category of \n``least concern globally'' for risk of extinction.\n  Mr. Chairman, the proposed rule and other examples I have cited \nclearly show that a full delisting of the gray wolf is long overdue. \nSince wolves were first placed under ESA, uncontrolled and unmanaged \ngrowth of gray wolf populations has resulted in devastating impacts on \nhunting and ranching, as well as tragic losses to historically strong \nand healthy livestock and wildlife populations.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gray wolf population has grown substantially across \nits range and is now considered to be recovered; therefore, it does not \nmerit protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The Pacific Northwest States are fully qualified to responsibly \nmanage their gray wolf populations and are better suited than the \nFederal Government to meet the needs of local communities, ranchers, \nlivestock, and wildlife populations.\n  My amendment today is simple. It would take steps that the Fish and \nWildlife Service has already said are necessary and are supported by \nthe best available scientific evidence and data. I urge my colleagues \nto support this commonsense amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from eastern \nWashington, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Newhouse, for yielding and for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Four years ago, when the Federal Government delisted wolves in a \nportion of the Western United States, what was left behind was a \ngrowing wolf population and a confusing checkerboard of regulations.\n  Wolves do not know regulatory boundaries. When a single forest is \ndivided between two different management plans, local leaders', \nfarmers', and other stakeholders' hands are tied when protecting \nthemselves from a wolf threat and often face unnecessary repercussions.\n  Washington State proposed a wolf conservation and management plan, \nbut is unable to fully implement it with Federal protections lingering \nin the western two-thirds of the State.\n  Our local leaders can manage the resources and wildlife in our State \nmore effectively and efficiently than the Federal Government; but if we \nwant to empower them to protect herds of livestock, people, and lands \nfrom other possible threats of wolves, we need a consistent framework \nfor the entire State, not just sections.\n  For this reason, I strongly support this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment is yet another attack on a vulnerable \nicon American species, the gray wolf. The gray wolf is a keystone \nspecies that plays a vital role in keeping our ecosystems healthy.\n  It is also an animal that many Native American cultures feel a \nkinship bond with. I heard from many tribal leaders that the \nprotections afforded under the Endangered Species Act for gray wolves \nare the only way that they have been able to keep wolf hunts out of \ntheir tribal reservation boundaries.\n  Now, I understand many of my colleagues have very strong views about \nlistings and delistings affecting their States, but the Endangered \nSpecies Act exists to offer necessary protections and ensure a species' \nsurvival, which the majority of our constituents strongly support. This \nis the same law that successfully restored another iconic American \nspecies, the bald eagle.\n  This amendment restricts the Department of the Interior's ability to \nimplement the Endangered Species Act. However, it does not alter the \nprotections for the endangered wolves in these States.\n  Regardless of one's position on species protection, the amendment is \nvery problematic. The restrictions will ultimately hurt farmers, \nranchers, landowners and businessowners.\n  Here is why: under this amendment, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwould not be able to offer exemptions or permits for incidental \nkillings of wolves to landowners, ranchers, and other parties who might \nbe in need of them; however, the prohibition against accidental kills \nor takes would still remain and would still be legally enforceable.\n  Thus, this constitutes that States would either have to stop any \nactivity--any activity--that led to the taking of a wolf, or they would \nbe vulnerable to a lawsuit or heavy penalties. Simply put, this \namendment is bad for wolves; it is bad for our ecosystem; it is bad for \nbusiness, and it is bad for our constituents.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I just wanted to explain the situation that we find \nourselves in.\n  I am sympathetic with what the gentleman is doing, and when we \nactually passed language 4 years ago on the wolves in Idaho and \nMontana, we thought about what happened to the wolves that go into \nWashington and Oregon and Nevada and Utah and so forth; and we thought \nabout including those in the general delisting. Well, we didn't delist \nthem; the Fish and Wildlife Service did.\n  We found it created several problems. One, those States didn't have \nState management plans, which is the case today with most of them \nbecause we discussed this, or I discussed this issue earlier with the \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  What their plan is and what they would like to do is, currently, they \nsupport the language that is in the bill that reinstates their \ndelisting in Wyoming and the Great Lakes. Those States have State \nmanagement plans that have been approved by Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  If you include the other States that are included in this that don't \nhave the State management plans, then Fish and Wildlife has to oppose \nwhat we are doing.\n  I believe that what their goal is, is to get this language passed \ndealing with Wyoming, the Great Lakes, and then do a wider, rangewide \ndelisting once those States have State management plans that have been \nadopted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and this amendment may \nundermine that.\n  This is something that we need to discuss, I think. I am not opposing \nthe gentleman's amendment, but it is something that I think we need to \ndiscuss between now and conference so that we get a plan and to make \nsure that we are not undermining what I think we all want, and that is \nthe ultimate delisting of the gray wolves that have met the standard.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, as I said earlier, I \nunderstand that my colleagues have strong views about this, pro and \ncon, about the listing and delisting; but this amendment is very, very \nproblematic. For that reason, I can't support it.\n  The gentleman from Idaho is correct. This has so many unintended \nconsequences that I feel very strongly--very strongly--about not \nsupporting this amendment for that reason.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, with the few seconds I have left, I would \ncertainly thank the gentleman from Idaho, as well as the lady from \nMinnesota, for sharing their concerns.\n  I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues. I would urge \nsupport and look forward to a continuing effort to move this to a \nconclusion that we can all accept.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H4833]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act for California \n     drought response or relief may be used by the Administrator \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Secretary of \n     the Interior in contravention of implementation of Division \n     26.7 of the California Water Code (the Water Quality, Supply, \n     and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014), as approved by \n     the voters of California in California Proposition 1 (2014).\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, despite the potential for a point of \norder and the amendment being out of order, it really, really is a good \npolicy. While it may not come to a vote on this House floor, it \ncertainly ought to come to the attention of the appropriators and the \nadministration that we have got a pretty serious drought in the West. \nIt does affect California, Arizona, Oregon, probably parts of Idaho, \nand on into New Mexico.\n  California voters last November passed a $7 billion water bond that \ndeals with the long-term issues of the water supply in California and \nsome of the immediate challenges that the California drought has \nbrought to the 30-plus million citizens of the State.\n  This amendment would direct the Department of the interior, the EPA, \nthe Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense to focus \nthe money that it would be spending in California under any \ncircumstance, to focus that money on assisting, augmenting, advancing, \nand supplementing those programs that the State of California is \nundertaking to address the drought using the bond act money.\n  That is a great idea, that instead of spending the money on things \nthat are not immediately relevant, that are not immediately necessary \nand do not immediately help those citizens of California, those \ncommunities, those agencies in the State that are suffering from the \ndrought, rather to spend the money on those programs. That is it.\n  It doesn't call for any additional money. It doesn't really cause \nlong-term problems to our appropriation processes, but, rather, it \nsays, hey, we have got a problem. Let's focus on the problem, and let's \ncoordinate with the State of California in solving the problem. That is \nit, pretty simple stuff.\n  Unfortunately, I guess we may have a point of order, and this rather \nimportant concept won't be in the legislation.\n  However, I do think that the administration is aware, and they are \nbeginning to focus appropriately on the drought in California. And I \nwould hope in other States, just as we are suggesting they do here, \nthat they, the administration and the Federal Government, focus the \nmoney that it would otherwise be spending in the State of California \nand in these other States on projects that the local governments, the \nState governments in those States are undertaking to address the \ndrought--pretty basic.\n  So that I might challenge the point of order, I will reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order and make a \npoint of order against the amendment because it proposes to change \nexisting law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, \ntherefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination, and I ask for a ruling \nfrom the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, my good friend from Idaho was so right \nand is now so wrong. But that is the way it is. When you have got the \nvotes, you have got the votes.\n  Nevertheless, this is really a very, very good program. I would \nencourage all of us--and particularly the administration--to follow \nalong the policies here; and I would point out that they are.\n  So I challenge the point of order and would ask for a ruling of the \nChair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination of whether certain actions will contravene a specified \nState law.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to issue any regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) that applies to an animal \n     feeding operation, including a concentrated animal feeding \n     operation and a large concentrated animal feeding operation, \n     as such terms are defined in section 122.23 of title 40, Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment on an \nissue that is critical to livestock producers not just in my State and \nin my district, but across the whole country.\n  Last year, a group of folks in my area, environmental activists, sued \nseveral dairies in the Yakima Valley in Washington State, claiming that \nthe dairies were responsible for ``open dumping'' under the Resources \nConservation and Recovery Act of 1976--or, as it is most commonly \nreferred to, RCRA--because of manure storage and management issues on \ntheir farms.\n  The big issue is what law the activists were suing the dairies under. \nThere are many laws and regulations, both at the State and Federal \nlevel, which are appropriate mechanisms for protecting and ensuring our \nNation's waters are kept clean, but the problem I see is that RCRA is \nnot one of them.\n  RCRA was a law designed to govern solid wastes and prevent open \ndumping. The major application of this law is regulating landfills. It \nwas never intended to regulate animal waste. In fact, the EPA, in its \ninitial 1979 regulations for RCRA, expressed that the law ``does not \napply to agricultural waste, including manure and crop residue, \nreturned to the soil as fertilizers or soil conditioners.''\n  I don't know how much clearer we can get that manure storage and \nhandling were not intended to be governed under this law. \nUnfortunately, though, a Federal judge in Spokane, Washington, agreed \nwith the group and stretched the definition of ``solid waste'' to apply \nto manure nitrates, contrary to the law and Federal regulatory code, \nand held the dairies responsible for open dumping because of how they \nstored and handled animal waste.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment does nothing to prevent EPA from enforcing \nthe current regulations under RCRA. It does nothing to change the Clean \nWater Act rulemakings, nor does it prevent EPA from issuing or \nenforcing Clean Water Act regulations. All my amendment does is prevent \nEPA from issuing and expanding new regulations under RCRA that would \nreflect the interpretation of this current law.\n  Mr. Chair, no one is saying that livestock producers--like every \nAmerican--don't share in the responsibility of good stewardship of our \nenvironment\n\n[[Page H4834]]\n\nand our resources. They certainly do. But there are appropriate laws \nand regulations intended to govern this, and there are ones that are \nnot appropriate for this purpose.\n  Simply piling additional layers of regulation on producers and giving \nactivists new litigation tools to target our Nation's farmers and \nranchers is not what Congress had in mind when passing the Resources \nConservation and Recovery Act. We, as Congress, have a responsibility \nto make that clarification, and that is what I am seeking to do with \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would be better able to comment on this \namendment if the gentleman had shared a copy. In this day and age, I am \nglad we are allowed to bring an iPad on the floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman from Washington when he \ndecided upon this amendment. Has it been in the last 20 minutes, or was \nit 2 hours ago?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. It was, let's see, more like 6 hours ago that it was in \nthe hopper.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I thank the \ngentleman.\n  The headlines are, groundbreaking rule in Washington State on this \ndairy case. And it is, ``Dairy Pollution Threatens Washington Valley's \nWater.'' This was a big enough story, in fact, that it was even \nreprinted by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. It was the first time that \nthe Federal Resources Conservation Recovery Act was used to consider \nways in which land and water had to be protected.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, just because I didn't have an opportunity to really \ndelve into this and find out more about it--and what the amendment does \nis it just totally stops funds to be issued under this regulation to \nanimal feeding operations--I am going to oppose it because it also \nincludes large concentrated animal feeding operations. And I do come \nfrom a farming State, so I do know the difference between a small farm, \na small hog farmer, and a lagoon, and large dairy farms and small dairy \nfarms. So with that, I oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I am not questioning the good lady's \ncredentials from the farming State of Minnesota. But certainly given \ntime, as this process moves forward, she will become intimately \nfamiliar with this law as it is being interpreted. It is already \nhappening in other parts of the country, and I would offer this \namendment to help preclude the wrongful use of the law and ask my \ncolleagues for strong consideration.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I will just read into the Record from \nJanuary 15, 2015, Spokane, Washington:\n\n       A Federal judge has ruled that a large industrial dairy in \n     eastern Washington has polluted drinking water through its \n     application, storage, and management of manure in a case that \n     could set precedents across the Nation.\n       U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice of Spokane ruled \n     Wednesday that the pollution posed an ``imminent and \n     substantial endangerment'' to the environment and to people \n     who drink the water.\n       Rice wrote that he ``could come to no other conclusion than \n     that the dairy's operations are contributing to the high \n     levels of nitrate that are currently contaminating--and will \n     continue to contaminate . . . the underlying groundwater.''\n       ``Any attempt to diminish the dairy's contribution to the \n     nitrate contamination is disingenuous, at best,'' Rice wrote \n     in the 111-page opinion, in which he granted partial summary \n     judgment in favor of environmental groups that sued the \n     dairy.\n\n  These environmental groups are people who are looking out for their \ndrinking water. So, Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to eliminate the Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the committee, both the \nstaff and the gentlewoman from Minnesota, the gentleman from \nCalifornia, and the gentleman from Idaho who are now managing this \nappropriations bill.\n  I call this the good health appropriations for the quality of life of \nmany Americans, both urban and rural. I ask my colleagues to consider \nmy amendment, which deals with the urban reforestation program. I live \nclose and personal to both urban areas and rural areas in my \ncongressional district.\n  Given close to 80 percent of the population of the conterminous \nUnited States lives in an urban area, the benefits provided by urban \nforests touch most U.S. citizens. My amendment specifically reinforces \nthe importance of urban reforestation, as well as preserves our ability \nto return urban areas to healthy and safe living environments for our \nchildren.\n  I offered these amendments in years past. I know it from a real-time \nexperience. Over the last couple of years, when the drought hit Houston \nand many other areas in Texas, millions of trees were lost. Millions of \ntrees were lost.\n  Today, now, we face the large and very challenging effort of trying \nto reforest parks like Memorial Park, MacGregor Park, and many parks in \nthe northeast part of my district. In the past 30 years alone, we have \nlost 30 percent of all of our urban trees, a loss of over 600 million \ntrees.\n  I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban \nreforestation. In fact, many Members will remember that throughout our \ncareers, we have been involved in planting of trees. There are major \nefforts throughout our community.\n  I want to cite, for example, those who have worked in Houston, Texas, \ndoing the reforestation work: Houston Wilderness, Student Conservation \nAssociation, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, the Greater East End \nManagement District, Houston Parks and Recreation Department, and Texas \nParks & Wildlife Department, along with many civic clubs of which I \nhave had the privilege of working with.\n  Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group, \nestimated that the tree-covered loss in the greater Washington \nmetropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540 \nmillion cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have \ntaken more than 1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.\n  We know that the green effect in the middle of the city can have a \nbeneficial effect on a community's health, both physically and \npsychologically. A healthy 32-foot-tall ash tree can produce about 260 \npounds of oxygen annually.\n  Trees help reduce pollution. Trees help combat the effects of \ngreenhouse gases. Trees help cool down the overall city environment by \nshading asphalt, concrete, and metal surfaces. Buildings and paving in \ncity centers create a heat island effect. A mature tree canopy reduces \nair temperatures by about 5 to 10 degrees.\n  Let me give a personal story on the importance of reforestation. A \nfew years ago, I helped create a memorial plaza for a Martin Luther \nKing monument in MacGregor Park. There was a tree of life that was \npresented to that park by Martin Luther King's father.\n  In the course of urban development, that tree had to be moved. It \ncaused an emotional uprising in our community. Ovide Duncantell tied \nhimself to the tree.\n  Ultimately, we resolved that the tree had to be moved, and that tree \nwas potentially a tree that would die. With the right kind of nurturing \nand reforestation and treatment by the foresters who came, that tree is \nnow a shining example of a unified community.\n\n[[Page H4835]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment to ensure \nthat our programs dealing with urban reforestation continue.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my \namendment to H.R. 2822, the Interior and Environment Appropriations Act \nof 2016 and to commend Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir leadership in shepherding this bill through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution, which \noperates our national museums including the National Zoo.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important \nmessage from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment emphasizes the importance of urban forests, \nand preserves our ability to return urban areas to healthy and safe \nliving environments for our children.\n  Identical amendments were offered and accepted in the Interior and \nEnvironment Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 2643) and \nFiscal Year 2007 (H.R. 5386), and were adopted by voice vote.\n  Mr. Chair, surveys indicate that some urban forests are in serious \ndanger.\n  In the past 30 years alone, we have lost 30% of all our urban trees--\na loss of over 600 million trees.\n  Eighty percent (80%) of the American population lives in the dense \nquarters of a city.\n  Reforestation programs return a tool of nature to a concrete area \nthat can help to remove air pollution, filter out chemicals and \nagricultural waste in water, and save communities millions of dollars \nin storm water management costs.\n  I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban \nreforestation.\n  In addition, havens of green in the middle of a city can have \nbeneficial effects on a community's health, both physical and \npsychological, as well as increase property value of surrounding real \nestate.\n  Reforestation of cities is an innovative way of combating urban \nsprawl and/or deterioration.\n  Mr. Chair, a real commitment to enhancing our environment involves \nboth the protection of existing natural resources and active support \nfor restoration and improvement projects.\n  Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group, \nestimated that the tree cover lost in the greater Washington \nmetropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540 \nmillion cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have \ntaken more than $1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.\n  Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen.\n  People breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.\n  A typical person consumes about 38 lb of oxygen per year.\n  A healthy tree, say a 32 ft tall ash tree, can produce about 260 lb \nof oxygen annually--two trees supply the oxygen needs of a person for a \nyear.\n  Trees help reduce pollution by capturing particulates like dust and \npollen with their leaves.\n  A mature tree absorbs from 120 to 240 lbs of the small particles and \ngases of air pollution.\n  Trees help combat the effects of ``greenhouse'' gases, the increased \ncarbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels that is causing our \natmosphere to ``heat up.''\n  Trees help cool down the overall city environment by shading asphalt, \nconcrete and metal surfaces.\n  Buildings and paving in city centers create a heat-island effect.\n  A mature tree canopy reduces air temperatures by about 5-10 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  A 25 foot tree reduces annual heating and cooling costs of a typical \nresidence by 8 to 12 percent, producing an average annual savings of \n$120 per American household.\n  Proper tree plantings around buildings can slow winter winds, and \nreduce annual energy use for home heating by 4-22%.\n  Mr. Chair, trees play a vital role in making our cities more \nsustainable and more livable.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment simply provides for continued support to \nprograms that reforest our urban areas.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee \namendment and thank Chairman Calvert  and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, \nEnvironment, and Related Agencies.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  It was very interesting to learn more about what your goals and \nobjectives are, and I think it is very worthy of our consideration.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by simply saying what \na great difference life will be in many urban areas with our commitment \nto reforestation of urban areas and creating more opportunities for \ntrees to grow in those areas.\n  I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoder\n\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to implement or enforce threatened species \n                 listing of the lesser prairie chicken\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species \n     listing of the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Kansas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today would prohibit further \nwaste of Federal funds from being used to enforce the unnecessary \nlisting of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Now, this listing has Americans crying foul in Kansas and all across \nthe country over the burden it places on farmers, ranchers, and \nagriculture producers. This misguided listing comes at a time when the \nlesser prairie chicken is actually becoming the greater prairie \nchicken, in some respects, gaining in population significantly each of \nthe last several years.\n  Less than 1 week ago, a new population count for the lesser prairie \nchicken was released, and it shows a 25 percent increase in the species \npopulation over the last year. That follows a 20 percent increase from \nthe year before.\n  What is to account for all this? Is it the listing on the endangered \nspecies list? No--these population increases, according to experts, are \nattributed to improved habitat conditions, as a result of increased \nrainfall to an area that had previously been experiencing one of the \nworst droughts since the infamous Dust Bowl.\n  Now, not a single drop of this rainfall can be attributed to the \ncentral planners in Washington, D.C., nor can this listing have any \neffect on making it rain in places like Kansas.\n  We need to let State and local municipalities and States work \ntogether to create these conservation plans to help produce the \npopulations we need for the lesser prairie chicken.\n  In fact, five States with habitat areas--Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New \nMexico, and Colorado--already have a locally driven, areawide plan in \nplace known as the lesser prairie chicken rangewide conservation plan. \nIt has broad stakeholder support to conserve and replenish the lesser \nprairie chicken population.\n  Now, we have an opportunity today, as Democrats and Republicans, to \nflock together, to break out of our shells, to work with States and \nlocalities and delist the lesser prairie chicken.\n  Keeping it in place makes it harder on hard-working farmers to grow \ncrops and feed our Nation, and it makes it harder for energy producers \nto produce renewable or traditional energy.\n  All of that increases the cost at the grocery store or at the pump \nfor average everyday working Americans. This cost of the listing is \nhaving little to no impact; this is while the cost of this listing has \nlittle to no impact on the ever-growing population.\n  That growth is coming from States and localities working hand in hand \nwith farmers and producers; yet, as these ineffective Federal burdens \ngo up, so does the cost of doing business in America. Now, that is \ntruly something to crow about.\n  Let's work together. Let's let States recoup and conserve and grow \nthe lesser prairie chicken populations, and let's pass this amendment.\n\n[[Page H4836]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the Fish and \nWildlife Service from implementing or enforcing threatened species \nlisting of the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered Species Act \nand would restrict the Fish and Wildlife Service from offering any \ncritical protections to preserve the species.\n  This amendment is harmful and misguided and maybe a little scrambled, \nas in some eggs. Once the species is listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the role of Fish and Wildlife is primarily permissive, \nhelping parties comply with the act as they carry out their activities.\n  Under this amendment, all the Endangered Species Act prohibitions \nwould still apply. They would still apply, the Endangered Species Act \nprohibitions, but landowners would have no avenue to comply with them.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing \npermits or exemptions. This means landowners, industry, and other \nparties who might need to take the lesser prairie chicken incidentally \nto do their otherwise lawful activities, such as oil and gas \ndevelopment, would be vulnerable to a citizens lawsuit.\n  Additionally, this amendment would halt an innovative plan to \nconserve the lesser prairie chicken. In 2014, Fish and Wildlife, in \npartnership with States and local stakeholders, began the \nimplementation of a lesser prairie chicken rangewide conservation plan. \nThat encouraged participants to gain in proactive and voluntary \nconservation activities, promoting lesser prairie chicken conservation.\n  The plan describes a locally controlled and an innovative approach \nfor maintaining the State's authority to conserve the species and \nallows for economic development to continue in a seamless manner. It \nsounds like a win-win to me, with Fish and Wildlife partnering with \nlocal partners and with the State.\n  This plan prevents significant regulatory delays in obtaining taking \npermits, disruption to economic activities vital to the State and \nnational interests, and little incentive for conservation habitat on \nprairie lands.\n  Sadly, the gentleman's amendment would undermine this plan that local \nfolks and the State came up with to be more collaborative in a \nconservation effort. This amendment would create uncertainty for \nlandowners, making them vulnerable, as I said earlier, to lawsuits.\n  We should be supporting the Fish and Wildlife Service in its efforts \nto work with local community leaders and to work with the States, not \nblocking the agency for doing their job.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from western Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to cosponsor this \ncommonsense amendment as we work to stop the Federal Government from \nenforcing the ill-advised listing of the lesser prairie chicken.\n  As a fifth-generation farmer and possibly the only Member on the \nfloor who has actually seen the real-life bird on a family farm that we \nare talking about, I am strongly opposed to this listing.\n  As was mentioned, this listing occurred during a massive, historical \nmultiyear drought in my home area in my region and State, which \nobviously limits habitat growth and reduces the numbers of prairie \nchickens.\n  The best solution is for it to rain; and that, it has. Thank you, \nLord, though I fully expect the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to take \ncredit for the resulting increase in the lesser prairie chicken \npopulation.\n  For the last 4 years, I have heard from farmers, ranchers, \nhomebuilders, energy producers, and other small businesses concerned \nabout what this listing would do to our rural economy. Our farmers and \nranchers are in a state of uncertainty as to whether certain farming \nand conservation practices, like we have in my own farm, will result in \nfines or perhaps even jail time. Many energy producers have stopped \ndrilling new wells for fear of risking the consequences of the listing.\n\n  Unless Congress does something and does it soon, this threat to our \nrural economy will probably continue forever. In 40 years of the \nEndangered Species Act, more than 1,350 species have been listed as \nendangered, but only 24 have been delisted, and that is just 1.7 \npercent--not very successful, Mr. Chairman.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these concerns with you, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment, support our farmers \nand ranchers, and support common sense.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am sympathetic to the gentleman's \nconcerns, particularly because my home State of California probably has \nmore than its fair share of endangered species problem.\n  The Endangered Species Act hinges upon the principle that, if a \nspecies is listed, that it will be recovered and management will return \nto the States. This push by the States is the reality we see playing \nout. Bats, wolves, greater sage-grouse, delta smelt, the list goes on \nand on and on.\n  It should come as no surprise, then, to see the States pushing back \nthrough their elected Representatives in the legislative branch in an \neffort to bring the Endangered Species Act back into balance.\n  I would support this amendment.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I understand that there is a concern with \nthe listings; and I hear that very loud and clear from my colleagues.\n  The problem with the way that these amendments have been drafted, \nparticularly in line with this amendment, again, all the Endangered \nSpecies Act prohibitions would still apply.\n  Landowners would have no avenue to comply with because they wouldn't \nhave a partner in the Fish and Wildlife because Fish and Wildlife would \nbe barred from issuing any permits or any exemptions.\n  Clearly, it means landowners, industries, and other parties who might \nneed to take a lesser prairie chicken incidentally to their otherwise \nlawful activities will be vulnerable to a lawsuit. Additionally, this \namendment will halt any innovation plan to conserve the lesser prairie \nchicken.\n  The gentleman's amendment, by undermining collaborative efforts and, \nI believe, with an amendment that creates uncertainty for landowners \nmaking them vulnerable to lawsuits, should be an amendment that should \nbe opposed.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n\n                              {time}  2215\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n        At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to limit outreach programs administered by the \n     Smithsonian Institution.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, again, let me offer my appreciation to \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota, the gentleman from California, and \ntheir staff who have worked with us.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that just a few days ago, I offered this \namendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the \nfunding and the Smithsonian, to provide for the Nation's museum.\n\n[[Page H4837]]\n\n  Let me also say to my colleagues that I have offered this amendment \nin the past because I have a particular interest in the museums of \nAmerica and their ability to do outreach. I imagine I am not alone \nstanding here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end \nof sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide \nthe people of America the full funding to address these quality of life \nissues from the various lands and Federal parks and, as well, the \nhistoric trails, of which I will talk about, but museums, urban \nreforestation, all elements of the beauty of this Nation. And I frankly \nbelieve that museums, likewise, are that form of beauty.\n  My amendment specifically says: ``None of the funds made available in \nthis Act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the \nSmithsonian Institution.''\n  In order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge, the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater \naudience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities who \notherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history \noffered by the Smithsonian.\n  Our museums of the Nation are in trouble. The Smithsonian has a \nbeautiful array of museums that are here that millions of Americans \nhave the opportunity to visit. But the outreach program serves millions \nof Americans, thousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in \nall 50 States through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and \nsharing of educational resources via publications, lectures and \npresentations, training programs, and Web sites.\n  Allow me to mention just a few in my own district:\n  The Holocaust Museum, unique in its presentation of a horrible time \nin history, but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our \ncommunity;\n  The Children's Museum, as one of the original board members and \nfounders, now the Children's Museum is one of the major children's \nmuseums in the Nation. But again, it needs the impact of the outreach \nof the Smithsonian;\n  And then, of course, the Museum of African American Culture, headed \nby a dear friend, but also a champion of holding this museum together, \nand that is John Guess. He needs a fuller embrace by the Smithsonian, \nincluding its expertise, its experts, its Ph.D.s, traveling efforts, \nand again, its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the \nvalue of participating in museums.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach activities include the Smithsonian \nInstitution traveling exhibition, the Smithsonian Center for Education \nand Museum Studies, National Science Resources Center, the Smithsonian \nInstitution Press, the Office of Fellowships, and the Smithsonian \nAssociates.\n  Who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the \nvaried and diverse history of America, the good history of America, the \nhistory that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that \nrecognizes our wonderful diversity?\n  So I ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals \nspecifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that \nreally need the help of the Smithsonian.\n  The Smithsonian, in concluding, Mr. Chairman, is very important to \nurban areas and rural areas alike, and its ability or its affiliation \nis to build a strong national network of museums and educational \norganizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships \nwith communities throughout the country.\n  Again, allow me to salute, in particular, John Guess, with the Museum \nof African American Culture in Houston. He has literally put that \nmuseum together, along with his board members.\n  The Smithsonian--I hope they are hearing me as I am talking on the \nfloor of the House--we need your help in Houston, Texas. We probably \nneed your help in Washington State, in California, Minnesota, New York, \nand beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the \nNation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment, but the \nmuseums of this Nation.\n  And I say to Mr. Calvert, we had discussed this before. This \namendment now is a placeholder, hopefully, for our discussion going \nforward dealing with the preservation of our museums.\n  Let me thank Mr. Calvert, Mr. Simpson, and Ms. McCollum.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my \namendment to H.R. 2822, the ``Interior and Environment Appropriations \nAct of 2016.''\n  Let me also thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Smithsonian \nInstitution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and \nSpace Museum; the Museum of African Art; the Museum of the American \nIndian; and the National Portrait Gallery.\n  The Smithsonian also operates another national treasure: the National \nZoo.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important \nmessage from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment simply provides that:\n  ``Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used \nto limit outreach programs administered by the Smithsonian \nInstitution.''\n  This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered to the Interior \nand Environment Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 2643) that was \napproved by voice vote on June 26, 2007.\n  Mr. Chair, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring Smithsonian \nscholars in art, history and science out of ``the nation's attic'' and \ninto their own backyard.\n  Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian in Washington, \nD.C.\n  But in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, ``the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge,'' the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even \ngreater audience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities \nwho otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history \noffered by the Smithsonian.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach programs serve millions of Americans, \nthousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50 \nstates, through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of \neducational resources via publications, lectures and presentations, \ntraining programs, and websites.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with \nSmithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate \ninstitutions and others across the nation.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach activities support community-based \ncultural and educational organizations around the country.\n  They ensure a vital, recurring, and high-impact Smithsonian presence \nin all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a \nnetwork of affiliations.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the \nInstitution and targeted audiences (African American, Asian American, \nLatino, Native American, and new American) and provide kindergarten \nthrough college-age museum education and outreach opportunities.\n  These outreach programs enhance K-12 science education programs, \nfacilitate the Smithsonian's scholarly interactions with students and \nscholars at universities, museums, and other research institutions; and \ndisseminate results related to the research and collections strengths \nof the Institution.\n  The programs that provide the critical mass of Smithsonian outreach \nactivity are:\n  1. the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services (SITES);\n  2. the Smithsonian Affiliations, the Smithsonian Center for Education \nand Museum Studies (SCEMS);\n  3. National Science Resources Center (NSRC);\n  4. the Smithsonian Institution Press (SIP);\n  5. the Office of Fellowships (OF); and\n  6. the Smithsonian Associates (TSA), which receives no federal \nfunding.\n  To achieve the goal of increasing pubic engagement, SITES directs \nsome of its federal resources to develop Smithsonian Across America: A \nCelebration of National Pride.\n  This ``mobile museum,'' which will feature Smithsonian artifacts from \nthe most iconic (presidential portraits, historical American flags, \nCivil War records, astronaut uniforms, etc.) to the simplest items of \neverday life (family quilts, prairie schoolhouse furnishings, \nhistorical lunch boxes, multilingual store front and street signs, \netc.), has been a long-standing organizational priority of the \nSmithsonian.\n  SITES ``mobile museum'' is the only traveling exhibit format able to \nguarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during \nsustained periods of economic retrenchment, but also because it is \nimperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling \nfinancially yet eager to participate in Smithsonian outreach.\n\n  For communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic \ndownturn, the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions, the \n``mobile museum'' promises to answer an ever-growing demand for \nSmithsonian shows in the field.\n\n[[Page H4838]]\n\n  A single, conventional SITES exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 \nlocations over a two- to three-year period.\n  In contrast, a ``mobile museum'' exhibit can visit up to three venues \nper week in the course of only one year, at no cost to the host \ninstitution or community.\n  The net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach \nlocations to which SITES shows can travel annually.\n  And in addition to its flexibility in making short-term stops in \ncities and towns from coast-to-coast, a ``mobile museum'' has the \nadvantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people \nlive, work, and take part in leisure time activities.\n  By establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these, SITES \nwill not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million, \nbut also advance a key Smithsonian performance objective: to develop \nexhibit approaches that address diverse audiences, including population \ngroups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions.\n  SITES also will be the public exhibitions' face of the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, as that new \nMuseum comes online.\n  Providing national access to projects that will introduce the \nAmerican public to the Museum's mission, SITES in FY 2008 will tour \nsuch stirring exhibitions as NASA ART: 50 Years of Exploration; 381 \nDays: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story; Beyond: Visions of Planetary \nLandscapes; The Way We Worked: Photographs from the National Archives; \nand More Than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's \nArchives of American Art.\n  To meet the growing demand among smaller community and ethnic museums \nfor an exhibition celebrating the Latino experience, SITES provided a \nscaled-down version of the National Museum of American History's 4,000-\nsquare-foot exhibition about legendary entertainer Celia Cruz.\n  Two 1,500-square-foot exhibitions, one about Crow Indian history and \nthe other on basket traditions, will give Smithsonian visitors beyond \nWashington a taste of the Institution's critically acclaimed National \nMuseum of the American Indian.\n  Two more exhibits, ``In Plane View'' and ``Earth from Space,'' \nprovided visitors an opportunity to experience the Smithsonian's \nrecently opened, expansive National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy \nCenter.\n  For almost 30 years, The Smithsonian Associates--the highly regarded \neducational arm of the Smithsonian Institution--has arranged Scholars \nin the Schools programs.\n  Through this tremendously successful and well-received educational \noutreach program, the Smithsonian shares its staff--hundreds of experts \nin art, history and science--with the national community at a local \nlevel.\n  The mission of Smithsonian Affiliations is to build a strong national \nnetwork of museums and educational organizations in order to establish \nactive and engaging relationships with communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  There are currently 138 affiliates located in the United States, \nPuerto Rico, and Panama.\n  By working with museums of diverse subject areas and scholarly \ndisciplines, both emerging and well-established, Smithsonian \nAffiliations is building partnerships through which audiences and \nvisitors everywhere will be able to share in the great wealth of the \nSmithsonian while building capacity and expertise in local communities.\n  The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) strives to increase the \nnumber of ethnically diverse students participating in effective \nscience programs based on NSRC products and services.\n  The Center develops and implements a national outreach strategy that \nwill increase the number of school districts (currently more than 800) \nthat are implementing NSRC K-8 programs.\n  The NSRC is striving to further enhance its program activity with a \nnewly developed scientific outreach program introducing communities and \nschool districts to science through literacy initiatives.\n  In addition, through the building of the multicultural Alliance \nInitiative, the Smithsonian's outreach programs seek to develop new \napproaches to enable the public to gain access to Smithsonian \ncollections, research, education, and public programs that reflect the \ndiversity of the American people, including underserved audiences of \nethnic populations and persons with disabilities.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment and \nthank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their \ncourtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together this \nexcellent legislation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Director of the National Park Service to \n     implement, administer, or enforce Policy Memorandum 11-03 or \n     to approve a request by a park superintendent to eliminate \n     the sale in National Parks of water in disposable plastic \n     bottles.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This summer, thousands of Americans will load the kids into the car \nand set out on a trip to visit one of our country's historic national \nparks.\n  Whether it is to see the stunning valleys of the Grand Canyon or the \ntowering stone faces etched into Mt. Rushmore, tens of millions of \nfamilies arrive at national park destinations each year.\n  As some may know, the National Park Service has implemented a policy \nallowing parks to ban the sale of bottled water, and only bottled \nwater, at park concessions. I understand that the Park Service is \nconcerned about waste left behind by visitors. We all agree that \nprotecting our national parks is a laudable goal. However, banning the \nsale of bottled water is not the best way to go about it.\n  In blocking the sale of bottled water at our parks, we are depriving \nmillions of Americans access to a healthy and necessary beverage that \npark visitors rely on. This is especially true in the hot summer \nmonths.\n  Families who don't own expensive camping equipment and aren't \nexperienced hikers and climbers will be surprised to find out that they \ncan't buy their child a bottle of water at one of our national parks. \nNineteen national parks have adopted or plan to adopt a bottled water \nban. This includes the Grand Canyon National Park. Temperatures at the \nGrand Canyon just this week will top 100 degrees. Visitors who may have \nforgotten or have run out of water could be put at risk of dehydration.\n  Banning bottled water defies common sense. Even the Park Service \nadmits that the ban ``could affect visitor safety'' and ``eliminates \nthe healthiest choice for bottled drinks, leaving sugary drinks as a \nprimary alternative.''\n  The policy runs counter to the Park Service's own Healthy Parks \nHealthy People initiative, which urges visitors to make healthy food \nchoices because, remember, bottled water, and only bottled water, is \nbanned from being sold at concessions.\n  Some argue that the ban is necessary to reduce waste. But the \nNational Park Service has confirmed that participating parks haven't \nbeen able to determine if the policy works. To start, we know parks \ndon't separately analyze recycled waste visitors leave behind. Parks \nsimply can't say whether the ban has worked.\n  It is also worth noting that studies conducted on similar water bans \nshow that they aren't effective in reducing waste. A study in the \nAmerican Journal of Public Health found the bottled water bans on \ncollege campuses had unintended consequences. Eliminating bottled water \ndid not, in fact, reduce waste, but actually led to a spike in sales \nand increased shipments of packaged beverages.\n  Mr. Chairman, we all support efforts to protect our parks. All we ask \ntoday is that the National Park Service carefully consider its \npolicies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to work with the gentleman \non this issue because I think he raises some concerns which do need to \nbe addressed.\n  I would just kind of like to set the picture about what is currently \ngoing on right now. There are 407 units in the National Park system, \nand only 19 of them--19 of them--have elected to eliminate the sale of \nwater in disposable plastic bottles.\n\n[[Page H4839]]\n\n  It is important to note that in the National Park system units, \nincluding these 19, visitors are still free to bring water in with them \nand use water in disposable plastic bottles. They are not banned from \nbringing in their own water.\n  The use of these disposable water bottles has had a significant \nenvironmental impact on the National Park system units. That is why I \nwould like to work with the gentleman and figure out what we need to do \nabout waste reduction in our parks and if this was part of the Park's \noverall system on it, and the sugary drinks that the gentleman referred \nto, if those bottles are also a potential problem, or how do we educate \nand work with families and hikers and vacationers and visitors to our \nnational parks about not leaving this waste out in the open.\n  Another example, in Grand Canyon Park, disposable bottles compromise \nnearly 20 percent of the Grand Canyon's waste stream and 30 percent of \nthe park's recyclables.\n  So before eliminating bottle water sales, the National Park system \nunits were required to undertake an extensive review process \nconsidering 14 different factors before seeking approval from the \nregional director. This extensive review process included rigorous \nimpact analysis, including assessment of the effects on visitors' \nhealth and safety.\n  Once approved, these park units are required to maintain an extensive \npublic education program that provides readily available designed water \nbottle refilling stations. And in many places that I visited recently, \nI have seen both the ability to purchase as well as refill, at our \nnational parks, water bottles.\n  So as a leader in conservation, the National Park Service encourages \nrecycling in the reduction of plastic disposable water bottles. My \nconcern would be we wouldn't want your amendment--and I will speak for \nmyself. I don't want to be part of undercutting any of those efforts to \nencourage recycling in the reduction of disposable water bottles.\n  I would also be concerned that the park system eliminated water sales \nwithout having a viable alternative, as the gentleman pointed out, but \nthat does not appear to be the case here. As I noted earlier, there is \nan extensive review process, and these park units are required to offer \nreadily available free water refilling stations. Plus, people are still \nfree to bring in water themselves.\n  I would very much like to work with the gentleman and the chairman to \nsee if there are any refinements or if there is anything that we need \nto know more about what the National Park system's policy on plastic \nwater bottles is. But I do not support an outright prohibition on the \nNational Park Service to be able to carry out a policy that encourages \nthe reuse and the reduction of plastic water bottles in our parks and \nin our Nation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support \nof my colleague from Pennsylvania's amendment.\n  As a nurse, I know the key component of staying healthy is being \nhydrated and drinking plenty of water. However, if you were to be in \none of our Nation's parks, you might find this difficult.\n  Why?\n  Because the National Park Service allows individual parks to ban \nbottled water from their premises. Yet, in those same parks, someone \ncan still purchase soda and other bottled beverages.\n\n                              {time}  2230\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this ban is misguided. While it was created in an \nattempt to reduce litter in the parks, it has, instead, served as a \nprimary example of intrusive government overreach--something this \ncountry certainly needs less of and something my constituents sent me \nhere to Washington to prevent.\n  According to the National Park's Sustainable Practices report, parks \nthat have implemented this ban are not actually reporting any useful \ndata on recycling by type. In other words, they don't know if this ban \nis effectively working or not. Preserving the beauty of our parks is a \nnoble goal and is something we should all care about, but it should not \ncome at the expense of consumer choice.\n  Mr. Chairman, we should support freedom; we should support the beauty \nof our parks; and we should support good, healthy lifestyles for every \nAmerican. However, the current ban in place does none of the above. I \nurge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure as it stops this \nineffective ban.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, to the speakers and to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, I hear the concerns. If there are concerns to be \naddressed, I want to be a partner in that, but I also don't want to be \npart in party of walking back--reducing waste in our streams and not in \nany way, shape or form, adding to the costs of Park Service rangers and \nvolunteers in their having to go out and clean up plastic bottles, \nplastic water caps, and other such things.\n  I am sincere in my efforts in saying I would like very much to work \nwith my colleagues on this issue, but I did not hear anybody saying \nthat they wanted to work back. So, at this point, I will oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment for the convenience of consumers and also in light of the \nfact that studies show that it is not having an impact.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCalvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am more than happy to work with my good \nfriend from Minnesota as we move this process forward.\n  As you know, we talked about this in the budget process with the \nNational Park Service earlier in the year. We, obviously, don't want to \ndiscourage people from drinking water. We want them to stay hydrated. \nThere are also people who work in the bottled water industry, and I \nthink it is a noble industry. We want to encourage people to drink more \nwater. It is not just about bottled water. It is about jobs and about \nthe people who bottle that water.\n  I will work together with the gentlewoman from Minnesota, and we will \nnot deny people water in our national parks. I support this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of bill, before the short title, add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act for \n     the ``DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR--National Park Service--national \n     recreation and preservation'' may be used in contravention of \n     section 320101 of title 54, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise with my appreciation to the \nmanagers of this bill and their staffs; but I also want to thank them \nfor the very civil discussion that occurred earlier by two of my \ncolleagues who offered amendments regarding the exhibition of Civil War \nartifacts, or the rebel flag, and I thank them for their courtesy in \nthose amendments of those individuals.\n  I also make a statement on the floor that I look forward to the \nopportunity given to us by the leadership of this House to have a full \ndiscussion on various entities that did not unify but divide, and I \nthink a civil debate on this is warranted in this House as we watched \nthe very moving and very honest debate that took place in South \nCarolina.\n  My amendment, however, is one that, I hope, is embracing and is a \nshow of unity about what America stands for,\n\n[[Page H4840]]\n\nand that is the National Heritage Area-Corridor designation. I just \nwant to show this map, and I am certainly quite pleased that a number \nof these National Heritage Areas do exist. There are 49 of them--none \nin the State of Texas, none but possibly one in Minnesota, maybe one \nbetween Arizona and California, but very few in the West, including in \nthe State of Idaho, and I can name a number of other States.\n  My amendment is to highlight the value of these national trails. This \nis particularly important because this tells the story of America. 16 \nU.S. Code 461 provides that: ``It is declared that it is a national \npolicy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and \nobjects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the \npeople of the United States.'' Again, I want to emphasize that--the \ninspiration.\n  Texas has, starting in Galveston, history referring to the \nEmancipation Proclamation. We commemorate something called Juneteenth, \nand out of Juneteenth was the time when Captain Granger came to the \nshores of Galveston, in Texas, and announced that the slaves had been \nfreed. However, there are a number of other historic sites following \nthe trail from Galveston through Houston to include Emancipation Park, \nMacGregor Park, and then sites going up through Austin.\n  We really understand that this idea of historic trails can create an \neconomic impact. For example, in 2012, a nationally respected \nconsulting firm completed a comprehensive economic impact of six \nnational historic sites in the northeast region that also included an \nextrapolation of the economic benefit of all 49 NHAs. It was $12.9 \nbillion.\n  The study quantified the economic impact of the individual NHAs and \nbased it upon a case study approach and found that the economic impact \nof three National Historic Areas in Arizona, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania showed: in Massachusetts, $153.8 million in economic \nimpact, 1,832 jobs, and generates $14.3 million in tax revenue; in \nPennsylvania, $21.2 million in economic impact, 314 jobs, and generates \n$1.5 million in tax revenue; in the Yuma Crossing National Heritage \nArea in Arizona, $22.7 million in economic impact, supports 277 jobs, \nand generates $1.3 million in tax revenue.\n  This is, Mr. Chairman, an important and very vital part of America's \nhistory, and as we approach the anniversary of this legislation that \nwas created in 1966, I think it is important to reinforce the ability \nfor these particular sites. We need to increase the ability for \nfeasibility studies; we need the support of legislative action and \ndesignation; and we need to be able to introduce people to the \nimportance of these sites.\n  Let me make very quick mention of the emancipation part. In 1872, in \nHouston, four former slaves raised $800. That would be part of it, but \nI would just simply say that this is a very important part of America's \nhistory.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the creation of a national heritage \nsite across America by supporting the Jackson Lee amendment so that we \ncan expand the 49 sites to other States that do not have one single \nsite, and Texas is one of them.\n  Mr. Chair, Thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the \nJackson Lee amendment and to commend Chairman Calvert and Ranking \nMember McCollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to floor.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Most Americans do not know that this bill also funds a very special \nprogram, the National Recreation and Preservation.\n  Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment is simple but it sends a very \nimportant message from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment provides:\n  Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act for the \n``DEPARTMENT 0F THE INTERIOR--NATIONAL PARK SERVICE--NATIONAL \nRECREATION AND PRESERVATION'' may be used in contravention of section \n461 of title 16, United States Code.\n  And 16 U.S. Code 461 provides that:\n  It is declared that it is a national policy to preserve for public \nuse historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for \nthe inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States.\n  This is important, especially as it relates to National Heritage \nAreas (NHAs).\n  NHAs both preserve our national heritage and provide economic \nbenefits to communities and regions through their commitments to \nheritage conservation and economic development.\n  Through public-private partnerships, NHA entities support historic \npreservation, natural resource conservation, recreation, heritage \ntourism, and educational projects.\n  Leveraging funds and long-term support for projects, NHA partnerships \ngenerate increased economic impact for regions in which they are \nlocated.\n  In 2012, a nationally respected consulting firm (Tripp Umbach) \ncompleted a comprehensive economic impact study of six NHA sites in the \nNortheast Region that also included an extrapolation of the economic \nbenefit of all 49 NHA sites on the national economy.\n  The annual economic impact was estimated to be 12.9 billion.\n  The economic activity supports approximately 148,000 jobs and \ngenerates $1.2 billion annually in Federal revenues from sources such \nas employee compensation, proprietor income, indirect business tax, \nhouseholds, and corporation.\n  The study quantified the economic impacts of individual NHAs based \nupon a case study approach and found that the economic impact of the \nthree National Historic Areas in Arizona, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania showed:\n  1. Essex National Heritage Area (MA) generates $153.8 million in \necononic impact, supports 1,832 jobs, and generates $14.3 million in \ntax revenue.\n  2. Oil Region National Heritage Area (PA) generates $21.2 million in \neconomic impact, supports 314 jobs, and generates $1.5 million tax \nrevenue; and\n  3. Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area (AZ) $22.7 million in \neconomic impact, supports 277 jobs, and generates $1.3 million in tax \nrevenue.\n  Mr. Chair, as I said there are 49 NHA across the nation but, \nsurprisingly, none in my state of Texas.\n  We hope to rectify this in the not too distant future.\n  Texas is the largest and second most populous state in the nation and \nhas a unique story in American history with its diverse geographic \nlandscape, natural resources, and population.\n  From Galveston's port, East Texas' farms and forestry, and the \nBuffalo Soldiers, Texas has a rich multi-cultured heritage and history.\n  To honor Texas' heritage, I will be working with my colleagues to \nestablish a National Heritage Area Corridor designation that stretches \nacross historically significant and landmark sites from Galveston to \nHouston and East Texas into Central Texas.\n  This cultural corridor would focus on historic, cultural and natural \nsites, as well as roadways, businesses, residential and farm districts \nthat unite Texas' rich heritage from the first settlers to modern \ntimes.\n  Mr. Chair, as we approach the anniversary of the passage of the 1966 \nNational Historic Preservation Act, we want to preserve and unite the \nlegacy stories of some of our state's most revered sites.\n  Currently underway in Houston is the revitalization of the historic \nEmancipation Park, a pivotal site in the state's social and cultural \ndevelopment and African American legacy.\n  The future Emancipation Park, if brought to fruition and designated \nas a part of a National Heritage Corridor, represents a unique \nopportunity to tell a comprehensive story about the great State of \nTexas.\n  To conclude, National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are both a good \ninvestment and national treasure providing economic benefits to \ncommunities and regions through their commitment to heritage \nconservation and economic development.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee \nAmendment.\n  I thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their work \nin putting together this legislation.\n\n\nThe Creation of a National Heritage Corridor for Emancipation Park and \n                  Surrounding Historic Sites in Texas:\n\n       I.) Why a National Heritage Corridor:\n       1. Opportunity to share the unique story of Emancipation \n     Park\n       In 1872, four former slaves raised $800.00 to purchase 10 \n     acres of land as a gathering place to celebrate their new \n     found freedom. This land has played a prominent role in \n     America's rich cultural heritage, from slavery, to the false \n     hopes of Emancipation, a safe haven under Jim Crow, a site \n     for mobilization and activism during the Civil Rights \n     movement and will now serve as a local, national and \n     international destination for many years to come for all \n     people for the discussion of modern day race relations and \n     for the celebration and exploration of African American \n     history and culture.\n       2. Link Related Historical Sites to create the Heritage \n     Corridor\n       From the Slave Ships landing in Galveston, to slaves \n     traveling into Ft.

Raises the Profile of the Project for the Capital \n     Campaign\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Weber of Texas\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Section 321(a) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7621(a)).\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a commonsense \namendment to the Interior and EPA Appropriations bill which, I hope, \nall Members can and will support.\n  First, I would like to commend Chairman Calvert for his work on this \nlegislation and for including critical provisions to prevent the EPA \nfrom moving forward on crippling new regulations on our economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, since 2009, our job creators have faced an onslaught of \nregulations from the EPA even as Congress has consistently reduced the \nAgency's budget year after year. The EPA has proposed a regulation to \nlower the national ozone standard, which is largely based on shaky \nscientific data and could cost our economy billions of dollars a year. \nThe EPA has also proposed new regulations on new and existing power \nplants that could substantially increase energy prices for hard-working \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  The Agency has cited its authority to regulate under the Clean Air \nAct as the basis for many of these decisions. However, when it comes to \nevaluating how its regulations impact American jobs, the Agency has \nfailed to follow the law. Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act clearly \nstates: ``The Administrator shall conduct continuing evaluations of \npotential loss or shifts of employment.''\n  Last year, the EPA was sued because of its failure to comply with \nthis provision. Additionally, we heard testimony last month before the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee that further reinforced the \nEPA's failure to evaluate employment impacts as Congress has directed \nunder section 321(a).\n  It is unacceptable for the EPA Administrators to cherry-pick the law \nbased on their own ideological agenda. That is why I have introduced \nthis amendment, which would ensure that the EPA abides by the law and \nconducts ongoing evaluations of just how their actions impact jobs in \nAmerica. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Murphy of Florida\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n   limitation on use of funds to carry out seismic airgun testing or \n                      surveys off coast of florida\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out seismic airgun testing or seismic airgun \n     surveys in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area, the Straits of Florida Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area, or the South Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area located within the exclusive economic zone (as \n     defined in section 107 of title 46, United States Code) \n     bordering the State of Florida.\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Murphy, \nCastor, Jolly, Posey, Clawson, Graham, DeSantis, Ros-Lehtinen, Grayson, \nBuchanan, Hastings, Wilson amendment to block the use of seismic airgun \ntesting off of Florida's coast.\n  As you can see from the list of cosponsors, offshore drilling is not \na partisan issue in our State but an economic issue. Florida is a \nunique place that depends on healthy beaches, clean waters, and a \nsafeguarded environment. The seismic testing that the administration \nhas proposed puts all of these things at risk.\n  First, seismic airgun testing can be harmful to undersea mammals like \nendangered whale species and dolphins, disrupting their ability to \ncommunicate and navigate. It can also have negative effects on sea \nturtles, such as the loggerhead sea turtle, that have key nesting \ngrounds along the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches in the district that \nI am so proud to represent. This testing practice can also disrupt fish \nmigratory patterns that could have significant impacts on fishermen in \nFlorida.\n\n                              {time}  2245\n\n  Second, seismic airgun testing is the first step in the wrong \ndirection to opening our pristine shores to offshore drilling and to \nthe threat of devastating oil spills. Florida has more coastline than \nany other continental State in the United States, and our economy \ndepends on healthy beaches.\n  I was proud when former Governor Jeb Bush and Florida's congressional \ndelegation actually came together and fought to block drilling off \nFlorida's coast, and now I am proud to join my many Florida colleagues \nto block this administration from putting special interests over the \neconomic and environmental needs of our State.\n  Whatever your party, Floridians protect their environmental treasures \nat all costs. As residents on the Gulf Coast are too well aware--and as \nI have seen firsthand myself--oil spills can devastate our environment \nand our economy up and down the coast. Twenty cities throughout Florida \nhave passed resolutions proactively banning seismic testing because \nthey know it is a rotten deal for our State.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this administration has already developed \nthe most restrictive policies for the use of seismic airguns for \noffshore exploration to date. We do not need to place a moratorium on \nthe use.\n  Further, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area is more than 125 \nmiles off the Florida coast, and the South Atlantic Planning Area also \naffects Georgia and South Carolina. So the amendment affects many other \nStates other than his own. Also, the Department of the Interior has \nalready classified the Straits of Florida as a low resource potential \nor low support for potential new listing. As such, I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I certainly do appreciate the \nchairman's hard work on this bill, and many Members of Congress who are \nsupporting this in a bipartisan manner. In Florida, it is pretty clear \nto see, based on the cosponsors of this bill, that this isn't a \npartisan issue.\n  I would like to remind the chairman that regardless of how far \noffshore this is, what really matters is the infrastructure onshore. \nYou could talk about these sites, it doesn't matter how far offshore. \nThe fact is, you are going to have to have infrastructure there onshore \nthat really starts to impede with our economy, whether that is the \nbeaches, whether that is the\n\n[[Page H4842]]\n\ntourism, whether that is the fishing industry. So there is a lot more \nto it. But I do respect the chairman's hard work on this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Murphy).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mrs. Noem\n\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n     limitation on use of funds to close or move fisheries archives\n\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to close or move the D.C. Booth Historic National \n     Fish Hatchery and Archives.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom South Dakota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment to \nprevent the Fish and Wildlife Service from closing fish hatcheries \nacross the United States. I want to thank the chairman and his staff \nfor all their dedication and for preventing the closure of these \nhatcheries in the underlying bill. My amendment only clarifies their \nlanguage to ensure that it prevents closure of hatcheries and archives, \nwhich operate a little bit differently within the hatchery system.\n  For example, the D.C. Booth Historic National Fish Hatchery and \nArchives has been a cornerstone of the community in Spearfish, South \nDakota, with over 150,000 visitors annually. It was originally \nestablished in 1896 to introduce and maintain trout in the Black Hills \nof South Dakota, but it is much more than a fish hatchery. It is home \nto an 1800's era museum, a 1910 railroad car, priceless artifacts, and \neducational opportunities for children. Moving these items would cost \ntaxpayers, which doesn't make any sense, given the tens of thousands of \nvolunteer hours and private funds that are leveraged to run this \nhatchery.\n  I want to thank the chairman for working with me to preserve these \nhatcheries and archives that are certainly of cultural significance. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment to prevent their closure.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. This \namendment is consistent with policy agreed to last year in the \nconference on a bipartisan basis. Fishing is a national pastime, to \nwhich the national fish hatchery plays an important role.\n  Therefore, I support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I urge an \n``aye'' vote.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rouzer\n\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the rule \n     entitled ``Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood \n     Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air \n     Furnaces'' published by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     in the Federal Register on March 16, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 13671 \n     et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, in early March 2015, the Environmental \nProtection Agency published the final rule establishing excessive new \nstandards for wood heaters. This onerous rule is a classic example of \nbureaucratic overreach that has become all too common at the EPA. \nManufacturers in my district, as well as consumers, are very concerned \nabout the negative impacts of these new standards.\n  According to press reports, 10 percent of U.S. households still \nchoose to burn wood to keep energy costs as low as possible. The number \nof households that rely on wood as their primary heating source rose by \nnearly one-third from the year 2005 to 2012.\n  This new rule is of particular concern for rural residents all across \nthis country. Because of this new rule, the cost of manufacturing wood \nheaters would increase substantially, making them unaffordable for \nmany.\n  It is no secret that costs from additional regulations are always \npassed down to the consumers. Several States, in fact, have expressed \ntheir concern on this matter. Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Virginia, \nand my home State of North Carolina have all introduced or passed \nlegislation that prohibits their respective environmental agencies from \nenforcing this burdensome, unnecessary regulation.\n  In defense of all the fine Americans who want to purchase wood \nheaters, my amendment to the Department of the Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act prohibits any funds from being \nused to implement, administer, or enforce these new, unnecessary, and \ncostly standards. Simply put, the Federal Government has no business \ntelling private citizens how they should heat their homes or their \nbusinesses. After all, this is America. If an individual or family \nwants to heat their home or business using a wood stove or furnace, \nthey should be able to do so without paying through the nose.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Congressmen Walter Jones, \nMarkwayne Mullin, Rod Blum, Mark Meadows, Mike Bishop, Sean Duffy, and \nThomas Massie for their support on this amendment.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), \nmy colleague and friend.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina \nfor his leadership on this issue and for yielding the time to me.\n  First, the administration went after coal. Now it is coming after \nwood heat. In March, the EPA finalized a new rule to regulate the type \nof wood burning stoves and boilers that you can buy, forcing millions \nof middle class Americans to pay more to heat their homes.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring this legislation, to stop the \nadministration from enforcing new prohibitions on a renewable, \nabundant, and, dare I say, carbon-neutral method of heating our homes \nthat has been with us for centuries. If it passes, our amendment to the \nEPA funding bill will prohibit the Federal Government from using \ntaxpayer money to enforce crippling regulations on wood burning heating \nappliances.\n  As the price of electricity skyrockets due to the President's promise \nto bankrupt the coal industry, wood heat is a viable alternative for \nmillions of Americans. Unfortunately, it seems like this administration \nwould rather see people turn to the government for public assistance \nwith their heating bills than to allow them an affordable means of \nself-sufficiency.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a State issue. The Federal Government should \nnot be regulating wood burning appliances. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I just rise in support of the amendment. I \nknow the State of North Carolina opposed the rule and passed the \nlegislation a few months ago to block these EPA regulations. I suspect \nit is not the only State that may have these concerns. Let's let the \nmarket drive manufacturers toward producing lower emission wood \nheaters.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote. I hope \nthat everybody who supports this amendment would also vote for the bill \nfor final passage.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n\n[[Page H4843]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hudson\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to remove oil and gas lease sale 260 from \n                            leasing program\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to remove oil and gas lease sale 260 from the Draft \n     Proposed Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing \n     Program for 2017-2022.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that \nprohibits the administration from blocking the proposed Atlantic lease \nsale from the Department of the Interior's draft proposed plan for \noffshore oil and gas development.\n  As cochairman of the Atlantic Offshore Energy Caucus, I have been \nfighting to advance an all-of-the-above energy strategy that gets North \nCarolina into the energy business.\n\n                              {time}  2300\n\n  I was pleased when the administration recently heeded calls from \nMembers of Congress--as well as our fine Governor, Pat McCrory, and \nother State leaders--when they announced a proposal to open up the \nAtlantic to offshore natural gas and oil exploration.\n  I welcome the proposal as one of the many steps that must be taken to \nunlock our natural resources, create jobs, and boost our economy.\n  The problem is we now face bureaucratic hoops and an uphill \nrulemaking process that could take the Atlantic lease sale completely \noff the table. In fact, Secretary Sally Jewell testified recently that \nshe could not guarantee the Atlantic lease would stay in the plan once \nit is finalized.\n  For years, there has been bipartisan support for an offshore lease \nsale off the Atlantic Coast. One was even scheduled off the coast of \nVirginia, but later blocked by this administration.\n  North Carolina has incredible potential for energy jobs, and I won't \nlet this opportunity slip through our fingers.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is critical to provide certainty to North \nCarolina and unleash jobs and lower energy prices. Our economy is \nsputtering along, and too many folks back home are struggling to find \njobs. Opening up the Atlantic to oil has the potential to support more \nthan 55,000 jobs in our State and contribute nearly $3 billion in new \nrevenue.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I am not going to oppose the amendment. I certainly \nappreciate what the gentleman is trying to accomplish and generally \nagree that this administration has placed way too many restrictions on \ndrilling, both onshore and offshore.\n  These restrictions have delayed the permitting process and slowed \neconomic growth in your State and many other States around the Union. \nVarious groups have used that to their advantage.\n  I agree that more certainty is needed in the leasing and permitting \nprocess. What I am afraid of is this might lead to a precedent for \npreempting the Department of the Interior's decisionmaking under any \nPresident, and may lead to other amendments and kind of opening \nPandora's box, and Members doing specific amendments that are off their \nparticular States.\n  Saying that, as we move this process forward, I am not going to \noppose the amendment, but I just have some concerns we can talk about \nas we move this process along.\n  We both want the same outcome. I just want to make sure that we make \nsure this works in an orderly fashion.\n  Mr. HUDSON. I thank the chairman for his comments, and I appreciate \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. This amendment would mandate that the Bureau of Ocean \nEnergy Management include the South and mid-Atlantic area of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, otherwise known as sale 260 in the 2017-2022 lease \nsale schedule.\n  The amendment would undermine the Bureau's fundamental mission to \nmanage the development of offshore resources in an environmentally and \neconomically responsible manner.\n  The Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf is a frontier area, and the \ndecision to include sale 260 in the 2017-2022 5-year leasing schedule \nshould be informed by sound science, using the best available data.\n  The Bureau is required by law to consider the environmental impacts \nof leasing decisions, and this includes a comprehensive programmatic \nenvironmental impact statement, which has not yet been completed for \nthe Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In fact, the most current geological and geophysical data on the oil \nand gas resources in this area was collected in the 1970s and 1980s. \nThat is really ancient by today's scientific standards.\n  Without the collection and analysis of new information, input from \nState Governors and other Federal agencies, and consideration of \ncritical economic analyses, the decision to include sale 260 in the \n2017-2022 program is premature and runs counter to the thoughtful and \ndeliberative process established by Congress through the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act.\n  This amendment would violate multiple environmental statutes, \nincluding NEPA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act.\n  The amendment undermines environmental protection required by law. \nTherefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's comments on the \nsubject.\n  The reason we need this step is to guarantee that the folks in North \nCarolina get a shot at these jobs. We are talking about 55,000 jobs and \npotentially as much as $3 billion in economic development in our State.\n  Frankly, it has been frustrating how hard it has been to get this \nprocess moved forward. If you look at the proposed lease sale, the sale \nis allowed in the fourth year of the 5-year period. Only one sale is \neven allowed. An artificial buffer of 50 miles was inserted into the \nsale.\n  We are getting one sale late in the 5-year period, with a 50-mile \nbuffer, when the old seismic shows that most of that oil and gas is \naround 25 miles out.\n  The ``yes'' that we got from the administration and the fact this \nprocess is even moving forward is good news for North Carolina and the \nother States on the Atlantic Coast; but it is certainly not, in my \nopinion, an appropriate response to the potential we have got there.\n  I agree with the gentlewoman when she said the seismic is old; the \nseismic was done in the late seventies, but this administration has \ncalled for new seismic mapping. I am looking forward to that because, \nagain, we want to use good science.\n  We have given one opportunity pretty far out in the fourth year of a \n5-year period, and I am afraid we are going to lose that because, if \nyou look at the history under this administration, there was a lease \nsale proposed in Virginia and that was taken away.\n  I think, to guarantee that we get at least some shot at unlocking \nthis potential off the coast of getting the American sources of energy \ninto the pipeline, getting North Carolinians to work in these energy \njobs, I think it is important we have this amendment. I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina and his concerns about jobs for his home State, but as a \nMember of\n\n[[Page H4844]]\n\nCongress who also represents the coastal State of Maine, I know the \ndeep concerns that people have about the potential dangers of offshore \noil drilling and the possible dangers to the fisheries, marine mammals, \nand a whole variety of other things. The reason we have this process is \nit is critically important to our State.\n  Mr, Chairman, I continue to oppose this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Loudermilk). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hudson\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to issue, \n     implement, administer, or enforce any regulation of \n     particulate matter emissions from residential barbecues.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that \nwould prohibit the EPA from regulating particulate matter emissions \nfrom residential barbecues.\n  As you may recall, last August, the EPA issued a grant to ``perform \nresearch and develop preventative technology that will reduce fine \nparticulate emissions from residential barbecues.''\n  The EPA gets a lot of things wrong, especially with this preposterous \nstudy. For one thing, ``barbecue'' is a term us southerners use to talk \nabout the best pork in North Carolina or a community pig picking.\n  What they are proposing is reducing emissions from residential \npropane grills, which means they want to stop you and me from grilling \noutside on our own property. By the way, propane is one of the most \nclean and efficient sources of energy out there.\n  Regulations that waste our time, money, and resources are bad as it \nis, but they are trying to go as far as restricting our personal \nfreedom.\n  Mr. Chairman, this grant was met with staunch opposition from \nconservatives and other outdoor enthusiasts like myself. If this isn't \npart of EPA's larger goal of regulating grill emissions, then it begs \nthe question why they are wasting our hard-earned tax dollars on this \nmind-boggling study in the first place.\n  We have seen overreaches by the EPA time and time again, from their \nflawed waters of the USA regulation to their disastrous clean power \nplan that is cap-and-trade by fiat to their new ground level ozone \nregulations that would have a catastrophic impact on manufacturing in \nthis country; but now, they are studying limiting emissions from \nresidential grills. Enough is enough.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is summer, and it is grilling season. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concerns of the Member \nfrom North Carolina, and I will give him credit. They have better \nbarbecue than my home State. We have got you beat on lobsters, but that \nis how it goes.\n  I want to say I think this argument is somewhat cynical and a little \ntoo suspicious of our government; perhaps Republicans have gotten too \nfar down this road.\n  My understanding is this summer, a conservative media outlet ran a \nsensationalized story about EPA's regulatory overreach. The story \nclaimed that EPA has its eyes on pollution from backyard barbecues. The \nproblem with the story and this amendment is that it is based on a \nfalse premise and a mischaracterization of important work.\n  EPA operates a successful and innovative grant program that \nencourages students around the Nation to design solutions for a \nsustainable future. It is called People, Prosperity, and the Planet \nStudent Design Competition for Sustainability. Its purpose is to foster \ninnovation, not to create regulations.\n  The EPA awarded one of these design grants to a group of University \nof California students working to design a system to make barbecues \nburn cleaner and be better for the environment. The students received \n$15,000 from the EPA for the idea. In addition, the university has said \nthe idea has potential for global application.\n  Mr. Chair, in many developing nations, women hunch over traditional \ncook stoves for hours a day, breathing in toxic smoke. Exposure to this \nhousehold air pollution is responsible for low birth weights, childhood \npneumonia, and more than 4 million premature deaths each year.\n  The availability of cleaner cooking technologies could literally be \nlifesaving for many of these women and children. Instead of attacking \nthe EPA for these innovative grants, we should be applauding them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind \ncomments about North Carolina barbecue. I do admit the lobster rolls in \nMaine are pretty good. Maybe we can work out some kind of exchange.\n  The gentlewoman is right. I am guilty as charged. I am cynical and \nsuspicious of the Federal Government, particularly the EPA, when you \nlook at the some of the things they are spending our tax dollars on and \nsome of the rules they are proposing.\n  Let's get serious. We are talking about a $15 million grant to study \nthe emissions of a propane grill in your backyard.\n  Now, we all are concerned about toxic smoke in homes and living \nconditions of individuals--the example that was mentioned--but we are \ntalking about a propane gas grill in your backyard. The EPA has no \nbusiness regulating that. They have spent $15 million of our tax money \nto form a study, which is the first step in a rulemaking process.\n  I think this Chamber needs to say loud and clear to the EPA: focus on \nthe job that the gentlewoman described, focus on the real issues and \nthe mission of the EPA, and keep your hands off our grills in our \nbackyards.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I am happy to have an exchange--North \nCarolina barbecue, Maine lobster. It is probably a pretty fair \nexchange.\n  I just want to clarify. It is $15,000, not $15 million that the EPA \nspent working on this innovation.\n  I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the points that you \nbrought up.\n  Mr. Chairman, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                         forest legacy program\n\n       Sec. __. For ``Department of Agriculture--Forest Service--\n     State and Private Forestry'' for the Forest Legacy program, \n     as authorized by section 1217 of Title XII of the Food, \n     Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. \n     2103c), there is hereby appropriated, and the amount \n     otherwise provided for ``Department of the Interior--Bureau \n     of Land Management--Management of Lands and Resources'' is \n     reduced by, $5,985,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4845]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n                              {time}  2315\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I intend to offer and then withdraw \nthis amendment which will make it easier for land preservation efforts, \nincluding under the Federal Forest Legacy Program.\n  During my time as a local official in Pennsylvania as a Bucks County \ncommissioner, I was proud to lead local efforts to preserve the beauty \nof the countryside and the Bucks County landscape, while advancing \nsmarter development initiatives to reclaim brownfields through \ncommonsense conservation efforts.\n  Along with a task force for that purpose, our community was able to \nexpend approximately $100 million for the preservation of farmland, \nparkland, and critical natural areas, close to about 15,000 acres in \nour one county preserved.\n  Now, as a strong advocate for land preservation in Congress, I \ncontinue to be a supporter of vital conservation programs, including \nthe United States Forest Service's Forest Legacy Program.\n  My amendment today would reallocate $5.9 million from the Bureau of \nLand Management, Management of Lands and Resources, to the Forest \nLegacy Program for the purpose of fully funding two additional \npreservation projects.\n  The Forest Legacy Program is a Federal program that supports and \nencourages State and private efforts to protect environmentally \nsensitive forestlands. The program helps the States develop and carry \nout their forest conservation plans, while encouraging and supporting \nacquisition of conservation easements without removing the property \nfrom private ownership.\n  Most conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable \nforestry practices, and protect other values.\n  The additional funding my amendment provides will allow for the \nprotection of 4,000 acres of Pennsylvania forests in the Northeast \nConnection.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Northeast Connection is a collaboration between the \nPennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and three \ngroups of over 150 families to conserve more than 4,000 contiguous \nforest acres which serve as a natural bridge between the 84,000-acre \nDelaware State Forest, which is managed by the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, and the 77,000-acre Delaware Water Gap National \nRecreation Area, managed by the National Park Service.\n  I believe this project is a crucial objective to preserving \nPennsylvania's and our Nation's natural resources and beauty.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for his hard work on the \nunderlying bill. I look forward to working with the chairman on robust \nfunding for this program.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding me time, \nand I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work with us.\n  We support the Forest Legacy Program, and I pledge to you we will \ncontinue to work with you and other supporters of the program as we \nmove this process along.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I thank the chairman for his desire to provide \nadditional resources, if possible, to the Forest Legacy Program. It is \na great program for our Nation, well utilized by States and local \ncommunities and private landowners. I look forward to working with the \nchairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n           Amendment Offered by Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n    limitation on use of funds to treat northern long-eared bat as \n                           endangered species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or any \n     other agency of the Department of the Interior to treat the \n     northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service has released a final 4(d) rule listing the northern \nlong-eared bat as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act.\n  While certain colonies of the species of bat have seen dramatic \npopulation losses in recent years, Fish and Wildlife has repeatedly \nasserted that the underlying fundamental cause is a fungal disease \nknown as the white-nose syndrome.\n  White-nose syndrome does not directly kill or harm these bats. \nRather, it wakes them out of hibernation, resulting in the bats burning \nthrough stored fat and leaving their hibernacula in search of food when \nnone is often found or available.\n  I am pleased that the underlying legislation contains funding for \nwhite-nose syndrome research. Bats play a critical role in the \necosystem, and more needs to be done in order to restore colonies \ndevastated by white-nose.\n  However, as we allow for necessary habitat conservation, we must also \nensure that activities occurring in the bats' range are not \nunreasonably or unnecessarily impacted as a result of the Endangered \nSpecies Act listing.\n  Specifically, such a listing could have great impacts on forest \nmanagement, forest products, agriculture, energy production, mining, \nand commercial development. Because this species of bat is found in 38 \nStates and Washington, D.C., a listing under the Endangered Species Act \nwould have significant impacts through this enormous geographical \nrange.\n  My amendment is simple. It merely prohibits the Department of the \nInterior, for a period of 1 year, from considering any new rules beyond \nthe final 4(d) rule or any action to treat the northern long-eared bat \nas endangered, which is the most restrictive form of ESA listing.\n  The intention is to ensure reasonable land use within the bats' range \nwhile Fish and Wildlife continues to research and work with the States \non finding treatments for white-nose syndrome.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the Fish \nand Wildlife Service from treating the northern long-eared bat as \nendangered under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern long-eared bat as \nthreatened--threatened--with an interim rule in April of this year. \nSince the bat was listed as threatened and not endangered, this \namendment would have no effect on the Service's implementation of the \nrule.\n  Even though the amendment has no practical effect, I strongly oppose \nits intent, which runs counter to the fundamental principle that \nscience should govern our determinations under our environmental laws.\n  Bats are critically important to the ecosystem, and a study published \nin Science magazine found the value of pest control services provided \nby insect-eating bats in the United States ranges from the low of $3.7 \nbillion to the high of $53 billion a year.\n  Additionally, researchers warn that notable economic losses to North \nAmerican agriculture could occur in the next 4 to 5 years as a result \nof emerging threats to bat populations. Bats play an important role in \nour economy when it comes to eliminating pests.\n  The primary factor threatening the northern long-eared bat is a \nfunctional\n\n[[Page H4846]]\n\ndisease called white-nose syndrome, as has been mentioned. However, \nbecause this disease has reduced populations of the bat, human \nactivities that might not have been significant in the past are now \nhaving a greater effect.\n  It is appropriate that Fish and Wildlife Service is taking steps to \nprotect the species, but we should be supporting the Fish and Wildlife \nService in its efforts. We should be supporting them, not blocking the \nagency from doing its job.\n  So I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman \nfor her perspectives. Certainly, a number of those points I agree \nwith--the value of the bats--as chairman of the Conservation and \nForestry Subcommittee. In agriculture, bats serve a very important \npurpose.\n  I also agree with her premise, although I think her interpretation of \nwhat the science is is somewhat misguided. The science is extremely \nimportant, and the science has shown, in fact, the agency responsible \nfor oversight on the Endangered Species Act has publicly acknowledged, \nthat any job-crushing restrictions on industries related to habitat \nunder an endangered listing with these bats will not help the northern \nlong-eared bats. The threat really is going to an endangered listing \nwhich would do that.\n  I would agree that the Fish and Wildlife Service needs resources and, \nquite frankly, they are getting those. Just last week they released $1 \nmillion toward studying the white-nose syndrome. Within this underlying \nbill, I believe there is an amount of $10 million to study the white-\nnose syndrome. It is a fungus. It is not habitat, and it is not the \nindustries that work within those habitats.\n  And so, quite frankly, we need to give the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwhat they need, and that is the support that they have already, that \nthey released last week through many grants throughout many States, and \nthe underlying $10 million in this underlying bill.\n  I would just ask for support of my amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I read from the amendment:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by \n     Fish and Wildlife or any other service or agency in the \n     Department of the Interior to treat the northern long-eared \n     bat as an endangered species.\n\n  Well, first off, I reiterate again, it is listed as threatened, not \nas endangered. And this amendment doesn't even address the role the \nForest Service would still have. So this is a poorly constructed \namendment.\n  We need to be very, very careful and very thoughtful when we write \nthese amendments and make sure that we not only give Fish and Wildlife \nthe tools that they need, that when something is threatened and not \nendangered, whether it is the Forest Service, Interior, or whether it \nis U.S. Fish and Wildlife, we need to let them do their job based on \nthe science.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do not support the amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species \n     listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Preble's meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body \napproximately 3 inches long, with a 4- to 6-inch tail and large hind \nfeet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives primarily \nin streamside ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern Wyoming \nsouth to Colorado Springs in my district, along the front range of \nColorado. To evade predators, the mouse can jump like a miniature \nkangaroo, up to 18 inches high, using its 6-inch-long whiplike tail as \na rudder to switch directions in midair.\n  But the little acrobat's most famous feat was its leap onto the \nEndangered Species list in May 1998, a move that has hindered \ndevelopment in moist meadows and streamside areas from Colorado \nSprings, Colorado, to Laramie, Wyoming.\n  Among many projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway \nsoutheast of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and \nhousing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument \nCreek. Builders, landowners, and local governments in affected areas \nhave incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of \nthe mouse. Protecting the mouse has even been placed ahead of \nprotecting human life, and let me explain why that is the case.\n  On September 11, 2013, Colorado experienced a major flood event which \ndamaged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and \npublic works projects. And while Colorado has come a long way in \nrebuilding, there remains a lot of work to be done.\n  As a result of the Preble's mouse's listing as an endangered species, \nmany restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In \nfact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated, \n``legally required review may cause some delay in projects undertaken \nin the Preble's mouse habitat.''\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  It goes on to warn that ``local officials who proceed with projects \nwithout adhering to environmental laws risk fines and could lose \nFederal funding for their projects.'' While a waiver was eventually \ngranted, the fact remains that the scientific evidence does not justify \nthese delays or the millions of taxpayer dollars that go toward \nprotecting a rodent that is actually part of a larger group that roams \nthroughout half of the North American continent.\n  Several recent scientific studies have concluded that the Preble's \nmouse does not warrant protection because it isn't a subspecies at all \nand is actually part of the Bear Lodge jumping mouse population. Even \nthe scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has \nsince recanted his work.\n  Moreover, the Preble's mouse has a low conservation priority score, \nmeaning the hundreds of millions of dollars already spent on protection \nefforts could have been better spent on other, more fragile species or \nother uses to accomplish good.\n  The threats that development and transportation allegedly pose to the \nmouse have been greatly overstated. Ample regulations already in place \nminimize the impact of development on this species.\n  My amendment would correct the injustice that has been caused by an \ninaccurate listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse and refocus the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts on species that have been \nthoroughly scientifically vetted and that actually should come under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit Fish and \nWildlife Service from treating the Preble's meadow jumping mouse as \nthreatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and would \nrestrict, again, the Fish and Wildlife Service from offering any of the \ncritical protections to preserve the species.\n  This amendment is in addition to a growing list of anti-Endangered \nSpecies Act provisions, and it makes one wonder if--for the number of \npeople here who are opposing the work that Fish and Wildlife is doing \nunder the Endangered Species Act--if the intent isn't just to do away \nwith the entire act.\n\n[[Page H4847]]\n\n  Last year, Fish and Wildlife reviewed two petitions to delist the \nPreble's meadow jumping mouse and determined that protections under the \nEndangered Species were still necessary.\n  Voting for this amendment might undo a lot of work that was done that \nis well on its way to having this mouse removed from the endangered \nspecies list because this amendment ignores the determination and \nshort-circuits the statutory process informed by science.\n  I would certainly think that a rider on this bill is not the place to \nhave a robust debate about how close we are maybe with Fish and \nWildlife being able to delist this mouse and, by putting this language \nin the bill, that it undoes a lot of potentially good work.\n  It throws out, with this amendment, the carefully science-based work, \nas I said, that the Fish and Wildlife Service has worked towards and \nchips away at the very foundation of the Endangered Species Act, which \nmakes me wonder, as I said earlier, if the intent of many of the \namendments being offered is not only to chip away but to do away with \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, all I will say in response is that this is \na subspecies--actually, it is not even a species or subspecies. It \nshould have never been listed in the first place.\n  The science shows that it is actually part of the Bear Lodge jumping \nmouse population. For that reason, it shouldn't even be on the list in \nthe first place.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman's remarks, this is not \nthe place--as a rider on the environmental appropriations bill--to be \nhaving these thoughtful discussions. If that is what needs to take \nplace, this is not the bill to be doing it on. I mean, we have an \nauthorizing committee. They can hear things on it; and you can have a \nrobust, full, transparent discussion and bring all the scientists in.\n  Let me close with this: I would be really remiss if I did not remind \nmy colleagues that the Endangered Species Act, in fact, did rescue the \nbald eagle. The bald eagle's recovery is an American success story \nbecause we were united in the belief that this was the symbol of our \nNation and was worth protecting for the continuing benefit of future \ngenerations.\n  It feels like we have lost sight of being able to do that today, \nespecially with the lack of transparency and full debate that takes \nplace with all these riders being offered on an authorization bill.\n  Congress needs to give serious consideration of what kind of \nconservation legacy we are leaving for our children, and our children \nwill want us to do a better job than just to put riders onto an \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have one other amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species or \n     endangered species listing of any plant or wildlife that has \n     not undergone a review as required by section 4(c)(2) of the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(2) et \n     seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has to follow section 4(c)(2) of the \nEndangered Species Act by conducting a review of all threatened and \nendangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years. It \nprohibits any funds in the bill from being used to implement or enforce \nthe listing of any plant or wildlife that has not undergone the review \nas required by law.\n  Under the Endangered Species Act, the purpose of a 5-year review is \nto ensure that threatened and endangered species have the appropriate \nlevel of protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered \nspecies to determine whether its status has changed since the time of \nits listing or its last status review and whether it should be removed \nfrom the list, delisted; reclassified from endangered to threatened, \ndownlisted; reclassified from threatened to endangered, uplisted; or \nmaintain its current classification. You can find all this on the Web \nsite of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Because the Endangered Species Act grants extensive protection to a \nspecies, including harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens, \nit makes sense to verify if a plant or animal should be on the list in \nthe first place.\n  Despite this commonsense requirement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has acknowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to \nconduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species.\n  For example, in Florida alone, it was found that 77 species out of a \ntotal of 124 protected species in that State were overdue for a 5-year \nreview. In other words, the government had not followed the law for a \nstaggering 62 percent of species in that State.\n  In California, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged that \nit had failed to follow the law for roughly two-thirds of the State's \nspecies listed under the Endangered Species Act and was forced by the \ncourts to conduct the required reviews of 194 species.\n  By enforcing the 5-year review, which is in current law, my amendment \nwill ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best \navailable scientific information in implementing its responsibilities \nunder the Endangered Species Act, including incorporating new \ninformation through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation \nefforts. These are things we should all be in agreement with.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service follows the Endangered Species Act, that we do not \nprovide money in this bill that would violate current law.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, again, would prohibit the \nFish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the Endangered \nSpecies Act listing for any species that has not undergone a review. \nThis amendment joins a growing list of anti-Endangered Species Act \nprovisions.\n  The amendment would block the listing of any species that does not \nreceive status review by Fish and Wildlife Service every 5 years. Fish \nand Wildlife Service is required to do a 5-year review every 5 years \nafter a species is listed. However, with over 1,500 domestic listed \nspecies, that would amount to over 300 status reviews every year.\n  Why hasn't Fish and Wildlife done it? Well, it is because we--\nCongress--do not provide Fish and Wildlife Service with enough \nresources to complete such a large task.\n  Follow the law? They would love to. In fact, this bill that we are \nconsidering right now includes a 50 percent--a 50 percent--cut in the \nlisting program. Now, how can they follow the law when Congress doesn't \nput any tools in the toolbox allowing them to do their job?\n  I really have to wonder if this House is prepared to appropriate the \nmillions of dollars that would be needed to meet the requirement of \nthis amendment.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service already follows a transparent, science-\nbased listing process. This amendment only seeks to undermine the \nEndangered Species Act because there is not enough money in here that \nCongress provides Fish and Wildlife to do the job in the fashion that \nCongress has asked it to do.\n  In order to list a species under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service follows a strict legal process known as a \nrulemaking procedure. The first step in assessing the\n\n[[Page H4848]]\n\nstatus of the species is the Fish and Wildlife Service publishes a \nnotice of reviews that identify the species that is believed to meet \nthe definition of threatened or endangered. The species are candidates.\n  Now, these notices of review then, the Fish and Wildlife Service goes \nout and seeks biological information to complete the status of the \nreviews for the candidate species; then the Fish and Wildlife Service \npublishes those notices in the Federal Register so the process is \ntransparent to the public.\n  As you can see, the Fish and Wildlife Service follows an open, \ntransparent policy that adequately reviews the species prior to \nlisting. This amendment would exploit a 5-year review backlog that has \nbeen caused in part by this Congress' unwillingness to provide adequate \nfunding in order to attack the endangered species list. Let's be \ntransparent about that.\n  The Endangered Species Act exists to offer necessary protections to \nensure species survival. Quite frankly, the majority of our \nconstituents support that. Let's make sure that science and species \nmanagement practices continue to dictate species listings, not \nCongress; and let's figure out a way to come together, as the gentleman \nsaid, to give Fish and Wildlife the tools that they need in order that \nthey can follow the laws that Congress has requested them to follow and \nnot do a smoke and mirror show about how Fish and Wildlife is refusing \nto follow the law.\n  They can only do what they are able to do with the dollars that \nCongress appropriates to them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am glad that my colleague from Minnesota \nacknowledged that it is required under the law for Fish and Wildlife \nService to do these 5-year reviews. I thank her for admitting that.\n  Their budget is approximately $1.4 billion, and they are able to \nprioritize within that $1.4 billion where they spend their resources. \nIt is not Congress' fault. They just haven't made it a priority. They \nshould make it a priority to follow the law. They can do these few \nhundred reviews every year out of $1.4 billion, I am sure.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Let's require \nthis agency to follow the laws that are on the books.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to be really clear. This bill now \nincludes a 50 percent cut to the listing program. The listing program \nis money that Congress puts in it to do the reviews. Congress cut it by \n50 percent.\n  They can't just transfer money around. We have handcuffed and tied up \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service by the amount of funding that Congress \ngives them to do their job.\n  They don't wake up in the morning and say: We don't want to follow \nthe law.\n  They wake up in the morning, and they see how much Congress has \nappropriated them.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I just want to point out that what you are talking about \nwould be in the future. I am talking about the current status of them \nnot following the law by doing the reviews.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, they do not have the funding.\n\n                              {time}  2345\n\n  Congress has not given them the funding in the listing program to do \ntheir job. Congress needs to be held accountable for the 300 listings \nnot being able to be done every year because Congress has failed to \ngive them the money to do the laws that Congress passed.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Goodlatte\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to take any of \n     the actions described as a ``backstop'' in the December 29, \n     2009, letter from EPA's Regional Administrator to the States \n     in the Watershed and the District of Columbia in response to \n     the development or implementation of a State's watershed \n     implementation and referred to in enclosure B of such letter.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using the \nChesapeake Bay total maximum daily load and the Watershed \nImplementation Plans to take over States' water quality strategies, \nprotecting the 10th Amendment rights of States across the Nation from \nthe heavy hand of the EPA. This amendment makes it clear that Congress \nintended for the Clean Water Act to be State led, not subject to the \nwhims of politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\n  Over the last several years, the EPA has implemented a total maximum \ndaily load plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed which strictly limits \nthe amount of nutrients that can enter the Chesapeake Bay. While a \nlaudable goal and one I support in principle, through its \nimplementation, the EPA has basically given every State in the \nwatershed an ultimatum--either the State does exactly what the EPA \nsays, or it faces the threat of an EPA takeover of their water quality \nprograms. In some cases, the EPA will even rewrite the States' water \nquality plans if they disagree with the States' decisions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to make it perfectly clear that this amendment \nwould not stop the EPA from working with the States to restore the \nChesapeake Bay, nor would it in any way undermine the cleanup efforts \nalready underway. I repeat, our amendment does not stop the TMDL or \nwatershed implementation plans from moving forward, and it does not \nprevent the EPA from working cooperatively with the States to help \nrestore the Chesapeake Bay.\n  This amendment is very carefully crafted to address the 10th \nAmendment federalism issues that the EPA is encroaching upon and does \nnot address the States' laudable goals of continuing to improve the \nhealth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The States should be able to use any resources the EPA may have \navailable to help develop and implement a strategy to restore the Bay. \nThis amendment only stops the ability of the EPA to step in and take \nover a State's plan--again, ensuring states' rights remain intact and \nnot usurped by the EPA.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Bay is a national treasure, and I want to see it \nrestored. But we know that in order to achieve this goal, the States \nand the EPA must work together. The EPA cannot be allowed to railroad \nthe States and micromanage the process.\n  With this amendment, we are simply telling the EPA to respect the \nimportant role States play in implementing the Clean Water Act and help \nprevent another Federal power grab by the administration.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I certainly agree with the amendment, and I urge \nadoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, here we go again, yet another fix in \nsearch of a problem.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to Mr. Goodlatte's amendment. It \nwould deliberately undermine the crucial work that is already being \ndone to rehabilitate the Chesapeake Bay. It would also undermine the \nhistoric Federal-State partnership that has done so much already to \nimprove the quality of the Bay and its surroundings.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. It is the \nNation's\n\n[[Page H4849]]\n\nlargest estuary. It benefits all Americans, and especially those living \nin the six States that comprise the Bay watershed: Maryland, Virginia, \nWest Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and the District of \nColumbia.\n  The States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including the gentleman's \nown home State of Virginia, have been working together for over 40 \nyears to clean up the Bay. And guess what, Mr. Chairman? It is working.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program's most recent interim report shows that \ntremendous progress has been made. States are meeting the pollution \nreduction goals in their plans. In fact, some are exceeding them. \nStudies show that so-called ``dead zones'' are shrinking, and key \npopulations such as oysters are starting to rebound.\n  Under the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, States develop and \nimplement their own pollution reduction plans. The EPA set up an \ninitial framework, but the details of how each State chooses to reach \nthe targets, in fact, are State-driven and State-implemented. My own \nhome State of Maryland has created a plan to reduce its nitrogen levels \nby 46 percent, phosphorus by 48 percent, and sediment by 28 percent \nbelow the benchmark 1985 levels.\n  Of course, each of the Bay watershed States depends on the other \nStates to implement these plans simultaneously and in good faith. After \nall, Mr. Chairman, watersheds don't stop at the State borders, and the \nkind of go-it-alone approach that seems to be advocated by the majority \nhas never worked for environmental issues, and it will not work to \npreserve and to save the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Failure, for example, by one State to do its part threatens the work \nand hundreds of millions of dollars that all the other States have \ninvested in their plans. I don't want to see Maryland's work \njeopardized because another State in the watershed doesn't meet its \nresponsibilities. And only the EPA can stand as the arbiter to make \nsure that that is true.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, as a safety measure against that kind of bad faith \nby one of the partners, the EPA has backstop actions that it can take \nto ensure that the other States' investments are preserved. These \nbackstop actions are not new authorities, but they are existing \nauthorities that the EPA can use to make the needed pollution \nreductions. That has been part of the partnership for 40 years.\n  In fact, just yesterday, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in \nPhiladelphia unanimously affirmed the EPA's authority to place \nrestrictions on wastewater treatment and runoff by farms and \nconstruction. The EPA places limits on the amount of nitrogen, \nphosphorus, and sediment that are allowed in the watershed and, thus, \ninto the Bay. This is known as the total maximum daily load, or TMDL, \nof chemical runoff that the Bay's watershed can handle while still \nmeeting water quality standards.\n  The court in its decision strongly affirmed that ``the States and EPA \ncould, working together, best allocate the benefits and burdens of \nlowering pollution.'' It is, in fact, an acknowledgment that this is a \npartnership that requires the full participation of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Mr. Chairman, the goal of the partnership is not just an \nenvironmental one. According to a peer-reviewed report by the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation, the economic impact of full implementation \nof the Clean Water Blueprint is more than $22 billion annually. Yet \nthis amendment by one of Virginia's own Members actually threatens that \npartnership by barring the EPA from using funds to take any backstop \nactions. It would allow one State to break its agreement and cease \nimplementing the plan.\n\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from Maryland's time has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the \npertinent subcommittee in the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. \nGoodlatte's amendment.\n  Since 2009, I have been hearing directly from my constituents--many \nof who are small farmers--about the significant challenges and costs of \nthe Chesapeake Bay total maximum daily load mandate. These significant \nconcerns also extend to the State and local governments because of the \nbillions of dollars in direct costs and new regulatory burdens that \nTMDL imposes. No doubt the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, but \nit is quickly becoming the national treasury with all these costs and \ntaxes upon our States and local municipalities.\n  The Agriculture Committee's Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, \nwhich I have the honor of chairing, has also heard directly from the \nstakeholders over the past few Congresses.\n  While each and every one of these witnesses wholeheartedly supports \nthe restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, there remains great concern over \nthe lack of consistent models, the heavy-handed approach of TMDL, and \nthe lack of needed flexibility while implementing the WIPs. This \namendment is needed in order to allow for that flexibility at the State \nand local levels.\n  Pennsylvania has been very innovative in our efforts to do our part \nwith the Bay restoration, and that innovation will continue into the \nfuture.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield the gentleman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman.\n  However, rather than acting punitively, EPA must work collaboratively \nwith the States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. He is \nquite right. This is very costly for the States. The State of Virginia \nhas estimated a cost of over $16 billion to comply with the backstop \nrequirements of the EPA. That is just one of the six States.\n  Secondly, the EPA has been asked repeatedly, including in hearings \nconducted by the gentleman from Pennsylvania in his subcommittee and at \nmy request and the request of others, to do a cost-benefit analysis to \nshow us that the multi-tens of billions of dollars that these six \nStates will collectively spend will be reflected in improvements to the \nquality of the Chesapeake Bay. They have never provided that cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentlewoman from Maryland, \nshe also is quite right that tremendous progress has been made in \nimproving the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but almost all of it prior \nto the President taking his pen and signing the executive order that \ncontains this backstop language that we need to stop and return the \npower to the State and local governments.\n  Sedimentation, phosphorus, and nitrogen are all down more than 40 \npercent--sedimentation more than 50 percent going into the Bay. The Bay \nis improving in its health because of the work done by the States. They \nshould have the authority to do this without having the EPA hold a gun \nto their head.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why this amendment should be passed, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. McCollum for her work on this \nbill and to Bobby Scott and Don Beyer for joining me in this effort. I \nrise in opposition to this amendment.\n  Just yesterday, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld EPA authority \nto set Chesapeake Bay pollution limits, which have led to the best \ncleanup progress in over 25 years. For the Bay, as with so many other \nwaters across the country, the Clean Water Act backstop is critical to \nensure that states are meeting their commitments.\n  In Maryland, we have cities working to manage stormwater and farmers \nimplementing best management practices to stop runoff. But for all our \nefforts, we will never have a clean and healthy Bay if pollution runs \ndownstream from Pennsylvania, New York, or West Virginia.\n  With our enormous watershed, encompassing 64,000 square miles, six \nStates, and\n\n[[Page H4850]]\n\nD.C., everyone must do their fair share. And to do that is through the \nClean Water Act's Federal backstop. I strongly oppose this amendment \nand urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maryland \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Black\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize, \n     implement, administer, or enforce section 1037.601(a)(1) of \n     title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as proposed to be \n     revised under the proposed rule entitled ``Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and \n     Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles - Phase 2'' signed by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on June \n     19, 2015 (Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0827), or any rule of \n     the same substance, with respect to glider kits and glider \n     vehicles (as defined in section 1037.801 of title 40, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as proposed to be revised under such \n     proposed rule).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nprotect Tennessee workers and small manufacturing businesses from the \nEPA's latest overreach.\n  Last month, the EPA released its Phase 2 fuel-efficiency and \nemissions standards for new medium-and heavy-duty trucks.\n  While many in the trucking industry are not opposed to this rule as a \nwhole, one section in the proposal wrongly applies these new standards \nto what is known as glider kits.\n  I recently toured a business in my district that manufactures these \nkits. For those who don't know, a glider kit is a group of truck parts \nthat can include a brand-new frame, cab, or axles, but does not include \nan engine or transmission.\n  Since a glider kit is less expensive than buying a new truck and can \nextend the working life of a truck, businesses and drivers with damaged \nor older vehicles may choose to purchase one of these kits instead of \nbuying a completely new vehicle.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA is proposing to apply the new Phase 2 \nstandards to glider kits, even though the gliders are not really new \nvehicles.\n  Mr. Chairman, this directly impacts my district where we have glider \nkits being manufactured and purchased by companies in places like \nByrdstown, Sparta, and Jamestown, communities that are already \nstruggling with an above average unemployment and would see job \nopportunities put further out of reach if this misguided rule goes into \neffect.\n  It is also unclear whether the EPA even has the authority to regulate \nreplacement parts like gliders in the first place.\n  Once more, while the EPA's stated goal with Phase 2 is to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, the Agency has not studied the emissions \nimpact of remanufactured engines and gliders compared to new vehicles.\n  Mr. Chairman, if the EPA is going to promulgate rules that raise \ncosts and hurt jobs in districts like mine, the least they could do is \nto have a few facts prepared to back them up.\n  Under this ill-advised rule, businesses and drivers that wish to use \nglider kits would be effectively forced to buy a completely new vehicle \ninstead. Reducing glider sales would also end up limiting consumer \nchoice in the marketplace.\n  That is why my amendment protects businesses, jobs, and consumers by \nprohibiting the EPA from moving forward with this Phase 2 standard on \nglider kits.\n  To be clear, this amendment would not--would not--bar the EPA from \nimplementing the whole Phase 2 rule for new medium- and heavy-duty \ntrucks. It would simply clarify that glider kits and glider vehicles \nare not new trucks as the EPA wrongly claims.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to help \nsupport American manufacturing and stop the EPA from attempting to shut \ndown the glider industry.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. BLACK. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  It is my understanding that the proposed rule is supported broadly by \nmany in the trucking manufacturing industry, so for that reason, I \nsupport her amendment.\n  However, as with any rule, there are some specifics that we need to \niron out. I would like to work with my colleague and with EPA to see if \nwe can't resolve those specifics between now and the final rule.\n  In the meantime, I support including language in the Interior bill, \nand I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that the discussion that the \nsubcommittee chair and the author of the amendment might prove \nsomething better than what this amendment is currently in front of us, \nbut what I have to work on is what is currently in front of me.\n  Just over 2 weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nNational Highway Safety Traffic Administration issued proposed fuel \nefficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks required by the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act.\n  This amendment would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing, \nand administering or enforcing this proposed rule or any future rules--\nso this is where I am concerned about the way this amendment is moving \nforward--with respect to glider vehicles.\n  These new standards were designed to improve fuel efficiency, cut \ncarbon pollution, and reduce the impacts of climate change. To be \nspecific, these standards are expected to lower CO2 \nemissions by roughly 1 billion metric tons, cut fuel costs by $170 \nmillion, and reduce oil consumption up to 1.8 billion barrels over the \nlifetime if a vehicle is sold under this program.\n  Heavy trucks account for 5 percent of the vehicles on the road; yet \nthey create 20 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions created by all \ntransportation sectors.\n  We know from my colleagues that this amendment does not actually \nsuspend all aspects of the new rule. As it was pointed out, it simply \ncarves out an exemption for one particular industry, an industry that \nproduces what has been called, today, glider vehicles.\n  As has been pointed out, glider vehicles are heavy-duty vehicles that \nreplace older remanufactured engines on new truck chassis. These \nengines date back to 2001 or older, and they have emissions that are 20 \nto 40 times higher than today's clean diesel engines.\n  In essence, this amendment would allow an entire segment of the truck \nmanufacturing industry to simply avoid compliance with the new criteria \npollutant standards that are in the rule. These are engines that will \ncontinue to emit greenhouse gases, slow down our progress, and reduce \nthe impacts of climate change.\n  In short, this amendment creates a loophole that you could drive a \ntruck through by allowing dirty engines to continue to pollute our \nenvironment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I want to once again reiterate that this is \na very narrow amendment. It does not apply to new trucks, as the EPA \nrule indicates.\n  I also want to reiterate one more time that they have not studied the \nemissions impact of these remanufactured engines and the gliders \ncompared to new vehicles, so we would like to have that information as \nwell.\n\n[[Page H4851]]\n\n  I also want to add that the military also uses glider kits, and this \nrule would not apply to them. Once again, we are putting into place \nsomething where we say this is what the government can do, but this is \nwhat the private sector can do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Mica\n\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement Alternative A, Alternative C, or \n     Alternative D, described in the Final General Management Plan \n     and Environmental Impact Statement for Castillo de San Marcos \n     National Monument in St. Augustine, Florida, for the \n     educational center authorized by Public Law 108-480 nor shall \n     funds be expended for a new General Management Plan other \n     than the General Management Plan approved by record of \n     decision published in the Federal Register September 10, \n     2007.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, every year, nearly 1.5 million visitors come \nto the Castillo de San Marcos and Fort Matanzas National Monuments in \nAmerica's oldest city, St. Augustine, Florida.\n  Way back some 11 years ago, in December of 2004, I passed legislation \nauthorizing a visitors center for Castillo de San Marcos, which was \nsigned into law. The Castillo fortress is the largest intact Spanish \nfortress in the continental United States, with construction that was \ncompleted in 1695.\n  After the authorization was signed into law, significant, thorough, \ncostly, and time-consuming studies and reports were completed after \nmany reviews, hearings, and public forums.\n  Then in 2007, 3 years later, the National Park Service came up with a \nfinal general management plan. This plan developed four alternatives. \nOne was to do nothing; that was A. Two others, C and D, were to \npossibly build on land that will no longer be available that was going \nto be made available by the State and the city. That leaves one \nalternative. Now, this is a very simple, clarifying amendment.\n  Alternative B is the one that we would like funds spent on. Here, we \nare saying no funds shall be spent to do nothing; no funds will be \nspent or wasted to go towards a project that isn't going to happen.\n  This is a simple, clarifying, limiting amendment. It would \nspecifically limit funds from being expended on any alternative, except \nfor B, which is in the plan, been in the plan. It doesn't say that we \nhave to do another plan; why spend more taxpayer moneys to do another \nplan? That is all it says.\n  It is a simple thing to get us moving to proceed with the final \ndesign without further cost and further delaying the process. A \nvisitors center at Castillo is long overdue, and it is overdue on St. \nAugustine's 450th founding anniversary, so I urge its passage.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MICA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman from \nFlorida raising this issue. I always learn new facts when we have these \ndebates. I didn't know that St. Augustine was the Nation's oldest city. \nI always thought it was Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n  Mr. MICA. Some people are under the misconception of Williamsburg.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I know; but I have learned something today.\n  I certainly commend the gentleman's longstanding interest in this. I \nknow you have been working on this for a number of years. The Castillo \nde San Marcos National Monument in St. Augustine needs a new visitors \ncenter.\n  I certainly look forward to working with you as we move this issue \nforward, and we certainly have no objection to this amendment.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Burgess\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to hire or pay the salary of any officer or employee \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency under subsection (f) \n     or (g) of section 207 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 209) who is not already receiving pay under either \n     such subsection on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the subcommittee chairman for his \nindulgence at this late hour.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an issue that has been under investigation by \nthe Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee for over the last 6 years.\n  In 2006, without consultation from the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nthere was included a provision in the annual Interior, EPA \nappropriations bill that allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to \nbegin using a special pay program that was explicitly and exclusively \nauthorized for use by the Public Health Service administration under \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This special pay mechanism allows a government employee to leave the \nnormal GS pay scale and receive nearly uncapped compensation, upwards \nof $200,000 to $300,000 per year.\n  This special provision was intended to be used only in unique \ncircumstances where, perhaps, leaders of the healthcare industry would \nnot be able to work for the Federal Government because of pay \nconsiderations if they did not have access to these higher salaries.\n  This justification cannot be used for anyone at the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Indeed, some of the employees that the Environmental \nProtection Agency pays under title 42, the part of the U.S. Code that \nallows for this special pay, were previous government workers and were \nmerely moved to this special pay scale because they wanted additional \nmoney.\n\n                              {time}  0015\n\n  The EPA claims that, because the Environmental Protection Agency is a \nhealth organization, it may use this statute to pay special hires, and \nthis, in fact, has endured for several years. Originally, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency was granted only a handful of slots to \nfill with title 42 hires. That number is now over 50. The cost to \ntaxpayers for these 50 employees is in the tens of millions of dollars.\n  This amendment would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from \nhiring any new employees under title 42 or from transferring current \nemployees from the GS pay scale to title 42. It would not affect \ncurrent employees being paid by this provision. It would give the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, the authorizing committee, the time it \nneeds to address whether the Environmental Protection Agency truly \ndeserves this special pay consideration. The General Accountability \nOffice looked into the abuse of title 42 several years ago and found \nnumerous problems with the implementation of the program. Why we would \nallow this problematic pay structure to be advanced by the EPA is, in \nfact, mysterious.\n  In multiple hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, both \nAdministrator Lisa Jackson and current Administrator Gina McCarthy \nrefused to give specifics regarding this program. A Freedom of \nInformation Act request sent to my office by the EPA union, the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, showed that title 42 hires \nat the EPA are actually sowing the seeds of discontent amongst workers, \nwith the union asking the Congress to stop this unfair hiring \ntechnique.\n\n[[Page H4852]]\n\n  Both former Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Barton and I have \nintroduced legislation further clarifying that the Public Health \nServices Act, written for the Department of Health and Human Services, \ndoes not permit the Environmental Protection Agency to use its language \nto hire employees under a special pay structure. This amendment \nprevents further abuses of the program, and I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the EPA is one of several government \nagencies that uses a special authority to hire Federal employees with \nspecific scientific research credentials. In fact, when the Republicans \nwere the majority party in 2006, they started this program. The EPA \ndidn't start this program on its own. Congress started it in 2006 under \na Republican majority. The National Institutes of Health uses title 42 \nmoney and authority to attract top-tier scientists in their fields to \ndo important research.\n  We have been listening to many hours this evening of many of my \nRepublican colleagues criticizing the EPA's scientific conclusions. So \nnow it amazes me that the gentleman wants to reduce the Agency's \nability to hire the top scientists. Further, the National Academy of \nSciences has favorably reported to the committee that the EPA is \neffectively utilizing its title 42 authority. If a scientist retires or \nmoves on, the Agency would no longer be able to attract a suitable \nreplacement if this amendment were to pass.\n  For those who think the EPA doesn't have adequate scientific basis \nfor its regulations, they should be with me, and they should clearly \nvote against this amendment. We should be doing more to ensure that our \nenvironmental policies are being set by the best and the brightest. \nThis amendment would ensure that the EPA can't recruit new scientists \nusing its limited title 42 authority, which was given to them, to the \nEPA, in 2006 by a Republican Congress.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment. It is \nclear that this program does need the scrutiny of the authorizing \ncommittee. We are prepared to do that if this amendment passes.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Westmoreland\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to pay legal fees pursuant to a settlement in any \n     case, in which the Federal Government is a party, that arises \n     under--\n       (1) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       (2) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \n     et seq.); or\n       (3) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, the United States is facing a crisis \nof executive overreach, and nowhere else is this more true than with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's escalation of sue and \nsettle cases to change the law through Federal court rulings threatens \nour economy and the ability to create jobs, not to mention bypassing \nthe normal rulemaking process. By operating hand in hand with radical \nenvironmental groups that are willing participants in these types of \nactions, the EPA's use of sue and settle not only endangers the economy \nbut also our constitutional separation of powers.\n  Here is how it works:\n  An organization sues the EPA or an agency such as the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife, demanding that the agency apply the law in a new, unintended, \nand expanded way that increases the agency's jurisdiction. The agency, \nrather than defending the law, enters into a consent decree with the \nparty who filed the original lawsuit. A judge then signs the consent \ndecree without significant review since the two disputing parties are \nin agreement. Suddenly, the agency has new, expansive powers to wield \nagainst job creators in the form of a legally binding settlement that \ncreates rules and priorities outside of the normal rulemaking process. \nBetween 2009 and 2012, the EPA chose not to defend itself in over 60 of \nthese lawsuits from special interest advocacy groups. Those 60 lawsuits \nresulted in settlement agreements and in the EPA's publishing more than \n100 new regulations.\n  Also included in these legally binding settlements are requirements \nthat U.S. taxpayers must pay for the attorneys of the organization that \ninitiated the action. According to a 2011 GAO report, between 1995 and \n2010, three large environmental activist groups, like the Sierra Club, \nreceived almost $6 million in attorneys' fees alone. An example of sue \nand settle occurred with a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction rule. \nThis was in response to a sue and settle agreement the EPA made with \nthe Sierra Club in 2011.\n  As noted by Louisiana Senator David Vitter in a letter to EPA \nAdministrator Gina McCarthy in 2013:\n\n       Instead of defending the EPA's own regulations and the SSM \n     provisions in the EPA-approved air programs of 39 States, the \n     EPA simply agreed to include an obligation to respond to the \n     petition in the settlement of an entirely separate lawsuit.\n\n  Sue and settle is made possible because, under the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, potential litigants \nare given broad standing to go to court because Congress has defined \ncauses of action under these laws. Under my amendment, no funds can be \nused to pay legal fees under any settlement regarding any case arising \nunder the three acts I mentioned--period, case closed, end of story. \nLitigants can still sue, but they will no longer be financially \nrewarded by the American taxpayer for their efforts.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport this amendment to reduce the secretive transfer of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars to other organizations. By restricting Federal \nagencies from having the ability to pay attorneys' fees, we will not \nonly reduce Federal spending but also reduce the incentive for these \nself-interest groups to continue suing the Federal Government and \ntaking American taxpayer dollars that could be used to reduce our \nFederal deficit.\n  It is inexcusable to require taxpayers to pay the legal bills of \nenvironmental groups to collude with the EPA in order to expand the \nAgency's abilities. This is one way Congress can fight the expansion of \nexecutive powers by this administration and its most out-of-control \nagency. With this amendment, Congress can ensure taxpayers are \nprotected from funding the legal efforts of environmental advocacy \norganizations and from arming the EPA with draconian enforcement \npowers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the Equal Access to Justice Act is the \nlaw of the land. Within limits, it does allow for the Federal payment \nof legal fees to individuals and small businesses and nonprofits that \nare the prevailing parties in actions against Federal agencies unless \nthe agency is able to show that the action was substantially justified \nor a special circumstance existed to make the award unjust. This law \nhelps to deter government misconduct, and it encourages all parties, \nnot just those with resources, to hire legal counsel to assert their \nrights.\n  I know that my colleagues, including my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, will agree with me that the ability to challenge Federal \nactions is the most important tool for ensuring government \naccountability. The Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct, and the Endangered Species Act are also the law of the land, and \nthese laws have contributed greatly to the protection and improvement \nof public health in this country. A study by a nonpartisan \nenvironmental law institute found that the Equal Access to\n\n[[Page H4853]]\n\nJustice Act has been cost-effective and only applies to meritorious \nlitigation, and existing legal safeguards and the independent \ndiscretion of Federal judges will continue to ensure its prudent \napplication. There are safeguards in place so that this can't be \nmisused.\n  Moreover, the claim that large environmental groups are getting rich \non attorneys' fees is not supported by available evidence. The 2011 GAO \nstudy, which was just referenced and was at the request of the House \nRepublicans, brought cases against the EPA. They found that most of \nthose suits were brought by trade associations and private companies \nand that attorneys' fees were only awarded about 8 percent of the time; \nand among the environmental plaintiffs, the majority of those cases \nwere brought by local groups rather than by national groups.\n  It is completely unfair to target these important environmental \nsafeguards for removal from the protection of the Equal Access to \nJustice Act. More importantly, this amendment would have serious \nconsequences for public health. In order for our Nation's environmental \nsafeguards to work properly and ensure the protection of public health, \ncitizens, including those with limited means, must have the ability to \nchallenge Federal actions. This amendment is clearly designed to make \nit more difficult for regular citizens to ensure the accountability of \nthe Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, this does not prevent anybody from \nsuing. This stops the EPA from this sue and settle--what I would call \n``scam''--where it allows the groups or companies or whatever to come \nin and sue and allow them--I mentioned there were 60 different cases--\nthe ability to make 100 new rulings that did not go through the normal \nrulemaking procedure but were done by court rulings.\n  I think it is appropriate that we not allow taxpayer dollars to be \nspent on these attorneys' fees that are being used to do this--to \npromote the Environmental Protection Agency. Rather than going through \nthe regular rulemaking process, it is doing it by a court ruling.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the Equal Access to Justice Act is the \nlaw of the land. It allows for the Federal payment of legal fees, \nwithin limits, to individuals and small businesses and nonprofits which \nare the prevailing parties in actions against the Federal Government.\n  Again, we should be mindful of the 2011 GAO study that said, in cases \nbrought against the EPA, it found that most suits were brought by trade \nassociations and private companies and that attorneys' fees were only \nawarded in about 8 percent of the cases.\n  Citizens need to be able to hold their government accountable. They \nneed to be able to petition their government, and that means a citizen \nwith limited means. If that citizen wins and if the judge decides that \nit is just to award the costs, then that is the law of the land, which \nI support. Private citizens, regular citizens--citizens without means--\ncan ensure that there is full accountability of the Federal Government \nto them. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. As I would like to repeat, Mr. Chairman, this does \nnot keep anybody from suing. The intent of this amendment is to keep \nthe EPA from creating rules by judicial bodies rather than a normal \nrulemaking procedure.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rokita\n\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n  enforcement of the endangered species act regarding certain mussels\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     enforce the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.) with respect to the Clubshell, Fanshell, Rabbitsfoot, \n     Rayed Bean, Sheepnose, or Snuffbox mussels.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nIndiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Calvert for \nmanaging the time tonight and for getting us to this point.\n  By my calculation, it has been 5 years since we have been able to \nhave these kind of debates on the floor of the House, and here we are, \nat 12:30 at night.\n  Speaking for myself, I have listened to the entire debate here \ntonight on the floor, starting with votes after 6:30. Mr. Chairman, I \nwas struck by the amount of amendments having to do with the Endangered \nSpecies Act, number one; and, number two, having to deal with the \nlists, whether threatened or endangered lists of Endangered Species \nAct.\n  Clearly--and I would agree with the gentlewoman on the other side of \nthe aisle on this--reform and major reform of the Endangered Species \nAct is needed. That will take some time. That discussion has been \nongoing.\n  It is nothing that hasn't already started in this Congress or in \nprevious Congresses. I look forward to being a part of that solution in \na very constructive way.\n  What about the near term? We have people, human constituents who are \nreally suffering; and that is what my amendment, Mr. Chairman, is about \ntonight. Summer is a big time for any industry that depends on tourism \nto survive. I offer this amendment out of concern for two lake \ncommunities in my district.\n  Just last year, during the height of the summer's busy tourist \nseason, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service required that the \nNorthern Indiana Public Service Company, locally known as NIPSCO, \nrelease more water into the Tippecanoe River from Lake Freeman to \nprotect a bed of endangered freshwater mussels that live further down \nthe Tippecanoe River, all under the guise of the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  As a result, in a matter of days, water levels on Lake Freeman \ndropped dramatically. I have visited with local residents near Lake \nFreeman multiple times and have seen the lake in person. Growing up \nduring the summers, I spent my time on the sister lake, Lake Shafer.\n  Many who live and work near the lake discovered, to their surprise, \ntheir boats were stuck, businesses were in jeopardy, and home values \nwere going down; but more than that, stumps were rising out of the \nwater, and personal health and safety were also in jeopardy as a \nresult.\n  Now, I immediately contacted Fish and Wildlife, and I want to applaud \nthem for their responsiveness and NIPSCO for working together. We \ncreated a technical assistance letter, otherwise known as a TAL. It is \nmy estimation that that is going to have some effect. Again, I \nappreciate the reasonableness of all involved.\n  The current plan there is a temporary fix, and really, we ought to be \nable to do more. Now, currently, Fish and Wildlife receives funding to \nenforce the Endangered Species Act, which protects six species of \nmussels that live in the river, as the Clerk mentioned as he read the \namendment.\n  The Endangered Species Act gives the highest priority to protected \nand listed species, and there is little anyone can do in terms of \nexceptions or exemptions or even any kind of balancing test to make \nsure that there is not a solution that could be a win-win. It is a very \ndraconian law--strict compliance, no balancing test, no room for \ndiscretion or creative solution. That is where this reform is needed.\n  The statute, like I said, provides no balancing test for weighing the \neconomic harms, and the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page H4854]]\n\nof this land has refused to allow us or even lower courts to construct \ntheir own test, us as citizens. Compliance with this law, as currently \nwritten, requires diverting water from Lake Freeman to the Tippecanoe \nRiver to balance water levels, despite consideration of the economic \nimpact and human safety.\n  In essence, my amendment limits the funding mechanism Fish and \nWildlife would be able to use to enforce the Endangered Species Act \nwith respect to these six types of mussels and eliminates the financial \nrepercussions for failing to enforce the law.\n  Speaking firsthand with residents, lowering these water levels in \nLake Freeman negatively affects the community and small businesses that \nrely on the tourists who enjoy the lake and the steady water level. \nLower water levels also pose dangerous swimming conditions to both \nboaters and swimmers as formerly underwater tree stumps breach the \nwater. This is unnecessary and a preventable hazard to those who use \nthe lake and, again, in a win-win way.\n  It is all because of this draconian law that, although well intended, \nis badly in need of reform so that its practical effect can be \noverhauled and any of its misguided applications halted.\n  Hoosiers, like myself, are just as concerned for the environment as \nthey are for their incomes and family recreation. It is not about \nantienvironmentalism, but they believe, like I said, there is a win-win \nsolution here, if only the law would allow such a solution to exist. In \nthe meantime, we ought to defund Fish and Wildlife's ability to enforce \nthis law as it is written.\n  While I value nature and seek to protect endangered animals, the \nreward of protecting the mussel does not outweigh the economic damage \ndone to this community or the personal safety or health of my human \nconstituents.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would, once again, prevent \nFish and Wildlife Service from enforcing the Endangered Species Act \nwith respect to six different species of mussel and would restrict the \nFish and Wildlife Service from offering any of the critical protections \nto preserve these species.\n  This amendment is harmful and, in my opinion, misguided. Once a \nspecies is listed under the Endangered Species Act, it is a role of \nFish and Wildlife Service--is primarily permissive, helping parties \ncomply with the act as they carry out their activities, the TAL that \nthe gentleman referred to.\n  Under this amendment, all the Endangered Species Act prohibitions \nwould still apply, but developers and landowners would have no avenue \nto comply with them. There could be no TAL. The Fish and Wildlife \nService would be barred from issuing permits or exemptions.\n  This means landowners and industry and other parties who might need \nto take any of these six species of mussels would be vulnerable to a \ncitizens suit. Additionally, this amendment would halt Fish and \nWildlife Service enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, which has \nno effect on other Federal agencies that are funded outside of this \nbill.\n  The Endangered Species Act mandates that all Federal departments and \nagencies conserve listed species and use their authorities in \nfurthering the purpose of this act.\n  Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act stipulates that any Federal \nagency that carries out, permits, licenses, funds, or otherwise \nauthorizes activities that may affect all listed species must consult \nwith the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that its actions are not \nlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species.\n\n  This amendment would stop--stop--section 7 consultation requirements \nfor Federal agencies; rather, it would prohibit Fish and Wildlife from \ncompleting these consultations. That means a bridge or a highway \nproject permitted or funded through the Federal Highway Administration \nor power projects permitted by the Department of Energy would be \nvulnerable to delays and stoppages and other potential lawsuits.\n  This amendment, in my opinion, is an all-out assault on the \nEndangered Species Act. In one fell swoop, it would block protections \nfor six different species that are currently listed as threatened or \nendangered; but, regardless of one's position on the Endangered Species \nAct, it is just a bad amendment.\n  The gentleman's amendment will create uncertainty for developers, \nlandowners, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits. I don't think that was \nthe gentleman's original intention, but that is the effect it will have \nbecause it will block section 7 consultations, gumming up permitting \nprocessing across the Federal Government, delaying projects, and \nadversely impacting the economy.\n  The amendment is bad for the environment. It is bad for the economy. \nIt is bad for business. It is bad for the highways and energy projects. \nIt is just bad for this bill. I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Loudermilk). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. LaMalfa\n\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n              limitation on use of funds for attorney fees\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to pay attorney fees in a civil suit under section \n     11(g) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1540(g)) pursuant to a court order that states such fees were \n     calculated at an hourly rate in excess of $125 per hour.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to express my support for the \ngood work Chairman Calvert and the subcommittee have done on this bill.\n  This amendment, which I offered with my colleagues Representatives \nBill Huizenga and Bill Flores, aligns attorney fee award limits for \nEndangered Species Act lawsuits with award limits for other lawsuits \nagainst the Federal Government established by the Equal Access to \nJustice Act.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act generally limits the hourly rate for \nawards of fees to prevailing attorneys to a reasonable $125 per hour. \nHowever, no such fee cap exists under the Endangered Species Act. As a \nresult, ESA litigants are being awarded sums, in many cases, in excess \nof $600 per hour.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act was not intended as an extraordinary \naccess to taxpayer dollars for environmental attorneys. Indeed, we \nheard one of my colleagues a minute ago talk about sue and settle.\n  According to the GAO, the Department of the Interior paid out over \n$27 million in attorney fees between 2001 and 2010; $21 million of \nthose payments were for Endangered Species Act lawsuits. Many of them \nsettled with no court order, finding the litigants to have prevailed on \nthe merits of the case--no finding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time we close this loophole that enables \nexcessive payouts to groups that have made a business of suing the \nFederal Government. There is simply no reason that one sort of lawsuit, \na type commonly undertaken by entities solely engaged in continuous \nlitigation against the government, should be paid more than any other.\n  Representative Huizenga sponsored a measure addressing this issue \nlast session, which was passed by the Committee on Natural Resources. I \nurge your support, which would be very much appreciated, including by \npeople like my daughter whose birthday it is tonight, so they would \nhave a chance to be in business and not have these extraordinarily high \nfees.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n\n[[Page H4855]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would prohibit \nfunds in the act from being used to pay attorney fees in excess of $125 \nper hour for the Endangered Species Act civil suits.\n  Now, perhaps the gentleman is not aware that the Equal Access to \nJustice Act caps attorney fees at $125 per hour unless the court--the \ncourt--determines that an increase in the cost of living or special \nfactors, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for \nthe proceedings involved, justifies the higher fee.\n\n                              {time}  0045\n\n  So it would be the court that would determine that. But the fee is \ncapped at $125 an hour. This is unnecessary and it is a redundant \namendment. Attorney fees for the Endangered Species Act cases, as I \nsaid, are already capped at $125 per hour, unless special criteria are \nstipulated by the Equal Access Justice Court.\n  This amendment would effectively change that implementation of the \nEqual Access Justice Act for one specific policy area: the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Again, higher attorney fees are only permitted in cases where \nspecific criteria under the Endangered Species Act are met. At best, \nthis amendment is redundant; at worst, it is a backdoor attempt to \nundermine the Endangered Species Act protections and make access to \njustice a lot less equal.\n  In closing, Mr. Chair, we don't need any extraneous, redundant \nprovisions to a bill that is already overburdened with harmful \nlegislative riders. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I appreciate the comments by my colleague from Minnesota \nhere, but it has been very unequal already, with many, many cases being \npaid out at $600, $700 per hour. So this amendment seeks to actually \nput that cap on there. There will still be the ability for a court, in \nextraordinary circumstances, to make the decision of whether it should \nbe higher.\n  But I am glad I am not in the position, like my colleague from \nMinnesota, of defending $600 or $700 an hour for attorney fees for more \nfrivolous environmental lawsuits that make it difficult to farm, ranch, \nmine, and do timber operations which are desperately needed, especially \nwith the conditions we have in California, with our forests as well as \nthe drought situation and trying to get work done to address that.\n  So when the people watch what goes on here, they need to be cognizant \nthat there are those in the government that would rather pay to $600 to \n$700 per hour for more frivolous environmental lawsuits while they \nsuffer from drought or burning forests.\n  With that, I think that this amendment is very much in order because \nwe see that these limits aren't being followed at all under the $125 \nlimit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert after the last section \n     (preceding the short title), the following:\n       Sec.__. None of the funds provided in this Act may be used \n     in contravention of 33 U.S.C. 1319 with respect to a permit \n     issued or required to be issued to the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1344 for discharges of \n     dredged or fill material impacting wetlands.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, Americans are tired of two \nstandards: a standard whereby private citizens are treated one way and \na standard whereby the Federal Government treats themselves in an \nentirely different way.\n  Nothing is more apparent in this situation than where the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers grants themselves one way of complying with wetlands \nregulations, yet they impose an entirely different standard upon our \nprivate citizens.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA go out and purport to be \ndefenders of wetlands; good stewards of our wetlands. Yet the greatest \ncause of wetlands loss in the United States is actually caused by \nhistoric current and future actions of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  In our home State of Louisiana, we have lost over 1,900 square miles \nof our coast, and the majority of that land loss has been caused by the \nmanagement or the mismanagement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers of \nour coastal resources and the river resources, particularly the \nMississippi River.\n  Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is it simply requires that the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers comply with the same standards as anything \nelse. If there are permits required, they have to get them. If there \nare mitigation requirements, they have to get them. They can no longer \nmismanage our coastal resources.\n  This isn't a parochial. This is an issue whereby the Nation truly \nbenefits from this. This is the area where fishery production occurs, \nenergy production occurs. We literally power this Nation's economy and \nwe feed American families.\n  So this wetlands loss that we are experiencing actually increases the \nvulnerability of our coastal communities in south Louisiana and \nincreases the demands upon FEMA and other agencies in response to \ndisasters.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used on an unmanned aircraft system or to operate any such \n     system owned by the Department of the Interior for the \n     performance of surveying, mapping, or collecting remote \n     sensing data.\n\n  Mr. PERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for allowing me to offer this \namendment. It prevents the Department of the Interior from competing \nwith our local job creators in the use of UAS--unmanned aerial \nsystems--for land surveying, mapping, imaging, and remote sensing data \nactivities.\n  There is concern that agencies like the USGS and the Bureau of Land \nManagement are acquiring the UAS and utilizing them on projects that \ncan be accomplished by the private sector. We have no problem with them \nusing them. We have no problem with them using them for forest fires \nand those types of things, for emergency situations, but where local \nbusinesses can do this work, we think that it is unfair\n\n[[Page H4856]]\n\nfor the government to take that work away.\n  Having the Department compete with local employers results in a loss \nof business for private geospatial firms under contract to other \nFederal mapping agencies. The government is actually getting a leg up \non the private market by obtaining Certificates of Authorization, or \nCOAs, and performing services with UAS that are otherwise commercial in \nnature.\n  Current law and regulation permits private citizens and firms to \noperate UAS for a hobby. However, there is no effective enforcement to \nprevent government abuse of such authority for commercial purposes.\n  The fact that government agencies can operate a UAS while the private \nsector cannot as freely or timely gain airspace access has created and \nuneven playing field. Allowing the Department of the Interior to \ncompete with the free market use of UAS is not only poor stewardship of \ntaxpayer money and inefficient use of resources, but results in the \ngovernment duplicating and directly competing with private enterprise.\n  This is a $73 million marketplace, Mr. Chairman. It drives more than \n$1 trillion in economic activity. More than 500,000 American jobs are \nrelated to the collection, storage, and dissemination of imagery and \ngeospatial data. Another 5.3 million citizens utilize such data. As \nmuch as 90 percent of the government information has a geospatial \ninformation component. Up to 80 percent of the information managed by \nbusiness is connected to a specific location. The geospatial \nmarketplace is identified by the Department of Labor as one of just 14 \nhigh gross sectors in the United States workforce.\n  With that, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological \nSurvey have been using unmanned aircraft to complement conventional \nsatellite-based remote sensing. Using remote sensing via unmanned \naircraft did make sense. It allows for the rapid collection of data and \nallows for the Department to get a closer look at natural disasters as \nthey develop.\n  The Department and the USGS are using unmanned aircraft to monitor \nthe spread of wildfires, monitor riverbank erosion, detect and locate \ncoal steam fires, conduct waterfall surveys, and inspect abandoned \nmines.\n  It is clearly evident to everyone that this technology offers a real \npublic safety benefit. So it makes no sense to hamstring the Department \nwhen the technology can save lives and the survey can monitor dangerous \nnatural events.\n  Now, the way that the amendment is written--and I am all for the \nprivate sector being able to do things, and that is in your new \namendment, that the private sector is not affected by this amendment--\nif the private sector currently isn't operating in this space looking \nat abandoned mines or looking at wildfires and we need to do something \nright away, your amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from \nusing equipment it would have and be able to launch up and look at \nsomething in real time.\n  I don't think that was the total intention of your amendment. But \nbecause even though you worked in the redraft to make sure that you \nprotected contractors--and I am glad you did that--I don't know where \nthat leaves us in times of emergency when there isn't a contractor \navailable, because you haven't allowed prohibition.\n  For that reason, Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.\n  First of all, I did state that fire observation would not be \nincluded. Indeed, it is not written in the amendment. It is very \nspecific. So for emergency purposes, if need be, the Department of the \nInterior still can use, whether it uses its own or DHS' or one of the \nother myriad agencies that have the vehicles, it still has the ability \nto do that.\n  But I would also remind the gentlewoman that there are plenty of \nambulance services and other emergency services for contract hire out \nthere in our communities that perform emergency services every hour of \nthe day, every day of the year. That fact notwithstanding, the private \nindustry does provide all the other things that the agency is currently \nembarking on on its own and leaving the private sector out.\n  A friend just called me today and asked me, because I am a helicopter \npilot in the Army, if we could put his air-conditioning unit on a roof. \nI said, ``Absolutely not.'' The Army doesn't do what the civilian world \ndoes for good reason. We want the civilians out there doing those \nthings. We don't want to compete as the Federal Government.\n  But in this case, the Department of the Interior is competing \ndirectly, and will continue to do if allowed to do so, unless \nprohibited. They can write contracts, and they can have somebody on \ncall. If there is an emergency situation, they can have a contractor on \ncall to do that, and they should.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentleman.\n  I think that this is a great discussion we are having, but I don't \nthink the discussion necessarily belongs on the appropriations bill. It \nbelongs in the policy committee so that all the questions that I have \nand the concerns that you have can be addressed and thoughtfully \nwritten into a piece of legislation.\n  There are just some places in rural parts of the United States--and I \ncome from a State that is both urban, suburban, and very rural, up on \nthe north shore--where private contractors just don't go or the ability \nof getting a hold of one isn't there, and sometimes you have to have \nsome Federal redundancy in the system to get out there and do that.\n  You also have used a couple of terms and descriptions that I don't \nhave any statutory language in front of me. So where I think the \ngentleman might have a very good idea, bills that we are working on in \nthe appropriations process, when we start getting into writing \ntechnical policy or trying to figure out the new wave of what new \nlegislation should look like--and you have a great proponent; I hear \nhim all the time in the Defense subcommittee--the chairman of the \nsubcommittee says the Federal Government shouldn't be doing what the \nprivate sector can do. We should not be doing this legislation for the \nreasons I mentioned, that we just don't have all the facts in front of \nit, and it is not the role of the Interior Appropriations bill to do \npolicy.\n  So I am going to continue to object to the amendment at this time, \nbut I look forward to, in a policy situation, working with the \ngentleman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Again, I appreciate the gentlewoman's reservations and \nopposition for the reasons so stated. I respect them, but I feel this \nis the correct place to limit in the appropriations, to make sure that \nthe private sector can compete effectively and is allowed to do so and \ndoesn't have to compete against the Federal Government with all the \nprovisions it has at its hand to undermine their ability to be \neffective and competitive.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  0100\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nPerry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Loudermilk, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2822) \nmaking appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, \nand related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \nfor other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/07/house-section/article/H4816-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4816-H4856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rouzer).

When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \na request for a recorded vote on amendment No. 6, printed in the \nCongressional Record, offered by the gentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. \nBlackburn), had been postponed, and the bill had been read through page \n132, line 24.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gallego\n\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue a grazing permit or lease in contravention \n     of section 4110.1 or 4130.1-1(b) of title 43, Code of Federal \n     Regulations.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment that will \nreaffirm Congress' support for the enforcement of grazing fees on \npublic lands.\n  Grazing on public lands is a privilege, not a right, and it is \ncritical that individual ranchers who use these lands abide by the law \nand pay their fair share.\n  My commonsense amendment simply confirms that grazing permits or \nleases should not be issued to anyone who does not comply with BLM \nregulations. My amendment does not penalize people for forgetting to \nrepair a fence or for forgetting to make a payment once or twice.\n  Rather, this amendment ensures that egregious violations of grazing \nregulations are not going to be allowed to happen under the taxpayers' \nwatch, as there are American taxpayers who work every day to ensure \nthat all of their regulations are met.\n  Mr. Chairman, revenues from grazing fees go toward the management, \nmaintenance, and improvement of public rangeland. The vast majority of \nranchers understands how important these efforts are and pay their fees \non time, but some ranchers are outright refusing to pay their grazing \nfees.\n  One particular rancher, who is well known to the media, has been more \nthan $1 million in arrears since 1993. He has ignored the executive and \njudicial branches of our government, expanding his herds further onto \nour lands without permission.\n  Unauthorized grazing, such as in this case, has the potential to \ndestroy habitat for protected species and to damage public property. In \naddition, he has instigated volatile situations that has put the lives \nof local and Federal Government officials at risk.\n  Unbelievably, some in this body have actually applauded these \ndangerous actions. That is simply irresponsible. Mr. Chairman, I \nstrongly suspect that, if anyone in my congressional district in \nPhoenix forcibly resisted paying the Federal Government more than $1 \nmillion, he or she would be in handcuffs instead of on television or \nmeeting with potential Presidential candidates.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Ultimately, however, this amendment is about more than one man. It is \nabout upholding the basic principles that our laws should be applied \nfairly to everyone who lives in this country and uses its public lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, we must ensure that egregious violations of grazing \nregulations are not financed by the American taxpayer. To that end, I \nhope all Members will support this critical amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Pearce\n\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to increase the rate of any royalty required to be \n     paid to the United States for oil and gas produced on Federal \n     land, or to prepare or publish a proposed rule relating to \n     such an increase.\n\n\n[[Page H4817]]\n\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New Mexico and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Mexico.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, Washington recently issued the advanced notice \nof rulemaking in which they declared they were going to consider \nraising the royalty rates on oil and gas production on Federal land. \nNow, there is several reasons that we would want to consider that \nbefore we implemented it, and so our amendment simply says let's stop \nthe process.\n  First of all, what it does is it is going to drive the royalty rates \nup on Federal lands. It will be one more impediment to producing the \noil and gas that fuels this Nation's economy.\n  Secondly, small businesses, small independent producers are already \nunder pressure to try to just stay in business, and it would increase \ntheir operating costs. For a small State like ours, rural States, the \nsmall businesses, these local producers are sources of prosperity that \nare desperately missing from the rural parts of the country.\n  If we are going to have an economy that is healthy, if we are going \nto have an economy that provides jobs for the future, then we need \nenergy that is both affordable and a predictable supply. Nothing is \nbetter than producing our own. When we have to import oil from other \nnations, some of those nations are unstable politically. Some just \ndon't like us as a country; and so why not produce our own energy, \nproviding our own jobs and providing revenues to the Federal \nGovernment?\n  Anytime you increase taxes on a given item, then you are going to see \nless of that item, and oil and gas is no exception. Let's let the \ndepartment think about this just a bit more before we rush into a \nroyalty rate which will decrease America's energy supply and make us \nmore dependent on foreign oil.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, the amendment would prohibit the Bureau of \nLand Management from using its legal authorities to modernize its \nroyalty rate structure, which would result in less revenue to the \nTreasury.\n  The Department of the Interior's oil and gas royalties have been the \nsubject of repeated study by the Government Accountability Office and \nother entities for many years. In 2008, the GAO said the United States \ncould be forgoing billions of dollars in revenue from the production of \nFederal oil and gas resources due to the lack of price flexibility in \nroyalty rates and the inability to change the fiscal terms on existing \nleases. In 2013, the GAO issued another report that noted concern that \nthe Department of the Interior had not taken the steps to change the \nonshore royalty rate regulations.\n  Modernizing the Bureau of Land Management's rate structures can \nprovide critical flexibility, especially given the dramatic growth of \noil development on public and tribal lands, where production has \nincreased in each of the past 6 years and combined production was up 81 \npercent in 2004 versus 2008.\n  It seems to me that it is critical that the Department of the \nInterior is ensuring that the public is receiving a fair return from \nthe production of oil and gas from Federal leases. This amendment would \nguarantee a sweetheart deal for Big Oil companies at the expense of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank my cosponsors on this \namendment: Mr. Tipton, Mr. Cramer, Mr. Lamborn, and Mr. Zinke. I \nappreciate their presence here.\n  The gentlewoman raises a significant question whether or not revenues \nwould increase or decrease. We have got a couple of charts here showing \nexactly what is happening.\n  First of all, the average number of leases that the BLM issued during \neach administration, we can see back in the Reagan administration the \nhighest level. It decreases down to--you can see the relative position \nof the Obama administration. If the administration were really \ninterested in revenues, it seems like they would be producing the \npermits at a little faster rate.\n  Then this chart shows the oil production; the increase in oil \nproduction in blue is shown here on private lands while the decrease in \noil production on the public lands is being shown in the red.\n  Again, if the administration were very interested, it seems like they \nwould modernize not the royalty rate, but the way in which they approve \nthese wells. Sometimes, wells go for 6 months or a year without being \npermitted, where States can offer 30-day processing of the permits.\n  The same is happening with natural gas. Again, we just see the blue \non private lands where natural gas production is increasing, dramatic \ndecreases in production of natural gas on Federal lands. Again, it \nlooks like, if the agency were worried about the revenues, they would \nseek to modernize and update their procedures first.\n  I yield to the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman for this amendment. I think it is a \ngood amendment. I certainly understand his concern.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. PEARCE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment. The \nBureau of Land Management has only just begun the process of examining \nwhether royalty rates and rentals for oil and gas leases on public \nlands should be increased. That process should be allowed to continue.\n  GAO recently found that, based upon the results of a number of \nstudies, the U.S. Government receives one of the lowest government \ntakes, commonly understood to be the total revenue, as a percentage of \nthe value of oil and natural gas produced in the entire world.\n  For example, royalty rates on public land are at 12.5 percent, \nconsiderably less than the royalty rates even on State lands, which \nrange from a low of 16.67 percent to 25 percent-plus. These low royalty \nrates cheat the American taxpayers and keep them from receiving a fair \nreturn for the extraction of their oil and gas resources.\n  However, rental rates are even worse. To secure very valuable mineral \nrights, sometimes worth hundreds of millions of dollars, companies only \nhave to bid a minimum, and I repeat, a minimum of $2 an acre upfront to \nwin the lease and then $1.50 per acre each year to keep the lease. That \nis right, a rental of $1.50 per acre per year. This low price was last \nset by Congress in the 1980s and has not been adjusted since.\n  This can and should change. Oil companies, some of which generate \nbillions of dollars per quarter in profits, should pay their fair share \nto the American people for the development of the Nation's public \nresources. Imagine if your rent had not increased since Ronald Reagan \nwas President or if the local grocery store had not raised their prices \nsince 1987.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. This scenario may sound too good to be true, but in \nfact, that is exactly the sweetheart deal that we are currently giving \noil and gas industries, a sweetheart deal that should end. All \nAmericans must deal with the unavoidable reality of inflation; so why \nshouldn't oil and gas companies?\n  It is long past time for the BLM to assess better ways for the public \nto receive their fair share. Blocking the BLM from doing that is \nfiscally irresponsible, a giveaway to the oil and gas companies.\n  Ms. PINGREE. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Mexico has 1 minute \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from Maine has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chair, the assumption that the royalty rates are \nabnormally low in the United States simply ignores the fact that we \nhave lease\n\n[[Page H4818]]\n\nsales on top of the royalties. Many countries fail to have those.\n  The United States has the most extreme environmental regulations, so \nthe regulatory burden gladly borne by the oil companies is an \nadditional cost that many nations do not have. In addition, we have got \nincome taxes paid by the companies, and many countries don't charge \nthat on top of the royalty.\n  What we are hearing from our friends on the other side of the aisle \nabout the sweetheart deals, I think, take a look and see actually how \nmuch the oil and gas companies are paying. In our State, they have \ncontributed to two of the largest permanent funds in the world held by \nour State. I think oil and gas companies are paying their fair share by \na lot.\n  What other industry is paying truck drivers $100,000 a year to drive \na truck for a contractor? I think that those sorts of computations are \nsimply ignored by the GAO.\n  Again, I would urge Members to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, in spite of the arguments that my colleague \nfrom New Mexico has made, I still say this amendment, in my opinion, \ndoesn't pass the straight face test.\n  I can't imagine my constituents thinking that we should make things \nany easier for the oil and gas companies or that we should be giving \naway the opportunity to earn taxpayer revenue on our Federal lands.\n  The Federal onshore royalty rate has not been increased since 1920. \nThat is 95 years. The offshore royalty rate is 18.75 percent; yet the \nonshore rates have been stuck at 12.5 percent for 95 years. Where is \nthe equity in that?\n  As far as I am concerned, I think it is time for the American \ntaxpayers to get a fair return on the use of public resources, \nespecially from some of the most profitable companies in the world. I \nurge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Mexico \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Huffman\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement National Park Service Director's Order \n     61 as it pertains to allowing a grave in any Federal cemetery \n     to be decorated with a Confederate flag.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate very much the bipartisan support and passage of my \nearlier amendment, which would end the practice of concessionaires in \nour national parks selling Confederate flags and memorabilia of the \nConfederacy.\n  We now, with this Interior Appropriations bill, have a second \nopportunity to speak on this very important national debate that we are \nhaving regarding symbols of the Confederacy. This additional amendment \nwill end the practice of allowing groups to display Confederate flags \non federally managed cemeteries.\n  The American Civil War was fought, in Abraham Lincoln's words, to \n``save the last best hope of Earth.'' We can honor that history without \ncelebrating the Confederate flag and all of the dreadful things that it \nsymbolizes.\n  I request an ``aye'' of my colleagues, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Huffman).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Walberg\n\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                          limitation on funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to lobby in \n     contravention of section 1913 of title 18, United States \n     Code, on behalf of the proposed rule entitled ``Definition of \n     `Waters of the United States' Under the Clean Water Act'' (79 \n     Fed. Reg. 22188; April 21, 2014).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, my amendment tells the Environmental \nProtection Agency to follow the law and clearly establishes the view of \nCongress that the EPA cannot lobby on behalf of the waters of the U.S. \nrule, in violation of the Anti-Lobbying Act.\n  Over the past few years, the EPA has been pushing the limits of its \nstatutory authority to the issue of the waters of the U.S. rule. Now, \nwe have learned that, as part of their efforts to regulate every pond, \nstream, and ditch in America, the EPA may have violated the Anti-\nLobbying Act to garner public comments in support of the proposed rule, \neven though the Department of Justice has consistently stated that the \nact prohibits Federal agencies from engaging in substantial grassroots \nlobbying.\n  In fact, The New York Times recently reported:\n\n       In a campaign that tests the limits of Federal lobbying \n     law, the Agency orchestrated a drive to counter political \n     opposition from Republicans and enlist public support in \n     concert with liberal environmental groups and a grassroots \n     organization aligned with President Obama.\n\n  The New York Times went on to say as well:\n\n       The most contentious part of the EPA's campaign was \n     deploying Thunderclap, a social media tool that spread the \n     Agency's message to hundreds of thousands of people, a \n     ``virtual flash mob,'' in the words of Travis Loop, the head \n     of communications for EPA's water division.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this is unseemly. The EPA Administrator later used the \nskewed results as evidence of public support before Congress.\n  For this reason, my amendment is needed to make clear that the EPA \nshall not violate the Anti-Lobbying Act while pursuing the completion \nof the waters of the U.S.\n  I respectfully urge all my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. WALBERG. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I agree with the gentleman and with The New York Times that this is \nwhy the underlying bill reduces funding for certain offices within EPA \nthat were responsible for these questionable actions.\n  Therefore, this language is complementary to the approach the \ncommittee has already taken in the bill, and I urge an ``aye'' vote on \nthe amendment.\n  Mr. WALBERG. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. The gentleman's amendment would prohibit funds in the \nact from being used to lobby on the waters of the U.S. There is an \nexisting prohibition on lobbying that applies to all Federal employees \nthat has been in place since 1919, so this is an unnecessary and \nredundant amendment.\n  I would remind my colleagues that Federal employees are not \nprohibited from providing information to Congress on legislation, \npolicies, or programs. There must be an open dialogue between the \nlegislative and executive branches to ensure that laws are being \nimplemented appropriately and programs achieve their intended goals.\n  We should not and cannot operate in an information vacuum. We don't \nneed\n\n[[Page H4819]]\n\nto add extraneous, redundant provisions to a bill that is already \noverburdened with harmful legislative riders.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her comments.\n  It is the law, and that is all I am trying to substantiate, but I \nhave read to you not from an organ of the conservative Republican Party \nside, but from The New York Times.\n  They also went on to say:\n\n       The architect of the EPA's new public outreach strategy is \n     Thomas Reynolds, a former Obama campaign aid who was \n     appointed in 2013 as an associate administrator.\n\n  He said this in relationship to flash mob tactics and the lobbying \nefforts:\n\n       We are just borrowing new methods that have proven \n     themselves as being effective.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it may be effective, but it is unseemly that EPA, an \nagency of the Federal Government, would violate the law in lobbying and \ntrying then to show Congress through trumped up evidence that they have \nproduced through lobbying the private sector that they have support for \nthe waters of the U.S. rule.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why I think we need to establish it here very \nclearly in this appropriations bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I urge support, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enforce section 435 of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would not allow any funds to \nenforce section 435 of this bill, which is another harmful policy rider \nthat limits the ability of our environmental agencies to take action to \nimprove public health and fight the root causes of climate change.\n  This section blocks the EPA's ongoing efforts to regulate \nhydrofluorocarbons, or HFCs, which is the wrong approach. HFCs are \nfactory-made gases used in air conditioning and refrigeration and are \nup to 10,000 times more potent than carbon dioxide. This potency has \nled to HFCs being referred to as a superpollutant. Unless we act now, \nUnited States emissions are expected to double by 2020 and triple by \n2030.\n  While not as abundant as carbon dioxide, superpollutants, also known \nas short-lived climate pollutants--including HFCs, methane, and black \ncarbon--have contributed up to 40 percent of observed global warming.\n  By limiting the EPA's authority under the Clean Water Act to propose, \nfinalize, or enforce any regulation or guidance regarding HFCs, we \nundercut their ability to protect public health and demonstrate \nAmerican leadership in emission reductions.\n  The EPA's Significant New Alternatives Policy Program, or SNAP, \nrequires us to evaluate substitutes for superpollutants like HFCs that \nare harming public health and our environment. Through SNAP, we can \nensure a more smooth transition to safer alternatives for our country's \nindustrial sector.\n  Within the last week, EPA finalized a new rule on HFCs that the \nEnvironmental Investigation Agency estimates will avoid superpollutant \nemissions equal to the annual greenhouse gas emissions of more than 21 \nmillion cars by 2030. It will allow heavy users of HFCs, including \nsupermarkets, which are the largest source of HFC emissions, to \ncontinue developing cleaner alternatives.\n  As we continue international negotiations to phase down HFCs, the \nUnited States should be a leader in reducing the use of HFCs and other \nsuperpollutants. The standard set by EPA will drive U.S. and \ninternational innovation and market development of low-emission and \nenergy-efficient refrigeration, air conditioning, foam-blowing agents, \nand aerosol technologies.\n  These innovations will actually get at one of the root causes of \nclimate change before we are forced to react to increasingly extreme \nweather and sea level rise.\n  American industry has already begun creating alternatives that both \nhave a lower emissions profile and are more energy efficient than \ncurrent HFCs, and last September, we saw major companies--including \nCoca-Cola, Carrier, DuPont, Honeywell, PepsiCo, and other industry \nleaders--commit to voluntarily reducing harmful HFC emissions.\n  My amendment simply bars funding to enforce section 435 of this bill \nso we can instead continue with existing rules and move our country's \nglobal leadership in finding innovative solutions to reducing emissions \nforward. We should not be handcuffing the important work being done at \nEPA to reduce superpollutants.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. The committee still has concerns about the costs, \ntechnology requirements, and compliance periods in the final rule. It \nis not clear why EPA divided some categories into subcategories and \nprovided different deadlines for similar products.\n  The EPA clearly chose winners and losers. For the losers, the \ntimetables remain unworkable. Manufacturers need time to implement \nengineering and technology changes and address new risk and safety \nchallenges. Historic experience with the Montreal Protocol indicates \nthat manufacturers need approximately 6-plus years to successfully \ntransition between new materials.\n  This new rule will particularly be hard on small businesses. The \nlarge businesses that the gentleman mentioned have the resources and \nthe technologies available to them to comply quicker. These smaller \nbusinesses will find it very difficult to comply with DOE's energy \nconservation standards.\n  EPA's proposal is not being driven by a statutory mandate, so the \ncommittee believes additional time is warranted. The EPA left critical \ndecisions regarding energy, efficiency, and system performance up to \nthe manufacturers; and they need time to get this right.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate very much the constructive \ncomments by my colleague, the gentleman from California. I would just \nsuggest this is not the way to deal with these issues, but rather to \naddress them via policy approach.\n  Section 435 of this bill will just take out the legs from all work we \nwould do on HFCs and superpollutants, and it is just too broad a brush \nto paint with.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I urge opposition to this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 30 Offered by Mr. Walden\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n                       resource management plans\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to complete or implement the revision of the resource \n     management plans for the Coos Bay, Eugene, Medford, Roseburg, \n     or Salem Districts of the Bureau of Land Management or the \n     Klamath\n\n[[Page H4820]]\n\n     Falls Field Office of the Lakeview District of the Bureau of \n     Land Management proposed in the Bureau of Land Management \n     Notice of Availability of the Draft Resource Management Plan \n     Revisions and Draft Environmental Impact Statement for \n     Western Oregon published in the Federal Register on April 24, \n     2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 23046).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, the past several decades have been really \nhard on Oregon's forested communities as timber harvest from Federal \nlands dropped more than 90 percent because of, in part, litigation, \nlack of management, government regulation.\n  Across the State, we have lost more than 300 forest product mills. \nThey have closed. We have lost more than 30,000 forest-related jobs. \nThis has left our communities in really bad shape, nearing bankruptcy \nin some cases in our counties, high poverty rates in our communities. \nUnemployment rates are high in these forested areas and, of course, we \nface, without active management, these enormous forest fires that \ncontribute massively to the carbon buildup.\n  Recently, the BLM released a proposed update to their two-decade, 20-\nyear-old management plan in western Oregon. The vast majority of the \nforests covered by these plans are what are called O lands, which are \nmanaged by a very unique Federal statute called the O Act. That law \ncalls for sustainable timber production and revenue to local counties. \nIt is different than the other forest laws.\n  Now, despite that clear mandate in Federal law, the BLM's proposal \nwould allow for harvesting on about 22 percent is all, 22 percent of \nthe land base. It would lock up the remainder in various reserves.\n  Oregon's forested counties, some of which have more than 70 percent \nof their land controlled by the Federal Government, rely on receipts \nfrom Federal timber projects to fund basic needs like law enforcement, \nschools, and other essential services. Unfortunately, under BLM's \nproposal, these counties would receive an estimated 27 percent is all \nof their historical average receipt--27 percent.\n  Now, while the BLM's proposed plans fall far short of meeting these \ncommunities' needs, it seems the agency is determined to push forward \nanyway with these plans.\n  In a bipartisan effort, the entire Oregon Congressional Delegation \nrequested a 120-day extension of the comment period so that the \ncounties and other interested parties have time to thoroughly review \nthe more than 1,500 pages of analysis and provide some useful input and \ncomment.\n  Apparently, the BLM isn't interested in that input, since I \nunderstand they will be rejecting our request and moving forward with \ntheir plan under their current timeline. That is really disappointing. \nYou see, these local communities are most affected by the management \nchanges on the Federal land that surrounds them, and the BLM, I wish, \nwould care more about their input than a self-imposed deadline likely \nout of some office back here.\n  This amendment would simply delay the BLM's implementation of these \nproposed plans. That would give more time for our counties and \ninterested parties to thoroughly review the more than 1,500 pages of \nanalysis. It would also give the agency time to consider additional \nalternatives that better incorporate the clear mandates of the O Act.\n  I want to quote, Mr. Chairman, from the Portland Oregonian. This is \nthe statewide newspaper that probably leans a little more to the left. \nThey said: ``Minimally, BLM needs to extend its comment period and \ndevelop more alternatives to be considered. But it is unlikely to \ndevelop any alternative that would be acceptable to the industry, \ncounties and environmental advocates. Congress, not a government \nagency, needs to step up and help solve this long-festering problem.''\n  Mr. Chairman, with Oregon's wildfire season well off to a terrible \nstart, we need time to review these plans, get active management on \nthese forestlands, and by passing this amendment, we will give the \ntaxpayers, the people who live there, a better opportunity to weigh in. \nSo I urge support.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering the \namendment and yielding me time.\n  I appreciate the concerns that he brings to us today. It is troubling \nthat the Bureau of Land Management has proposed land use plans that \nappear to contradict its multiple-use mandate. So with that, I would \nhappily accept his amendment.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maine for \n5 minutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the concerns raised by the \ngentleman from Oregon, but this amendment would prohibit the Bureau of \nLand Management from completing or implementing updates to certain \nresource management plans in western Oregon.\n  These updated plans cover 2.5 million acres of land that play an \nimportant role in the social, economic, and ecological well-being of \nwestern Oregon, as well as to the American public generally. The plans \ndetermine how BLM-administered lands will be managed to further the \nrecovery of threatened and endangered species, provide for clean water, \nrestore fire-adapted ecosystems, produce a sustained yield of timber \nproducts, and coordinate land management of surrounding tribal land.\n  The amendment would suspend the BLM's authority to implement a new \nresource management plan in western Oregon. As a result, the BLM would \nbe forced to rely on a 20-year-old outdated plan that doesn't \nincorporate significant new information. For example, the old plan does \nnot include important conservation activities, such as the northern \nspotted owl recovery plan. The amendment would block one of the most \ncomprehensive and detailed landscape plans that the BLM has ever \ndeveloped and would ignore significant public input. The public has a \nright to engage in the management decisions of their Federal lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Chairman, I would suggest that the spotted owl is \ncovered by their planning process today in some measure because it \ncertainly contributed to the downfall of our communities, absent this \nplan.\n  Look, all we are asking for is time for people to have a better \nchance to review what this Federal agency, after 20 years, has finally \ncome up with--1,500 pages. I think they should have a chance, as do my \ncolleagues, including Mr. Schrader, a member of your party, supporting \nthis amendment. So it is a bipartisan Oregon approach that I would hope \nmy colleague from Maine would share that we need to do better managing \nAmerica's Federal forests.\n  Turn on the TV. They are going up in flames right now. I don't like \nthat for the habitat. I don't like that for the communities. I don't \nlike that for what the firefighters have to face.\n  I think we can do better. Most observers in the State think we can do \nbetter, and I would encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle \nto support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, again, I just want to say I appreciate the \nconcerns that the gentleman from Oregon has raised, and other Members \nfrom Oregon who share those concerns. I thought it was important to \naddress some of the considerations and concerns that we have with this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Lowenthal\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to require \ncompanies to follow the law if they want to export crude oil from the \nUnited States.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n[[Page H4821]]\n\nlimitation on use of funds to issue any new federal oil and gas leases \n                          and drilling permits\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue any new Federal oil and gas lease or \n     drilling permit to any person that does not commit to \n     following Department of Commerce regulations regarding the \n     requirement of obtaining a license for exporting crude oil.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, I offer this amendment \nto require companies to follow the law if they want to export crude oil \nfrom the United States.\n  I want to make it clear. This amendment is not about whether we \nshould lift the crude oil export ban altogether. That is a debate for a \ndifferent time and a different bill. This is about those narrow cases \nwhere companies are currently able to export crude oil in limited \nquantities but are also choosing not to follow the rules.\n  Last summer, the Commerce Department ruled that two companies could \nexport very light crude oil, called condensate, after it had been \nlightly processed. That decision meant that those companies would not \nneed to obtain a license to export crude oil even though licenses are \nrequired for all other crude oil exports.\n  Because of that ruling, which I believe was inappropriate, another \ncompany decided that they, too, would begin exporting their own light \ncrude oil without even asking the Commerce Department for a decision \nfirst, let alone try to get a license.\n  Since then, exports have skyrocketed. From January 2010 until June \n2014, when the Commerce Department made that ruling, we exported about \n97,000 barrels of crude oil a day, mostly to Canada. Since that day in \nJune of 2014, our oil exports have quadrupled to an average of over \n400,000 barrels a day, hitting all-time record levels, with more and \nmore of that crude oil going to Europe and to Asia.\n  I don't think we should be exporting so much of our domestic oil when \nwe are still importing roughly 7 million barrels every day. We may be \nthe world's number one oil producer, but we are still the world's \nnumber one oil importer.\n  If we want to change that, we shouldn't be letting oil companies \nsimply ship American crude oil anywhere in the world that they want to. \nWe should certainly also not let them ignore existing laws and \nregulations in order to do so. First and foremost, oil produced in \nAmerica, particularly oil from America's public lands that belong to \nthe American people, should remain in this country for the benefit of \nthe American people.\n  If we are going to allow these companies to export oil, they must \nfollow the law. They simply can't take matters into their own hands and \ndecide whether they need or do not need a license before shipping this \noil all over the world.\n  My amendment is a simple, commonsense solution to this problem. It \nsimply states, if you are going to drill on public land, you must \nfollow the legal process for getting an export license if you want to \nship that oil elsewhere.\n  This is not an onerous restriction. It only applies to public land, \nonly requires companies to commit to following the existing process for \ngetting a license with the Department of Commerce. That way, the \nCommerce Department can evaluate these options on a case-by-case basis \nto determine if they are in the national interest.\n  The concept of exporting American crude oil is too important to let \nthe companies make that call on their own.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n\n   Vacating Demand for Recorded Vote on Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent that the request for a \nrecorded vote on my amendment be withdrawn to the end that the \namendment stand disposed of by the voice vote thereon.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the request for a recorded vote \nis withdrawn. Accordingly, the noes have it, and the amendment is not \nadopted.\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Hardy\n\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to make a Presidential declaration by public \n     proclamation of a national monument under chapter 3203 of \n     title 54, United States Code in the counties of Mohave and \n     Coconino in the State of Arizona, in the counties of Modoc \n     and Siskiyou in the State of California, in the counties of \n     Chaffee, Moffat, and Park in the State of Colorado, in the \n     counties of Lincoln, Clark, and Nye in the State of Nevada, \n     in the county of Otero in the State of New Mexico, in the \n     counties of Jackson, Josephine and, Malheur in the State of \n     Oregon, or in the counties of Wayne, Garfield, and Kane in \n     the State of Utah.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Nevada and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Nevada.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment with my \ngood friends from Arizona, California, Colorado, New Mexico, Oregon, \nand Utah to prohibit public land management agencies in this bill from \nmaking declarations under the Antiquities Act in counties where there \nis significant local opposition.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to begin by stating my strong support for \nour Nation's public lands. As an active hunter and an outdoorsman, I \nmarvel at the beauty of our landscapes, our unique flora, and the \nabundant animal species that roam our terrain.\n  With that being said, I also come from Nevada, a State where roughly \n85 percent of the land is controlled by the Federal Government.\n  Addressing this concentration of land use decisionmaking power in the \nhands of Washington bureaucrats has been one of the strong motivating \nfactors during my time in this body, as I am sure that it has been for \nmany of my colleagues in the Western States.\n  While this concentration is certainly a topic that should be \naddressed by the authorizing committees, I believe that we can and \nshould take an important step here today.\n  A recent prominent example demonstrating the need for this amendment \nis the administration's draft proclamation to establish the Basin and \nRange National Monument on more than 700,000 acres of land in Lincoln \nand Nye Counties in my district.\n  Not only is the sheer size of the proposed monument staggering, being \nnearly as large as many of the Eastern States, it also poses some \nsignificant risks, both local and national in scope.\n  Nevada's economy was one of the hardest hit by the Great Recession, \nand far too many in our State are still struggling to get by. Nevada's \nrural county economies are particularly sensitive, and any decision \nthat restricts ranching, recreation, and types of land use activities \nshould have much of the local input as possible.\n  Earlier this year I spoke on the floor of the House about the \nnational security implications of designating the Basin and Range, \ngiven that most of the acreage in the proposed monument falls directly \nunder the airspace of the Nevada Test and Training Range, one of the \nmost heavily used military operating areas, or MOAs, in the United \nStates. Establishing this monument could drastically impair vital \nground-based training activities tied to the NTTR.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to my colleague from Arizona (Mr. \nGosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, in my home State of Arizona, a few special \ninterest groups have been pushing the President to unilaterally \ndesignate a massive new 1.7-million-acre national monument in the Grand \nCanyon watershed.\n  Twenty-six Members of Congress have joined me in opposing this \nmisguided effort, and there is significant local opposition.\n\n[[Page H4822]]\n\n  Here is a sample of those resolutions, and I would like to share a \nfew of their comments here:\n  ``The creation of a national monument by Presidential declaration \ndoes not allow for input from local communities . . . and could result \nin negative impacts for . . . grazing, hunting, water development and \nforest restoration . . . which would result in negative economic and \npublic health impacts to the City of Williams.\n  ``The Arizona Game and Fish Commission is concerned that the \npotential monument . . . 'will impede proactive and effective \nmanagement of wildlife populations and habitats . . . and may result in \nreduced hunter opportunities and loss of revenues that directly support \nconservation and local communities.' ''\n  I could provide several more examples but will stop there.\n  I urge the adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, I now ask how much time I have remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Nevada has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. HARDY. I yield 1 minute to my distinguished colleague from Utah \n(Mr. Bishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, this Antiquities Act was passed \nover a century ago in 1906, when four States weren't even in the Union \nat that time. They were still territories.\n  There are absolutely no environmental laws that we had at that \nparticular time protecting anything. Yet, this act was not used by \nevery President. In fact, most Presidents never used it. Ronald Reagan \nnever used it. Most Presidents only used it one time.\n  It was changed, starting with the Jimmy Carter administration, so \nthat no longer is this act that was supposed to protect antiquities--\nthus, the name the Antiquities Act--used to protect antiquities. It was \nused as a political weapon and abused as a political weapon. The \nsaddest part is there is absolutely no input that has to be guaranteed \nby this act.\n  In fact, the vast majority of monuments that were created through \nthis Antiquities Act, there was no public input whatsoever. Any public \ninput that took place was purely by accident, purely by coincidence.\n  The people in the counties that are designated in this amendment need \nto have the right to have some input in how land decisions are used \nthat area. That is what this amendment does.\n  Give them the chance to be heard because, under the present \nAntiquities Act, they are not heard.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Arizona is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would place uncalled-for \nrestrictions and undercut any President from using their authority \nunder the Antiquities Act to establish a national monument, an \nauthority, I should add, that has been available to Presidents for 100 \nyears.\n  The Antiquities Act is an important tool that enables the President \nto protect and strengthen America's heritage. Since Theodore Roosevelt \nfirst designated the national monument Devil's Tower in Wyoming, 16 \nPresidents from both parties have used the Antiquities Act to protect \nmore than 160 of America's best known and loved landscapes. Only three \nPresidents have not.\n  National monuments tell the story of the American people. Out of 460 \nnational monuments and national parks, 113 reflect the diverse \ncommunity that makes up our Nation. Nineteen recognize the achievements \nof the Latino community, twenty-six of the African American community, \nand eight for women.\n  It should be noted that an important factor in the designation \nprocess is the First Americans, the Native Americans, their legacy, \ntheir heritage, and their cultural and historic resources on the land.\n  But with the Antiquities Act, the lack of diversity reflected in our \npublic units, whether it is parks or national monuments, is changing.\n  President Obama has been using the Antiquities Act to diversify the \nstory of public lands with new designations such as the Cesar Chavez \nNational Monument in Keene, California, which he recently designated.\n\n  Since the beginning of his administration, the President used this \nauthority to create national monuments that recognize the contributions \nof Africa Americans and other diverse voices in this country.\n  The Center for American Progress published a report that found that \n33 percent of presidential designations are inclusive of the American \npeople, compared to only 20 percent of the designations done by \nCongress.\n  America's public places are becoming more inclusive, more \nrepresentative of all Americans because of the Antiquities Act. This \namendment would jeopardize that progress. I urge its defeat.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. How much time remains, Mr. Chairman?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Nevada has 30 seconds remaining. \nThe gentleman from Arizona has 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, let me point out some obvious points.\n  This amendment, as I said earlier, would undermine conservation of \npublic lands and stall efforts to ensure that our public places tell \nthe very important diverse story of America and be representative of \nall Americans.\n  Development and conservation--to say that this would deny jobs and \nopportunities to particular regions is not true.\n  Over 9 million acres are available right now under energy leases from \nthe Obama administration compared to--those were added to it--only 4.1 \nmillion acres that are now land that is protected.\n  Since its enactment in 1906, 16 Presidents have used it. 160 of \nAmerica's best known landscapes have been preserved. National monuments \ndesignated under the Antiquities Act are comprised of existing Federal \nlands only. No new lands are added to the Federal estate by these \ndesignations.\n  National monument designations have better reflected the complexity--\nand Presidents have used that--of our Nation, ensuring that the voices \nof a changing and diverse community, which is this country, is told as \nwe change and as we go forward.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote. Undercutting an authority that existed \nfor 100 years that has brought benefit to the Nation, enhanced the \ncultural, historic, and conservation ethics of this Nation should be \npreserved.\n  With that, I urge a ``no'' vote amendment. It is unneeded, \nrestrictive, and goes against a tradition and an authority that has \nexisted in this country for 100 years.\n  I hope this effort is not about who is President at this time, but it \nis an authority that has been with us for 100 years.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, in closing, I would just like to reiterate \nto my colleagues that voting for this amendment is a vote for \nempowering the communities and the local stakeholders most affected by \nthe monument designations.\n  Doing so will increase transparency, allow local input, and provide \nimproved management of our public lands. It will fulfill the \nresponsibility to ensure these communities have a legitimate voice in \nthe process.\n  I strongly urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Engel\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of the Interior, the Environmental \n     Protection Agency, or any other Federal agency to lease or \n     purchase new light duty vehicles for\n\n[[Page H4823]]\n\n     any executive fleet, or for an agency's fleet inventory, \n     except in accordance with Presidential Memorandum--Federal \n     Fleet Performance, dated May 24, 2011.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, on May 24, 2011, President Obama issued a \nmemorandum on Federal fleet performance that required that all new \nlight-duty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternative fuel \nvehicles, such as hybrid, electric, natural gas, or biofuel by December \n31, 2015.\n  My amendment echoes the President's memorandum by prohibiting funds \nin this act from being used to lease or purchase new light-duty \nvehicles unless that purchase is made in accord with the President's \nmemorandum.\n  I have submitted identical amendments to 18 different appropriations \nbills over the past few years, and every time they have been accepted \nby both the majority and the minority. I hope my amendment will receive \nsimilar support today.\n  Global oil prices are down. We no longer pay $147 per barrel. But \ndespite increased production here in the United States, the global \nprice of oil is still largely determined by OPEC.\n  Spikes in oil prices have profound repercussions for our economy. The \nprimary reason is that our cars and trucks run only on petroleum.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  We can change that with alternative technologies that exist today. \nThe Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light-duty \nvehicles in America, over 633,000 vehicles. Almost 35,000 of these \nvehicles are within the jurisdiction of this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I was in Brazil a few years ago, I saw how they \ndiversified their fuel use. People there can drive to a gas station and \nchoose whether to fill their vehicle with gasoline or with ethanol. \nThey make their choice based on cost or whatever criteria they deem \nimportant.\n  I want the same choice for American consumers. That is why I am also \nproposing a bill this Congress, a bipartisan bill, as I have done many \ntimes in the past, which will provide for cars built in America to be \nable to run on a fuel instead of or in addition to gasoline. It is \nvirtually very inexpensive, under $100 per car; and if they do it in \nBrazil, we can do it here.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Chairman, expanding the role these alternative \ntechnologies play in our transportation economy will help break the \nleverage that foreign government controlled oil companies hold over \nAmericans. It will increase our Nation's domestic security and protect \nconsumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask that my colleagues support the Engel amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Byrne\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to propose or develop legislation to redirect funds \n     allocated under section 105(a)(2)(A) of the Gulf of Mexico \n     Energy Security Act of 2006 (43 U.S.C. 1331 note).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, my straightforward amendment would prohibit \nany effort to redirect funds allocated under the Gulf of Mexico Energy \nSecurity Act, also referred to as GOMESA.\n  GOMESA was passed in 2006 and created a revenue sharing agreement for \noffshore oil revenue between the Federal Government and four States in \nthe Gulf of Mexico: Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and my home State of \nAlabama.\n  Under GOMESA, 37.5 percent of the revenues generated from selected \noil and gas lease sales in the Outer Continental Shelf of the Gulf of \nMexico is returned to these Gulf States. There is a reason the law was \nstructured this way.\n  These Gulf States not only provide the lion's share of the \ninfrastructure and workforce for the industry in the Gulf of Mexico; we \nalso have inherent environmental and economic risks. The BP oil spill 5 \nyears ago should tell us all what that means.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, in his budget proposal this year, \nPresident Obama has recommended that the Bureau of Ocean Energy \nManagement, under the Department of the Interior, redirect the \ndistribution of expanded revenue payments expected to start in 2018 for \nthe Gulf of Mexico oil and gas leases away from the Gulf Coast and \ninstead be spent all around the country.\n  Not only does this proposal directly contradict the current Federal \nstatute, it vastly undermines the purpose of the law, to keep revenues \nfrom these lease sales in the States that supply the workforce and have \nthe inherent risk of a potential environmental and economic disaster.\n  My amendment today is simple, to protect the clearly defined statute \nand prevent the President from using these revenue sharing agreements \nas a slush fund for politically driven environmental projects across \nthe country.\n  Regardless of whether you are from a Gulf Coast State or not, I would \nurge my colleagues to vote in favor of this important amendment to \nprotect the rule of law to support our coastal communities.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nwould urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to express a \nfew concerns.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment is an overreaction to a \npolicy proposal in the administration's--in the administration's--2016 \nbudget request.\n  The President's budget requested to propose to direct funds currently \nallocated to payments to States and shift them more towards Federal \nprograms that serve the Nation more broadly.\n  Now, this is a proposal that the President suggested in his budget, \nand it wasn't included in this bill because the Appropriations \nCommittee just flat out rejected it. This is an appropriations process. \nThat is what it is. It is a process.\n  The administration submitted a proposal. The committee evaluated it. \nIt had the power to accept it or reject it. The proposal lay with the \ncommittee as to what to do. As I said, the committee rejected it.\n  This amendment would unnecessarily stifle any proposals to amend \ncurrent formula, which is unnecessary because Congress would need to \nenact legislation before any changes could be made to the formula.\n  The Department of the Interior doesn't have the authority to change \nthe formula through rulemaking or other administrative action. \nBasically, this amendment would prohibit the Department from even \nsuggesting an idea for Congress to consider.\n  I just wanted to claim the time in opposition, Mr. Chair, just to say \nI really think this amendment--although it appears that the majority is \ngoing to take it and I am not going to ask for a vote or anything on \nit--is just really, in my opinion, political overreach.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Chairman, I wish that these sorts of amendments were \nunnecessary, but the way this administration plays fast and loose with \nits interpretation of the law, particularly through these \nadministrative agencies, I am afraid it is necessary to protect a law \npassed by this Congress in 2006 in recognition of the inherent risk \nthat these four Gulf States have produced so much energy for this \ncountry have, and\n\n[[Page H4824]]\n\nwithout it, we will have an agency that will take the laws that exist--\neven this appropriations bill--and interpret it the way they want to, \nand this amendment makes it very clear they can't do that, that these \nfour coastal States will retain control over these moneys as it was \nenacted by this Congress in 2006.\n  Mr. Chairman, I respect the gentlewoman's point of view. I wish it \nwere unnecessary, but given the behavior of this administration through \nthese administrative agencies, I am afraid it is necessary.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask for the Members to support this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 34 Offered by Mr. Grayson\n\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any offeror or any of \n     its principals if the offeror certifies, pursuant to the \n     Federal Acquisition Regulation, that the offeror or any of \n     its principals--\n       (1) within a three-year period preceding this offer has \n     been convicted of or had a civil judgment rendered against it \n     for commission of fraud or a criminal offense in connection \n     with obtaining, attempting to obtain, or performing a public \n     (Federal, State, or local) contract or subcontract; violation \n     of Federal or State antitrust statutes relating to the \n     submission of offers; or commission of embezzlement, theft, \n     forgery, bribery, falsification or destruction of records, \n     making false statements, tax evasion, violating Federal \n     criminal tax laws, or receiving stolen property; or\n       (2) are presently indicted for, or otherwise criminally or \n     civilly charged by a governmental entity with, commission of \n     any of the offenses enumerated in paragraph (1); or\n       (3) within a three-year period preceding this offer, has \n     been notified of any delinquent Federal taxes in an amount \n     that exceeds $3,000 for which the liability remains \n     unsatisfied.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. GRAYSON. Mr. Chair, this amendment is identical to other \namendments that have been inserted by voice vote into every \nappropriations bill considered under an open rule during the 113th and \n114th Congresses.\n  My amendment expands the list of parties with whom the Federal \nGovernment is prohibited from contracting due to serious misconduct on \nthe part of the contractor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n      limitation on use of funds with respect to valuation of coal\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to finalize, implement, or enforce subparts F and J \n     of part 1206 of the proposed rule by the Department of the \n     Interior entitled ``Consolidated Federal Oil & Gas and \n     Federal & Indian Coal Valuation Reform'' and dated January 6, \n     2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 608).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Montana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of economic \nopportunity for local communities across the Nation.\n  In my home State of Montana, the Crow Nation suffers from \nunemployment rates as high as 50 percent, despite having over $1 \nbillion in coal reserves. Similar situations play out in communities \nacross America. This administration has waged a war against coal. In \nthe words of Crow Chairman Old Coyote: ``A war on coal is a war on the \nCrow people.''\n  Republicans and Democrats agree; we all want clean air and water and \naffordable power. Thankfully, advances in technology have made it \npossible to have both, making it possible to use our vast resources of \nclean coal to power American homes and manufacturers and put Americans \nback to work. We can't power the American economy on pixie dust and \nhope; it takes innovation and investment in areas like clean coal.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, this administration is fighting a more \naggressive war against American coal than they are against ISIS. We all \nknow of countless attempts to kill coal with regulations, cap-and-\ntrade, and carbon taxes.\n  Now, the most recent attempt is by the Department of the Interior. \nThe DOI is planning to change how coal on Federal lands and \nreservations is valued, creating an unpredictable and unstable market \nthat threatens the livelihoods of our local communities and tribes.\n  When oil, gas, and coal resources are sold, local communities receive \ntax revenues and royalties to help fund everything from education to \ninfrastructure. However, this administration's one-size-fits-all plan \nputs funding in jeopardy; places heavier burdens on States and local \ngovernments; and also stifles innovation, investment, and job creation.\n  The national labor participation is the lowest it has been in the \npast 30 years. Wages are stagnant; the cost of living is going up, and \nenergy prices for home heating and manufacturing are skyrocketing. Our \ncommunities simply can't afford another Federal assault on our economy.\n  These jobs are real, Mr. Chairman. I have been to the Rosebud Mine in \nColstrip where union jobs earn their paychecks to provide for their \nfamilies. This is not just a couple hundred jobs in Montana. There are \nthousands more like them in Kentucky, West Virginia, Utah, and beyond.\n  Whether the coal is mined in Montana or turned into electricity to \nbuild cars in Michigan, coal is a critical part of our American \neconomy. Again, I am reminded of the words of Chairman Old Coyote: \n``For the Crow people, there are no jobs that compare to a coal job--\nthe wages and benefits exceed anything else that is available.''\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to join me in fighting for \nAmerican workers and American jobs by supporting my amendment to block \nfunding for the Obama administration to continue their war on coal.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nurge the adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  It is a good amendment.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment which would deny the American public, especially Native \nAmericans, a fair return for the use of their coal resources.\n  The current coal valuation regulations have been in effect since \n1989. A lot has happened in the intervening 26 years since these \nregulations were last updated. It has now been nearly 3 years since it \nwas first reported that coal companies were skirting Federal royalty \npayments by selling coal to sister companies in order to value exported \ncoal at low domestic prices rather than the much higher prices these \nsister companies were selling the exported coal for in overseas \nmarkets.\n  Now, while there has been a boom for Western coal companies, it has \nmeant the Federal Government and Western States--where we share 50-50 \nof the royalties--have forgone hundreds of millions of dollars that are \nrightly due the American people.\n  These coal royalty valuations especially hurt Native Americans who \ndepend on these royalties for their income. The proposed regulations \nwere a response to States such as Wyoming pleading with the Department \nof the Interior: Do not allow coal producers to create affiliates to \nreduce the royalties paid.\n\n[[Page H4825]]\n\n  This amendment offers Members a stark contrast. Do they want to side \nwith the coal industry which has been gaming the existing royalty \nsystem? Or do they stand with the American public, especially Native \nAmericans, in seeing that coal is fairly priced and that the royalties \ndue Western States, tribes, and the Federal Government are paid?\n  I, for one, will stand with the American people and especially my \nNative American brothers and sisters to make sure that they are treated \nfairly.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Montana has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\3/4\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Montana for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, current Federal coal valuation rules have provided \nstable and significant royalty revenue to State, tribal, and Federal \ngovernments. Despite this tract record, the Department of the Interior \nhas carelessly proposed to modify the valuation of Federal and Indian \ncoal by granting the Office of Natural Resources Revenue new authority \nto deem sales, potentially disallow costs, and use the default rule to \nassert arbitrary values for royalty purposes.\n  These broad new authorities come without clear or transparent \nguidelines for regulators and regulated parties alike, setting the \nstage for inconsistent valuation and protracted litigation. \nFurthermore, the arbitrary regulatory environment created by this rule \ncould jeopardize affordable and reliable energy production, American \njobs, and crucial revenue for State, Federal, and tribal governments.\n  For these reasons, I encourage my colleagues to support this \namendment and to stop funding for this new rule until the Department of \nthe Interior can demonstrate the need, if there is any--and I am \nskeptical--to radically alter the way royalties are accessed on Federal \ncoal.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, as the sole Representative of the great \nState of Montana, I do represent, and am proud to represent, the Crows, \nthe Northern Cheyenne, the Assiniboine Sioux, and our American Indian \ntribes and great nations and understand the value of having a \nprosperous economy.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I would like the support of all Members.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to repeat, it has now been nearly \n3 years since it was first reported. Coal companies were skirting \nFederal royalty payments by selling coal to sister companies in order \nto value exported coal at low domestic prices rather than the much \nhigher prices these sister companies were selling the exported coal for \nin overseas markets.\n  It is our job--it is our job--to see that coal is fairly priced and \nthat the royalties due to Western States, tribes, and the Federal \nGovernment are paid.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Montana will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Norcross\n\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n                       revision of dollar amounts\n\n       Sec. __. The amounts otherwise provided by this Act are \n     revised by reducing the amount made available for \n     ``Department of the Interior--Office of the Secretary--\n     Departmental Operations'' for payments in lieu of taxes under \n     chapter 69 of title 31, United States Code, and increasing \n     the aggregate amount made available for ``Environmental \n     Protection Agency--Hazardous Substance Superfund'', by \n     $22,884,840.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from New Jersey and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This is a very simple amendment that would increase funding for the \nSuperfund with the intention the money go specifically to the cleanup \nprogram account. Superfund cleanup is right for the environment and \ncertainly right for the U.S. economy, which is right for the U.S.\n  I come from New Jersey, the Garden State. We have great tomatoes, \ncorn, and it is blueberry season. But what we also have, particularly \nin the southern half of the State, is a history of heavy industry.\n  New Jersey found out the hard way that you just can't take those \nresources after they are finished and dump them into the backyard. We \nhave more than 200 sites in New Jersey listed as being in serious \nviolation of at least one of four Federal environmental laws. The \ncompany offenders, they are gone, and left the constituents, my \nconstituents, holding the bags.\n  My predecessor, Representative Jim Florio, back in the early \neighties, was the author of the Superfund bill. He had the vision of \nwhat we have to do to protect our citizens.\n  I just want to tell a quick story, two of them.\n  The first one is one site, $1 billion, and it is about a quarter of a \nmile from where I live. It is the Welsbach & General Gas Mantle in \nGloucester City, New Jersey. As part of that process of making gas \nmantles almost a half century ago, radium, the substance that was used \nto make it glow brighter, was dumped throughout the city. This material \nis now sitting there. Radium has a half-life of 1,600 years--1,600 \nyears. The process started in 1996, and it is about two-thirds \nfinished. There is no company to go back to.\n  The second story is Sherwin Williams in Gibbsboro, which was a \ngorgeous spot. But as we all know, years ago, that lead paint is now in \nthe water system and impacting that area horribly. The site includes \nKirkwood Lake. The soil under the lake is contaminated. They can't use \nthe lake.\n  These are two very simple stories. I have 15 Superfund sites in my \ndistrict--15.\n  It is our responsibility to protect our citizens. There are no \ncompanies to go back to. That is why I offer this simple amendment. The \ndamage is already done, and we must continue to protect our citizens by \nfunding this amendment correctly.\n  I want to thank the chairman, with the understanding that this \namendment will be ruled out of order.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment with \nthe hope that we continue to work on this important issue in a very \nbipartisan way to protect our citizens.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Jolly\n\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to research, investigate, or study offshore drilling \n     in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As a nation, we continually strive to achieve both energy \nindependence, as well as protect the environment, our critical \nhabitats, and the quality of life\n\n[[Page H4826]]\n\nin communities like Pinellas County, Florida, that I have the \nopportunity to represent.\n  One way we strike that balance is represented in how we currently \nmanage the Gulf of Mexico when it comes to oil drilling. Under a 2006 \nact, we allow for drilling exploration in the central and western Gulf \noff the coast of Texas and Louisiana and other States, but we have a \nban that protects the State of Florida. That ban currently protects the \nState of Florida with a drilling ban of about 125 miles or, in some \ncases, 235 miles.\n  This ban has been in place for 32 years through the operations of the \nAppropriations Committee. And while the current statute allows for the \nban through 2022, year after year, those on the other side of this \ndebate, very respectfully, attempt to erode that ban.\n  The truth is we don't need any additional drilling in the eastern \nGulf of Florida to achieve energy independence. There are nearly 1,000 \nactive leaseholds in the central and western Gulf. There are probably \nnearly 3,000 more available. And to change the ban is just something \nthat we don't need.\n  This amendment is very simple. It says none of the funds may be used \nto study, prepare for, research, investigate any increased offshore oil \ndrilling in the eastern Gulf contemplating the expiration of a ban in \n2022.\n  I am pleased to be joined in offering this amendment by my colleague \nfrom Bonita Springs, Mr. Clawson; my colleague from Tallahassee, Ms. \nGraham; and my colleague from Jupiter, Mr. Murphy.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in reluctant opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, as in the case of a number of offshore-\nrelated amendments that we will deal with today, the Interior \nAppropriations bill is not the appropriate venue, though I do \nunderstand it has been used in the past.\n  I understand this amendment dovetails with the current congressional \nmoratorium, and the Department of the Interior has no intention of \nacting in a manner that is contrary to congressional intent. The \nDepartment is focused on the next 5-year oil and gas leasing plan, \nwhich is limited to 2017-2022, so many departmental activities in \nfiscal year 2016 are already limited in scope through 2022. If my \ncolleagues wish to see the moratorium extended beyond 2022, then they \nshould work with the appropriate authorizing committees.\n  With that, I would oppose the amendment, and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the chairman's understanding of \nthe interest of those in the State of Florida and the current debate \ncurrently from those on the other side that wish to actually lift the \nban. It is important that, as a delegation, we have the opportunity to \nhave this debate.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Clawson), my \ncolleague from Bonita Springs.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I start by thanking \nRepresentative Jolly for his leadership and persistence on this issue--\nit is so important to my district--and to the chairman for allowing \ndisagreement. Disagreement allows learning, and we appreciate your \nleadership in this regard.\n  I speak in full support of Representative Jolly's amendment. I base \nmy support on the enormous all-time high, proven reserves elsewhere in \nour country and a conviction that we can focus in areas other than the \nGulf.\n  The private sector definitely needs cheap oil, and our businesses, \nour manufacturing companies, cannot be successful without low energy \nprices. I know it, because I lived it.\n  But let's drill where drilling makes sense. And to us, it doesn't \nmake sense to drill in the eastern Gulf of Mexico. The recent BP \nsettlement, the highest such settlement ever, is evidence that the \neconomic and environmental risk of drilling in the Gulf greatly offset \nany potential returns.\n  For those of us who live, work, or have business in the Gulf, we were \ntold that an oil disaster could never happen, and then it happened. \nFool me once, shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me.\n  I say it is not worth the risk. I say let's do everything we can to \nnever have more drilling in the eastern Gulf.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would just say that, again, I am in \nreluctant opposition to this amendment. This should be dealt with in \nthe authorizing committees.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Chairman, I would close by offering my colleagues \nthere is authorizing legislation that would extend the ban past the \nyear 2022.\n  This language simply says a ban is a ban is a ban. And while there is \na ban on activities on drilling and the like, this simply says that no \nplanning may occur for post-2022 drilling.\n  With that, I would urge a ``yea'' vote, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used in \n     contravention of Executive Order 13693.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I think I will start this discussion \nwith the words of a rather influential individual: Pope Francis. In his \nrecent encyclical, he wrote: ``If present trends continue, this century \nmay well witness extraordinary climate change and an unprecedented \ndestruction of ecosystems, with serious consequences for all of us.'' \nThat is Pope Francis.\n  In this legislation, the appropriation bill, there are numerous \nefforts to deny the reality of climate change. And, specifically, what \nI want to deal with on this amendment is Executive Order No. 13693: \nPlanning for Federal Sustainability in the Next Decade.\n  The intention of this amendment is to support the Federal \nGovernment's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 40 percent \nover the next decade relative to 2008.\n  This bill will save taxpayers money--about $18 billion--in avoided \nenergy costs, and it will increase the share of electricity the Federal \nGovernment consumes from renewable resources by up to 30 percent. \nTwenty-six million metric tons of greenhouse gases would be eliminated.\n  So why in the face of all of the scientific evidence and why in the \nface of the reality that the climate is, indeed, changing, when we have \nthroughout the State of California and around the Nation local \ngovernments planning for the eventually, not the reality, of higher sea \nlevels, would we put forth a bill that would prohibit the Federal \nGovernment from planning for climate change?\n  Let me just cite some of the ways in which the current legislation, \nthis proposal, deals with it:\n  It prohibits Federal funds for any rulemaking or guidance with regard \nto the social cost of climate change.\n  It prohibits the EPA from limiting carbon pollution from new and \nrenovated power plants, and there has been much discussion about that \non the floor today.\n  It prohibits the funding to update and revise the EPA's ozone \nstandards.\n  It prohibits the funding for any change to the status of HFCs. These \nare fluorocarbons.\n  It also prohibits the reporting detailing the Federal funding for \ndomestic and international climate change programs. This is denial, \ndenial, denial about what is really happening.\n  My amendment would simply say that there is no money to carry out \nthese provisions in the current bill. It is really time for all of us \nhere to recognize that there is a serious challenge, and it is one that \nPope Francis points out so clearly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4827]]\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, climate change is winning the amendment \ncontest tonight. We have had a number of amendments on that subject.\n  Earlier we debated whether or not to continue a bipartisan reporting \nrequirement in the bill on climate change expenditures.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle wanted to remove that \nrequirement, which would have reduced transparency. Now my friend wants \nto ensure that funds are being expended on climate and efficiency \nexecutive orders issued by the President.\n  So I am left to wonder whether my colleagues would prefer to know if \nthe funds are spent on these programs or not.\n  Regardless, this amendment is certainly unnecessary. The President \ndid not consult Congress on these executive orders. If anything, we \nshould defund these programs until Congress can have an appropriate \npolicy debate. I see no reason to include this language, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, the executive order by the President is \nvery straightforward. It basically says that the Federal Government \nshall reduce greenhouse gases, and he is using his appropriate \nauthority as the administrative agent of our government to find ways to \ndo that.\n  Certain goals are set in the executive order, for example, reducing \ngreenhouse gases by 40 percent over the next decade. What could be \nwrong with that when you save $18 billion in the process and create \nmore opportunities for renewable energy by up to 30 percent?\n  Why would we pass a bill in this appropriation bill that would go in \nexactly the opposite direction, one that would actually create greater \ngreenhouse gases and lead more directly and more imminently to the \nclimate crisis?\n  I fail to understand why we would want to take up a piece of \nlegislation that has so many provisions in it that deny the reality of \nclimate change, that puts this government on the course to spend more \nmoney on programs that actually create a crisis that will be \nextraordinarily expensive.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote on this amendment, which would maintain the \nPresident's executive order and keep America on a path that all the \nworld should carry out.\n  Pay attention to what Pope Francis said: ``If present trends \ncontinue, this century may well witness extraordinary climate change \nand an unprecedented destruction of ecosystems, with serious \nconsequences for all of us.''\n  This is not something we should deny. This is something we should, in \nfact, pay attention to, and we ought to be able to maintain the \nPresident's executive order.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, the President did make his unilateral \ndetermination in an executive order. We have an opportunity to vote \n``no'' on this amendment, and I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Crawford\n\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to enforce the requirements of part 112 of title 40, \n     Code of Federal Regulations, with respect to any farm (as \n     that term is defined in section 112.2 of such title).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I offer this amendment in defense of \nagricultural producers across our Nation who are facing the heavy hand \nof EPA regulations.\n  The EPA's Spill Prevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule for on-\nfarm fuel storage requires farmers and ranchers to make costly \ninfrastructure improvements to their oil storage facilities to reduce \nthe possibility of an oil spill.\n  These regulations fail to take into account the relative risk of oil \nspills on farms, and they do not factor in the simple fact that family \nfarmers are already careful stewards of our land and water. No one has \nmore at stake in the health of their land than those who work on the \nground from which they derive their livelihoods.\n  The USDA itself discovered little evidence of oil spills on farms and \ndetermined in a recent study that more than 99 percent of farmers have \nnever experienced a spill.\n  To require that all of our producers make a significant investment to \nprevent such an unlikely event seems out of touch with reality and \ndisregards the already overwhelming number of safeguards our farmers \nalready employ.\n  My amendment would restrict the EPA's ability to enforce SPCC \nregulations on farms so that farmers and ranchers can go about their \nbusiness of producing food and fiber without having to worry about \nunnecessary compliance costs and red tape.\n  On three separate occasions, the House unanimously passed my \nbipartisan legislation, the FUELS Act, which rolled back these same \nSPCC regulations on farms. I urge my colleagues to again support our \nfarmers and ranchers by supporting this amendment.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I would urge the adoption of the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would stop the EPA from \nrequiring farms to submit a plan on how they will prevent oil from \nentering navigable waters.\n  I come from Minnesota; so, this seems like a pretty commonsense \nrequirement to me. If a facility has large amounts of oil, it should \ntell the agency responsible for an inland oil spill cleanup how it will \nprevent an environmental disaster.\n  Why shouldn't the holder of gallons of oil have a plan even if it is \nan agriculture business? It should have a plan. And there are criteria \nto make sure that a facility truly should be subject to the Spill \nPrevention, Control, and Countermeasure rule.\n  It has to meet three criteria. It must be nontransported. It must \nhave an aggregate aboveground storage capacity greater than 1,320 \ngallons or a completely buried storage capacity greater than 42,000 \ngallons. We are talking about a lot of oil.\n  The third point is that there must be a reasonable expectation that, \nif something were to go wrong and if there were a discharge, it would \ngo into navigable waters of the United States or of adjoining \nshorelines.\n  In other words, if there is an accident and if there is water nearby, \nyou would need to have a plan in place so that not only would oil not \nseep in and ruin your land, but that it would not flow into waters past \nthe boundaries of your water and just keep polluting.\n  The preparation of the SPCC plan is the responsibility of a facility \nowner or operator or it can be prepared by an engineer or a consultant, \nbut it must be certified by a registered professional engineer.\n  Let's just think about it. You have 42,000 gallons of oil stored \nunderground, and you have 1,320 gallons of oil above. All this does is \nsay you need to have an emergency plan if, when that accident would \noccur--and it can\n\n[[Page H4828]]\n\noccur--there would be the possibility of having that oil go into \nnavigable waters and spread onto other property owners' land or State \nland or Federal land.\n  I think these sound like reasonable requirements. It is a small step \nto help work with the farmer to prevent an environmental disaster that \nwould most likely end up being cleaned up with taxpayers' funds.\n  I always think you should hope for the best, but you always need to \nhave a plan just in case something goes wrong. This rule requirement \nmakes sure that these facilities that meet these criteria have a plan \nin place.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The question is on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Jeffries\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available to the National \n     Park Service by this Act may be used for the purchase or \n     display of a confederate flag with the exception of specific \n     circumstances where the flags provide historical context as \n     described in the National Park Service memorandum entitled \n     ``Immediate Action Required, No Reply Needed: Confederate \n     Flags'' and dated June 24, 2015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the use of \nfunds made available to the National Park Service by this Act for the \npurchase or display of a Confederate flag with the exception of \nspecific circumstances when such flags provide historical context as \nset forth by the National Park Service in their memo to all park \nsuperintendents, dated June 24, 2015.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  The National Park Service has jurisdiction over operation of the \nNational Park System, associated sites such as national heritage areas, \nand various State grant accounts.\n  In light of recent events, the display of the Confederate flag has \nbeen at the forefront of discussion throughout our Nation. This \namendment is consistent with a bipartisan effort across the country to \npromote harmony and not division in this great Nation.\n  On June 17, we were all shocked by the heinous massacre that took the \nlives of nine God-fearing African American churchgoers in Charleston, \nSouth Carolina. This act of domestic terror was carried out by an \nindividual who idolized the Confederate flag and harbored racist \nbeliefs, calling for a return to the human subjugation of others on the \nbasis of race.\n  Unfortunately, that same Confederate flag flew on the grounds of the \nState capitol amidst the funeral of a State senator and dedicated \npastor who taught that we are all God's children at the historic \nEmanuel AME Church.\n  We have come a long way in America, but we still have a long way to \ngo in our march toward a more perfect Union. The cancer of racial \nhatred continues to adversely impact our society, and people of good \nwill must unite to eradicate it. Limiting the use of Federal funds \nconnected to the purchase or display of the Confederate flag is an \nimportant step in that direction.\n  Earlier today, lawmakers in South Carolina from both sides of the \naisle came together to support removing the Confederate battle flag \nfrom their State capitol grounds. This evening, the United States House \nof Representatives has the opportunity to further limit the public \ndisplay of this divisive symbol that is so closely associated with \ndefense of the institution of slavery.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their consideration. \nFor the aforementioned reasons, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from Minnesota.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I am very happy that this opportunity has \nbeen presented for us to have a discussion on the House floor and the \nNational Park Service doing the right thing about the removal of this \nsymbol of what has become racist hate speech.\n  I thank the gentleman for bringing forward the amendment, and I rise \nin support of it.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for her support.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Jeffries).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment Offered by Mr. Smith of Texas\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to propose, \n     finalize, implement, or revise any regulation in which the \n     research data relied on to support such action is subject to \n     OMB Circular A-110 and is withheld in contravention of the \n     Freedom of Information Act as prescribed under OMB Circular \n     A-110 or if the Science Advisory Board of the Environmental \n     Protection Agency fails to provide scientific advice as may \n     be requested on such regulation to the Congress in \n     contravention of section 4365 of title 42, United States \n     Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment reflects the core \nprinciples of two bills passed by the House earlier this year with \nbipartisan support. They are H.R. 1029, the EPA Science Advisory Board \nReform Act, and H.R. 1030, the Secret Science Reform Act.\n  I am pleased to be joined by the Committee on Science, Space, and \nTechnology's former Subcommittee on Environment chairman, \nRepresentative David Schweikert, who sponsored the original version of \nthe Secret Science bill in 2014.\n  The amendment simply requires the Environmental Protection Agency to \nbase its regulations on publicly available data that can be verified. \nWhy would the administration want to hide this information from the \nAmerican people? We must make sure that Federal regulations are based \non science that is available for independent review.\n  Many Americans are unaware that some of the EPA's most expensive and \nburdensome regulations, such as its proposed climate and ozone rules, \nare based on underlying data that not even the EPA has seen.\n  This amendment ensures that the decisions that affect every American \nare based on independently verified, unbiased, scientific research \ninstead of on secret data that is hidden from the American people. That \nis called the scientific method.\n  This amendment also ensures that the EPA Science Advisory Board is \nable to provide meaningful, balanced, and independent assessments of \nthe science behind the EPA regulations. The EPA frequently undermines \nthe SAB's independence and prevents it from being able to provide \nadvice to Congress. As a result, the valuable advice these experts can \nprovide is often ignored or silenced.\n  The public's right to know must be protected in a democracy. This \namendment ensures that happens. The EPA has a responsibility to be open \nand transparent with the people it serves and whose money it uses.\n  Anyone who supports government transparency and accountability should \nbe able to support this amendment. It helps EPA and the Obama \nadministration keep their promise to be open and honest with the \nAmerican people.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Calvert), the Appropriations subcommittee \nchairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman. I certainly rise in \nsupport of this amendment. Having chaired that subcommittee for 6 years \nand knowing the good work of that subcommittee, I think the intent of \nthe\n\n[[Page H4829]]\n\nlanguage aligns with the two authorizing bills passed by the House \nCommittee on Science, Space, and Technology earlier this year. I \ncertainly voted for them both times.\n  I think it is a good amendment, so I urge an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his \ncomments. I very much appreciate his support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment seeks to stop \nthe Environmental Protection Agency from issuing regulations through \ntwo different mechanisms.\n  The first one would prevent the EPA from issuing regulations if \nsupporting research data is withheld under the Freedom of Information \nAct.\n  Second, it would withhold regulations if the Agency's Science \nAdvisory Board does not provide the requested advice and information to \nCongress.\n  I would just like to take a moment to address each one of these \nissues fully. Last year, for example, the EPA received 10,500 FOIA \nrequests--Freedom of Information requests--or an average of 40 per \nworkday.\n  These requests required nearly $11 million--$11 million--in personnel \ncosts to process; yet the EPA receives less than $1 million to collect \nfees for these requests. They get $11 million in personnel costs to \nprocess; yet they get less than $1 million to collect the fees for \nthese requests. You can simply do the math.\n  There are only nine allowable exemptions under the law that would \nprevent the EPA from complying with FOIA requests in the first place. \nThese exemptions range from classified national defense, foreign \nrelations information, to confidential business information and matters \nof personal privacy, things which we discuss in this room all the time.\n  The amendment is simply another attempt to stop the EPA from issuing \nregulations, many of which are required by law and are designed to \nimprove human health and the environment.\n  Now, that was in regards to the first point about EPA issuing \nregulations on the Freedom of Information Act, lack of funding \navailable to do it, and then they are following the laws with the nine \nexemptions.\n  Now, with regard to the Science Advisory Board, let me remind my \ncolleagues that these boards are comprised of nearly four dozen experts \nfrom academia. For example, there are academics from the University of \nTexas Health Science Center in Houston, Texas; the Environmental \nSystems and Research Institute in Redlands, California; and from the \nUniversity of Minnesota, my home State.\n  Now, in my opinion, it is very disingenuous to suggest that this \nAdvisory Board's subject matter of experts would withhold information \nto Congress. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, which \nsimply puts two more roadblocks in the EPA regulations.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 15 seconds simply to \npoint out that this amendment does not prevent the EPA from issuing any \nregulations.\n  In fact, it doesn't take a position on regulations. It simply says \nthat the underlying data that the EPA is using to justify regulations \nneeds to be made public. I don't know who could oppose transparency and \nhonesty by this administration.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert), who as I mentioned a while \nago is a former chairman of the Subcommittee on Energy of the Committee \non Science, Space, and Technology and is now a member of the Committee \non Financial Services.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire into the remaining time \non our side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chair, in this 45 seconds, I want to walk through \na couple mechanical things really quickly. First off, this amendment is \nbased on the OMB's circular that actually said this data is supposed to \nbe public.\n  Number two, the release of data, if you are making rules, does not \npre-assume that the reg is too tough, too little, too soft. What it \nmeans is, if you are going to be doing public policy--public policy--\ndoesn't the public deserve access to public data because there is lots \nof smart people out there on the left and the right or just academia \nthat should have this information, this raw data, to decide are we \ndoing it the most rational, the most powerful way?\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to once again reiterate \nthere are only nine allowable exemptions under this law that would \nprevent the EPA from complying with FOIA requests.\n  These exemptions range from classified national defense, foreign \nrelations information, confidential business information, and matters \nof personal privacy.\n  Once again, Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nwhich simply works to put roadblocks in front of the EPA ever being \nable to issue a regulation.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Ms. Speier\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the final rule \n     following the Supplemental Environmental Impact Statement for \n     the Dog Management Plan (Plan/SEIS), Golden Gate National \n     Recreation Area (GGNRA), California (78 Fed. Reg. 55094; \n     September 9, 2013).\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentlewoman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman from California and \na Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Chairman, ``Ruff.'' That is what my dog Buddy says \nwhen he wants to go out for a walk, and that is what dogs throughout \nthe bay area have been accustomed to doing in the Golden Gate National \nRecreation Area for decades.\n  I, like them, believe that the GGNRA should be able to afford the \nopportunity for people to recreate, whether one wants to watch a bird, \nride a horse, walk a path, or climb a hill. Some of these uses are \nincompatible, but that doesn't mean we should ban them. That means that \nwe should create opportunity for all.\n  In San Mateo County, in my district, the GGNRA is proposing zero off-\nleash dog areas, closing down one site that has been in operation for \nover many decades.\n  For 40 years, people and their dogs have been welcome at the beaches \nand trails of the GGNRA, which compromises 80,000 acres across San \nFrancisco, Marin, and San Mateo Counties. This public land provides \nmuch-needed recreational space in the densely populated bay area.\n  Today, that access is at risk. The National Park Service is trying to \ndramatically change how it manages recreational areas in the bay area \nby turning the majority of open space in the GGNRA into what are called \ncontrolled zones, where visitor access and activities could be highly \nrestricted. Public use could be denied for longstanding activities in \nthe GGNRA, like hiking, surfing, bike riding, horseback riding, and dog \nwalking.\n  The bay area is densely populated, and open space is precious. For \nmany, the GGNRA is the only option for time outdoors.\n  My amendment would slow the National Park Service's regulatory \noverreach and ensure that people in the bay\n\n[[Page H4830]]\n\narea continue to have recreational access to these urban parks.\n  People and nature aren't incompatible. We can be good stewards and \nalso allow those in the GGNRA to have access to this very beautiful \narea.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote, Mr. Chairman, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  If not, the Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination as to whether a rule ``follows'' a specified \nEnvironmental Impact Statement.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n            Amendment Offered by Mr. Rice of South Carolina\n\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n      limitation on use of funds for offshore oil and gas leasing\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue any oil and gas lease under the 2017-2022 \n     Outer Continental Shelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program unless \n     the Secretary of the Interior has entered into revenue \n     sharing agreement with each affected State.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from South Carolina \nand a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, my amendment withholds \nfunding for permitting of offshore oil exploration until the Secretary \nof the Interior reaches revenue-sharing agreements with coastal States.\n  The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management's 2017-2022 Outer Continental \nShelf Oil and Gas Leasing Program opens the mid- and south Atlantic \nregions to oil and gas development after several decades of being off-\nlimits.\n  While advanced drilling techniques and spill response have made \nenvironmentally safe access to oil and gas reserves in the Atlantic \npossible, coastal States should consider and prepare for impacts that \noffshore energy development present.\n  Sharing of revenues with coastal States will help address the risk \nand responsibilities that States and coastal counties assume with \noffshore energy development. These revenues would help State \ngovernments expand coastal management and conservation, build necessary \ninfrastructure, fund emergency preparation and response, and expand \npublic service to support the influx of new industry and workforce.\n  Involving the coastal infrastructure and management will add to the \noverall economic well-being of the coastal communities. Before our \ncoastal States agree to share in the burden of offshore drilling, we \nought to ensure that our coastal States are able to share in the \neconomic blessings of such drilling.\n  My amendment would prohibit funding for implementation of BOEM's plan \nuntil the Secretary of the Interior enters into a revenue sharing \nagreement with the States affected.\n  While it may not be possible this evening to adopt my amendment for \ncoastal States, as we move forward with energy exploration off our \ncoastlines, please be mindful of revenue sharing.\n  Because I understand my amendment is subject to a point of order, I \nplan to withdraw this amendment. But before I withdraw my amendment, I \nask for the chairman's consideration to assist in development of \nrevenue sharing agreements to compensate the coastal States and help \nthem to mitigate risk.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I would be happy to work with the gentleman in the \nfuture to see if there is a methodology where we can move your idea \nforward and see if we can't get the Federal Government and States to \ncooperate to their mutual, I think, benefit on this issue.\n  Mr. RICE of South Carolina. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the \nchairman's consideration.\n  I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 23 Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n           prohibition on transfer of fire preparedness funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to transfer funds made available by this Act for fire \n     preparedness activities to the Wildland Fire Management \n     appropriation for fire suppression activities.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, I am trying to figure out where to start \nwith this, because we are making progress. I guess the purpose of this \namendment is to give this whole process a swift kick so we can actually \ndo something that is absolutely necessary.\n  The chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee really has it \ncorrect. And I want to read the language of the appropriations bill, \nwhich I happen to agree with this evening, but not the result.\n\n       In 7 of the last 10 years, the Forest Service and the \n     Department of the Interior have exceeded their wildland fire \n     suppression budgets despite being fully funded at the 10-year \n     suppression average for such costs.\n       Fire seasons have grown longer and more destructive, \n     putting people, communities, and ecosystems at greater risk. \n     Fire borrowing has now become routine rather than \n     extraordinary. Borrowing from nonfire accounts to pay \n     suppression costs results in the Forest Service and \n     Department of the Interior having fewer resources for forest \n     management activities, including hazardous fuels management \n     and other proven efforts, to improve overall forest health \n     and reduce the risk of catastrophic wildland fires.\n\n  Mr. Chairman of the subcommittee, you have it right. You and your \ncommittee staff have done the right analysis but haven't completed the \nfollow-through to achieve that goal.\n  I see our good friend from Idaho standing nearby, and he has a very, \nvery fine bill to deal with this. It would basically create two \nseparate accounts. Now, understanding the necessity of proper order and \nbeing out of order, which sometimes I am, I am not proposing that we \nadopt the good gentleman from Idaho's bill in this bill, but I have got \na different idea. I am going to take this idea from my Republican \ncolleagues who have created so many fiscal crises, otherwise known as \ncliffs, to create one.\n  Basically, what I am doing here with this amendment is saying you \ncan't borrow from other accounts, and when you run out of money, my \ngoodness, we have a crisis. We will have to then adopt my good friend \nfrom Idaho's legislation and solve the problem once and for all.\n  So that is what this amendment does. It says you can't borrow from \nother accounts to fight wildfires, which means that we are going to \nhave to come to grips with the reality of our funding crisis--where we \ncannot get ahead of the wildland fires, where there is a necessity for \nus to spend money on\n\n[[Page H4831]]\n\nprotecting the forests and forest health, thinning and other kinds of \nthings, firebreaks and the like, so we don't just burn down all the \nforests to get around with the proper management. This is what you call \nkicking the issue into gear.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Idaho is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I understand what the gentleman is trying to do, and we \nare on the same page, actually, in ultimately what we want to \naccomplish with this.\n  The fact is that we appropriate money--the Interior Subcommittee has \ndone it for several years now, and Chairman Calvert has done it in this \nbill--where, under the FLAME Act, we fund the 10-year average of what \nit costs to fight wildfires. Unfortunately, I think it is in 8 of the \nlast 10 years we have exceeded that 10-year average. Consequently, when \nmoney runs out for fighting wildfires, what the Forest Service does is \nborrow that money from other accounts.\n  We sometimes complain that the Forest Service doesn't go out and do \nthe thinning that is necessary or do the restoration that is necessary \nor do the trail maintenance that is necessary. The reason they can't do \nit is because we have borrowed all the money to fight wildfires, and we \nare trying to prevent that wildfire borrowing.\n  It is one thing to try to prevent it in a manner that will address \nthe problem and another to just say you just can't borrow, because I \nwould hate to be in the situation where we run up against a fire year \nwhere we are going to exceed the 10-year average, we run out of \nfirefighting money, and there is no way to get the resources in order \nto fund the fires that are occurring in the latter part of the year. \nThis would put pressure on for Congress to probably do something.\n  As you know, there is a challenge with the Budget Committee that we \nhave been working with in trying to address this issue.\n  There is some language, as I understand it, in the Senate Interior \nbill dealing with the wildfire-fighting costs and how we handle that. \nThere is some language in a bill that will be before us I think this \nweek, the Healthy Forest bill out of the Resources Committee.\n  I think more and more people are starting to realize that we have got \nto address this problem. There is absolutely no reason that wildfires \nshould not be treated as other natural disasters are--hurricanes, \ntornadoes, earthquakes, and other things. But for some reason, we treat \nwildfires differently, and that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.\n  So we have had various proposals. I have talked with the \nadministration, with the Department of the Interior, with the Forest \nService, and with many other people, trying to come to a resolution on \nthis, and there are many people on both the Republican and the \nDemocratic side of the aisle that are trying to address this.\n  I am hopeful that we are inching ever closer, because you know things \ndon't move as quickly as we like oftentimes in Congress. We are moving, \ninching closer, I would hope, to finding the solution to this. There \nare different ideas out there about how to go about doing exactly what \nthe gentleman from California, myself, and the chairman all want to do, \nand that is quit the fire borrowing so that the Forest Service can do \nthe job that we appropriate the money for them to do.\n  Given that this could create some real problems, I appreciate what \nthe gentleman is trying to do, but I would have to oppose the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members not to traffic the \nwell.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. My good friend from Idaho has it right. His bill ought \nto become law. And you did find a way to fund it: the same way we fund \nhurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, and the like--out of FEMA.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Good bill--by the way, I am a coauthor of it. Thank you very much. \nOnly you can prevent forest fires. How many times have we seen Smokey \nthe Bear? Congress can help.\n  I want to congratulate and I really want to thank my colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle because you are in a position to lead on \nthis. This amendment is in a position to cause action. That is all it \nis.\n  Would we have a disaster? We are going to have a fire disaster; there \nis no doubt about it.\n  Would we have a financing disaster? Probably, but we can solve it--we \ncan solve it both with legislation, and then we can solve it with a \npiece of legislation moving through this House that would reach back to \nthe FEMA money, where we always stack a huge stash of money for the \neventuality of a disaster. We would reach back and say: Okay. That is \nhow we are going to do it going forward.\n  I think it is about time for me to yield. I probably don't have much \nmore time, but I am kind of stirring the pot here. I am trying to kick \nthis into gear, and I am delighted to work with the good language that \nthe chairman of the committee has put into the bill.\n  Had I the time, I would read, once again, your analysis of the \nproblem and also your analysis of the solution. That is found in, this \nyear, H.R. 167, a fine piece of legislation by an outstanding gentleman \nfrom Idaho.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I thank the gentleman for his comments and his help on \ntrying to get us to a resolution on this. I am sure, working together, \nwe can solve this problem eventually.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\nlimitation on use of funds to treat gray wolves in washington, oregon, \n          and utah as endangered species or threatened species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Interior or the United States \n     Fish and Wildlife Service to treat any gray wolf (Canis \n     lupus) in Washington, Oregon, or Utah as an endangered \n     species or threatened species under the Endangered Species \n     Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that \nwould prohibit the Department of the Interior and the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service from using funds to continue listing the gray wolf \nunder the Endangered Species Act in the States of Washington, Oregon, \nand Utah.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a very serious issue of extreme importance to \nmy home State of Washington, where the gray wolf is listed in the \nwestern two-thirds of the State, but is delisted in the eastern third. \nThis fragmented listing means that there are no geographic barriers to \nprevent the wolves from traveling between listed and delisted areas, \nposing a risk to people living, farming, and ranching in the region.\n  Unfortunately, this issue should already have been settled. In June \nof 2013, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service published a proposed rule \nto remove the gray wolf from the list of endangered and threatened \nwildlife under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service made this determination after \nevaluating this ``classification status of gray wolves currently listed \nin the contiguous United States'' and found the ``best available \nscience and commercial information indicates that the currently listed \nentity is not a valid species under the Act.''\n  On June 30 of this year, the Service released its response to a \npetition seeking to reclassify all gray wolves in the U.S. as a \nthreatened species under ESA. In its response, the Fish and Wildlife \nService states that it determined there was not substantial information \nto indicate that such a reclassification was warranted, and as a \nresult, the Fish and Wildlife Service will take no further action on \nthe petition.\n\n[[Page H4832]]\n\n  Furthermore, the statutory purpose of ESA is to recover a species to \nthe point where it is no longer considered endangered or threatened. \nThe gray wolf is currently found in nearly 50 countries around the \nworld, and the wolf specialist group of the International Union for \nConservation of Nature has placed the species in the category of \n``least concern globally'' for risk of extinction.\n  Mr. Chairman, the proposed rule and other examples I have cited \nclearly show that a full delisting of the gray wolf is long overdue. \nSince wolves were first placed under ESA, uncontrolled and unmanaged \ngrowth of gray wolf populations has resulted in devastating impacts on \nhunting and ranching, as well as tragic losses to historically strong \nand healthy livestock and wildlife populations.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gray wolf population has grown substantially across \nits range and is now considered to be recovered; therefore, it does not \nmerit protection under the Endangered Species Act.\n  The Pacific Northwest States are fully qualified to responsibly \nmanage their gray wolf populations and are better suited than the \nFederal Government to meet the needs of local communities, ranchers, \nlivestock, and wildlife populations.\n  My amendment today is simple. It would take steps that the Fish and \nWildlife Service has already said are necessary and are supported by \nthe best available scientific evidence and data. I urge my colleagues \nto support this commonsense amendment, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to my colleague from eastern \nWashington, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, \nRepresentative Newhouse, for yielding and for his leadership on this \nimportant issue.\n  Four years ago, when the Federal Government delisted wolves in a \nportion of the Western United States, what was left behind was a \ngrowing wolf population and a confusing checkerboard of regulations.\n  Wolves do not know regulatory boundaries. When a single forest is \ndivided between two different management plans, local leaders', \nfarmers', and other stakeholders' hands are tied when protecting \nthemselves from a wolf threat and often face unnecessary repercussions.\n  Washington State proposed a wolf conservation and management plan, \nbut is unable to fully implement it with Federal protections lingering \nin the western two-thirds of the State.\n  Our local leaders can manage the resources and wildlife in our State \nmore effectively and efficiently than the Federal Government; but if we \nwant to empower them to protect herds of livestock, people, and lands \nfrom other possible threats of wolves, we need a consistent framework \nfor the entire State, not just sections.\n  For this reason, I strongly support this amendment and urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. This amendment is yet another attack on a vulnerable \nicon American species, the gray wolf. The gray wolf is a keystone \nspecies that plays a vital role in keeping our ecosystems healthy.\n  It is also an animal that many Native American cultures feel a \nkinship bond with. I heard from many tribal leaders that the \nprotections afforded under the Endangered Species Act for gray wolves \nare the only way that they have been able to keep wolf hunts out of \ntheir tribal reservation boundaries.\n  Now, I understand many of my colleagues have very strong views about \nlistings and delistings affecting their States, but the Endangered \nSpecies Act exists to offer necessary protections and ensure a species' \nsurvival, which the majority of our constituents strongly support. This \nis the same law that successfully restored another iconic American \nspecies, the bald eagle.\n  This amendment restricts the Department of the Interior's ability to \nimplement the Endangered Species Act. However, it does not alter the \nprotections for the endangered wolves in these States.\n  Regardless of one's position on species protection, the amendment is \nvery problematic. The restrictions will ultimately hurt farmers, \nranchers, landowners and businessowners.\n  Here is why: under this amendment, the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwould not be able to offer exemptions or permits for incidental \nkillings of wolves to landowners, ranchers, and other parties who might \nbe in need of them; however, the prohibition against accidental kills \nor takes would still remain and would still be legally enforceable.\n  Thus, this constitutes that States would either have to stop any \nactivity--any activity--that led to the taking of a wolf, or they would \nbe vulnerable to a lawsuit or heavy penalties. Simply put, this \namendment is bad for wolves; it is bad for our ecosystem; it is bad for \nbusiness, and it is bad for our constituents.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Idaho.\n  Mr. SIMPSON. I just wanted to explain the situation that we find \nourselves in.\n  I am sympathetic with what the gentleman is doing, and when we \nactually passed language 4 years ago on the wolves in Idaho and \nMontana, we thought about what happened to the wolves that go into \nWashington and Oregon and Nevada and Utah and so forth; and we thought \nabout including those in the general delisting. Well, we didn't delist \nthem; the Fish and Wildlife Service did.\n  We found it created several problems. One, those States didn't have \nState management plans, which is the case today with most of them \nbecause we discussed this, or I discussed this issue earlier with the \nFish and Wildlife Service.\n  What their plan is and what they would like to do is, currently, they \nsupport the language that is in the bill that reinstates their \ndelisting in Wyoming and the Great Lakes. Those States have State \nmanagement plans that have been approved by Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  If you include the other States that are included in this that don't \nhave the State management plans, then Fish and Wildlife has to oppose \nwhat we are doing.\n  I believe that what their goal is, is to get this language passed \ndealing with Wyoming, the Great Lakes, and then do a wider, rangewide \ndelisting once those States have State management plans that have been \nadopted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, and this amendment may \nundermine that.\n  This is something that we need to discuss, I think. I am not opposing \nthe gentleman's amendment, but it is something that I think we need to \ndiscuss between now and conference so that we get a plan and to make \nsure that we are not undermining what I think we all want, and that is \nthe ultimate delisting of the gray wolves that have met the standard.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, as I said earlier, I \nunderstand that my colleagues have strong views about this, pro and \ncon, about the listing and delisting; but this amendment is very, very \nproblematic. For that reason, I can't support it.\n  The gentleman from Idaho is correct. This has so many unintended \nconsequences that I feel very strongly--very strongly--about not \nsupporting this amendment for that reason.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, with the few seconds I have left, I would \ncertainly thank the gentleman from Idaho, as well as the lady from \nMinnesota, for sharing their concerns.\n  I certainly look forward to working with my colleagues. I would urge \nsupport and look forward to a continuing effort to move this to a \nconclusion that we can all accept.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n\n[[Page H4833]]\n\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Washington \nwill be postponed.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Garamendi\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act for California \n     drought response or relief may be used by the Administrator \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency or the Secretary of \n     the Interior in contravention of implementation of Division \n     26.7 of the California Water Code (the Water Quality, Supply, \n     and Infrastructure Improvement Act of 2014), as approved by \n     the voters of California in California Proposition 1 (2014).\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from California and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, despite the potential for a point of \norder and the amendment being out of order, it really, really is a good \npolicy. While it may not come to a vote on this House floor, it \ncertainly ought to come to the attention of the appropriators and the \nadministration that we have got a pretty serious drought in the West. \nIt does affect California, Arizona, Oregon, probably parts of Idaho, \nand on into New Mexico.\n  California voters last November passed a $7 billion water bond that \ndeals with the long-term issues of the water supply in California and \nsome of the immediate challenges that the California drought has \nbrought to the 30-plus million citizens of the State.\n  This amendment would direct the Department of the interior, the EPA, \nthe Department of Agriculture, and the Department of Defense to focus \nthe money that it would be spending in California under any \ncircumstance, to focus that money on assisting, augmenting, advancing, \nand supplementing those programs that the State of California is \nundertaking to address the drought using the bond act money.\n  That is a great idea, that instead of spending the money on things \nthat are not immediately relevant, that are not immediately necessary \nand do not immediately help those citizens of California, those \ncommunities, those agencies in the State that are suffering from the \ndrought, rather to spend the money on those programs. That is it.\n  It doesn't call for any additional money. It doesn't really cause \nlong-term problems to our appropriation processes, but, rather, it \nsays, hey, we have got a problem. Let's focus on the problem, and let's \ncoordinate with the State of California in solving the problem. That is \nit, pretty simple stuff.\n  Unfortunately, I guess we may have a point of order, and this rather \nimportant concept won't be in the legislation.\n  However, I do think that the administration is aware, and they are \nbeginning to focus appropriately on the drought in California. And I \nwould hope in other States, just as we are suggesting they do here, \nthat they, the administration and the Federal Government, focus the \nmoney that it would otherwise be spending in the State of California \nand in these other States on projects that the local governments, the \nState governments in those States are undertaking to address the \ndrought--pretty basic.\n  So that I might challenge the point of order, I will reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. SIMPSON. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order and make a \npoint of order against the amendment because it proposes to change \nexisting law and constitutes legislation in an appropriation bill and, \ntherefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part:\n  ``An amendment to a general appropriations bill shall not be in order \nif changing existing law.''\n  The amendment requires a new determination, and I ask for a ruling \nfrom the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Chairman, my good friend from Idaho was so right \nand is now so wrong. But that is the way it is. When you have got the \nvotes, you have got the votes.\n  Nevertheless, this is really a very, very good program. I would \nencourage all of us--and particularly the administration--to follow \nalong the policies here; and I would point out that they are.\n  So I challenge the point of order and would ask for a ruling of the \nChair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair will rule.\n  The Chair finds that this amendment includes language requiring a new \ndetermination of whether certain actions will contravene a specified \nState law.\n  The amendment, therefore, constitutes legislation in violation of \nclause 2 of rule XXI.\n  The point of order is sustained, and the amendment is not in order.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to issue any regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 6901 et seq.) that applies to an animal \n     feeding operation, including a concentrated animal feeding \n     operation and a large concentrated animal feeding operation, \n     as such terms are defined in section 122.23 of title 40, Code \n     of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment on an \nissue that is critical to livestock producers not just in my State and \nin my district, but across the whole country.\n  Last year, a group of folks in my area, environmental activists, sued \nseveral dairies in the Yakima Valley in Washington State, claiming that \nthe dairies were responsible for ``open dumping'' under the Resources \nConservation and Recovery Act of 1976--or, as it is most commonly \nreferred to, RCRA--because of manure storage and management issues on \ntheir farms.\n  The big issue is what law the activists were suing the dairies under. \nThere are many laws and regulations, both at the State and Federal \nlevel, which are appropriate mechanisms for protecting and ensuring our \nNation's waters are kept clean, but the problem I see is that RCRA is \nnot one of them.\n  RCRA was a law designed to govern solid wastes and prevent open \ndumping. The major application of this law is regulating landfills. It \nwas never intended to regulate animal waste. In fact, the EPA, in its \ninitial 1979 regulations for RCRA, expressed that the law ``does not \napply to agricultural waste, including manure and crop residue, \nreturned to the soil as fertilizers or soil conditioners.''\n  I don't know how much clearer we can get that manure storage and \nhandling were not intended to be governed under this law. \nUnfortunately, though, a Federal judge in Spokane, Washington, agreed \nwith the group and stretched the definition of ``solid waste'' to apply \nto manure nitrates, contrary to the law and Federal regulatory code, \nand held the dairies responsible for open dumping because of how they \nstored and handled animal waste.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment does nothing to prevent EPA from enforcing \nthe current regulations under RCRA. It does nothing to change the Clean \nWater Act rulemakings, nor does it prevent EPA from issuing or \nenforcing Clean Water Act regulations. All my amendment does is prevent \nEPA from issuing and expanding new regulations under RCRA that would \nreflect the interpretation of this current law.\n  Mr. Chair, no one is saying that livestock producers--like every \nAmerican--don't share in the responsibility of good stewardship of our \nenvironment\n\n[[Page H4834]]\n\nand our resources. They certainly do. But there are appropriate laws \nand regulations intended to govern this, and there are ones that are \nnot appropriate for this purpose.\n  Simply piling additional layers of regulation on producers and giving \nactivists new litigation tools to target our Nation's farmers and \nranchers is not what Congress had in mind when passing the Resources \nConservation and Recovery Act. We, as Congress, have a responsibility \nto make that clarification, and that is what I am seeking to do with \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would be better able to comment on this \namendment if the gentleman had shared a copy. In this day and age, I am \nglad we are allowed to bring an iPad on the floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would ask the gentleman from Washington when he \ndecided upon this amendment. Has it been in the last 20 minutes, or was \nit 2 hours ago?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. It was, let's see, more like 6 hours ago that it was in \nthe hopper.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman, I thank the \ngentleman.\n  The headlines are, groundbreaking rule in Washington State on this \ndairy case. And it is, ``Dairy Pollution Threatens Washington Valley's \nWater.'' This was a big enough story, in fact, that it was even \nreprinted by the Minneapolis Star Tribune. It was the first time that \nthe Federal Resources Conservation Recovery Act was used to consider \nways in which land and water had to be protected.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, just because I didn't have an opportunity to really \ndelve into this and find out more about it--and what the amendment does \nis it just totally stops funds to be issued under this regulation to \nanimal feeding operations--I am going to oppose it because it also \nincludes large concentrated animal feeding operations. And I do come \nfrom a farming State, so I do know the difference between a small farm, \na small hog farmer, and a lagoon, and large dairy farms and small dairy \nfarms. So with that, I oppose this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Chairman, I am not questioning the good lady's \ncredentials from the farming State of Minnesota. But certainly given \ntime, as this process moves forward, she will become intimately \nfamiliar with this law as it is being interpreted. It is already \nhappening in other parts of the country, and I would offer this \namendment to help preclude the wrongful use of the law and ask my \ncolleagues for strong consideration.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I will just read into the Record from \nJanuary 15, 2015, Spokane, Washington:\n\n       A Federal judge has ruled that a large industrial dairy in \n     eastern Washington has polluted drinking water through its \n     application, storage, and management of manure in a case that \n     could set precedents across the Nation.\n       U.S. District Judge Thomas O. Rice of Spokane ruled \n     Wednesday that the pollution posed an ``imminent and \n     substantial endangerment'' to the environment and to people \n     who drink the water.\n       Rice wrote that he ``could come to no other conclusion than \n     that the dairy's operations are contributing to the high \n     levels of nitrate that are currently contaminating--and will \n     continue to contaminate . . . the underlying groundwater.''\n       ``Any attempt to diminish the dairy's contribution to the \n     nitrate contamination is disingenuous, at best,'' Rice wrote \n     in the 111-page opinion, in which he granted partial summary \n     judgment in favor of environmental groups that sued the \n     dairy.\n\n  These environmental groups are people who are looking out for their \ndrinking water. So, Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       LIMITATION ON USE OF FUNDS\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to eliminate the Urban Wildlife Refuge Partnership.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank the committee, both the \nstaff and the gentlewoman from Minnesota, the gentleman from \nCalifornia, and the gentleman from Idaho who are now managing this \nappropriations bill.\n  I call this the good health appropriations for the quality of life of \nmany Americans, both urban and rural. I ask my colleagues to consider \nmy amendment, which deals with the urban reforestation program. I live \nclose and personal to both urban areas and rural areas in my \ncongressional district.\n  Given close to 80 percent of the population of the conterminous \nUnited States lives in an urban area, the benefits provided by urban \nforests touch most U.S. citizens. My amendment specifically reinforces \nthe importance of urban reforestation, as well as preserves our ability \nto return urban areas to healthy and safe living environments for our \nchildren.\n  I offered these amendments in years past. I know it from a real-time \nexperience. Over the last couple of years, when the drought hit Houston \nand many other areas in Texas, millions of trees were lost. Millions of \ntrees were lost.\n  Today, now, we face the large and very challenging effort of trying \nto reforest parks like Memorial Park, MacGregor Park, and many parks in \nthe northeast part of my district. In the past 30 years alone, we have \nlost 30 percent of all of our urban trees, a loss of over 600 million \ntrees.\n  I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban \nreforestation. In fact, many Members will remember that throughout our \ncareers, we have been involved in planting of trees. There are major \nefforts throughout our community.\n  I want to cite, for example, those who have worked in Houston, Texas, \ndoing the reforestation work: Houston Wilderness, Student Conservation \nAssociation, the Buffalo Bayou Partnership, the Greater East End \nManagement District, Houston Parks and Recreation Department, and Texas \nParks & Wildlife Department, along with many civic clubs of which I \nhave had the privilege of working with.\n  Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group, \nestimated that the tree-covered loss in the greater Washington \nmetropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540 \nmillion cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have \ntaken more than 1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.\n  We know that the green effect in the middle of the city can have a \nbeneficial effect on a community's health, both physically and \npsychologically. A healthy 32-foot-tall ash tree can produce about 260 \npounds of oxygen annually.\n  Trees help reduce pollution. Trees help combat the effects of \ngreenhouse gases. Trees help cool down the overall city environment by \nshading asphalt, concrete, and metal surfaces. Buildings and paving in \ncity centers create a heat island effect. A mature tree canopy reduces \nair temperatures by about 5 to 10 degrees.\n  Let me give a personal story on the importance of reforestation. A \nfew years ago, I helped create a memorial plaza for a Martin Luther \nKing monument in MacGregor Park. There was a tree of life that was \npresented to that park by Martin Luther King's father.\n  In the course of urban development, that tree had to be moved. It \ncaused an emotional uprising in our community. Ovide Duncantell tied \nhimself to the tree.\n  Ultimately, we resolved that the tree had to be moved, and that tree \nwas potentially a tree that would die. With the right kind of nurturing \nand reforestation and treatment by the foresters who came, that tree is \nnow a shining example of a unified community.\n\n[[Page H4835]]\n\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment to ensure \nthat our programs dealing with urban reforestation continue.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my \namendment to H.R. 2822, the Interior and Environment Appropriations Act \nof 2016 and to commend Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir leadership in shepherding this bill through the legislative \nprocess.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution, which \noperates our national museums including the National Zoo.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important \nmessage from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment emphasizes the importance of urban forests, \nand preserves our ability to return urban areas to healthy and safe \nliving environments for our children.\n  Identical amendments were offered and accepted in the Interior and \nEnvironment Appropriations Acts for Fiscal Year 2008 (H.R. 2643) and \nFiscal Year 2007 (H.R. 5386), and were adopted by voice vote.\n  Mr. Chair, surveys indicate that some urban forests are in serious \ndanger.\n  In the past 30 years alone, we have lost 30% of all our urban trees--\na loss of over 600 million trees.\n  Eighty percent (80%) of the American population lives in the dense \nquarters of a city.\n  Reforestation programs return a tool of nature to a concrete area \nthat can help to remove air pollution, filter out chemicals and \nagricultural waste in water, and save communities millions of dollars \nin storm water management costs.\n  I have certainly seen neighborhoods in Houston benefit from urban \nreforestation.\n  In addition, havens of green in the middle of a city can have \nbeneficial effects on a community's health, both physical and \npsychological, as well as increase property value of surrounding real \nestate.\n  Reforestation of cities is an innovative way of combating urban \nsprawl and/or deterioration.\n  Mr. Chair, a real commitment to enhancing our environment involves \nboth the protection of existing natural resources and active support \nfor restoration and improvement projects.\n  Several years ago, American Forests, a leading conservation group, \nestimated that the tree cover lost in the greater Washington \nmetropolitan area from 1973 to 1997 resulted in an additional 540 \nmillion cubic feet of storm water runoff annually, which would have \ntaken more than $1 billion in storm water control facilities to manage.\n  Trees breathe in carbon dioxide, and produce oxygen.\n  People breathe in oxygen and exhale carbon dioxide.\n  A typical person consumes about 38 lb of oxygen per year.\n  A healthy tree, say a 32 ft tall ash tree, can produce about 260 lb \nof oxygen annually--two trees supply the oxygen needs of a person for a \nyear.\n  Trees help reduce pollution by capturing particulates like dust and \npollen with their leaves.\n  A mature tree absorbs from 120 to 240 lbs of the small particles and \ngases of air pollution.\n  Trees help combat the effects of ``greenhouse'' gases, the increased \ncarbon dioxide produced from burning fossil fuels that is causing our \natmosphere to ``heat up.''\n  Trees help cool down the overall city environment by shading asphalt, \nconcrete and metal surfaces.\n  Buildings and paving in city centers create a heat-island effect.\n  A mature tree canopy reduces air temperatures by about 5-10 degrees \nFahrenheit.\n  A 25 foot tree reduces annual heating and cooling costs of a typical \nresidence by 8 to 12 percent, producing an average annual savings of \n$120 per American household.\n  Proper tree plantings around buildings can slow winter winds, and \nreduce annual energy use for home heating by 4-22%.\n  Mr. Chair, trees play a vital role in making our cities more \nsustainable and more livable.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment simply provides for continued support to \nprograms that reforest our urban areas.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee \namendment and thank Chairman Calvert  and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir courtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), \nthe ranking member of the Appropriations Subcommittee on the Interior, \nEnvironment, and Related Agencies.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  It was very interesting to learn more about what your goals and \nobjectives are, and I think it is very worthy of our consideration.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me conclude by simply saying what \na great difference life will be in many urban areas with our commitment \nto reforestation of urban areas and creating more opportunities for \ntrees to grow in those areas.\n  I ask for support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoder\n\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to implement or enforce threatened species \n                 listing of the lesser prairie chicken\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species \n     listing of the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered \n     Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Kansas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kansas.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment today would prohibit further \nwaste of Federal funds from being used to enforce the unnecessary \nlisting of the lesser prairie chicken as a threatened species under the \nEndangered Species Act.\n  Now, this listing has Americans crying foul in Kansas and all across \nthe country over the burden it places on farmers, ranchers, and \nagriculture producers. This misguided listing comes at a time when the \nlesser prairie chicken is actually becoming the greater prairie \nchicken, in some respects, gaining in population significantly each of \nthe last several years.\n  Less than 1 week ago, a new population count for the lesser prairie \nchicken was released, and it shows a 25 percent increase in the species \npopulation over the last year. That follows a 20 percent increase from \nthe year before.\n  What is to account for all this? Is it the listing on the endangered \nspecies list? No--these population increases, according to experts, are \nattributed to improved habitat conditions, as a result of increased \nrainfall to an area that had previously been experiencing one of the \nworst droughts since the infamous Dust Bowl.\n  Now, not a single drop of this rainfall can be attributed to the \ncentral planners in Washington, D.C., nor can this listing have any \neffect on making it rain in places like Kansas.\n  We need to let State and local municipalities and States work \ntogether to create these conservation plans to help produce the \npopulations we need for the lesser prairie chicken.\n  In fact, five States with habitat areas--Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, New \nMexico, and Colorado--already have a locally driven, areawide plan in \nplace known as the lesser prairie chicken rangewide conservation plan. \nIt has broad stakeholder support to conserve and replenish the lesser \nprairie chicken population.\n  Now, we have an opportunity today, as Democrats and Republicans, to \nflock together, to break out of our shells, to work with States and \nlocalities and delist the lesser prairie chicken.\n  Keeping it in place makes it harder on hard-working farmers to grow \ncrops and feed our Nation, and it makes it harder for energy producers \nto produce renewable or traditional energy.\n  All of that increases the cost at the grocery store or at the pump \nfor average everyday working Americans. This cost of the listing is \nhaving little to no impact; this is while the cost of this listing has \nlittle to no impact on the ever-growing population.\n  That growth is coming from States and localities working hand in hand \nwith farmers and producers; yet, as these ineffective Federal burdens \ngo up, so does the cost of doing business in America. Now, that is \ntruly something to crow about.\n  Let's work together. Let's let States recoup and conserve and grow \nthe lesser prairie chicken populations, and let's pass this amendment.\n\n[[Page H4836]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, this amendment would prohibit the Fish and \nWildlife Service from implementing or enforcing threatened species \nlisting of the lesser prairie chicken under the Endangered Species Act \nand would restrict the Fish and Wildlife Service from offering any \ncritical protections to preserve the species.\n  This amendment is harmful and misguided and maybe a little scrambled, \nas in some eggs. Once the species is listed under the Endangered \nSpecies Act, the role of Fish and Wildlife is primarily permissive, \nhelping parties comply with the act as they carry out their activities.\n  Under this amendment, all the Endangered Species Act prohibitions \nwould still apply. They would still apply, the Endangered Species Act \nprohibitions, but landowners would have no avenue to comply with them.\n  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service would be barred from issuing \npermits or exemptions. This means landowners, industry, and other \nparties who might need to take the lesser prairie chicken incidentally \nto do their otherwise lawful activities, such as oil and gas \ndevelopment, would be vulnerable to a citizens lawsuit.\n  Additionally, this amendment would halt an innovative plan to \nconserve the lesser prairie chicken. In 2014, Fish and Wildlife, in \npartnership with States and local stakeholders, began the \nimplementation of a lesser prairie chicken rangewide conservation plan. \nThat encouraged participants to gain in proactive and voluntary \nconservation activities, promoting lesser prairie chicken conservation.\n  The plan describes a locally controlled and an innovative approach \nfor maintaining the State's authority to conserve the species and \nallows for economic development to continue in a seamless manner. It \nsounds like a win-win to me, with Fish and Wildlife partnering with \nlocal partners and with the State.\n  This plan prevents significant regulatory delays in obtaining taking \npermits, disruption to economic activities vital to the State and \nnational interests, and little incentive for conservation habitat on \nprairie lands.\n  Sadly, the gentleman's amendment would undermine this plan that local \nfolks and the State came up with to be more collaborative in a \nconservation effort. This amendment would create uncertainty for \nlandowners, making them vulnerable, as I said earlier, to lawsuits.\n  We should be supporting the Fish and Wildlife Service in its efforts \nto work with local community leaders and to work with the States, not \nblocking the agency for doing their job.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from western Kansas (Mr. Huelskamp), my friend and colleague.\n  Mr. HUELSKAMP. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to cosponsor this \ncommonsense amendment as we work to stop the Federal Government from \nenforcing the ill-advised listing of the lesser prairie chicken.\n  As a fifth-generation farmer and possibly the only Member on the \nfloor who has actually seen the real-life bird on a family farm that we \nare talking about, I am strongly opposed to this listing.\n  As was mentioned, this listing occurred during a massive, historical \nmultiyear drought in my home area in my region and State, which \nobviously limits habitat growth and reduces the numbers of prairie \nchickens.\n  The best solution is for it to rain; and that, it has. Thank you, \nLord, though I fully expect the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to take \ncredit for the resulting increase in the lesser prairie chicken \npopulation.\n  For the last 4 years, I have heard from farmers, ranchers, \nhomebuilders, energy producers, and other small businesses concerned \nabout what this listing would do to our rural economy. Our farmers and \nranchers are in a state of uncertainty as to whether certain farming \nand conservation practices, like we have in my own farm, will result in \nfines or perhaps even jail time. Many energy producers have stopped \ndrilling new wells for fear of risking the consequences of the listing.\n\n  Unless Congress does something and does it soon, this threat to our \nrural economy will probably continue forever. In 40 years of the \nEndangered Species Act, more than 1,350 species have been listed as \nendangered, but only 24 have been delisted, and that is just 1.7 \npercent--not very successful, Mr. Chairman.\n  I appreciate the opportunity to share these concerns with you, and I \nencourage my colleagues to support this amendment, support our farmers \nand ranchers, and support common sense.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Kansas has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am sympathetic to the gentleman's \nconcerns, particularly because my home State of California probably has \nmore than its fair share of endangered species problem.\n  The Endangered Species Act hinges upon the principle that, if a \nspecies is listed, that it will be recovered and management will return \nto the States. This push by the States is the reality we see playing \nout. Bats, wolves, greater sage-grouse, delta smelt, the list goes on \nand on and on.\n  It should come as no surprise, then, to see the States pushing back \nthrough their elected Representatives in the legislative branch in an \neffort to bring the Endangered Species Act back into balance.\n  I would support this amendment.\n  Mr. YODER. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I understand that there is a concern with \nthe listings; and I hear that very loud and clear from my colleagues.\n  The problem with the way that these amendments have been drafted, \nparticularly in line with this amendment, again, all the Endangered \nSpecies Act prohibitions would still apply.\n  Landowners would have no avenue to comply with because they wouldn't \nhave a partner in the Fish and Wildlife because Fish and Wildlife would \nbe barred from issuing any permits or any exemptions.\n  Clearly, it means landowners, industries, and other parties who might \nneed to take a lesser prairie chicken incidentally to their otherwise \nlawful activities will be vulnerable to a lawsuit. Additionally, this \namendment will halt any innovation plan to conserve the lesser prairie \nchicken.\n  The gentleman's amendment, by undermining collaborative efforts and, \nI believe, with an amendment that creates uncertainty for landowners \nmaking them vulnerable to lawsuits, should be an amendment that should \nbe opposed.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n\n                              {time}  2215\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Yoder).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n        At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to limit outreach programs administered by the \n     Smithsonian Institution.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, again, let me offer my appreciation to \nthe gentlewoman from Minnesota, the gentleman from California, and \ntheir staff who have worked with us.\n  Let me remind my colleagues that just a few days ago, I offered this \namendment dealing with museums and dealing with my concern for the \nfunding and the Smithsonian, to provide for the Nation's museum.\n\n[[Page H4837]]\n\n  Let me also say to my colleagues that I have offered this amendment \nin the past because I have a particular interest in the museums of \nAmerica and their ability to do outreach. I imagine I am not alone \nstanding here amongst appropriators to again say and call for the end \nof sequestration to be able to provide the appropriators and to provide \nthe people of America the full funding to address these quality of life \nissues from the various lands and Federal parks and, as well, the \nhistoric trails, of which I will talk about, but museums, urban \nreforestation, all elements of the beauty of this Nation. And I frankly \nbelieve that museums, likewise, are that form of beauty.\n  My amendment specifically says: ``None of the funds made available in \nthis Act may be used to limit outreach programs administered by the \nSmithsonian Institution.''\n  In order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge, the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even greater \naudience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities who \notherwise would be deprived of the vast amounts of cultural history \noffered by the Smithsonian.\n  Our museums of the Nation are in trouble. The Smithsonian has a \nbeautiful array of museums that are here that millions of Americans \nhave the opportunity to visit. But the outreach program serves millions \nof Americans, thousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in \nall 50 States through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and \nsharing of educational resources via publications, lectures and \npresentations, training programs, and Web sites.\n  Allow me to mention just a few in my own district:\n  The Holocaust Museum, unique in its presentation of a horrible time \nin history, but it also serves as a very unifying entity in our \ncommunity;\n  The Children's Museum, as one of the original board members and \nfounders, now the Children's Museum is one of the major children's \nmuseums in the Nation. But again, it needs the impact of the outreach \nof the Smithsonian;\n  And then, of course, the Museum of African American Culture, headed \nby a dear friend, but also a champion of holding this museum together, \nand that is John Guess. He needs a fuller embrace by the Smithsonian, \nincluding its expertise, its experts, its Ph.D.s, traveling efforts, \nand again, its encouragement of corporate communities to recognize the \nvalue of participating in museums.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach activities include the Smithsonian \nInstitution traveling exhibition, the Smithsonian Center for Education \nand Museum Studies, National Science Resources Center, the Smithsonian \nInstitution Press, the Office of Fellowships, and the Smithsonian \nAssociates.\n  Who are we if we do not value preserving those items that tell the \nvaried and diverse history of America, the good history of America, the \nhistory that is unifying and purposeful in citing us as a country that \nrecognizes our wonderful diversity?\n  So I ask my colleagues to support this amendment that deals \nspecifically with allowing the outreach to the kinds of museums that \nreally need the help of the Smithsonian.\n  The Smithsonian, in concluding, Mr. Chairman, is very important to \nurban areas and rural areas alike, and its ability or its affiliation \nis to build a strong national network of museums and educational \norganizations in order to establish active and engaging relationships \nwith communities throughout the country.\n  Again, allow me to salute, in particular, John Guess, with the Museum \nof African American Culture in Houston. He has literally put that \nmuseum together, along with his board members.\n  The Smithsonian--I hope they are hearing me as I am talking on the \nfloor of the House--we need your help in Houston, Texas. We probably \nneed your help in Washington State, in California, Minnesota, New York, \nand beyond to preserve and help these small museums throughout the \nNation.\n  I ask my colleagues to support not only this amendment, but the \nmuseums of this Nation.\n  And I say to Mr. Calvert, we had discussed this before. This \namendment now is a placeholder, hopefully, for our discussion going \nforward dealing with the preservation of our museums.\n  Let me thank Mr. Calvert, Mr. Simpson, and Ms. McCollum.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of my \namendment to H.R. 2822, the ``Interior and Environment Appropriations \nAct of 2016.''\n  Let me also thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for \ntheir leadership in shepherding this bill to the floor.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the Smithsonian \nInstitution, which operates our national museums, including the Air and \nSpace Museum; the Museum of African Art; the Museum of the American \nIndian; and the National Portrait Gallery.\n  The Smithsonian also operates another national treasure: the National \nZoo.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple but it sends a very important \nmessage from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment simply provides that:\n  ``Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may be used \nto limit outreach programs administered by the Smithsonian \nInstitution.''\n  This amendment is identical to an amendment I offered to the Interior \nand Environment Appropriations Act for FY2008 (H.R. 2643) that was \napproved by voice vote on June 26, 2007.\n  Mr. Chair, the Smithsonian's outreach programs bring Smithsonian \nscholars in art, history and science out of ``the nation's attic'' and \ninto their own backyard.\n  Each year, millions of Americans visit the Smithsonian in Washington, \nD.C.\n  But in order to fulfill the Smithsonian's mission, ``the increase and \ndiffusion of knowledge,'' the Smithsonian seeks to serve an even \ngreater audience by bringing the Smithsonian to enclaves of communities \nwho otherwise would be deprived of the vast amount of cultural history \noffered by the Smithsonian.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach programs serve millions of Americans, \nthousands of communities, and hundreds of institutions in all 50 \nstates, through loans of objects, traveling exhibitions, and sharing of \neducational resources via publications, lectures and presentations, \ntraining programs, and websites.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs work in close cooperation with \nSmithsonian museums and research centers, as well as with 144 affiliate \ninstitutions and others across the nation.\n  The Smithsonian's outreach activities support community-based \ncultural and educational organizations around the country.\n  They ensure a vital, recurring, and high-impact Smithsonian presence \nin all 50 states through the provision of traveling exhibitions and a \nnetwork of affiliations.\n  Smithsonian outreach programs increase connections between the \nInstitution and targeted audiences (African American, Asian American, \nLatino, Native American, and new American) and provide kindergarten \nthrough college-age museum education and outreach opportunities.\n  These outreach programs enhance K-12 science education programs, \nfacilitate the Smithsonian's scholarly interactions with students and \nscholars at universities, museums, and other research institutions; and \ndisseminate results related to the research and collections strengths \nof the Institution.\n  The programs that provide the critical mass of Smithsonian outreach \nactivity are:\n  1. the Smithsonian Institution Traveling Exhibition Services (SITES);\n  2. the Smithsonian Affiliations, the Smithsonian Center for Education \nand Museum Studies (SCEMS);\n  3. National Science Resources Center (NSRC);\n  4. the Smithsonian Institution Press (SIP);\n  5. the Office of Fellowships (OF); and\n  6. the Smithsonian Associates (TSA), which receives no federal \nfunding.\n  To achieve the goal of increasing pubic engagement, SITES directs \nsome of its federal resources to develop Smithsonian Across America: A \nCelebration of National Pride.\n  This ``mobile museum,'' which will feature Smithsonian artifacts from \nthe most iconic (presidential portraits, historical American flags, \nCivil War records, astronaut uniforms, etc.) to the simplest items of \neverday life (family quilts, prairie schoolhouse furnishings, \nhistorical lunch boxes, multilingual store front and street signs, \netc.), has been a long-standing organizational priority of the \nSmithsonian.\n  SITES ``mobile museum'' is the only traveling exhibit format able to \nguarantee audience growth and expanded geographic distribution during \nsustained periods of economic retrenchment, but also because it is \nimperative for the many exhibitors nationwide who are struggling \nfinancially yet eager to participate in Smithsonian outreach.\n\n  For communities still struggling to fully recover from the economic \ndownturn, the ability of museums to present temporary exhibitions, the \n``mobile museum'' promises to answer an ever-growing demand for \nSmithsonian shows in the field.\n\n[[Page H4838]]\n\n  A single, conventional SITES exhibit can reach a maximum of 12 \nlocations over a two- to three-year period.\n  In contrast, a ``mobile museum'' exhibit can visit up to three venues \nper week in the course of only one year, at no cost to the host \ninstitution or community.\n  The net result is an increase by 150 in the number of outreach \nlocations to which SITES shows can travel annually.\n  And in addition to its flexibility in making short-term stops in \ncities and towns from coast-to-coast, a ``mobile museum'' has the \nadvantage of being able to frequent the very locations where people \nlive, work, and take part in leisure time activities.\n  By establishing an exhibit presence in settings like these, SITES \nwill not only increase its annual visitor participation by 1 million, \nbut also advance a key Smithsonian performance objective: to develop \nexhibit approaches that address diverse audiences, including population \ngroups not always affiliated with mainstream cultural institutions.\n  SITES also will be the public exhibitions' face of the Smithsonian's \nNational Museum of African American History and Culture, as that new \nMuseum comes online.\n  Providing national access to projects that will introduce the \nAmerican public to the Museum's mission, SITES in FY 2008 will tour \nsuch stirring exhibitions as NASA ART: 50 Years of Exploration; 381 \nDays: The Montgomery Bus Boycott Story; Beyond: Visions of Planetary \nLandscapes; The Way We Worked: Photographs from the National Archives; \nand More Than Words: Illustrated Letters from the Smithsonian's \nArchives of American Art.\n  To meet the growing demand among smaller community and ethnic museums \nfor an exhibition celebrating the Latino experience, SITES provided a \nscaled-down version of the National Museum of American History's 4,000-\nsquare-foot exhibition about legendary entertainer Celia Cruz.\n  Two 1,500-square-foot exhibitions, one about Crow Indian history and \nthe other on basket traditions, will give Smithsonian visitors beyond \nWashington a taste of the Institution's critically acclaimed National \nMuseum of the American Indian.\n  Two more exhibits, ``In Plane View'' and ``Earth from Space,'' \nprovided visitors an opportunity to experience the Smithsonian's \nrecently opened, expansive National Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy \nCenter.\n  For almost 30 years, The Smithsonian Associates--the highly regarded \neducational arm of the Smithsonian Institution--has arranged Scholars \nin the Schools programs.\n  Through this tremendously successful and well-received educational \noutreach program, the Smithsonian shares its staff--hundreds of experts \nin art, history and science--with the national community at a local \nlevel.\n  The mission of Smithsonian Affiliations is to build a strong national \nnetwork of museums and educational organizations in order to establish \nactive and engaging relationships with communities throughout the \ncountry.\n  There are currently 138 affiliates located in the United States, \nPuerto Rico, and Panama.\n  By working with museums of diverse subject areas and scholarly \ndisciplines, both emerging and well-established, Smithsonian \nAffiliations is building partnerships through which audiences and \nvisitors everywhere will be able to share in the great wealth of the \nSmithsonian while building capacity and expertise in local communities.\n  The National Science Resources Center (NSRC) strives to increase the \nnumber of ethnically diverse students participating in effective \nscience programs based on NSRC products and services.\n  The Center develops and implements a national outreach strategy that \nwill increase the number of school districts (currently more than 800) \nthat are implementing NSRC K-8 programs.\n  The NSRC is striving to further enhance its program activity with a \nnewly developed scientific outreach program introducing communities and \nschool districts to science through literacy initiatives.\n  In addition, through the building of the multicultural Alliance \nInitiative, the Smithsonian's outreach programs seek to develop new \napproaches to enable the public to gain access to Smithsonian \ncollections, research, education, and public programs that reflect the \ndiversity of the American people, including underserved audiences of \nethnic populations and persons with disabilities.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of my amendment and \nthank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their \ncourtesies, consideration, and very fine work in putting together this \nexcellent legislation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Director of the National Park Service to \n     implement, administer, or enforce Policy Memorandum 11-03 or \n     to approve a request by a park superintendent to eliminate \n     the sale in National Parks of water in disposable plastic \n     bottles.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This summer, thousands of Americans will load the kids into the car \nand set out on a trip to visit one of our country's historic national \nparks.\n  Whether it is to see the stunning valleys of the Grand Canyon or the \ntowering stone faces etched into Mt. Rushmore, tens of millions of \nfamilies arrive at national park destinations each year.\n  As some may know, the National Park Service has implemented a policy \nallowing parks to ban the sale of bottled water, and only bottled \nwater, at park concessions. I understand that the Park Service is \nconcerned about waste left behind by visitors. We all agree that \nprotecting our national parks is a laudable goal. However, banning the \nsale of bottled water is not the best way to go about it.\n  In blocking the sale of bottled water at our parks, we are depriving \nmillions of Americans access to a healthy and necessary beverage that \npark visitors rely on. This is especially true in the hot summer \nmonths.\n  Families who don't own expensive camping equipment and aren't \nexperienced hikers and climbers will be surprised to find out that they \ncan't buy their child a bottle of water at one of our national parks. \nNineteen national parks have adopted or plan to adopt a bottled water \nban. This includes the Grand Canyon National Park. Temperatures at the \nGrand Canyon just this week will top 100 degrees. Visitors who may have \nforgotten or have run out of water could be put at risk of dehydration.\n  Banning bottled water defies common sense. Even the Park Service \nadmits that the ban ``could affect visitor safety'' and ``eliminates \nthe healthiest choice for bottled drinks, leaving sugary drinks as a \nprimary alternative.''\n  The policy runs counter to the Park Service's own Healthy Parks \nHealthy People initiative, which urges visitors to make healthy food \nchoices because, remember, bottled water, and only bottled water, is \nbanned from being sold at concessions.\n  Some argue that the ban is necessary to reduce waste. But the \nNational Park Service has confirmed that participating parks haven't \nbeen able to determine if the policy works. To start, we know parks \ndon't separately analyze recycled waste visitors leave behind. Parks \nsimply can't say whether the ban has worked.\n  It is also worth noting that studies conducted on similar water bans \nshow that they aren't effective in reducing waste. A study in the \nAmerican Journal of Public Health found the bottled water bans on \ncollege campuses had unintended consequences. Eliminating bottled water \ndid not, in fact, reduce waste, but actually led to a spike in sales \nand increased shipments of packaged beverages.\n  Mr. Chairman, we all support efforts to protect our parks. All we ask \ntoday is that the National Park Service carefully consider its \npolicies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I would like to work with the gentleman \non this issue because I think he raises some concerns which do need to \nbe addressed.\n  I would just kind of like to set the picture about what is currently \ngoing on right now. There are 407 units in the National Park system, \nand only 19 of them--19 of them--have elected to eliminate the sale of \nwater in disposable plastic bottles.\n\n[[Page H4839]]\n\n  It is important to note that in the National Park system units, \nincluding these 19, visitors are still free to bring water in with them \nand use water in disposable plastic bottles. They are not banned from \nbringing in their own water.\n  The use of these disposable water bottles has had a significant \nenvironmental impact on the National Park system units. That is why I \nwould like to work with the gentleman and figure out what we need to do \nabout waste reduction in our parks and if this was part of the Park's \noverall system on it, and the sugary drinks that the gentleman referred \nto, if those bottles are also a potential problem, or how do we educate \nand work with families and hikers and vacationers and visitors to our \nnational parks about not leaving this waste out in the open.\n  Another example, in Grand Canyon Park, disposable bottles compromise \nnearly 20 percent of the Grand Canyon's waste stream and 30 percent of \nthe park's recyclables.\n  So before eliminating bottle water sales, the National Park system \nunits were required to undertake an extensive review process \nconsidering 14 different factors before seeking approval from the \nregional director. This extensive review process included rigorous \nimpact analysis, including assessment of the effects on visitors' \nhealth and safety.\n  Once approved, these park units are required to maintain an extensive \npublic education program that provides readily available designed water \nbottle refilling stations. And in many places that I visited recently, \nI have seen both the ability to purchase as well as refill, at our \nnational parks, water bottles.\n  So as a leader in conservation, the National Park Service encourages \nrecycling in the reduction of plastic disposable water bottles. My \nconcern would be we wouldn't want your amendment--and I will speak for \nmyself. I don't want to be part of undercutting any of those efforts to \nencourage recycling in the reduction of disposable water bottles.\n  I would also be concerned that the park system eliminated water sales \nwithout having a viable alternative, as the gentleman pointed out, but \nthat does not appear to be the case here. As I noted earlier, there is \nan extensive review process, and these park units are required to offer \nreadily available free water refilling stations. Plus, people are still \nfree to bring in water themselves.\n  I would very much like to work with the gentleman and the chairman to \nsee if there are any refinements or if there is anything that we need \nto know more about what the National Park system's policy on plastic \nwater bottles is. But I do not support an outright prohibition on the \nNational Park Service to be able to carry out a policy that encourages \nthe reuse and the reduction of plastic water bottles in our parks and \nin our Nation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina (Mrs. Ellmers).\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support \nof my colleague from Pennsylvania's amendment.\n  As a nurse, I know the key component of staying healthy is being \nhydrated and drinking plenty of water. However, if you were to be in \none of our Nation's parks, you might find this difficult.\n  Why?\n  Because the National Park Service allows individual parks to ban \nbottled water from their premises. Yet, in those same parks, someone \ncan still purchase soda and other bottled beverages.\n\n                              {time}  2230\n\n  Mr. Chairman, this ban is misguided. While it was created in an \nattempt to reduce litter in the parks, it has, instead, served as a \nprimary example of intrusive government overreach--something this \ncountry certainly needs less of and something my constituents sent me \nhere to Washington to prevent.\n  According to the National Park's Sustainable Practices report, parks \nthat have implemented this ban are not actually reporting any useful \ndata on recycling by type. In other words, they don't know if this ban \nis effectively working or not. Preserving the beauty of our parks is a \nnoble goal and is something we should all care about, but it should not \ncome at the expense of consumer choice.\n  Mr. Chairman, we should support freedom; we should support the beauty \nof our parks; and we should support good, healthy lifestyles for every \nAmerican. However, the current ban in place does none of the above. I \nurge my colleagues to support this commonsense measure as it stops this \nineffective ban.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, to the speakers and to the chairman of \nthe subcommittee, I hear the concerns. If there are concerns to be \naddressed, I want to be a partner in that, but I also don't want to be \npart in party of walking back--reducing waste in our streams and not in \nany way, shape or form, adding to the costs of Park Service rangers and \nvolunteers in their having to go out and clean up plastic bottles, \nplastic water caps, and other such things.\n  I am sincere in my efforts in saying I would like very much to work \nwith my colleagues on this issue, but I did not hear anybody saying \nthat they wanted to work back. So, at this point, I will oppose the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment for the convenience of consumers and also in light of the \nfact that studies show that it is not having an impact.\n  I yield the balance of my time to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCalvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I am more than happy to work with my good \nfriend from Minnesota as we move this process forward.\n  As you know, we talked about this in the budget process with the \nNational Park Service earlier in the year. We, obviously, don't want to \ndiscourage people from drinking water. We want them to stay hydrated. \nThere are also people who work in the bottled water industry, and I \nthink it is a noble industry. We want to encourage people to drink more \nwater. It is not just about bottled water. It is about jobs and about \nthe people who bottle that water.\n  I will work together with the gentlewoman from Minnesota, and we will \nnot deny people water in our national parks. I support this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of bill, before the short title, add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act for \n     the ``DEPARTMENT OF INTERIOR--National Park Service--national \n     recreation and preservation'' may be used in contravention of \n     section 320101 of title 54, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise with my appreciation to the \nmanagers of this bill and their staffs; but I also want to thank them \nfor the very civil discussion that occurred earlier by two of my \ncolleagues who offered amendments regarding the exhibition of Civil War \nartifacts, or the rebel flag, and I thank them for their courtesy in \nthose amendments of those individuals.\n  I also make a statement on the floor that I look forward to the \nopportunity given to us by the leadership of this House to have a full \ndiscussion on various entities that did not unify but divide, and I \nthink a civil debate on this is warranted in this House as we watched \nthe very moving and very honest debate that took place in South \nCarolina.\n  My amendment, however, is one that, I hope, is embracing and is a \nshow of unity about what America stands for,\n\n[[Page H4840]]\n\nand that is the National Heritage Area-Corridor designation. I just \nwant to show this map, and I am certainly quite pleased that a number \nof these National Heritage Areas do exist. There are 49 of them--none \nin the State of Texas, none but possibly one in Minnesota, maybe one \nbetween Arizona and California, but very few in the West, including in \nthe State of Idaho, and I can name a number of other States.\n  My amendment is to highlight the value of these national trails. This \nis particularly important because this tells the story of America. 16 \nU.S. Code 461 provides that: ``It is declared that it is a national \npolicy to preserve for public use historic sites, buildings, and \nobjects of national significance for the inspiration and benefit of the \npeople of the United States.'' Again, I want to emphasize that--the \ninspiration.\n  Texas has, starting in Galveston, history referring to the \nEmancipation Proclamation. We commemorate something called Juneteenth, \nand out of Juneteenth was the time when Captain Granger came to the \nshores of Galveston, in Texas, and announced that the slaves had been \nfreed. However, there are a number of other historic sites following \nthe trail from Galveston through Houston to include Emancipation Park, \nMacGregor Park, and then sites going up through Austin.\n  We really understand that this idea of historic trails can create an \neconomic impact. For example, in 2012, a nationally respected \nconsulting firm completed a comprehensive economic impact of six \nnational historic sites in the northeast region that also included an \nextrapolation of the economic benefit of all 49 NHAs. It was $12.9 \nbillion.\n  The study quantified the economic impact of the individual NHAs and \nbased it upon a case study approach and found that the economic impact \nof three National Historic Areas in Arizona, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania showed: in Massachusetts, $153.8 million in economic \nimpact, 1,832 jobs, and generates $14.3 million in tax revenue; in \nPennsylvania, $21.2 million in economic impact, 314 jobs, and generates \n$1.5 million in tax revenue; in the Yuma Crossing National Heritage \nArea in Arizona, $22.7 million in economic impact, supports 277 jobs, \nand generates $1.3 million in tax revenue.\n  This is, Mr. Chairman, an important and very vital part of America's \nhistory, and as we approach the anniversary of this legislation that \nwas created in 1966, I think it is important to reinforce the ability \nfor these particular sites. We need to increase the ability for \nfeasibility studies; we need the support of legislative action and \ndesignation; and we need to be able to introduce people to the \nimportance of these sites.\n  Let me make very quick mention of the emancipation part. In 1872, in \nHouston, four former slaves raised $800. That would be part of it, but \nI would just simply say that this is a very important part of America's \nhistory.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the creation of a national heritage \nsite across America by supporting the Jackson Lee amendment so that we \ncan expand the 49 sites to other States that do not have one single \nsite, and Texas is one of them.\n  Mr. Chair, Thank you for this opportunity to speak in support of the \nJackson Lee amendment and to commend Chairman Calvert and Ranking \nMember McCollum for their leadership in shepherding this bill to floor.\n  Among other agencies, this legislation funds the U.S. Forest Service, \nthe National Park System, and the Smithsonian Institution.\n  Most Americans do not know that this bill also funds a very special \nprogram, the National Recreation and Preservation.\n  Mr. Chair, the Jackson Lee Amendment is simple but it sends a very \nimportant message from the Congress of the United States.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment provides:\n  Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act for the \n``DEPARTMENT 0F THE INTERIOR--NATIONAL PARK SERVICE--NATIONAL \nRECREATION AND PRESERVATION'' may be used in contravention of section \n461 of title 16, United States Code.\n  And 16 U.S. Code 461 provides that:\n  It is declared that it is a national policy to preserve for public \nuse historic sites, buildings, and objects of national significance for \nthe inspiration and benefit of the people of the United States.\n  This is important, especially as it relates to National Heritage \nAreas (NHAs).\n  NHAs both preserve our national heritage and provide economic \nbenefits to communities and regions through their commitments to \nheritage conservation and economic development.\n  Through public-private partnerships, NHA entities support historic \npreservation, natural resource conservation, recreation, heritage \ntourism, and educational projects.\n  Leveraging funds and long-term support for projects, NHA partnerships \ngenerate increased economic impact for regions in which they are \nlocated.\n  In 2012, a nationally respected consulting firm (Tripp Umbach) \ncompleted a comprehensive economic impact study of six NHA sites in the \nNortheast Region that also included an extrapolation of the economic \nbenefit of all 49 NHA sites on the national economy.\n  The annual economic impact was estimated to be 12.9 billion.\n  The economic activity supports approximately 148,000 jobs and \ngenerates $1.2 billion annually in Federal revenues from sources such \nas employee compensation, proprietor income, indirect business tax, \nhouseholds, and corporation.\n  The study quantified the economic impacts of individual NHAs based \nupon a case study approach and found that the economic impact of the \nthree National Historic Areas in Arizona, Massachusetts, and \nPennsylvania showed:\n  1. Essex National Heritage Area (MA) generates $153.8 million in \necononic impact, supports 1,832 jobs, and generates $14.3 million in \ntax revenue.\n  2. Oil Region National Heritage Area (PA) generates $21.2 million in \neconomic impact, supports 314 jobs, and generates $1.5 million tax \nrevenue; and\n  3. Yuma Crossing National Heritage Area (AZ) $22.7 million in \neconomic impact, supports 277 jobs, and generates $1.3 million in tax \nrevenue.\n  Mr. Chair, as I said there are 49 NHA across the nation but, \nsurprisingly, none in my state of Texas.\n  We hope to rectify this in the not too distant future.\n  Texas is the largest and second most populous state in the nation and \nhas a unique story in American history with its diverse geographic \nlandscape, natural resources, and population.\n  From Galveston's port, East Texas' farms and forestry, and the \nBuffalo Soldiers, Texas has a rich multi-cultured heritage and history.\n  To honor Texas' heritage, I will be working with my colleagues to \nestablish a National Heritage Area Corridor designation that stretches \nacross historically significant and landmark sites from Galveston to \nHouston and East Texas into Central Texas.\n  This cultural corridor would focus on historic, cultural and natural \nsites, as well as roadways, businesses, residential and farm districts \nthat unite Texas' rich heritage from the first settlers to modern \ntimes.\n  Mr. Chair, as we approach the anniversary of the passage of the 1966 \nNational Historic Preservation Act, we want to preserve and unite the \nlegacy stories of some of our state's most revered sites.\n  Currently underway in Houston is the revitalization of the historic \nEmancipation Park, a pivotal site in the state's social and cultural \ndevelopment and African American legacy.\n  The future Emancipation Park, if brought to fruition and designated \nas a part of a National Heritage Corridor, represents a unique \nopportunity to tell a comprehensive story about the great State of \nTexas.\n  To conclude, National Heritage Areas (NHAs) are both a good \ninvestment and national treasure providing economic benefits to \ncommunities and regions through their commitment to heritage \nconservation and economic development.\n  For all these reasons, Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the Jackson Lee \nAmendment.\n  I thank Chairman Calvert and Ranking Member McCollum for their work \nin putting together this legislation.\n\n\nThe Creation of a National Heritage Corridor for Emancipation Park and \n                  Surrounding Historic Sites in Texas:\n\n       I.) Why a National Heritage Corridor:\n       1. Opportunity to share the unique story of Emancipation \n     Park\n       In 1872, four former slaves raised $800.00 to purchase 10 \n     acres of land as a gathering place to celebrate their new \n     found freedom. This land has played a prominent role in \n     America's rich cultural heritage, from slavery, to the false \n     hopes of Emancipation, a safe haven under Jim Crow, a site \n     for mobilization and activism during the Civil Rights \n     movement and will now serve as a local, national and \n     international destination for many years to come for all \n     people for the discussion of modern day race relations and \n     for the celebration and exploration of African American \n     history and culture.\n       2. Link Related Historical Sites to create the Heritage \n     Corridor\n       From the Slave Ships landing in Galveston, to slaves \n     traveling into Ft. Bend and Harris County, up the Brazos into \n     Washington County and from East Texas into Central Texas.\n       3.

Raises the Profile of the Project for the Capital \n     Campaign\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Weber of Texas\n\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                       limitation on use of funds\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Section 321(a) of the Clean Air \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 7621(a)).\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a commonsense \namendment to the Interior and EPA Appropriations bill which, I hope, \nall Members can and will support.\n  First, I would like to commend Chairman Calvert for his work on this \nlegislation and for including critical provisions to prevent the EPA \nfrom moving forward on crippling new regulations on our economy.\n  Mr. Chairman, since 2009, our job creators have faced an onslaught of \nregulations from the EPA even as Congress has consistently reduced the \nAgency's budget year after year. The EPA has proposed a regulation to \nlower the national ozone standard, which is largely based on shaky \nscientific data and could cost our economy billions of dollars a year. \nThe EPA has also proposed new regulations on new and existing power \nplants that could substantially increase energy prices for hard-working \nfamilies and small businesses.\n  The Agency has cited its authority to regulate under the Clean Air \nAct as the basis for many of these decisions. However, when it comes to \nevaluating how its regulations impact American jobs, the Agency has \nfailed to follow the law. Section 321(a) of the Clean Air Act clearly \nstates: ``The Administrator shall conduct continuing evaluations of \npotential loss or shifts of employment.''\n  Last year, the EPA was sued because of its failure to comply with \nthis provision. Additionally, we heard testimony last month before the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee that further reinforced the \nEPA's failure to evaluate employment impacts as Congress has directed \nunder section 321(a).\n  It is unacceptable for the EPA Administrators to cherry-pick the law \nbased on their own ideological agenda. That is why I have introduced \nthis amendment, which would ensure that the EPA abides by the law and \nconducts ongoing evaluations of just how their actions impact jobs in \nAmerica. I urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Murphy of Florida\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n   limitation on use of funds to carry out seismic airgun testing or \n                      surveys off coast of florida\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to carry out seismic airgun testing or seismic airgun \n     surveys in the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area, the Straits of Florida Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area, or the South Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf \n     Planning Area located within the exclusive economic zone (as \n     defined in section 107 of title 46, United States Code) \n     bordering the State of Florida.\n\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Murphy, \nCastor, Jolly, Posey, Clawson, Graham, DeSantis, Ros-Lehtinen, Grayson, \nBuchanan, Hastings, Wilson amendment to block the use of seismic airgun \ntesting off of Florida's coast.\n  As you can see from the list of cosponsors, offshore drilling is not \na partisan issue in our State but an economic issue. Florida is a \nunique place that depends on healthy beaches, clean waters, and a \nsafeguarded environment. The seismic testing that the administration \nhas proposed puts all of these things at risk.\n  First, seismic airgun testing can be harmful to undersea mammals like \nendangered whale species and dolphins, disrupting their ability to \ncommunicate and navigate. It can also have negative effects on sea \nturtles, such as the loggerhead sea turtle, that have key nesting \ngrounds along the Treasure Coast and Palm Beaches in the district that \nI am so proud to represent. This testing practice can also disrupt fish \nmigratory patterns that could have significant impacts on fishermen in \nFlorida.\n\n                              {time}  2245\n\n  Second, seismic airgun testing is the first step in the wrong \ndirection to opening our pristine shores to offshore drilling and to \nthe threat of devastating oil spills. Florida has more coastline than \nany other continental State in the United States, and our economy \ndepends on healthy beaches.\n  I was proud when former Governor Jeb Bush and Florida's congressional \ndelegation actually came together and fought to block drilling off \nFlorida's coast, and now I am proud to join my many Florida colleagues \nto block this administration from putting special interests over the \neconomic and environmental needs of our State.\n  Whatever your party, Floridians protect their environmental treasures \nat all costs. As residents on the Gulf Coast are too well aware--and as \nI have seen firsthand myself--oil spills can devastate our environment \nand our economy up and down the coast. Twenty cities throughout Florida \nhave passed resolutions proactively banning seismic testing because \nthey know it is a rotten deal for our State.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this administration has already developed \nthe most restrictive policies for the use of seismic airguns for \noffshore exploration to date. We do not need to place a moratorium on \nthe use.\n  Further, the Eastern Gulf of Mexico Planning Area is more than 125 \nmiles off the Florida coast, and the South Atlantic Planning Area also \naffects Georgia and South Carolina. So the amendment affects many other \nStates other than his own. Also, the Department of the Interior has \nalready classified the Straits of Florida as a low resource potential \nor low support for potential new listing. As such, I urge my colleagues \nto vote ``no.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MURPHY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I certainly do appreciate the \nchairman's hard work on this bill, and many Members of Congress who are \nsupporting this in a bipartisan manner. In Florida, it is pretty clear \nto see, based on the cosponsors of this bill, that this isn't a \npartisan issue.\n  I would like to remind the chairman that regardless of how far \noffshore this is, what really matters is the infrastructure onshore. \nYou could talk about these sites, it doesn't matter how far offshore. \nThe fact is, you are going to have to have infrastructure there onshore \nthat really starts to impede with our economy, whether that is the \nbeaches, whether that is the\n\n[[Page H4842]]\n\ntourism, whether that is the fishing industry. So there is a lot more \nto it. But I do respect the chairman's hard work on this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I urge opposition to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Murphy).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mrs. Noem\n\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n     limitation on use of funds to close or move fisheries archives\n\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to close or move the D.C. Booth Historic National \n     Fish Hatchery and Archives.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom South Dakota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from South Dakota.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment to \nprevent the Fish and Wildlife Service from closing fish hatcheries \nacross the United States. I want to thank the chairman and his staff \nfor all their dedication and for preventing the closure of these \nhatcheries in the underlying bill. My amendment only clarifies their \nlanguage to ensure that it prevents closure of hatcheries and archives, \nwhich operate a little bit differently within the hatchery system.\n  For example, the D.C. Booth Historic National Fish Hatchery and \nArchives has been a cornerstone of the community in Spearfish, South \nDakota, with over 150,000 visitors annually. It was originally \nestablished in 1896 to introduce and maintain trout in the Black Hills \nof South Dakota, but it is much more than a fish hatchery. It is home \nto an 1800's era museum, a 1910 railroad car, priceless artifacts, and \neducational opportunities for children. Moving these items would cost \ntaxpayers, which doesn't make any sense, given the tens of thousands of \nvolunteer hours and private funds that are leveraged to run this \nhatchery.\n  I want to thank the chairman for working with me to preserve these \nhatcheries and archives that are certainly of cultural significance. I \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment to prevent their closure.\n  I yield to the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentlewoman's amendment. This \namendment is consistent with policy agreed to last year in the \nconference on a bipartisan basis. Fishing is a national pastime, to \nwhich the national fish hatchery plays an important role.\n  Therefore, I support the gentlewoman's amendment, and I urge an \n``aye'' vote.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from South Dakota (Mrs. Noem).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rouzer\n\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the rule \n     entitled ``Standards of Performance for New Residential Wood \n     Heaters, New Residential Hydronic Heaters and Forced-Air \n     Furnaces'' published by the Environmental Protection Agency \n     in the Federal Register on March 16, 2015 (80 Fed. Reg. 13671 \n     et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, in early March 2015, the Environmental \nProtection Agency published the final rule establishing excessive new \nstandards for wood heaters. This onerous rule is a classic example of \nbureaucratic overreach that has become all too common at the EPA. \nManufacturers in my district, as well as consumers, are very concerned \nabout the negative impacts of these new standards.\n  According to press reports, 10 percent of U.S. households still \nchoose to burn wood to keep energy costs as low as possible. The number \nof households that rely on wood as their primary heating source rose by \nnearly one-third from the year 2005 to 2012.\n  This new rule is of particular concern for rural residents all across \nthis country. Because of this new rule, the cost of manufacturing wood \nheaters would increase substantially, making them unaffordable for \nmany.\n  It is no secret that costs from additional regulations are always \npassed down to the consumers. Several States, in fact, have expressed \ntheir concern on this matter. Wisconsin, Missouri, Michigan, Virginia, \nand my home State of North Carolina have all introduced or passed \nlegislation that prohibits their respective environmental agencies from \nenforcing this burdensome, unnecessary regulation.\n  In defense of all the fine Americans who want to purchase wood \nheaters, my amendment to the Department of the Interior, Environment, \nand Related Agencies Appropriations Act prohibits any funds from being \nused to implement, administer, or enforce these new, unnecessary, and \ncostly standards. Simply put, the Federal Government has no business \ntelling private citizens how they should heat their homes or their \nbusinesses. After all, this is America. If an individual or family \nwants to heat their home or business using a wood stove or furnace, \nthey should be able to do so without paying through the nose.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Congressmen Walter Jones, \nMarkwayne Mullin, Rod Blum, Mark Meadows, Mike Bishop, Sean Duffy, and \nThomas Massie for their support on this amendment.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), \nmy colleague and friend.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina \nfor his leadership on this issue and for yielding the time to me.\n  First, the administration went after coal. Now it is coming after \nwood heat. In March, the EPA finalized a new rule to regulate the type \nof wood burning stoves and boilers that you can buy, forcing millions \nof middle class Americans to pay more to heat their homes.\n  That is why I am cosponsoring this legislation, to stop the \nadministration from enforcing new prohibitions on a renewable, \nabundant, and, dare I say, carbon-neutral method of heating our homes \nthat has been with us for centuries. If it passes, our amendment to the \nEPA funding bill will prohibit the Federal Government from using \ntaxpayer money to enforce crippling regulations on wood burning heating \nappliances.\n  As the price of electricity skyrockets due to the President's promise \nto bankrupt the coal industry, wood heat is a viable alternative for \nmillions of Americans. Unfortunately, it seems like this administration \nwould rather see people turn to the government for public assistance \nwith their heating bills than to allow them an affordable means of \nself-sufficiency.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a State issue. The Federal Government should \nnot be regulating wood burning appliances. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Calvert), the chairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I just rise in support of the amendment. I \nknow the State of North Carolina opposed the rule and passed the \nlegislation a few months ago to block these EPA regulations. I suspect \nit is not the only State that may have these concerns. Let's let the \nmarket drive manufacturers toward producing lower emission wood \nheaters.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment and urge an ``aye'' vote. I hope \nthat everybody who supports this amendment would also vote for the bill \nfor final passage.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer).\n\n[[Page H4843]]\n\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hudson\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n limitation on use of funds to remove oil and gas lease sale 260 from \n                            leasing program\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to remove oil and gas lease sale 260 from the Draft \n     Proposed Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing \n     Program for 2017-2022.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that \nprohibits the administration from blocking the proposed Atlantic lease \nsale from the Department of the Interior's draft proposed plan for \noffshore oil and gas development.\n  As cochairman of the Atlantic Offshore Energy Caucus, I have been \nfighting to advance an all-of-the-above energy strategy that gets North \nCarolina into the energy business.\n\n                              {time}  2300\n\n  I was pleased when the administration recently heeded calls from \nMembers of Congress--as well as our fine Governor, Pat McCrory, and \nother State leaders--when they announced a proposal to open up the \nAtlantic to offshore natural gas and oil exploration.\n  I welcome the proposal as one of the many steps that must be taken to \nunlock our natural resources, create jobs, and boost our economy.\n  The problem is we now face bureaucratic hoops and an uphill \nrulemaking process that could take the Atlantic lease sale completely \noff the table. In fact, Secretary Sally Jewell testified recently that \nshe could not guarantee the Atlantic lease would stay in the plan once \nit is finalized.\n  For years, there has been bipartisan support for an offshore lease \nsale off the Atlantic Coast. One was even scheduled off the coast of \nVirginia, but later blocked by this administration.\n  North Carolina has incredible potential for energy jobs, and I won't \nlet this opportunity slip through our fingers.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is critical to provide certainty to North \nCarolina and unleash jobs and lower energy prices. Our economy is \nsputtering along, and too many folks back home are struggling to find \njobs. Opening up the Atlantic to oil has the potential to support more \nthan 55,000 jobs in our State and contribute nearly $3 billion in new \nrevenue.\n  For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Calvert), the chairman.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I am not going to oppose the amendment. I certainly \nappreciate what the gentleman is trying to accomplish and generally \nagree that this administration has placed way too many restrictions on \ndrilling, both onshore and offshore.\n  These restrictions have delayed the permitting process and slowed \neconomic growth in your State and many other States around the Union. \nVarious groups have used that to their advantage.\n  I agree that more certainty is needed in the leasing and permitting \nprocess. What I am afraid of is this might lead to a precedent for \npreempting the Department of the Interior's decisionmaking under any \nPresident, and may lead to other amendments and kind of opening \nPandora's box, and Members doing specific amendments that are off their \nparticular States.\n  Saying that, as we move this process forward, I am not going to \noppose the amendment, but I just have some concerns we can talk about \nas we move this process along.\n  We both want the same outcome. I just want to make sure that we make \nsure this works in an orderly fashion.\n  Mr. HUDSON. I thank the chairman for his comments, and I appreciate \nhis leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. This amendment would mandate that the Bureau of Ocean \nEnergy Management include the South and mid-Atlantic area of the Outer \nContinental Shelf, otherwise known as sale 260 in the 2017-2022 lease \nsale schedule.\n  The amendment would undermine the Bureau's fundamental mission to \nmanage the development of offshore resources in an environmentally and \neconomically responsible manner.\n  The Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf is a frontier area, and the \ndecision to include sale 260 in the 2017-2022 5-year leasing schedule \nshould be informed by sound science, using the best available data.\n  The Bureau is required by law to consider the environmental impacts \nof leasing decisions, and this includes a comprehensive programmatic \nenvironmental impact statement, which has not yet been completed for \nthe Atlantic Outer Continental Shelf.\n  In fact, the most current geological and geophysical data on the oil \nand gas resources in this area was collected in the 1970s and 1980s. \nThat is really ancient by today's scientific standards.\n  Without the collection and analysis of new information, input from \nState Governors and other Federal agencies, and consideration of \ncritical economic analyses, the decision to include sale 260 in the \n2017-2022 program is premature and runs counter to the thoughtful and \ndeliberative process established by Congress through the Outer \nContinental Shelf Lands Act.\n  This amendment would violate multiple environmental statutes, \nincluding NEPA, the Marine Mammal Protection Act, the Endangered \nSpecies Act, and the Coastal Zone Management Act.\n  The amendment undermines environmental protection required by law. \nTherefore, I oppose the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my colleague's comments on the \nsubject.\n  The reason we need this step is to guarantee that the folks in North \nCarolina get a shot at these jobs. We are talking about 55,000 jobs and \npotentially as much as $3 billion in economic development in our State.\n  Frankly, it has been frustrating how hard it has been to get this \nprocess moved forward. If you look at the proposed lease sale, the sale \nis allowed in the fourth year of the 5-year period. Only one sale is \neven allowed. An artificial buffer of 50 miles was inserted into the \nsale.\n  We are getting one sale late in the 5-year period, with a 50-mile \nbuffer, when the old seismic shows that most of that oil and gas is \naround 25 miles out.\n  The ``yes'' that we got from the administration and the fact this \nprocess is even moving forward is good news for North Carolina and the \nother States on the Atlantic Coast; but it is certainly not, in my \nopinion, an appropriate response to the potential we have got there.\n  I agree with the gentlewoman when she said the seismic is old; the \nseismic was done in the late seventies, but this administration has \ncalled for new seismic mapping. I am looking forward to that because, \nagain, we want to use good science.\n  We have given one opportunity pretty far out in the fourth year of a \n5-year period, and I am afraid we are going to lose that because, if \nyou look at the history under this administration, there was a lease \nsale proposed in Virginia and that was taken away.\n  I think, to guarantee that we get at least some shot at unlocking \nthis potential off the coast of getting the American sources of energy \ninto the pipeline, getting North Carolinians to work in these energy \njobs, I think it is important we have this amendment. I would urge my \ncolleagues to support this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I certainly appreciate the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina and his concerns about jobs for his home State, but as a \nMember of\n\n[[Page H4844]]\n\nCongress who also represents the coastal State of Maine, I know the \ndeep concerns that people have about the potential dangers of offshore \noil drilling and the possible dangers to the fisheries, marine mammals, \nand a whole variety of other things. The reason we have this process is \nit is critically important to our State.\n  Mr, Chairman, I continue to oppose this amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Loudermilk). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Hudson\n\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to issue, \n     implement, administer, or enforce any regulation of \n     particulate matter emissions from residential barbecues.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I rise tonight to offer an amendment that \nwould prohibit the EPA from regulating particulate matter emissions \nfrom residential barbecues.\n  As you may recall, last August, the EPA issued a grant to ``perform \nresearch and develop preventative technology that will reduce fine \nparticulate emissions from residential barbecues.''\n  The EPA gets a lot of things wrong, especially with this preposterous \nstudy. For one thing, ``barbecue'' is a term us southerners use to talk \nabout the best pork in North Carolina or a community pig picking.\n  What they are proposing is reducing emissions from residential \npropane grills, which means they want to stop you and me from grilling \noutside on our own property. By the way, propane is one of the most \nclean and efficient sources of energy out there.\n  Regulations that waste our time, money, and resources are bad as it \nis, but they are trying to go as far as restricting our personal \nfreedom.\n  Mr. Chairman, this grant was met with staunch opposition from \nconservatives and other outdoor enthusiasts like myself. If this isn't \npart of EPA's larger goal of regulating grill emissions, then it begs \nthe question why they are wasting our hard-earned tax dollars on this \nmind-boggling study in the first place.\n  We have seen overreaches by the EPA time and time again, from their \nflawed waters of the USA regulation to their disastrous clean power \nplan that is cap-and-trade by fiat to their new ground level ozone \nregulations that would have a catastrophic impact on manufacturing in \nthis country; but now, they are studying limiting emissions from \nresidential grills. Enough is enough.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is summer, and it is grilling season. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the concerns of the Member \nfrom North Carolina, and I will give him credit. They have better \nbarbecue than my home State. We have got you beat on lobsters, but that \nis how it goes.\n  I want to say I think this argument is somewhat cynical and a little \ntoo suspicious of our government; perhaps Republicans have gotten too \nfar down this road.\n  My understanding is this summer, a conservative media outlet ran a \nsensationalized story about EPA's regulatory overreach. The story \nclaimed that EPA has its eyes on pollution from backyard barbecues. The \nproblem with the story and this amendment is that it is based on a \nfalse premise and a mischaracterization of important work.\n  EPA operates a successful and innovative grant program that \nencourages students around the Nation to design solutions for a \nsustainable future. It is called People, Prosperity, and the Planet \nStudent Design Competition for Sustainability. Its purpose is to foster \ninnovation, not to create regulations.\n  The EPA awarded one of these design grants to a group of University \nof California students working to design a system to make barbecues \nburn cleaner and be better for the environment. The students received \n$15,000 from the EPA for the idea. In addition, the university has said \nthe idea has potential for global application.\n  Mr. Chair, in many developing nations, women hunch over traditional \ncook stoves for hours a day, breathing in toxic smoke. Exposure to this \nhousehold air pollution is responsible for low birth weights, childhood \npneumonia, and more than 4 million premature deaths each year.\n  The availability of cleaner cooking technologies could literally be \nlifesaving for many of these women and children. Instead of attacking \nthe EPA for these innovative grants, we should be applauding them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her kind \ncomments about North Carolina barbecue. I do admit the lobster rolls in \nMaine are pretty good. Maybe we can work out some kind of exchange.\n  The gentlewoman is right. I am guilty as charged. I am cynical and \nsuspicious of the Federal Government, particularly the EPA, when you \nlook at the some of the things they are spending our tax dollars on and \nsome of the rules they are proposing.\n  Let's get serious. We are talking about a $15 million grant to study \nthe emissions of a propane grill in your backyard.\n  Now, we all are concerned about toxic smoke in homes and living \nconditions of individuals--the example that was mentioned--but we are \ntalking about a propane gas grill in your backyard. The EPA has no \nbusiness regulating that. They have spent $15 million of our tax money \nto form a study, which is the first step in a rulemaking process.\n  I think this Chamber needs to say loud and clear to the EPA: focus on \nthe job that the gentlewoman described, focus on the real issues and \nthe mission of the EPA, and keep your hands off our grills in our \nbackyards.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I am happy to have an exchange--North \nCarolina barbecue, Maine lobster. It is probably a pretty fair \nexchange.\n  I just want to clarify. It is $15,000, not $15 million that the EPA \nspent working on this innovation.\n  I understand your concerns, and I appreciate the points that you \nbrought up.\n  Mr. Chairman, I continue to oppose the amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Mr. Fitzpatrick\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                         forest legacy program\n\n       Sec. __. For ``Department of Agriculture--Forest Service--\n     State and Private Forestry'' for the Forest Legacy program, \n     as authorized by section 1217 of Title XII of the Food, \n     Agriculture, Conservation and Trade Act of 1990 (16 U.S.C. \n     2103c), there is hereby appropriated, and the amount \n     otherwise provided for ``Department of the Interior--Bureau \n     of Land Management--Management of Lands and Resources'' is \n     reduced by, $5,985,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4845]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n                              {time}  2315\n\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I intend to offer and then withdraw \nthis amendment which will make it easier for land preservation efforts, \nincluding under the Federal Forest Legacy Program.\n  During my time as a local official in Pennsylvania as a Bucks County \ncommissioner, I was proud to lead local efforts to preserve the beauty \nof the countryside and the Bucks County landscape, while advancing \nsmarter development initiatives to reclaim brownfields through \ncommonsense conservation efforts.\n  Along with a task force for that purpose, our community was able to \nexpend approximately $100 million for the preservation of farmland, \nparkland, and critical natural areas, close to about 15,000 acres in \nour one county preserved.\n  Now, as a strong advocate for land preservation in Congress, I \ncontinue to be a supporter of vital conservation programs, including \nthe United States Forest Service's Forest Legacy Program.\n  My amendment today would reallocate $5.9 million from the Bureau of \nLand Management, Management of Lands and Resources, to the Forest \nLegacy Program for the purpose of fully funding two additional \npreservation projects.\n  The Forest Legacy Program is a Federal program that supports and \nencourages State and private efforts to protect environmentally \nsensitive forestlands. The program helps the States develop and carry \nout their forest conservation plans, while encouraging and supporting \nacquisition of conservation easements without removing the property \nfrom private ownership.\n  Most conservation easements restrict development, require sustainable \nforestry practices, and protect other values.\n  The additional funding my amendment provides will allow for the \nprotection of 4,000 acres of Pennsylvania forests in the Northeast \nConnection.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Northeast Connection is a collaboration between the \nPennsylvania Department of Conservation and Natural Resources and three \ngroups of over 150 families to conserve more than 4,000 contiguous \nforest acres which serve as a natural bridge between the 84,000-acre \nDelaware State Forest, which is managed by the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, and the 77,000-acre Delaware Water Gap National \nRecreation Area, managed by the National Park Service.\n  I believe this project is a crucial objective to preserving \nPennsylvania's and our Nation's natural resources and beauty.\n  Again, I want to thank the chairman for his hard work on the \nunderlying bill. I look forward to working with the chairman on robust \nfunding for this program.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I certainly appreciate the gentleman yielding me time, \nand I appreciate the gentleman's willingness to work with us.\n  We support the Forest Legacy Program, and I pledge to you we will \ncontinue to work with you and other supporters of the program as we \nmove this process along.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I thank the chairman for his desire to provide \nadditional resources, if possible, to the Forest Legacy Program. It is \na great program for our Nation, well utilized by States and local \ncommunities and private landowners. I look forward to working with the \nchairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n           Amendment Offered by Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n    limitation on use of funds to treat northern long-eared bat as \n                           endangered species\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service or any \n     other agency of the Department of the Interior to treat the \n     northern long-eared bat as an endangered species under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife Service has released a final 4(d) rule listing the northern \nlong-eared bat as ``threatened'' under the Endangered Species Act.\n  While certain colonies of the species of bat have seen dramatic \npopulation losses in recent years, Fish and Wildlife has repeatedly \nasserted that the underlying fundamental cause is a fungal disease \nknown as the white-nose syndrome.\n  White-nose syndrome does not directly kill or harm these bats. \nRather, it wakes them out of hibernation, resulting in the bats burning \nthrough stored fat and leaving their hibernacula in search of food when \nnone is often found or available.\n  I am pleased that the underlying legislation contains funding for \nwhite-nose syndrome research. Bats play a critical role in the \necosystem, and more needs to be done in order to restore colonies \ndevastated by white-nose.\n  However, as we allow for necessary habitat conservation, we must also \nensure that activities occurring in the bats' range are not \nunreasonably or unnecessarily impacted as a result of the Endangered \nSpecies Act listing.\n  Specifically, such a listing could have great impacts on forest \nmanagement, forest products, agriculture, energy production, mining, \nand commercial development. Because this species of bat is found in 38 \nStates and Washington, D.C., a listing under the Endangered Species Act \nwould have significant impacts through this enormous geographical \nrange.\n  My amendment is simple. It merely prohibits the Department of the \nInterior, for a period of 1 year, from considering any new rules beyond \nthe final 4(d) rule or any action to treat the northern long-eared bat \nas endangered, which is the most restrictive form of ESA listing.\n  The intention is to ensure reasonable land use within the bats' range \nwhile Fish and Wildlife continues to research and work with the States \non finding treatments for white-nose syndrome.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit the Fish \nand Wildlife Service from treating the northern long-eared bat as \nendangered under the Endangered Species Act.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service listed the northern long-eared bat as \nthreatened--threatened--with an interim rule in April of this year. \nSince the bat was listed as threatened and not endangered, this \namendment would have no effect on the Service's implementation of the \nrule.\n  Even though the amendment has no practical effect, I strongly oppose \nits intent, which runs counter to the fundamental principle that \nscience should govern our determinations under our environmental laws.\n  Bats are critically important to the ecosystem, and a study published \nin Science magazine found the value of pest control services provided \nby insect-eating bats in the United States ranges from the low of $3.7 \nbillion to the high of $53 billion a year.\n  Additionally, researchers warn that notable economic losses to North \nAmerican agriculture could occur in the next 4 to 5 years as a result \nof emerging threats to bat populations. Bats play an important role in \nour economy when it comes to eliminating pests.\n  The primary factor threatening the northern long-eared bat is a \nfunctional\n\n[[Page H4846]]\n\ndisease called white-nose syndrome, as has been mentioned. However, \nbecause this disease has reduced populations of the bat, human \nactivities that might not have been significant in the past are now \nhaving a greater effect.\n  It is appropriate that Fish and Wildlife Service is taking steps to \nprotect the species, but we should be supporting the Fish and Wildlife \nService in its efforts. We should be supporting them, not blocking the \nagency from doing its job.\n  So I rise in opposition to this amendment, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman \nfor her perspectives. Certainly, a number of those points I agree \nwith--the value of the bats--as chairman of the Conservation and \nForestry Subcommittee. In agriculture, bats serve a very important \npurpose.\n  I also agree with her premise, although I think her interpretation of \nwhat the science is is somewhat misguided. The science is extremely \nimportant, and the science has shown, in fact, the agency responsible \nfor oversight on the Endangered Species Act has publicly acknowledged, \nthat any job-crushing restrictions on industries related to habitat \nunder an endangered listing with these bats will not help the northern \nlong-eared bats. The threat really is going to an endangered listing \nwhich would do that.\n  I would agree that the Fish and Wildlife Service needs resources and, \nquite frankly, they are getting those. Just last week they released $1 \nmillion toward studying the white-nose syndrome. Within this underlying \nbill, I believe there is an amount of $10 million to study the white-\nnose syndrome. It is a fungus. It is not habitat, and it is not the \nindustries that work within those habitats.\n  And so, quite frankly, we need to give the Fish and Wildlife Service \nwhat they need, and that is the support that they have already, that \nthey released last week through many grants throughout many States, and \nthe underlying $10 million in this underlying bill.\n  I would just ask for support of my amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I read from the amendment:\n\n       None of the funds made available by this Act may be used by \n     Fish and Wildlife or any other service or agency in the \n     Department of the Interior to treat the northern long-eared \n     bat as an endangered species.\n\n  Well, first off, I reiterate again, it is listed as threatened, not \nas endangered. And this amendment doesn't even address the role the \nForest Service would still have. So this is a poorly constructed \namendment.\n  We need to be very, very careful and very thoughtful when we write \nthese amendments and make sure that we not only give Fish and Wildlife \nthe tools that they need, that when something is threatened and not \nendangered, whether it is the Forest Service, Interior, or whether it \nis U.S. Fish and Wildlife, we need to let them do their job based on \nthe science.\n  Mr. Chairman, I do not support the amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act shall \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species \n     listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse under the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Preble's meadow jumping mouse is a tiny rodent with a body \napproximately 3 inches long, with a 4- to 6-inch tail and large hind \nfeet adapted for jumping. This largely nocturnal mouse lives primarily \nin streamside ecosystems along the foothills of southeastern Wyoming \nsouth to Colorado Springs in my district, along the front range of \nColorado. To evade predators, the mouse can jump like a miniature \nkangaroo, up to 18 inches high, using its 6-inch-long whiplike tail as \na rudder to switch directions in midair.\n  But the little acrobat's most famous feat was its leap onto the \nEndangered Species list in May 1998, a move that has hindered \ndevelopment in moist meadows and streamside areas from Colorado \nSprings, Colorado, to Laramie, Wyoming.\n  Among many projects that have been affected: the Jeffco Parkway \nsoutheast of Rocky Flats, an expansion of Chatfield Reservoir, and \nhousing developments in El Paso County along tributaries of Monument \nCreek. Builders, landowners, and local governments in affected areas \nhave incurred hundreds of millions of dollars in added costs because of \nthe mouse. Protecting the mouse has even been placed ahead of \nprotecting human life, and let me explain why that is the case.\n  On September 11, 2013, Colorado experienced a major flood event which \ndamaged or destroyed thousands of homes, important infrastructure, and \npublic works projects. And while Colorado has come a long way in \nrebuilding, there remains a lot of work to be done.\n  As a result of the Preble's mouse's listing as an endangered species, \nmany restoration projects were delayed as Colorado sought a waiver. In \nfact, FEMA was so concerned that they sent out a notice that stated, \n``legally required review may cause some delay in projects undertaken \nin the Preble's mouse habitat.''\n\n                              {time}  2330\n\n  It goes on to warn that ``local officials who proceed with projects \nwithout adhering to environmental laws risk fines and could lose \nFederal funding for their projects.'' While a waiver was eventually \ngranted, the fact remains that the scientific evidence does not justify \nthese delays or the millions of taxpayer dollars that go toward \nprotecting a rodent that is actually part of a larger group that roams \nthroughout half of the North American continent.\n  Several recent scientific studies have concluded that the Preble's \nmouse does not warrant protection because it isn't a subspecies at all \nand is actually part of the Bear Lodge jumping mouse population. Even \nthe scientist that originally classified this mouse as a subspecies has \nsince recanted his work.\n  Moreover, the Preble's mouse has a low conservation priority score, \nmeaning the hundreds of millions of dollars already spent on protection \nefforts could have been better spent on other, more fragile species or \nother uses to accomplish good.\n  The threats that development and transportation allegedly pose to the \nmouse have been greatly overstated. Ample regulations already in place \nminimize the impact of development on this species.\n  My amendment would correct the injustice that has been caused by an \ninaccurate listing of the Preble's meadow jumping mouse and refocus the \nU.S. Fish and Wildlife Service's efforts on species that have been \nthoroughly scientifically vetted and that actually should come under \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would prohibit Fish and \nWildlife Service from treating the Preble's meadow jumping mouse as \nthreatened or endangered under the Endangered Species Act and would \nrestrict, again, the Fish and Wildlife Service from offering any of the \ncritical protections to preserve the species.\n  This amendment is in addition to a growing list of anti-Endangered \nSpecies Act provisions, and it makes one wonder if--for the number of \npeople here who are opposing the work that Fish and Wildlife is doing \nunder the Endangered Species Act--if the intent isn't just to do away \nwith the entire act.\n\n[[Page H4847]]\n\n  Last year, Fish and Wildlife reviewed two petitions to delist the \nPreble's meadow jumping mouse and determined that protections under the \nEndangered Species were still necessary.\n  Voting for this amendment might undo a lot of work that was done that \nis well on its way to having this mouse removed from the endangered \nspecies list because this amendment ignores the determination and \nshort-circuits the statutory process informed by science.\n  I would certainly think that a rider on this bill is not the place to \nhave a robust debate about how close we are maybe with Fish and \nWildlife being able to delist this mouse and, by putting this language \nin the bill, that it undoes a lot of potentially good work.\n  It throws out, with this amendment, the carefully science-based work, \nas I said, that the Fish and Wildlife Service has worked towards and \nchips away at the very foundation of the Endangered Species Act, which \nmakes me wonder, as I said earlier, if the intent of many of the \namendments being offered is not only to chip away but to do away with \nthe Endangered Species Act.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, all I will say in response is that this is \na subspecies--actually, it is not even a species or subspecies. It \nshould have never been listed in the first place.\n  The science shows that it is actually part of the Bear Lodge jumping \nmouse population. For that reason, it shouldn't even be on the list in \nthe first place.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, to the gentleman's remarks, this is not \nthe place--as a rider on the environmental appropriations bill--to be \nhaving these thoughtful discussions. If that is what needs to take \nplace, this is not the bill to be doing it on. I mean, we have an \nauthorizing committee. They can hear things on it; and you can have a \nrobust, full, transparent discussion and bring all the scientists in.\n  Let me close with this: I would be really remiss if I did not remind \nmy colleagues that the Endangered Species Act, in fact, did rescue the \nbald eagle. The bald eagle's recovery is an American success story \nbecause we were united in the belief that this was the symbol of our \nNation and was worth protecting for the continuing benefit of future \ngenerations.\n  It feels like we have lost sight of being able to do that today, \nespecially with the lack of transparency and full debate that takes \nplace with all these riders being offered on an authorization bill.\n  Congress needs to give serious consideration of what kind of \nconservation legacy we are leaving for our children, and our children \nwill want us to do a better job than just to put riders onto an \nappropriations bill. I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Lamborn\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I have one other amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce the threatened species or \n     endangered species listing of any plant or wildlife that has \n     not undergone a review as required by section 4(c)(2) of the \n     Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1533(c)(2) et \n     seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment is straightforward. It simply ensures that \nthe U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has to follow section 4(c)(2) of the \nEndangered Species Act by conducting a review of all threatened and \nendangered plants and wildlife at least once every 5 years. It \nprohibits any funds in the bill from being used to implement or enforce \nthe listing of any plant or wildlife that has not undergone the review \nas required by law.\n  Under the Endangered Species Act, the purpose of a 5-year review is \nto ensure that threatened and endangered species have the appropriate \nlevel of protection. The reviews assess each threatened and endangered \nspecies to determine whether its status has changed since the time of \nits listing or its last status review and whether it should be removed \nfrom the list, delisted; reclassified from endangered to threatened, \ndownlisted; reclassified from threatened to endangered, uplisted; or \nmaintain its current classification. You can find all this on the Web \nsite of the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.\n  Because the Endangered Species Act grants extensive protection to a \nspecies, including harsh penalties for landowners and other citizens, \nit makes sense to verify if a plant or animal should be on the list in \nthe first place.\n  Despite this commonsense requirement, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife \nService has acknowledged that it has neglected its responsibility to \nconduct the required reviews for hundreds of listed species.\n  For example, in Florida alone, it was found that 77 species out of a \ntotal of 124 protected species in that State were overdue for a 5-year \nreview. In other words, the government had not followed the law for a \nstaggering 62 percent of species in that State.\n  In California, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service acknowledged that \nit had failed to follow the law for roughly two-thirds of the State's \nspecies listed under the Endangered Species Act and was forced by the \ncourts to conduct the required reviews of 194 species.\n  By enforcing the 5-year review, which is in current law, my amendment \nwill ensure that the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is using the best \navailable scientific information in implementing its responsibilities \nunder the Endangered Species Act, including incorporating new \ninformation through public comment and assessing ongoing conservation \nefforts. These are things we should all be in agreement with.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in ensuring that the U.S. Fish \nand Wildlife Service follows the Endangered Species Act, that we do not \nprovide money in this bill that would violate current law.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment, again, would prohibit the \nFish and Wildlife Service from implementing or enforcing the Endangered \nSpecies Act listing for any species that has not undergone a review. \nThis amendment joins a growing list of anti-Endangered Species Act \nprovisions.\n  The amendment would block the listing of any species that does not \nreceive status review by Fish and Wildlife Service every 5 years. Fish \nand Wildlife Service is required to do a 5-year review every 5 years \nafter a species is listed. However, with over 1,500 domestic listed \nspecies, that would amount to over 300 status reviews every year.\n  Why hasn't Fish and Wildlife done it? Well, it is because we--\nCongress--do not provide Fish and Wildlife Service with enough \nresources to complete such a large task.\n  Follow the law? They would love to. In fact, this bill that we are \nconsidering right now includes a 50 percent--a 50 percent--cut in the \nlisting program. Now, how can they follow the law when Congress doesn't \nput any tools in the toolbox allowing them to do their job?\n  I really have to wonder if this House is prepared to appropriate the \nmillions of dollars that would be needed to meet the requirement of \nthis amendment.\n  Fish and Wildlife Service already follows a transparent, science-\nbased listing process. This amendment only seeks to undermine the \nEndangered Species Act because there is not enough money in here that \nCongress provides Fish and Wildlife to do the job in the fashion that \nCongress has asked it to do.\n  In order to list a species under the Endangered Species Act, the Fish \nand Wildlife Service follows a strict legal process known as a \nrulemaking procedure. The first step in assessing the\n\n[[Page H4848]]\n\nstatus of the species is the Fish and Wildlife Service publishes a \nnotice of reviews that identify the species that is believed to meet \nthe definition of threatened or endangered. The species are candidates.\n  Now, these notices of review then, the Fish and Wildlife Service goes \nout and seeks biological information to complete the status of the \nreviews for the candidate species; then the Fish and Wildlife Service \npublishes those notices in the Federal Register so the process is \ntransparent to the public.\n  As you can see, the Fish and Wildlife Service follows an open, \ntransparent policy that adequately reviews the species prior to \nlisting. This amendment would exploit a 5-year review backlog that has \nbeen caused in part by this Congress' unwillingness to provide adequate \nfunding in order to attack the endangered species list. Let's be \ntransparent about that.\n  The Endangered Species Act exists to offer necessary protections to \nensure species survival. Quite frankly, the majority of our \nconstituents support that. Let's make sure that science and species \nmanagement practices continue to dictate species listings, not \nCongress; and let's figure out a way to come together, as the gentleman \nsaid, to give Fish and Wildlife the tools that they need in order that \nthey can follow the laws that Congress has requested them to follow and \nnot do a smoke and mirror show about how Fish and Wildlife is refusing \nto follow the law.\n  They can only do what they are able to do with the dollars that \nCongress appropriates to them.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I am glad that my colleague from Minnesota \nacknowledged that it is required under the law for Fish and Wildlife \nService to do these 5-year reviews. I thank her for admitting that.\n  Their budget is approximately $1.4 billion, and they are able to \nprioritize within that $1.4 billion where they spend their resources. \nIt is not Congress' fault. They just haven't made it a priority. They \nshould make it a priority to follow the law. They can do these few \nhundred reviews every year out of $1.4 billion, I am sure.\n  I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment. Let's require \nthis agency to follow the laws that are on the books.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I want to be really clear. This bill now \nincludes a 50 percent cut to the listing program. The listing program \nis money that Congress puts in it to do the reviews. Congress cut it by \n50 percent.\n  They can't just transfer money around. We have handcuffed and tied up \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service by the amount of funding that Congress \ngives them to do their job.\n  They don't wake up in the morning and say: We don't want to follow \nthe law.\n  They wake up in the morning, and they see how much Congress has \nappropriated them.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I just want to point out that what you are talking about \nwould be in the future. I am talking about the current status of them \nnot following the law by doing the reviews.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Reclaiming my time, they do not have the funding.\n\n                              {time}  2345\n\n  Congress has not given them the funding in the listing program to do \ntheir job. Congress needs to be held accountable for the 300 listings \nnot being able to be done every year because Congress has failed to \ngive them the money to do the laws that Congress passed.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Goodlatte\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to take any of \n     the actions described as a ``backstop'' in the December 29, \n     2009, letter from EPA's Regional Administrator to the States \n     in the Watershed and the District of Columbia in response to \n     the development or implementation of a State's watershed \n     implementation and referred to in enclosure B of such letter.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Virginia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment simply prohibits the EPA from using the \nChesapeake Bay total maximum daily load and the Watershed \nImplementation Plans to take over States' water quality strategies, \nprotecting the 10th Amendment rights of States across the Nation from \nthe heavy hand of the EPA. This amendment makes it clear that Congress \nintended for the Clean Water Act to be State led, not subject to the \nwhims of politicians and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C.\n  Over the last several years, the EPA has implemented a total maximum \ndaily load plan for the Chesapeake Bay watershed which strictly limits \nthe amount of nutrients that can enter the Chesapeake Bay. While a \nlaudable goal and one I support in principle, through its \nimplementation, the EPA has basically given every State in the \nwatershed an ultimatum--either the State does exactly what the EPA \nsays, or it faces the threat of an EPA takeover of their water quality \nprograms. In some cases, the EPA will even rewrite the States' water \nquality plans if they disagree with the States' decisions.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to make it perfectly clear that this amendment \nwould not stop the EPA from working with the States to restore the \nChesapeake Bay, nor would it in any way undermine the cleanup efforts \nalready underway. I repeat, our amendment does not stop the TMDL or \nwatershed implementation plans from moving forward, and it does not \nprevent the EPA from working cooperatively with the States to help \nrestore the Chesapeake Bay.\n  This amendment is very carefully crafted to address the 10th \nAmendment federalism issues that the EPA is encroaching upon and does \nnot address the States' laudable goals of continuing to improve the \nhealth of the Chesapeake Bay.\n  The States should be able to use any resources the EPA may have \navailable to help develop and implement a strategy to restore the Bay. \nThis amendment only stops the ability of the EPA to step in and take \nover a State's plan--again, ensuring states' rights remain intact and \nnot usurped by the EPA.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Bay is a national treasure, and I want to see it \nrestored. But we know that in order to achieve this goal, the States \nand the EPA must work together. The EPA cannot be allowed to railroad \nthe States and micromanage the process.\n  With this amendment, we are simply telling the EPA to respect the \nimportant role States play in implementing the Clean Water Act and help \nprevent another Federal power grab by the administration.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Calvert).\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I certainly agree with the amendment, and I urge \nadoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I seek time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maryland is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, here we go again, yet another fix in \nsearch of a problem.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to Mr. Goodlatte's amendment. It \nwould deliberately undermine the crucial work that is already being \ndone to rehabilitate the Chesapeake Bay. It would also undermine the \nhistoric Federal-State partnership that has done so much already to \nimprove the quality of the Bay and its surroundings.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure. It is the \nNation's\n\n[[Page H4849]]\n\nlargest estuary. It benefits all Americans, and especially those living \nin the six States that comprise the Bay watershed: Maryland, Virginia, \nWest Virginia, Delaware, Pennsylvania, New York, and the District of \nColumbia.\n  The States in the Chesapeake Bay watershed, including the gentleman's \nown home State of Virginia, have been working together for over 40 \nyears to clean up the Bay. And guess what, Mr. Chairman? It is working.\n  The Chesapeake Bay Program's most recent interim report shows that \ntremendous progress has been made. States are meeting the pollution \nreduction goals in their plans. In fact, some are exceeding them. \nStudies show that so-called ``dead zones'' are shrinking, and key \npopulations such as oysters are starting to rebound.\n  Under the Chesapeake Clean Water Blueprint, States develop and \nimplement their own pollution reduction plans. The EPA set up an \ninitial framework, but the details of how each State chooses to reach \nthe targets, in fact, are State-driven and State-implemented. My own \nhome State of Maryland has created a plan to reduce its nitrogen levels \nby 46 percent, phosphorus by 48 percent, and sediment by 28 percent \nbelow the benchmark 1985 levels.\n  Of course, each of the Bay watershed States depends on the other \nStates to implement these plans simultaneously and in good faith. After \nall, Mr. Chairman, watersheds don't stop at the State borders, and the \nkind of go-it-alone approach that seems to be advocated by the majority \nhas never worked for environmental issues, and it will not work to \npreserve and to save the Chesapeake Bay.\n  Failure, for example, by one State to do its part threatens the work \nand hundreds of millions of dollars that all the other States have \ninvested in their plans. I don't want to see Maryland's work \njeopardized because another State in the watershed doesn't meet its \nresponsibilities. And only the EPA can stand as the arbiter to make \nsure that that is true.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, as a safety measure against that kind of bad faith \nby one of the partners, the EPA has backstop actions that it can take \nto ensure that the other States' investments are preserved. These \nbackstop actions are not new authorities, but they are existing \nauthorities that the EPA can use to make the needed pollution \nreductions. That has been part of the partnership for 40 years.\n  In fact, just yesterday, the U.S. Third Circuit Court of Appeals in \nPhiladelphia unanimously affirmed the EPA's authority to place \nrestrictions on wastewater treatment and runoff by farms and \nconstruction. The EPA places limits on the amount of nitrogen, \nphosphorus, and sediment that are allowed in the watershed and, thus, \ninto the Bay. This is known as the total maximum daily load, or TMDL, \nof chemical runoff that the Bay's watershed can handle while still \nmeeting water quality standards.\n  The court in its decision strongly affirmed that ``the States and EPA \ncould, working together, best allocate the benefits and burdens of \nlowering pollution.'' It is, in fact, an acknowledgment that this is a \npartnership that requires the full participation of the Environmental \nProtection Agency.\n  Mr. Chairman, the goal of the partnership is not just an \nenvironmental one. According to a peer-reviewed report by the \nChesapeake Bay Foundation, the economic impact of full implementation \nof the Clean Water Blueprint is more than $22 billion annually. Yet \nthis amendment by one of Virginia's own Members actually threatens that \npartnership by barring the EPA from using funds to take any backstop \nactions. It would allow one State to break its agreement and cease \nimplementing the plan.\n\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I would urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, may I ask how much time is remaining on \neach side.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining, and the gentlewoman from Maryland's time has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Thompson), the chairman of the \npertinent subcommittee in the Agriculture Committee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Mr. \nGoodlatte's amendment.\n  Since 2009, I have been hearing directly from my constituents--many \nof who are small farmers--about the significant challenges and costs of \nthe Chesapeake Bay total maximum daily load mandate. These significant \nconcerns also extend to the State and local governments because of the \nbillions of dollars in direct costs and new regulatory burdens that \nTMDL imposes. No doubt the Chesapeake Bay is a national treasure, but \nit is quickly becoming the national treasury with all these costs and \ntaxes upon our States and local municipalities.\n  The Agriculture Committee's Conservation and Forestry Subcommittee, \nwhich I have the honor of chairing, has also heard directly from the \nstakeholders over the past few Congresses.\n  While each and every one of these witnesses wholeheartedly supports \nthe restoration of the Chesapeake Bay, there remains great concern over \nthe lack of consistent models, the heavy-handed approach of TMDL, and \nthe lack of needed flexibility while implementing the WIPs. This \namendment is needed in order to allow for that flexibility at the State \nand local levels.\n  Pennsylvania has been very innovative in our efforts to do our part \nwith the Bay restoration, and that innovation will continue into the \nfuture.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield the gentleman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I thank the chairman.\n  However, rather than acting punitively, EPA must work collaboratively \nwith the States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly support this amendment, and I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania. He is \nquite right. This is very costly for the States. The State of Virginia \nhas estimated a cost of over $16 billion to comply with the backstop \nrequirements of the EPA. That is just one of the six States.\n  Secondly, the EPA has been asked repeatedly, including in hearings \nconducted by the gentleman from Pennsylvania in his subcommittee and at \nmy request and the request of others, to do a cost-benefit analysis to \nshow us that the multi-tens of billions of dollars that these six \nStates will collectively spend will be reflected in improvements to the \nquality of the Chesapeake Bay. They have never provided that cost-\nbenefit analysis.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I would say to the gentlewoman from Maryland, \nshe also is quite right that tremendous progress has been made in \nimproving the health of the Chesapeake Bay, but almost all of it prior \nto the President taking his pen and signing the executive order that \ncontains this backstop language that we need to stop and return the \npower to the State and local governments.\n  Sedimentation, phosphorus, and nitrogen are all down more than 40 \npercent--sedimentation more than 50 percent going into the Bay. The Bay \nis improving in its health because of the work done by the States. They \nshould have the authority to do this without having the EPA hold a gun \nto their head.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why this amendment should be passed, and I urge \nmy colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, I thank Ms. McCollum for her work on this \nbill and to Bobby Scott and Don Beyer for joining me in this effort. I \nrise in opposition to this amendment.\n  Just yesterday, the 3rd Circuit Court of Appeals upheld EPA authority \nto set Chesapeake Bay pollution limits, which have led to the best \ncleanup progress in over 25 years. For the Bay, as with so many other \nwaters across the country, the Clean Water Act backstop is critical to \nensure that states are meeting their commitments.\n  In Maryland, we have cities working to manage stormwater and farmers \nimplementing best management practices to stop runoff. But for all our \nefforts, we will never have a clean and healthy Bay if pollution runs \ndownstream from Pennsylvania, New York, or West Virginia.\n  With our enormous watershed, encompassing 64,000 square miles, six \nStates, and\n\n[[Page H4850]]\n\nD.C., everyone must do their fair share. And to do that is through the \nClean Water Act's Federal backstop. I strongly oppose this amendment \nand urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Maryland \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mrs. Black\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to finalize, \n     implement, administer, or enforce section 1037.601(a)(1) of \n     title 40, Code of Federal Regulations, as proposed to be \n     revised under the proposed rule entitled ``Greenhouse Gas \n     Emissions and Fuel Efficiency Standards for Medium- and \n     Heavy-Duty Engines and Vehicles - Phase 2'' signed by the \n     Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency on June \n     19, 2015 (Docket No. EPA-HQ-OAR-2014-0827), or any rule of \n     the same substance, with respect to glider kits and glider \n     vehicles (as defined in section 1037.801 of title 40, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, as proposed to be revised under such \n     proposed rule).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentlewoman \nfrom Tennessee and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Tennessee.\n\n                              {time}  0000\n\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment to \nprotect Tennessee workers and small manufacturing businesses from the \nEPA's latest overreach.\n  Last month, the EPA released its Phase 2 fuel-efficiency and \nemissions standards for new medium-and heavy-duty trucks.\n  While many in the trucking industry are not opposed to this rule as a \nwhole, one section in the proposal wrongly applies these new standards \nto what is known as glider kits.\n  I recently toured a business in my district that manufactures these \nkits. For those who don't know, a glider kit is a group of truck parts \nthat can include a brand-new frame, cab, or axles, but does not include \nan engine or transmission.\n  Since a glider kit is less expensive than buying a new truck and can \nextend the working life of a truck, businesses and drivers with damaged \nor older vehicles may choose to purchase one of these kits instead of \nbuying a completely new vehicle.\n  Unfortunately, the EPA is proposing to apply the new Phase 2 \nstandards to glider kits, even though the gliders are not really new \nvehicles.\n  Mr. Chairman, this directly impacts my district where we have glider \nkits being manufactured and purchased by companies in places like \nByrdstown, Sparta, and Jamestown, communities that are already \nstruggling with an above average unemployment and would see job \nopportunities put further out of reach if this misguided rule goes into \neffect.\n  It is also unclear whether the EPA even has the authority to regulate \nreplacement parts like gliders in the first place.\n  Once more, while the EPA's stated goal with Phase 2 is to reduce \ngreenhouse gas emissions, the Agency has not studied the emissions \nimpact of remanufactured engines and gliders compared to new vehicles.\n  Mr. Chairman, if the EPA is going to promulgate rules that raise \ncosts and hurt jobs in districts like mine, the least they could do is \nto have a few facts prepared to back them up.\n  Under this ill-advised rule, businesses and drivers that wish to use \nglider kits would be effectively forced to buy a completely new vehicle \ninstead. Reducing glider sales would also end up limiting consumer \nchoice in the marketplace.\n  That is why my amendment protects businesses, jobs, and consumers by \nprohibiting the EPA from moving forward with this Phase 2 standard on \nglider kits.\n  To be clear, this amendment would not--would not--bar the EPA from \nimplementing the whole Phase 2 rule for new medium- and heavy-duty \ntrucks. It would simply clarify that glider kits and glider vehicles \nare not new trucks as the EPA wrongly claims.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment to help \nsupport American manufacturing and stop the EPA from attempting to shut \ndown the glider industry.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. BLACK. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  It is my understanding that the proposed rule is supported broadly by \nmany in the trucking manufacturing industry, so for that reason, I \nsupport her amendment.\n  However, as with any rule, there are some specifics that we need to \niron out. I would like to work with my colleague and with EPA to see if \nwe can't resolve those specifics between now and the final rule.\n  In the meantime, I support including language in the Interior bill, \nand I urge Members to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I am hopeful that the discussion that the \nsubcommittee chair and the author of the amendment might prove \nsomething better than what this amendment is currently in front of us, \nbut what I have to work on is what is currently in front of me.\n  Just over 2 weeks ago, the Environmental Protection Agency and the \nNational Highway Safety Traffic Administration issued proposed fuel \nefficiency standards for medium- and heavy-duty trucks required by the \nEnergy Independence and Security Act.\n  This amendment would prohibit the EPA from finalizing, implementing, \nand administering or enforcing this proposed rule or any future rules--\nso this is where I am concerned about the way this amendment is moving \nforward--with respect to glider vehicles.\n  These new standards were designed to improve fuel efficiency, cut \ncarbon pollution, and reduce the impacts of climate change. To be \nspecific, these standards are expected to lower CO2 \nemissions by roughly 1 billion metric tons, cut fuel costs by $170 \nmillion, and reduce oil consumption up to 1.8 billion barrels over the \nlifetime if a vehicle is sold under this program.\n  Heavy trucks account for 5 percent of the vehicles on the road; yet \nthey create 20 percent of the greenhouse gas emissions created by all \ntransportation sectors.\n  We know from my colleagues that this amendment does not actually \nsuspend all aspects of the new rule. As it was pointed out, it simply \ncarves out an exemption for one particular industry, an industry that \nproduces what has been called, today, glider vehicles.\n  As has been pointed out, glider vehicles are heavy-duty vehicles that \nreplace older remanufactured engines on new truck chassis. These \nengines date back to 2001 or older, and they have emissions that are 20 \nto 40 times higher than today's clean diesel engines.\n  In essence, this amendment would allow an entire segment of the truck \nmanufacturing industry to simply avoid compliance with the new criteria \npollutant standards that are in the rule. These are engines that will \ncontinue to emit greenhouse gases, slow down our progress, and reduce \nthe impacts of climate change.\n  In short, this amendment creates a loophole that you could drive a \ntruck through by allowing dirty engines to continue to pollute our \nenvironment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Chairman, I want to once again reiterate that this is \na very narrow amendment. It does not apply to new trucks, as the EPA \nrule indicates.\n  I also want to reiterate one more time that they have not studied the \nemissions impact of these remanufactured engines and the gliders \ncompared to new vehicles, so we would like to have that information as \nwell.\n\n[[Page H4851]]\n\n  I also want to add that the military also uses glider kits, and this \nrule would not apply to them. Once again, we are putting into place \nsomething where we say this is what the government can do, but this is \nwhat the private sector can do.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Mica\n\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 441.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement Alternative A, Alternative C, or \n     Alternative D, described in the Final General Management Plan \n     and Environmental Impact Statement for Castillo de San Marcos \n     National Monument in St. Augustine, Florida, for the \n     educational center authorized by Public Law 108-480 nor shall \n     funds be expended for a new General Management Plan other \n     than the General Management Plan approved by record of \n     decision published in the Federal Register September 10, \n     2007.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, every year, nearly 1.5 million visitors come \nto the Castillo de San Marcos and Fort Matanzas National Monuments in \nAmerica's oldest city, St. Augustine, Florida.\n  Way back some 11 years ago, in December of 2004, I passed legislation \nauthorizing a visitors center for Castillo de San Marcos, which was \nsigned into law. The Castillo fortress is the largest intact Spanish \nfortress in the continental United States, with construction that was \ncompleted in 1695.\n  After the authorization was signed into law, significant, thorough, \ncostly, and time-consuming studies and reports were completed after \nmany reviews, hearings, and public forums.\n  Then in 2007, 3 years later, the National Park Service came up with a \nfinal general management plan. This plan developed four alternatives. \nOne was to do nothing; that was A. Two others, C and D, were to \npossibly build on land that will no longer be available that was going \nto be made available by the State and the city. That leaves one \nalternative. Now, this is a very simple, clarifying amendment.\n  Alternative B is the one that we would like funds spent on. Here, we \nare saying no funds shall be spent to do nothing; no funds will be \nspent or wasted to go towards a project that isn't going to happen.\n  This is a simple, clarifying, limiting amendment. It would \nspecifically limit funds from being expended on any alternative, except \nfor B, which is in the plan, been in the plan. It doesn't say that we \nhave to do another plan; why spend more taxpayer moneys to do another \nplan? That is all it says.\n  It is a simple thing to get us moving to proceed with the final \ndesign without further cost and further delaying the process. A \nvisitors center at Castillo is long overdue, and it is overdue on St. \nAugustine's 450th founding anniversary, so I urge its passage.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. MICA. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I certainly appreciate the gentleman from \nFlorida raising this issue. I always learn new facts when we have these \ndebates. I didn't know that St. Augustine was the Nation's oldest city. \nI always thought it was Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n  Mr. MICA. Some people are under the misconception of Williamsburg.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I know; but I have learned something today.\n  I certainly commend the gentleman's longstanding interest in this. I \nknow you have been working on this for a number of years. The Castillo \nde San Marcos National Monument in St. Augustine needs a new visitors \ncenter.\n  I certainly look forward to working with you as we move this issue \nforward, and we certainly have no objection to this amendment.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Burgess\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Environmental Protection \n     Agency to hire or pay the salary of any officer or employee \n     of the Environmental Protection Agency under subsection (f) \n     or (g) of section 207 of the Public Health Service Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 209) who is not already receiving pay under either \n     such subsection on the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the subcommittee chairman for his \nindulgence at this late hour.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an issue that has been under investigation by \nthe Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee for over the last 6 years.\n  In 2006, without consultation from the Energy and Commerce Committee, \nthere was included a provision in the annual Interior, EPA \nappropriations bill that allowed the Environmental Protection Agency to \nbegin using a special pay program that was explicitly and exclusively \nauthorized for use by the Public Health Service administration under \nthe Department of Health and Human Services.\n  This special pay mechanism allows a government employee to leave the \nnormal GS pay scale and receive nearly uncapped compensation, upwards \nof $200,000 to $300,000 per year.\n  This special provision was intended to be used only in unique \ncircumstances where, perhaps, leaders of the healthcare industry would \nnot be able to work for the Federal Government because of pay \nconsiderations if they did not have access to these higher salaries.\n  This justification cannot be used for anyone at the Environmental \nProtection Agency. Indeed, some of the employees that the Environmental \nProtection Agency pays under title 42, the part of the U.S. Code that \nallows for this special pay, were previous government workers and were \nmerely moved to this special pay scale because they wanted additional \nmoney.\n\n                              {time}  0015\n\n  The EPA claims that, because the Environmental Protection Agency is a \nhealth organization, it may use this statute to pay special hires, and \nthis, in fact, has endured for several years. Originally, the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency was granted only a handful of slots to \nfill with title 42 hires. That number is now over 50. The cost to \ntaxpayers for these 50 employees is in the tens of millions of dollars.\n  This amendment would prevent the Environmental Protection Agency from \nhiring any new employees under title 42 or from transferring current \nemployees from the GS pay scale to title 42. It would not affect \ncurrent employees being paid by this provision. It would give the \nEnergy and Commerce Committee, the authorizing committee, the time it \nneeds to address whether the Environmental Protection Agency truly \ndeserves this special pay consideration. The General Accountability \nOffice looked into the abuse of title 42 several years ago and found \nnumerous problems with the implementation of the program. Why we would \nallow this problematic pay structure to be advanced by the EPA is, in \nfact, mysterious.\n  In multiple hearings in the Energy and Commerce Committee, both \nAdministrator Lisa Jackson and current Administrator Gina McCarthy \nrefused to give specifics regarding this program. A Freedom of \nInformation Act request sent to my office by the EPA union, the \nAmerican Federation of Government Employees, showed that title 42 hires \nat the EPA are actually sowing the seeds of discontent amongst workers, \nwith the union asking the Congress to stop this unfair hiring \ntechnique.\n\n[[Page H4852]]\n\n  Both former Energy and Commerce Committee Chairman Barton and I have \nintroduced legislation further clarifying that the Public Health \nServices Act, written for the Department of Health and Human Services, \ndoes not permit the Environmental Protection Agency to use its language \nto hire employees under a special pay structure. This amendment \nprevents further abuses of the program, and I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the EPA is one of several government \nagencies that uses a special authority to hire Federal employees with \nspecific scientific research credentials. In fact, when the Republicans \nwere the majority party in 2006, they started this program. The EPA \ndidn't start this program on its own. Congress started it in 2006 under \na Republican majority. The National Institutes of Health uses title 42 \nmoney and authority to attract top-tier scientists in their fields to \ndo important research.\n  We have been listening to many hours this evening of many of my \nRepublican colleagues criticizing the EPA's scientific conclusions. So \nnow it amazes me that the gentleman wants to reduce the Agency's \nability to hire the top scientists. Further, the National Academy of \nSciences has favorably reported to the committee that the EPA is \neffectively utilizing its title 42 authority. If a scientist retires or \nmoves on, the Agency would no longer be able to attract a suitable \nreplacement if this amendment were to pass.\n  For those who think the EPA doesn't have adequate scientific basis \nfor its regulations, they should be with me, and they should clearly \nvote against this amendment. We should be doing more to ensure that our \nenvironmental policies are being set by the best and the brightest. \nThis amendment would ensure that the EPA can't recruit new scientists \nusing its limited title 42 authority, which was given to them, to the \nEPA, in 2006 by a Republican Congress.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the amendment. It is \nclear that this program does need the scrutiny of the authorizing \ncommittee. We are prepared to do that if this amendment passes.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment Offered by Mr. Westmoreland\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to pay legal fees pursuant to a settlement in any \n     case, in which the Federal Government is a party, that arises \n     under--\n       (1) the Clean Air Act (42 U.S.C. 7401 et seq.);\n       (2) the Federal Water Pollution Control Act (33 U.S.C. 1251 \n     et seq.); or\n       (3) the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Georgia and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, the United States is facing a crisis \nof executive overreach, and nowhere else is this more true than with \nthe Environmental Protection Agency. The EPA's escalation of sue and \nsettle cases to change the law through Federal court rulings threatens \nour economy and the ability to create jobs, not to mention bypassing \nthe normal rulemaking process. By operating hand in hand with radical \nenvironmental groups that are willing participants in these types of \nactions, the EPA's use of sue and settle not only endangers the economy \nbut also our constitutional separation of powers.\n  Here is how it works:\n  An organization sues the EPA or an agency such as the U.S. Fish and \nWildlife, demanding that the agency apply the law in a new, unintended, \nand expanded way that increases the agency's jurisdiction. The agency, \nrather than defending the law, enters into a consent decree with the \nparty who filed the original lawsuit. A judge then signs the consent \ndecree without significant review since the two disputing parties are \nin agreement. Suddenly, the agency has new, expansive powers to wield \nagainst job creators in the form of a legally binding settlement that \ncreates rules and priorities outside of the normal rulemaking process. \nBetween 2009 and 2012, the EPA chose not to defend itself in over 60 of \nthese lawsuits from special interest advocacy groups. Those 60 lawsuits \nresulted in settlement agreements and in the EPA's publishing more than \n100 new regulations.\n  Also included in these legally binding settlements are requirements \nthat U.S. taxpayers must pay for the attorneys of the organization that \ninitiated the action. According to a 2011 GAO report, between 1995 and \n2010, three large environmental activist groups, like the Sierra Club, \nreceived almost $6 million in attorneys' fees alone. An example of sue \nand settle occurred with a start-up, shutdown, and malfunction rule. \nThis was in response to a sue and settle agreement the EPA made with \nthe Sierra Club in 2011.\n  As noted by Louisiana Senator David Vitter in a letter to EPA \nAdministrator Gina McCarthy in 2013:\n\n       Instead of defending the EPA's own regulations and the SSM \n     provisions in the EPA-approved air programs of 39 States, the \n     EPA simply agreed to include an obligation to respond to the \n     petition in the settlement of an entirely separate lawsuit.\n\n  Sue and settle is made possible because, under the Clean Air Act, the \nClean Water Act, and the Endangered Species Act, potential litigants \nare given broad standing to go to court because Congress has defined \ncauses of action under these laws. Under my amendment, no funds can be \nused to pay legal fees under any settlement regarding any case arising \nunder the three acts I mentioned--period, case closed, end of story. \nLitigants can still sue, but they will no longer be financially \nrewarded by the American taxpayer for their efforts.\n  I am hopeful that my colleagues on both sides of the aisle will \nsupport this amendment to reduce the secretive transfer of U.S. \ntaxpayer dollars to other organizations. By restricting Federal \nagencies from having the ability to pay attorneys' fees, we will not \nonly reduce Federal spending but also reduce the incentive for these \nself-interest groups to continue suing the Federal Government and \ntaking American taxpayer dollars that could be used to reduce our \nFederal deficit.\n  It is inexcusable to require taxpayers to pay the legal bills of \nenvironmental groups to collude with the EPA in order to expand the \nAgency's abilities. This is one way Congress can fight the expansion of \nexecutive powers by this administration and its most out-of-control \nagency. With this amendment, Congress can ensure taxpayers are \nprotected from funding the legal efforts of environmental advocacy \norganizations and from arming the EPA with draconian enforcement \npowers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the Equal Access to Justice Act is the \nlaw of the land. Within limits, it does allow for the Federal payment \nof legal fees to individuals and small businesses and nonprofits that \nare the prevailing parties in actions against Federal agencies unless \nthe agency is able to show that the action was substantially justified \nor a special circumstance existed to make the award unjust. This law \nhelps to deter government misconduct, and it encourages all parties, \nnot just those with resources, to hire legal counsel to assert their \nrights.\n  I know that my colleagues, including my colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, will agree with me that the ability to challenge Federal \nactions is the most important tool for ensuring government \naccountability. The Clean Air Act, the Federal Water Pollution Control \nAct, and the Endangered Species Act are also the law of the land, and \nthese laws have contributed greatly to the protection and improvement \nof public health in this country. A study by a nonpartisan \nenvironmental law institute found that the Equal Access to\n\n[[Page H4853]]\n\nJustice Act has been cost-effective and only applies to meritorious \nlitigation, and existing legal safeguards and the independent \ndiscretion of Federal judges will continue to ensure its prudent \napplication. There are safeguards in place so that this can't be \nmisused.\n  Moreover, the claim that large environmental groups are getting rich \non attorneys' fees is not supported by available evidence. The 2011 GAO \nstudy, which was just referenced and was at the request of the House \nRepublicans, brought cases against the EPA. They found that most of \nthose suits were brought by trade associations and private companies \nand that attorneys' fees were only awarded about 8 percent of the time; \nand among the environmental plaintiffs, the majority of those cases \nwere brought by local groups rather than by national groups.\n  It is completely unfair to target these important environmental \nsafeguards for removal from the protection of the Equal Access to \nJustice Act. More importantly, this amendment would have serious \nconsequences for public health. In order for our Nation's environmental \nsafeguards to work properly and ensure the protection of public health, \ncitizens, including those with limited means, must have the ability to \nchallenge Federal actions. This amendment is clearly designed to make \nit more difficult for regular citizens to ensure the accountability of \nthe Federal Government. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. Mr. Chairman, this does not prevent anybody from \nsuing. This stops the EPA from this sue and settle--what I would call \n``scam''--where it allows the groups or companies or whatever to come \nin and sue and allow them--I mentioned there were 60 different cases--\nthe ability to make 100 new rulings that did not go through the normal \nrulemaking procedure but were done by court rulings.\n  I think it is appropriate that we not allow taxpayer dollars to be \nspent on these attorneys' fees that are being used to do this--to \npromote the Environmental Protection Agency. Rather than going through \nthe regular rulemaking process, it is doing it by a court ruling.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the Equal Access to Justice Act is the \nlaw of the land. It allows for the Federal payment of legal fees, \nwithin limits, to individuals and small businesses and nonprofits which \nare the prevailing parties in actions against the Federal Government.\n  Again, we should be mindful of the 2011 GAO study that said, in cases \nbrought against the EPA, it found that most suits were brought by trade \nassociations and private companies and that attorneys' fees were only \nawarded in about 8 percent of the cases.\n  Citizens need to be able to hold their government accountable. They \nneed to be able to petition their government, and that means a citizen \nwith limited means. If that citizen wins and if the judge decides that \nit is just to award the costs, then that is the law of the land, which \nI support. Private citizens, regular citizens--citizens without means--\ncan ensure that there is full accountability of the Federal Government \nto them. I urge my colleagues to defeat this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0030\n\n  Mr. WESTMORELAND. As I would like to repeat, Mr. Chairman, this does \nnot keep anybody from suing. The intent of this amendment is to keep \nthe EPA from creating rules by judicial bodies rather than a normal \nrulemaking procedure.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Westmoreland).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Georgia will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Rokita\n\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The Clerk will report the \namendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following new section:\n\n\n  enforcement of the endangered species act regarding certain mussels\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to \n     enforce the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. 1531 et \n     seq.) with respect to the Clubshell, Fanshell, Rabbitsfoot, \n     Rayed Bean, Sheepnose, or Snuffbox mussels.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from \nIndiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Calvert for \nmanaging the time tonight and for getting us to this point.\n  By my calculation, it has been 5 years since we have been able to \nhave these kind of debates on the floor of the House, and here we are, \nat 12:30 at night.\n  Speaking for myself, I have listened to the entire debate here \ntonight on the floor, starting with votes after 6:30. Mr. Chairman, I \nwas struck by the amount of amendments having to do with the Endangered \nSpecies Act, number one; and, number two, having to deal with the \nlists, whether threatened or endangered lists of Endangered Species \nAct.\n  Clearly--and I would agree with the gentlewoman on the other side of \nthe aisle on this--reform and major reform of the Endangered Species \nAct is needed. That will take some time. That discussion has been \nongoing.\n  It is nothing that hasn't already started in this Congress or in \nprevious Congresses. I look forward to being a part of that solution in \na very constructive way.\n  What about the near term? We have people, human constituents who are \nreally suffering; and that is what my amendment, Mr. Chairman, is about \ntonight. Summer is a big time for any industry that depends on tourism \nto survive. I offer this amendment out of concern for two lake \ncommunities in my district.\n  Just last year, during the height of the summer's busy tourist \nseason, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service required that the \nNorthern Indiana Public Service Company, locally known as NIPSCO, \nrelease more water into the Tippecanoe River from Lake Freeman to \nprotect a bed of endangered freshwater mussels that live further down \nthe Tippecanoe River, all under the guise of the Endangered Species \nAct.\n  As a result, in a matter of days, water levels on Lake Freeman \ndropped dramatically. I have visited with local residents near Lake \nFreeman multiple times and have seen the lake in person. Growing up \nduring the summers, I spent my time on the sister lake, Lake Shafer.\n  Many who live and work near the lake discovered, to their surprise, \ntheir boats were stuck, businesses were in jeopardy, and home values \nwere going down; but more than that, stumps were rising out of the \nwater, and personal health and safety were also in jeopardy as a \nresult.\n  Now, I immediately contacted Fish and Wildlife, and I want to applaud \nthem for their responsiveness and NIPSCO for working together. We \ncreated a technical assistance letter, otherwise known as a TAL. It is \nmy estimation that that is going to have some effect. Again, I \nappreciate the reasonableness of all involved.\n  The current plan there is a temporary fix, and really, we ought to be \nable to do more. Now, currently, Fish and Wildlife receives funding to \nenforce the Endangered Species Act, which protects six species of \nmussels that live in the river, as the Clerk mentioned as he read the \namendment.\n  The Endangered Species Act gives the highest priority to protected \nand listed species, and there is little anyone can do in terms of \nexceptions or exemptions or even any kind of balancing test to make \nsure that there is not a solution that could be a win-win. It is a very \ndraconian law--strict compliance, no balancing test, no room for \ndiscretion or creative solution. That is where this reform is needed.\n  The statute, like I said, provides no balancing test for weighing the \neconomic harms, and the Supreme Court\n\n[[Page H4854]]\n\nof this land has refused to allow us or even lower courts to construct \ntheir own test, us as citizens. Compliance with this law, as currently \nwritten, requires diverting water from Lake Freeman to the Tippecanoe \nRiver to balance water levels, despite consideration of the economic \nimpact and human safety.\n  In essence, my amendment limits the funding mechanism Fish and \nWildlife would be able to use to enforce the Endangered Species Act \nwith respect to these six types of mussels and eliminates the financial \nrepercussions for failing to enforce the law.\n  Speaking firsthand with residents, lowering these water levels in \nLake Freeman negatively affects the community and small businesses that \nrely on the tourists who enjoy the lake and the steady water level. \nLower water levels also pose dangerous swimming conditions to both \nboaters and swimmers as formerly underwater tree stumps breach the \nwater. This is unnecessary and a preventable hazard to those who use \nthe lake and, again, in a win-win way.\n  It is all because of this draconian law that, although well intended, \nis badly in need of reform so that its practical effect can be \noverhauled and any of its misguided applications halted.\n  Hoosiers, like myself, are just as concerned for the environment as \nthey are for their incomes and family recreation. It is not about \nantienvironmentalism, but they believe, like I said, there is a win-win \nsolution here, if only the law would allow such a solution to exist. In \nthe meantime, we ought to defund Fish and Wildlife's ability to enforce \nthis law as it is written.\n  While I value nature and seek to protect endangered animals, the \nreward of protecting the mussel does not outweigh the economic damage \ndone to this community or the personal safety or health of my human \nconstituents.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would, once again, prevent \nFish and Wildlife Service from enforcing the Endangered Species Act \nwith respect to six different species of mussel and would restrict the \nFish and Wildlife Service from offering any of the critical protections \nto preserve these species.\n  This amendment is harmful and, in my opinion, misguided. Once a \nspecies is listed under the Endangered Species Act, it is a role of \nFish and Wildlife Service--is primarily permissive, helping parties \ncomply with the act as they carry out their activities, the TAL that \nthe gentleman referred to.\n  Under this amendment, all the Endangered Species Act prohibitions \nwould still apply, but developers and landowners would have no avenue \nto comply with them. There could be no TAL. The Fish and Wildlife \nService would be barred from issuing permits or exemptions.\n  This means landowners and industry and other parties who might need \nto take any of these six species of mussels would be vulnerable to a \ncitizens suit. Additionally, this amendment would halt Fish and \nWildlife Service enforcement of the Endangered Species Act, which has \nno effect on other Federal agencies that are funded outside of this \nbill.\n  The Endangered Species Act mandates that all Federal departments and \nagencies conserve listed species and use their authorities in \nfurthering the purpose of this act.\n  Section 7 of the Endangered Species Act stipulates that any Federal \nagency that carries out, permits, licenses, funds, or otherwise \nauthorizes activities that may affect all listed species must consult \nwith the Fish and Wildlife Service to ensure that its actions are not \nlikely to jeopardize the continued existence of any listed species.\n\n  This amendment would stop--stop--section 7 consultation requirements \nfor Federal agencies; rather, it would prohibit Fish and Wildlife from \ncompleting these consultations. That means a bridge or a highway \nproject permitted or funded through the Federal Highway Administration \nor power projects permitted by the Department of Energy would be \nvulnerable to delays and stoppages and other potential lawsuits.\n  This amendment, in my opinion, is an all-out assault on the \nEndangered Species Act. In one fell swoop, it would block protections \nfor six different species that are currently listed as threatened or \nendangered; but, regardless of one's position on the Endangered Species \nAct, it is just a bad amendment.\n  The gentleman's amendment will create uncertainty for developers, \nlandowners, leaving them vulnerable to lawsuits. I don't think that was \nthe gentleman's original intention, but that is the effect it will have \nbecause it will block section 7 consultations, gumming up permitting \nprocessing across the Federal Government, delaying projects, and \nadversely impacting the economy.\n  The amendment is bad for the environment. It is bad for the economy. \nIt is bad for business. It is bad for the highways and energy projects. \nIt is just bad for this bill. I urge my colleagues to reject this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Loudermilk). The question is on the amendment \noffered by the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. LaMalfa\n\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n              limitation on use of funds for attorney fees\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to pay attorney fees in a civil suit under section \n     11(g) of the Endangered Species Act of 1973 (16 U.S.C. \n     1540(g)) pursuant to a court order that states such fees were \n     calculated at an hourly rate in excess of $125 per hour.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to express my support for the \ngood work Chairman Calvert and the subcommittee have done on this bill.\n  This amendment, which I offered with my colleagues Representatives \nBill Huizenga and Bill Flores, aligns attorney fee award limits for \nEndangered Species Act lawsuits with award limits for other lawsuits \nagainst the Federal Government established by the Equal Access to \nJustice Act.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act generally limits the hourly rate for \nawards of fees to prevailing attorneys to a reasonable $125 per hour. \nHowever, no such fee cap exists under the Endangered Species Act. As a \nresult, ESA litigants are being awarded sums, in many cases, in excess \nof $600 per hour.\n  The Equal Access to Justice Act was not intended as an extraordinary \naccess to taxpayer dollars for environmental attorneys. Indeed, we \nheard one of my colleagues a minute ago talk about sue and settle.\n  According to the GAO, the Department of the Interior paid out over \n$27 million in attorney fees between 2001 and 2010; $21 million of \nthose payments were for Endangered Species Act lawsuits. Many of them \nsettled with no court order, finding the litigants to have prevailed on \nthe merits of the case--no finding.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is time we close this loophole that enables \nexcessive payouts to groups that have made a business of suing the \nFederal Government. There is simply no reason that one sort of lawsuit, \na type commonly undertaken by entities solely engaged in continuous \nlitigation against the government, should be paid more than any other.\n  Representative Huizenga sponsored a measure addressing this issue \nlast session, which was passed by the Committee on Natural Resources. I \nurge your support, which would be very much appreciated, including by \npeople like my daughter whose birthday it is tonight, so they would \nhave a chance to be in business and not have these extraordinarily high \nfees.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n\n[[Page H4855]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman's amendment would prohibit \nfunds in the act from being used to pay attorney fees in excess of $125 \nper hour for the Endangered Species Act civil suits.\n  Now, perhaps the gentleman is not aware that the Equal Access to \nJustice Act caps attorney fees at $125 per hour unless the court--the \ncourt--determines that an increase in the cost of living or special \nfactors, such as the limited availability of qualified attorneys for \nthe proceedings involved, justifies the higher fee.\n\n                              {time}  0045\n\n  So it would be the court that would determine that. But the fee is \ncapped at $125 an hour. This is unnecessary and it is a redundant \namendment. Attorney fees for the Endangered Species Act cases, as I \nsaid, are already capped at $125 per hour, unless special criteria are \nstipulated by the Equal Access Justice Court.\n  This amendment would effectively change that implementation of the \nEqual Access Justice Act for one specific policy area: the Endangered \nSpecies Act.\n  Again, higher attorney fees are only permitted in cases where \nspecific criteria under the Endangered Species Act are met. At best, \nthis amendment is redundant; at worst, it is a backdoor attempt to \nundermine the Endangered Species Act protections and make access to \njustice a lot less equal.\n  In closing, Mr. Chair, we don't need any extraneous, redundant \nprovisions to a bill that is already overburdened with harmful \nlegislative riders. So I urge my colleagues to oppose this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. I appreciate the comments by my colleague from Minnesota \nhere, but it has been very unequal already, with many, many cases being \npaid out at $600, $700 per hour. So this amendment seeks to actually \nput that cap on there. There will still be the ability for a court, in \nextraordinary circumstances, to make the decision of whether it should \nbe higher.\n  But I am glad I am not in the position, like my colleague from \nMinnesota, of defending $600 or $700 an hour for attorney fees for more \nfrivolous environmental lawsuits that make it difficult to farm, ranch, \nmine, and do timber operations which are desperately needed, especially \nwith the conditions we have in California, with our forests as well as \nthe drought situation and trying to get work done to address that.\n  So when the people watch what goes on here, they need to be cognizant \nthat there are those in the government that would rather pay to $600 to \n$700 per hour for more frivolous environmental lawsuits while they \nsuffer from drought or burning forests.\n  With that, I think that this amendment is very much in order because \nwe see that these limits aren't being followed at all under the $125 \nlimit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment Offered by Mr. Graves of Louisiana\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, insert after the last section \n     (preceding the short title), the following:\n       Sec.__. None of the funds provided in this Act may be used \n     in contravention of 33 U.S.C. 1319 with respect to a permit \n     issued or required to be issued to the U.S. Army Corps of \n     Engineers pursuant to 33 U.S.C. 1344 for discharges of \n     dredged or fill material impacting wetlands.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Louisiana and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, Americans are tired of two \nstandards: a standard whereby private citizens are treated one way and \na standard whereby the Federal Government treats themselves in an \nentirely different way.\n  Nothing is more apparent in this situation than where the U.S. Army \nCorps of Engineers grants themselves one way of complying with wetlands \nregulations, yet they impose an entirely different standard upon our \nprivate citizens.\n  The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the EPA go out and purport to be \ndefenders of wetlands; good stewards of our wetlands. Yet the greatest \ncause of wetlands loss in the United States is actually caused by \nhistoric current and future actions of the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers.\n  In our home State of Louisiana, we have lost over 1,900 square miles \nof our coast, and the majority of that land loss has been caused by the \nmanagement or the mismanagement by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers of \nour coastal resources and the river resources, particularly the \nMississippi River.\n  Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is it simply requires that the \nU.S. Army Corps of Engineers comply with the same standards as anything \nelse. If there are permits required, they have to get them. If there \nare mitigation requirements, they have to get them. They can no longer \nmismanage our coastal resources.\n  This isn't a parochial. This is an issue whereby the Nation truly \nbenefits from this. This is the area where fishery production occurs, \nenergy production occurs. We literally power this Nation's economy and \nwe feed American families.\n  So this wetlands loss that we are experiencing actually increases the \nvulnerability of our coastal communities in south Louisiana and \nincreases the demands upon FEMA and other agencies in response to \ndisasters.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I urge adoption of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used on an unmanned aircraft system or to operate any such \n     system owned by the Department of the Interior for the \n     performance of surveying, mapping, or collecting remote \n     sensing data.\n\n  Mr. PERRY (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to \ndispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for allowing me to offer this \namendment. It prevents the Department of the Interior from competing \nwith our local job creators in the use of UAS--unmanned aerial \nsystems--for land surveying, mapping, imaging, and remote sensing data \nactivities.\n  There is concern that agencies like the USGS and the Bureau of Land \nManagement are acquiring the UAS and utilizing them on projects that \ncan be accomplished by the private sector. We have no problem with them \nusing them. We have no problem with them using them for forest fires \nand those types of things, for emergency situations, but where local \nbusinesses can do this work, we think that it is unfair\n\n[[Page H4856]]\n\nfor the government to take that work away.\n  Having the Department compete with local employers results in a loss \nof business for private geospatial firms under contract to other \nFederal mapping agencies. The government is actually getting a leg up \non the private market by obtaining Certificates of Authorization, or \nCOAs, and performing services with UAS that are otherwise commercial in \nnature.\n  Current law and regulation permits private citizens and firms to \noperate UAS for a hobby. However, there is no effective enforcement to \nprevent government abuse of such authority for commercial purposes.\n  The fact that government agencies can operate a UAS while the private \nsector cannot as freely or timely gain airspace access has created and \nuneven playing field. Allowing the Department of the Interior to \ncompete with the free market use of UAS is not only poor stewardship of \ntaxpayer money and inefficient use of resources, but results in the \ngovernment duplicating and directly competing with private enterprise.\n  This is a $73 million marketplace, Mr. Chairman. It drives more than \n$1 trillion in economic activity. More than 500,000 American jobs are \nrelated to the collection, storage, and dissemination of imagery and \ngeospatial data. Another 5.3 million citizens utilize such data. As \nmuch as 90 percent of the government information has a geospatial \ninformation component. Up to 80 percent of the information managed by \nbusiness is connected to a specific location. The geospatial \nmarketplace is identified by the Department of Labor as one of just 14 \nhigh gross sectors in the United States workforce.\n  With that, I urge support of this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. The Department of the Interior and the U.S. Geological \nSurvey have been using unmanned aircraft to complement conventional \nsatellite-based remote sensing. Using remote sensing via unmanned \naircraft did make sense. It allows for the rapid collection of data and \nallows for the Department to get a closer look at natural disasters as \nthey develop.\n  The Department and the USGS are using unmanned aircraft to monitor \nthe spread of wildfires, monitor riverbank erosion, detect and locate \ncoal steam fires, conduct waterfall surveys, and inspect abandoned \nmines.\n  It is clearly evident to everyone that this technology offers a real \npublic safety benefit. So it makes no sense to hamstring the Department \nwhen the technology can save lives and the survey can monitor dangerous \nnatural events.\n  Now, the way that the amendment is written--and I am all for the \nprivate sector being able to do things, and that is in your new \namendment, that the private sector is not affected by this amendment--\nif the private sector currently isn't operating in this space looking \nat abandoned mines or looking at wildfires and we need to do something \nright away, your amendment would prohibit the Federal Government from \nusing equipment it would have and be able to launch up and look at \nsomething in real time.\n  I don't think that was the total intention of your amendment. But \nbecause even though you worked in the redraft to make sure that you \nprotected contractors--and I am glad you did that--I don't know where \nthat leaves us in times of emergency when there isn't a contractor \navailable, because you haven't allowed prohibition.\n  For that reason, Mr. Chair, I oppose the amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. I appreciate the gentlewoman's comments.\n  First of all, I did state that fire observation would not be \nincluded. Indeed, it is not written in the amendment. It is very \nspecific. So for emergency purposes, if need be, the Department of the \nInterior still can use, whether it uses its own or DHS' or one of the \nother myriad agencies that have the vehicles, it still has the ability \nto do that.\n  But I would also remind the gentlewoman that there are plenty of \nambulance services and other emergency services for contract hire out \nthere in our communities that perform emergency services every hour of \nthe day, every day of the year. That fact notwithstanding, the private \nindustry does provide all the other things that the agency is currently \nembarking on on its own and leaving the private sector out.\n  A friend just called me today and asked me, because I am a helicopter \npilot in the Army, if we could put his air-conditioning unit on a roof. \nI said, ``Absolutely not.'' The Army doesn't do what the civilian world \ndoes for good reason. We want the civilians out there doing those \nthings. We don't want to compete as the Federal Government.\n  But in this case, the Department of the Interior is competing \ndirectly, and will continue to do if allowed to do so, unless \nprohibited. They can write contracts, and they can have somebody on \ncall. If there is an emergency situation, they can have a contractor on \ncall to do that, and they should.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I thank the gentleman.\n  I think that this is a great discussion we are having, but I don't \nthink the discussion necessarily belongs on the appropriations bill. It \nbelongs in the policy committee so that all the questions that I have \nand the concerns that you have can be addressed and thoughtfully \nwritten into a piece of legislation.\n  There are just some places in rural parts of the United States--and I \ncome from a State that is both urban, suburban, and very rural, up on \nthe north shore--where private contractors just don't go or the ability \nof getting a hold of one isn't there, and sometimes you have to have \nsome Federal redundancy in the system to get out there and do that.\n  You also have used a couple of terms and descriptions that I don't \nhave any statutory language in front of me. So where I think the \ngentleman might have a very good idea, bills that we are working on in \nthe appropriations process, when we start getting into writing \ntechnical policy or trying to figure out the new wave of what new \nlegislation should look like--and you have a great proponent; I hear \nhim all the time in the Defense subcommittee--the chairman of the \nsubcommittee says the Federal Government shouldn't be doing what the \nprivate sector can do. We should not be doing this legislation for the \nreasons I mentioned, that we just don't have all the facts in front of \nit, and it is not the role of the Interior Appropriations bill to do \npolicy.\n  So I am going to continue to object to the amendment at this time, \nbut I look forward to, in a policy situation, working with the \ngentleman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Again, I appreciate the gentlewoman's reservations and \nopposition for the reasons so stated. I respect them, but I feel this \nis the correct place to limit in the appropriations, to make sure that \nthe private sector can compete effectively and is allowed to do so and \ndoesn't have to compete against the Federal Government with all the \nprovisions it has at its hand to undermine their ability to be \neffective and competitive.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  0100\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nPerry) having assumed the chair, Mr. Loudermilk, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2822) \nmaking appropriations for the Department of the Interior, environment, \nand related agencies for the fiscal year ending September 30, 2016, and \nfor other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "07"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/28/house-section/article/H4856-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4856-H4857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HOUSE BILLS APPROVED BY THE PRESIDENT\n\n  The President notified the Clerk of the House that on the following \ndates he had approved and signed bills of the following titles:\n\n\n[[Page H4857]]\n\n\n           May 19, 2015:\n       H.R. 2252.
