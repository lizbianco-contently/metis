The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the courage, \nsacrifice, and service of members of the Greatest Generation from my \ndistrict: Navy veteran Art Albert from Hattiesburg and Mr. John \nRounsaville of Jones County, Mississippi.\n\n\n                               Art Albert\n\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Albert truly exemplifies dedicated, selfless service \nin having fought in World War II, the Korean war, and the Vietnam war.\n  I first met Mr. Albert during the Mississippi Gulf Coast Honor \nFlight, which brings World War II veterans to Washington to see their \nmemorial.\n  Last month I had the opportunity to speak with Mr. Albert at the \nVictory over Japan Day anniversary ceremony in Hawaii. Here I learned \nthat Art was serving as a machinist mate aboard the USS Missouri on \nSeptember 2, 1945, where he witnessed the Japanese formally surrender \nto the United States, ending World War II.\n  Although he would disagree, like so many of his contemporaries who \nfocus not on their service, but on the greatness of our Nation as a \nwhole, Art is a true American hero. Through his service and his quiet \nwork of building our great Nation at home, he has brought honor to \nhimself, the State of Mississippi, and the United States of America.\n  I am honored to have him as a constituent and to have the opportunity \nto know him both as a person and as an enduring example of the values \nthat have made America great.\n\n\n                            John Rounsaville\n\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Last month another of my constituents, John Rounsaville, \ncelebrated his 90th birthday.\n  Beginning in October of 1943, Mr. Rounsaville served for 28 months in \nthe Pacific Theater of operations. He served aboard an LCI Gunboat that \nwas assigned to the Pacific Theater and participated in numerous \ncampaigns, earning his unit an impressive six battle stars for World \nWar II service, including the Navy Unit Commendation Award. Although it \nhas been over 70 years since his time in the Pacific, Mr. Rounsaville \nremembers his entire tour and speaks of it often.\n  Like the American flag that has been proudly planted in his front \nyard for decades, I take great pride in representing World War II \nveterans like Mr. Rounsaville, who belong to a generation whose \nsacrifices preserved our freedom and liberated the world from tyranny \nand oppression.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking John Rounsaville and Art \nAlbert for their courage and bravery and their service to this great \nNation; and I wish to extend my heartfelt gratitude to both of these \ngreat Americans, their families, and to congratulate them on their \ndedicated service to the United States of America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7177-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7177]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act, NDAA, is bipartisan legislation that our Nation has \ndepended upon for decades to support our servicemembers and military \nfamilies. In its entire history, the NDAA has been vetoed only four \ntimes. By vetoing it last week, the President has made history and, as \nThe Washington Post has identified, ``not in a good way.''\n  I am grateful for the leadership of the House Armed Services \nCommittee Chairman Mac Thornberry and Senate Armed Services Committee \nChairman John McCain as Congress works to fulfill its highest \nconstitutional duty to provide for our common defense to protect \nAmerican families from attacks with worldwide conflicts at record \nlevels.\n  As a grateful father of four sons currently serving in the military \nand as a 31-year Army veteran myself, I know firsthand the importance \nof the NDAA to promote peace through strength.\n  The NDAA is and always has been bipartisan legislation because the \nsafety of American families is more important than partisan politics. I \nencourage all Members of Congress to unite on voting to override the \nPresident's veto.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and the President by his actions \nmust never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7178-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7178]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               COMMUNICATION FROM THE CLERK OF THE HOUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Clerk of the House of Representatives:\n\n                                              Office of the Clerk,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2 of rule XV, I call up \nmotion No. 2, to discharge the Committee on Rules from the further \nconsideration of House Resolution 450, providing for the consideration \nof the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank of the \nUnited States, and for other purposes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Did the gentleman sign the petition?\n  Mr. FINCHER. Yes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee calls up a \nmotion to discharge the Committee on Rules from further consideration \nof House Resolution 450, which the Clerk will report by title.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to rule XV, section 2(d)(1), I \nmake a point of order that this motion is not timely brought.\n  The rule specifically says that, ``On the second and fourth Mondays \nof a month,'' which is what we are today, ``immediately after the \nPledge of Allegiance to the Flag, a motion to discharge that has been \nbrought on the calendar for at least seven legislative days shall be \nprivileged if called up by a Member whose signature appears thereon.''\n  We had the pledge and the prayer earlier today. We also then had \nintervening activity in the House, and this motion is no longer timely.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on \nthe point of order?\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I would point out, Mr. Speaker, that we took up 1-\nminute speeches; we received a message from the Senate; and you, \nyourself, approved the Journal.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on \nthe point of order?\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I think my friend from South Carolina, the \ngentleman, is out of order. This is regular order. We are moving on as \nprocedure.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, while you are continuing, I would like you \nto consider one thing.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman may proceed.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. The rule is very explicit. The rule does not say that \nwe may not take--the rule says that we must proceed immediately. I \nrecognize the fact that on occasion 1-minute speeches are not \nconsidered business of the House, that receiving messages from the \nSenate are not considered business of the House, and, on occasion, a \nJournal is not considered business of the House even though, from time \nto time, we do vote on it.\n  The rule does not say that we cannot do other business. The rule says \nwe can't do anything, that we must proceed immediately after the Pledge \nof Allegiance, and that if the motion is brought at any other time it \nis untimely.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does any other Member wish to be heard on \nthis point of order? If not, the Chair will rule.\n  The rule does not say that the motion to discharge must be--it just \nsays that it can be--brought up immediately.\n  Today's proceedings are consistent with previous occasions where the \nChair has entertained 1-minute speeches on discharge days, and those \nspeeches proceeded by unanimous consent.\n  On those grounds, the point of order is overruled.\n\n\n                        Parliamentary Inquiries\n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Does the language of section 2(d)(1) not specifically \nsay ``shall be privileged if called up''? It is not ``may.'' It is \n``shall . . . if. . . . ''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The rule is not so limited. The motion would \nbe in order if it were to be brought up then, and it is also in order \nto be brought up now.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n\n[[Page H7179]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. MULVANEY. If 2(d)(1) says that it shall be in order if brought up \nat this particular time but the Chair is ruling that it may be in order \nat other times, what rule is the Chair relying on for that \ndetermination?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. There is nothing in the rule that requires \nthe motion to discharge to be brought up immediately following the \nPledge of Allegiance.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Further point, Mr. Speaker. The only way that it is \nprivileged is that if it was brought up immediately after the pledge.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is also following prior practice \nof the House in entertaining the motion.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I'm sorry, and Mr. Speaker, when you were giving your \ndecision before, I was reading the rule.\n  Would you please restate the basis for your decision.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained 1-minute speeches \non previous discharge days. Those speeches proceeded by unanimous \nconsent. On those grounds, the point of order was overruled.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, you did not address, then, my issue on \nreceiving a message from the Senate or approving the Journal.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has entertained numerous \nparliamentary inquiries on a matter on which the Chair has already \nruled.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Would the decision have been different if we had not \nmade 1-minute speeches?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to a hypothetical \nquestion.\n  The Clerk will report the title of the resolution.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the gentleman from Tennessee \n(Mr. Fincher) will be recognized for 10 minutes and the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hensarling) will be recognized for 10 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Even though discharge petitions have rarely been invoked in modern \nhistory, they nevertheless embody democracy and its fundamental \nprinciple of majority rules, a principle that the gentleman has already \ntalked about earlier. This discharge process offers the only means by \nwhich a majority of House Members can secure a vote on a measure that \nis opposed by the chairman of the committee of jurisdiction and House \nleadership.\n  What makes the gentleman's remarks a few minutes ago particularly \nironic is the fact that the discharge rule evolved from a precursor \nrule adopted in 1910 as part of the Cannon revolt. The Cannon revolt \nwas a revolt against Speaker Joseph Cannon. It was a remarkable event \nin the history of this House and is relevant today in more ways than \none.\n  Speaker Cannon was, at the time, the longest-serving Republican \nSpeaker in the history of the House, serving as Speaker from 1903 to \n1911. Referred to as ``Uncle Joe,'' Speaker Cannon ruled with an iron \nfist. Historians have not painted him as a great legislator. No.\n  Historians have painted him as a great obstructionist. He blocked \nlegislation, including child labor laws and the right for women to \nvote. What was his reasoning for blocking this progressive legislation? \n``I am tired of listening to all this babble for reform,'' he said.\n  Several times, Republicans tried unsuccessfully to curb Speaker \nCannon's broad powers, which included his chairmanship of the Rules \nCommittee and his power to dole out committee assignments, among other \npowers. But that changed in March of 1910 when 42 Republicans joined \nwith the Democrats introducing a resolution containing a rules package \nthat would strip Speaker Cannon of his many powers.\n  Speaker Cannon tried to filibuster this revolt, speaking from the \nchair for 26 straight hours while allies tried to round up additional \nallies who were out celebrating St. Patrick's Day, but it didn't work. \nSpeaker Cannon finally ruled the resolution out of order, but the House \noverruled the Chair, thereby adopting far-reaching reforms, including \nthe precursor of today's discharge rule.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in returning power to rank-and-file \nMembers by voting on the motion to discharge and supporting American \njobs.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  First, Mr. Speaker, I want to recognize the gentleman from Tennessee \nand the passion that he brings to this debate. He has long been a \nchampion of the Export-Import Bank. We have had a respectful \ndisagreement over the substance of the issue, but at this moment I \ndon't care to spend much time on the substance of the issue because we \nare debating a discharge petition.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was an interesting history lesson that my colleague \nand friend introduced the House to, and I have no reason to doubt that \nit is an accurate history lesson. I will note for the Record that \napparently somehow Mr. Cannon managed to get a building named after \nhim.\n  But the point I would make is this: whether the gentleman from \nTennessee and others have disagreed with process at the Financial \nServices Committee--I know that they do--but the question before us, \nMr. Speaker, is why punish the entirety of the House?\n\n  Those who are bringing forth this discharge petition had the \nopportunity to allow Members on both sides of the aisle to offer \namendments. People who were not on the Financial Services Committee \ncould have had the opportunity to offer amendments, but not under this \nparticular discharge petition.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the real complaint I have here is, regardless of \nwhat complaints or beefs they may have against me personally or against \nthe process of the Financial Services Committee, why punish the \nentirety of the House?\n  We hear so much about regular order and about empowering rank-and-\nfile Members. Well, then, why aren't rank-and-file Members, then, \nempowered to offer amendments? We were told that it was simply to \ndischarge a single piece of legislation. Then why not, at this point, \nlet the House work its will?\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, that doesn't appear to happen. I \nperfectly understand that one man's economic development is another \nman's corporate welfare, and I think that debate will happen tomorrow. \nBut here, right now, simply because there is a rule to have a discharge \npetition that would disqualify any Member from offering an amendment \ndoesn't mean we should necessarily avail ourselves of it.\n  The Constitution allows us to create debt. It doesn't mean it is a \ngood thing for us to do that as we face yet another debt ceiling vote \nin front of us.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would simply hope that Members would vote down \nthis discharge petition, and if they believe strongly in it, then bring \nback another one, but at least allow Members on the floor to offer \namendments. Republicans, Democrats, and people from all committees \nshould be able to offer the amendments if that was the purpose of the \ndischarge petition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will say to my friend from Texas, there were 3 years \nto do exactly that. It wasn't done.\n  I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for yielding, and I thank him \nfor his courage and Mr. Lucas' courage for working within the rules to \nbring this matter to the floor. It is an important matter.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  Since July, businesses and workers across the country have been \nasking Congress to reopen the Export-Import Bank so that they could \ncompete on a level playing field in overseas markets. This is about \njobs and a competitive America. Opening the Export-Import Bank, Mr. \nSpeaker, is about creating and keeping jobs here in America.\n  A motion on the floor tonight will demonstrate that a majority of \nthis House supports taking action to pass a multiyear extension of the \nBank's charter authority. We will have a\n\n[[Page H7180]]\n\nchance to show the American people that Congress can work together, \nDemocrats and Republicans, to get something done that helps businesses \nand workers compete and create jobs.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HOYER. I yield to the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I rise to ask my friends and \ncolleagues to support Mr. Fincher of Tennessee on his motion in his \neffort to subject this issue to regular order. This is regular order. \nThis is the only regular order that we are going to be given to have a \nchance to take up this job-creating legislation. I know this for a \nfact. It is not speculation.\n  On February 12, they offered an amendment to the views and estimates \non the budget that said, in part, the committee will work to consider \nreauthorization of the Bank through regular order that lets all sides \nbe heard, and the leadership of the committee said, ``Vote `no.' '' \nThere was never an intention to subject this issue to regular order. \nNow is our chance to do that.\n  Support the gentlemen from Tennessee and Oklahoma and vote ``yes'' on \nthis.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, reclaiming my time, I thank Mr. Fincher, I \nthank Mr. Lucas, I thank Ms. Waters, I thank Ms. Moore, and I thank \nDenny Heck.\n  Vote for this motion to put a bill on the floor that the majority \nsupports. That is democracy.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga), chairman of the Monetary Policy and Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate that, and I \nappreciate the leadership of my chair on this issue.\n  It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, we have two issues that we are dealing \nwith today:\n  First is the issue, itself, of the Export-Import Bank and the \nentitlement mentality that has grown up here in the United States. It \nis sad to me that some believe that this is the only, or the best, way \nfor the U.S. to compete on the world stage when, in fact, we know it is \nnot.\n  We are at a competitive disadvantage, not because we may or may not \nhave an Export-Import Bank, but because of our regulatory environment, \nbecause of our tax environment, and because of all of the other \nbarriers that have been thrown up by this Congress, including health \ncare and a number of other things that have made our companies less \ncompetitive.\n  The other issue is the way that we are dealing with this issue as it \nis coming to the floor and how it has reached the House floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to know which committee chair of another \ncommittee would approve of having the process be short-circuited out of \ntheir committee. Would it be the Energy and Commerce Committee? the \nWays and Means Committee? Because I can tell you I have not been real \nhappy, as a small business owner on some of the lack of progress that \nwe have made on that. Maybe it would be the Ag Committee. Why did it \ntake so long for things to reach the floor? How about any other \ncommittee that we are all dealing with?\n  The simple fact is that my subcommittee, Monetary Policy and Trade, \nwhere this jurisdiction lies, had three joint hearings with the \nOversight Committee on this particular issue. There was a sunset that \nwas put in. It was intentionally put in so that there would be a \nreview. The review happened, and the determination of my subcommittee \nand this committee was that it did not warrant further action.\n  So, again, as we are looking at this tool that has been infrequently \nused, it doesn't restore regular order, as has been claimed. No. In \nfact, it upends the balance of power in the House. It skirts the \ncommittee process and gives the minority the control over the House \nfloor.\n  A discharge petition was brought to the House floor under the guise \nof job creation. In reality, it serves to revive and retrench a \ndependency mentality.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger), who has done great work on this supportive \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nTennessee for his hard work.\n  I would remind the previous speaker that this is actually a \nRepublican-led discharge petition for Ex-Im Bank.\n  We could have avoided this. None of us celebrate being here right now \nas Republicans. But the time to deal with the issue of Ex-Im Bank was \non the committee. Unfortunately, this could have gone through the \ncommittee, this could have been voted on in committee, and it could \nhave come to the floor in what people would consider a more regular \norder way than this. However, that didn't have the opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, my district is the 16th District of Illinois, and I will \ntell you what, they are not worried about discharge petitions and \nthings when people talk about regular order and internal politics and \nwhat is going on here. What they care about is the fact that it is a \nheavy manufacturing district, and they want to be able to go to work \ntomorrow. They are worried because people live with the threat of pink \nslips, and many people actually get pink slips.\n  Unfortunately, in July, the charter for Ex-Im Bank expired, which put \na lot of the manufacturing suppliers of the aerospace industry at a \ndisadvantage in my district compared with those that supply to Airbus \nand other companies around the world. Pride in our exports and pride in \nour manufacturing is something that we should have pride in, and we \nshould fight beyond what it means for a party label or beyond what it \nmeans for floor politics.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the opponents of reauthorization live in a world where \nthe politics of purity trumps the realism of today and of the \neconomics. Here is the reality: in my district, thousands of jobs, \nmillions of dollars of exports, and many, many people rely on this to \nbe reauthorized.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know this is not easy, as Republicans, to do this, but \nit is the right thing to do. So I stand and I ask my colleagues on the \nRepublican and the Democrat side of the aisle to put partisanship \naside, to do the right thing, and to discharge this resolution.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert), a valued member of the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  I hope you are all listening to some of the use of the language. I \nappreciated the history lesson. But has it been lost on you, the irony \npart of this discussion that, hey, we are going to do a discharge \npetition, which is part of the rules, because we don't feel we are \nhaving a voice. Oh, by the way, we are going to draft a rule--draft a \nrule--that you can't offer amendments, that you can't have a \ndiscussion.\n  For those of us who have worked on this issue for years, who have sat \nthrough dozens of hearings in multiple years, who actually have things \nwe believe that make it better, the brilliance here is lock it down. So \nyou are going to complain that you are not being treated fairly, and \nthen the answer to not being treated fairly is, let's write a rule that \nno one gets a voice, that it is purely up or down. Is that lost on \nanyone here?\n  The reality of it is the vast majority of the trade from this country \nhas access to surety bonds and trade credit. It is a fraction of a \nfraction of a fraction that actually asks for a taxpayer subsidy, a \ntaxpayer guarantee. If you wanted to solve this problem tomorrow, you \ncould recharter the Ex-Im Bank so that it continues to exist but get \nthe taxpayers off the hook and let them do just as now Fannie and \nFreddie are trying to do where they buy their reinsurance in the \nmarket.\n  There are solutions here, if I was allowed to offer an amendment. But \nyou have all chosen to write a rule that keeps those of us who have \nworked on this issue for years from being able to have that discussion. \nIs that irony lost on anyone here?\n  You know there is a better way to do this than extending this type of \ncrony capitalism and leaving our taxpayers on the hook for hours and \nhours of hearings we have had where you have heard the bad acts that \nare going on in this agency--the fraud, the mis-accounting.\n  Why are we going to let that move forward? Because if you have read \nthe\n\n[[Page H7181]]\n\nreforms that are in here, you would understand they already should be \ndoing these. It is an outrage they are not.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, Members, I would like \nto thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher) for yielding and \nfor his leadership in initiating this very successful discharge \npetition in order to finally make possible the opportunity to vote to \nrenew the charter of the Export-Import Bank.\n  For almost 2 years now, as ranking member of the Financial Services \nCommittee, I have been working very hard with Leader Pelosi, Whip \nHoyer, and my colleagues Gwen Moore and Denny Heck. We have all been \nworking hard to secure long-term reauthorization of the Bank. And \ntoday, after many months of obstruction by a vocal minority of this \nbody, which led to a shutdown of the Ex-Im Bank, this House will \nfinally get the opportunity to vote to do just that.\n  Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, this discharge petition is not a \nrejection of regular order. Although rarely used, the discharge \npetition exists under House rules for the very purpose of ensuring that \nthe will of a determined majority may ultimately prevail over an \nobstructionist minority, and that is exactly what is happening today.\n  Republicans and Democrats have come together to support the \nreauthorization of a proven job creator. We have come together to end \nthe unilateral disarmament that has harmed our exporters, their \ndomestic suppliers, and the many American workers across this country \nwhose jobs are supported by the Bank. We have come together to show \nthat compromise is possible if you are willing to work it.\n  So, again, I thank the gentleman from Tennessee for his work. I urge \nthe Members to vote in favor of the motion. We have come together as \nMembers of Congress to do the work of the people. Let's get on with the \nbusiness of doing it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Mulvaney), another valuable member of the House \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  I want to pick up on where my friend from Arizona left off regarding \nthe comments about my good friend and colleague from Washington \nregarding regular order. It is not regular order. If we have regular \norder, we have amendments. I have an amendment that would protect small \nbusiness. I don't get a chance to do that. We would under regular \norder.\n  But let's not forget, there is not just one committee that is getting \nrolled here. Rules Committee is getting rolled. And if this was to \nfollow regular order and go to rules, every single one of you would be \nable to offer amendments in that committee. They would probably get \nshot down, as mine have since I have been here, but at least you could \noffer them.\n  Furthermore, if it went to Rules Committee, you could have debate; \nyou could participate and debate on the issues.\n  What is getting ready to happen here in a few minutes is Mr. Fincher \nwill control 1 hour of debate, he will speak for 5, and then yield \nback, denying every single one of you in this Chamber the opportunity \nto speak for at least half an hour each side on this particular issue.\n\n  This is not regular order, Mr. Speaker. This is shoving something \ndown the American people's throats.\n  Let's have regular order. Let's have the amendments. I have got some \nones you might actually enjoy. Let's have the debate. But let's not kid \nourselves into thinking this is regular order because it is not.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I have one remaining speaker. How much time \ndo I have remaining? I want to reserve the right to close.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 2 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  A lot of discussion, passionate discussion about jobs tonight.\n  But I would point out to my Democratic colleagues on the other side \nof the aisle, where was this passion when ObamaCare was passed? The \nCongressional Budget Office says that it is going to cost this economy \n2.5 million fewer jobs.\n  Where was this passion when H.R. 30 came to the floor that would \nrepeal this 30-hour definition of full-time employee? According to one \nstudy, 2.6 million Americans making under $30,000 are at risk of having \ntheir hours cut due to the ObamaCare 30-hour rule.\n  Where was the passion on the other side of the aisle when H.R. 351, \nthe LNG Permitting Certainty and Transparency Act, came? That is \nestimated to put up to 45,000 unemployed Americans back to work on \nliquid natural gas export projects.\n  Where was the passion when S. 1 came, the Keystone XL pipeline? The \nState Department's environmental impact statement said: ``During \nconstruction, proposed project spending would support approximately \n42,100 jobs.''\n  But we didn't hear much from our friends on the other side of the \naisle when this was going on.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  But, again, I think, too often, my friends on the other side of the \naisle are always happy to subsidize what they can regulate and control.\n  I would say to my friends on my side of the aisle that I respect your \nopinion, and I hope you respect mine; but I think there is a better way \nto promote exports. I think there is a better way to promote jobs. It \nhas everything to do with regulatory reform. It has to do with the \nREINS Act. It has everything to do with fundamental tax reform, which, \naccording to the National Association of Manufacturers, is half of our \ncompetitive disadvantage. It has everything to do with litigation \nreform. We have greater remedial costs than do our green energy \nEuropean competitors.\n  There is a better way, and there is a more fair way to come to this \nfloor. As for whatever you think of the process of the Financial \nServices Committee, if this is going to come to the floor, every Member \nought to be allowed to have an amendment, and we should reject this \ndischarge petition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield my remaining 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Speaker and colleagues, why are we here tonight? Why \nare we compelled to engage in this process?\n  The circumstances, perhaps, might be a little bit like 1910. Do you \nremember 1910? A dictatorial Speaker who was so totally in control and \nwho so totally refused to accept input from the membership made himself \nchairman of the Rules Committee, too. He stymied the legislative \nprocess. He brought it to a stop.\n  What did our predecessors do 100-plus years ago?\n  They finally rose up together and threw him out, and they created a \nprocess by which no dictatorial chairman, no dictatorial Speaker would \never be able to fully thwart the will of this body.\n  It is amazing. That is what we are here for. It is to continue one \ncentury later the responsible actions that they put into place.\n  Now, some of my friends have asked, ``Why don't we have thousands of \namendments?'' Think about 1910--a dictatorial Speaker, a dictatorial \ncommittee chairman. Under no circumstances was Uncle Joe going to allow \nany input. So, when they created this process, they had to make sure \nthat the bill could come to the floor for consideration in a way that \nwould not allow it to be manipulated by that same dictatorial attitude. \nWe are operating under the present version of that rule.\n  If we had wanted unlimited amendments, we should have spent an \nunlimited amount of time in the committee of jurisdiction, working on \nthose amendments, but that opportunity never availed itself. Had that \nopportunity availed itself, we wouldn't be here; but we are here. We \nhave a bill that reflects, I believe--and that a majority of us in this \nHouse believes--what is in the best interest of America's workers and \nAmerica's\n\n[[Page H7182]]\n\nbusinesspeople in our competitive spirit.\n  I simply say to you that to talk about the things we should be doing \ntonight that should have been done a month ago or a year ago seems most \ninappropriate. So, my friends, in a moment, let's honor the people who \nwere on this floor in 1910. Let's say, ``Joe, you can't have your way \nthen or now.'' Let's pass the discharge; let's pass the rule; and let's \nget on with the bill debate.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Clerk will report the resolution.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 450\n\n       Resolved, That immediately upon adoption of this \n     resolution, the House shall proceed to the consideration in \n     the House of the bill (H.R. 597) to reauthorize the Export-\n     Import Bank of the United States, and for other purposes. All \n     points of order against consideration of the bill are waived. \n     An amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of the \n     text of H.R. 3611, as introduced, shall be considered as \n     adopted. The bill, as amended, shall be considered as read. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill, as \n     amended, are waived. The previous question shall be \n     considered as ordered on the bill, as amended, and on any \n     further amendment thereto, to final passage without \n     intervening motion except: (1) one hour of debate equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services or their \n     respective designees; and (2) one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions.\n       Sec. 2.  Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 597.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized \nfor 1 hour.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there has been a lot of conversation here tonight about \nwhat we are doing and how this happened and what we are going to do \nnext.\n  Mr. Speaker, the reason why we are here tonight, I didn't sign up to \ncome to Washington from Frog Jump, the place I live, to do discharge \npetitions. The reason I did come to Washington was to work for my \ndistrict and try to make sure that hardworking men and women all over \nthis country and my district have jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is what the Export-Import Bank does. It helps \ncreate thousands of jobs, specifically, 200,000 jobs each year.\n  Now, let me be clear because there has been a lot of misconception or \nmisperception, whatever you want to say, about what this costs the \ntaxpayer. Mr. Speaker, this is at no cost to the U.S. taxpayer. In \nfact, the Export-Import Bank returned $675 million to the U.S. Treasury \nin fiscal year 2014. In 2013, it returned more than $1 billion, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  This is not a minority procedure, this is not a Democrat procedure \nthat is happening tonight. This is a Republican-led position. This is a \nRepublican reform bill that we are doing.\n\n[[Page H7183]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  More reforms than have been done in probably 50 years. I haven't \nlooked specifically, but I think President Reagan did a lot, and other \nPresidents have done them.\n  But this is about jobs, Mr. Speaker. Think about this. We go home to \nour districts every weekend, and we talk to constituents every weekend. \nThink about constituents that come up to us and say: Congressman, have \nyou balanced the budget? We say: No, we are working on it, but we \nhaven't done it yet.\n  I don't want to offend any of my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle. I am probably going to, but I don't mean it. Our constituents \nsay: Well, Congressman, have you repealed ObamaCare? I say: Well, no, \nnot yet, but we are working on it.\n  Then they look at us and they say: Tell me, Congressman, you have \ndone away with the only thing that we know of that helps create \nthousands of jobs all over this country and possibly would help create \nthe job that they had because of some ideology or some conservative \ngroup that is scoring a Member of Congress, and now I don't have a job, \nand I am on unemployment.\n  Mr. Speaker, our constituents and hardworking Americans deserve \nbetter. They deserve better than Members of Congress playing political \ngames because of scorecards.\n  I serve under one of the most principled chairmen, probably the most \nprincipled chairman in Congress, and I agree with him on 99.9 percent \nof everything that we do in our committee. We just happen to disagree \non this one issue. My chairman is passionate and principled, and I \nnever would doubt that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I won't take much more time. If America is going to get \nout of the hole we are in as a country, then Congress must start \nworking together. Mr. Speaker, we should applaud. We should be happy on \nthe day--and I don't want to offend the gentlewoman from California who \nspoke earlier, but we should be happy on the day when Democrats want to \njoin Republicans on legislation that helps move the country forward. \nThey are clapping, that is awesome.\n  We are trying to do what we think is best, and the Export-Import Bank \ndoesn't cost the taxpayers a dime. It helps create thousands of jobs \nall over this country and makes sure we don't lose thousands of jobs to \n60 other countries that have these credit agencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know what else to say. This is regular order, \nthis closed rule. I am going to close in 10 seconds, but this is all \nabout regular order. We could have had amendments. We could have had a \nthousand amendments in our committee, but we chose to go this route. We \ndidn't choose it. Some of us chose to go this route. We are dealing \nwith this today. Our constituents deserve better, and we have to do \nbetter.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the rule and \nthe underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the previous question \non the resolution.\n\n\n                        parliamentary inquiries\n\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Parliamentary inquiry, Mr. Speaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas will state his \nparliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, the resolution before the House is H. \nRes. 450 which, as I understand it, would establish the rule for debate \non this Ex-Im reauthorization bill, that it does not make in order any \namendments.\n  The closed rule means that in addition to not having any debate on \nthe rule--since all time has now been yielded back, with no other \nMember having a chance to speak--Members have been denied their chance \nto participate in that part of the process.\n  My parliamentary inquiry is whether there is any way, at this \njuncture, for Members to amend the resolution, H. Res. 450, to give \nMembers an opportunity to offer amendments to the underlying Ex-Im \nreauthorization bill?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair was about to put the question on \nordering the previous question.\n  If the motion for the previous question was rejected, there would be \na potential for further debate on, or amendment to, House Resolution \n450.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. So, if the previous question is defeated, then a \nMember who is opposed to the previous question would be afforded the \nopportunity to offer an amendment to H. Res. 450 that would strike the \ntext of the closed, no amendments rule and replace it with the text of \na rule that provided for consideration of the underlying Ex-Im \nreauthorization bill through an open process, with time for debate, \nwhere any Member--either Republican or Democrat--could offer germane \namendments to the bill. Is that correct, Mr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot respond to specific \nhypotheticals, but if the motion for the previous question were \nrejected, there would be potential for further debate on, or amendment \nto, House Resolution 450.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, further parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. If the previous question is defeated, may I or any \nMember who votes against the previous question claim time to offer such \nan amendment to create an open rules process for consideration of the \nunderlying Ex-Im reauthorization bill where Members on both sides of \nthe aisle can offer amendments to the bill?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair cannot judge that at this time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the Speaker.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. A few minutes ago, in reference to a question raised by \nthe gentleman from Texas, you indicated that the amendments would be in \norder if the motion for the previous question failed.\n\n  My question is: Are motions to amend in order before the motion for \nthe previous question comes to the floor?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has preferential \nstanding.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would \nlike to have it heard now.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question has already been \nmoved.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. No, it hasn't.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair is about to put the question on \nordering the previous question on the resolution.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, parliamentary inquiry. Who moved the \nprevious question?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Was that seconded?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The previous question does not require a \nsecond.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk. I would \nsimply like to ask what rule the Chair is relying on in denying me the \nability to bring that amendment now.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Clause 4 of rule XVI.\n  The question is on ordering the previous question on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7183-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7183-H7184]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 1090, RETAIL \n                        INVESTOR PROTECTION ACT\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a \nprivileged report (Rept.

Research supported under this subsection shall \n     be conducted with the goal of practical application.\n       (b) Funding.--The National Science Foundation shall devote \n     at least $5,000,000 annually to research described in \n     subsection (a), subject to the availability of \n     appropriations, to come from amounts made available for the \n     Research and Related Activities account or the Education and \n     Human Resources Directorate. No additional funds are \n     authorized to be appropriated under this section. This Act \n     shall be carried out using funds otherwise appropriated by \n     law after the date of enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for \nDyslexia Act, or READ Act, will help millions of Americans who struggle \nwith dyslexia. It is fitting that the House considers this bill today, \nas October is Dyslexia Awareness Month.\n  Dyslexia affects an estimated 8.5 million school children and 1 in 6 \nAmericans in some form. It causes these individuals to have \ndifficulties with reading, though they often have normal or above-\naverage intelligence.\n  Despite the prevalence of dyslexia, many Americans remain \nundiagnosed, untreated, and silently struggle at school or work. Too \nmany children undiagnosed with dyslexia have difficulties in the \nclassroom and sometimes drop out of school and face uncertain futures.\n  The READ Act requires the National Science Foundation's budget to \ninclude a specific line item for the Research in Disabilities Education \nprogram. The bill requires the NSF to invest at least $5 million \nannually for merit-reviewed, competitively-awarded dyslexia research \nprojects.\n  The bill uses funds already appropriated for the NSF and does not \nauthorize any additional spending for these priority projects.\n  NSF research supported by the READ Act is focused on practical \napplications, which include the following: Early identification of \nchildren and students with dyslexia, professional development for \nteachers and administrators of students with dyslexia, curricula and \neducational tools needed for children with dyslexia, and implementation \nand scaling of successful models of dyslexia intervention.\n  The House Science, Space and Technology Committee held a hearing last \nyear on the science of dyslexia. Experts testified how research in the \narea of neuroscience has led to practical ways to better diagnose and \ndeal with dyslexia but that more research is necessary.\n  At a second committee hearing held just a few weeks ago, we heard \nfrom experts who work directly with dyslexic students and their \nteachers. They know firsthand about the obstacles these children, \nparents, and educators face, and they stress the importance of research \nin developing practical tools.\n  If you can't read, it is hard to achieve. If we change the way we \napproach dyslexia, we can turn this disability into an opportunity for \na brighter and more productive future for millions of Americans.\n  I am a co-chair of the bipartisan Dyslexia Caucus, along with \nCongresswoman Julia Brownley, which is comprised of more than 100 \nMembers of Congress.\n  I have met hundreds of children and their parents in my congressional \ndistrict in Texas and others across the U.S. who are affected by \ndyslexia, and they have shared their personal stories with me.\n  One child I met recently was Eddie, a middle school student from \nBaltimore. He, along with his family, has been on a long journey to \nreceive a proper diagnosis and find a supportive learning environment.\n  After our meeting, his mother wrote me a letter explaining: ``In only \n1 year, Eddie has gone from repeatedly missing recess because he would \nnot `try harder,' a boy who would stare at his homework in defeat \nbefore he has even tried an assignment, to a boy now daring to dream of \na career in the sciences.''\n  Eddie is very fortunate to have a mother who advocated for his proper \neducation. He is now not only able to learn, but also to excel. His \nmother comments: ``He is a voracious reader and wants to join the Jet \nPropulsion Lab or work with NASA.''\n  I also have had the pleasure of meeting an Austin, Texas, resident \nRobbi Cooper and her son, Ben. They shared many stories with me about \nthe hardships they have faced in their attempts to ensure Ben receives \nthe best education possible.\n  Ben has even taken his abilities one step further by becoming an \nadvocate and has traveled to D.C. numerous times to lobby Congress so \nothers can learn from his experiences.\n  The bipartisan READ Act, which unanimously passed the Science \nCommittee 2 weeks ago, will help ensure that all children like Eddie \nand Ben have the means to succeed. Nothing could be more important to \nthem.\n  I also want to acknowledge two young friends who are on the floor \nwith me today, Leighton and Gipson, who have an interest in this bill \ntoo.\n  The READ Act is a significant step in the right direction to help \nthose with dyslexia.\n\n[[Page H7185]]\n\n  Thanks go to my Dyslexia Caucus co-chair, Representative Julia \nBrownley, and the other cosponsors of the READ Act, such as Congressman \nDon Beyer, who is handling the other side of this debate tonight, for \ntheir interest and support. And I urge my other colleagues to better \nthe lives of millions of children and adults with dyslexia.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence \nand Advancements for Dyslexia Act, or the READ Act. Passing this bill \nis the perfect way to honor October, National Dyslexia Awareness Month.\n  As my friend, the chairman, has said, dyslexia is a learning disorder \ncharacterized by difficulty reading due to problems identifying speech \nsounds and learning how they relate to letters and words.\n  Unfortunately, many children are not diagnosed or are diagnosed later \nin life, leaving them with little access to helpful interventions and \ntechnologies. Too often our educators do not have the proper training \nto identify students with learning disabilities, including dyslexia.\n  This bill would fund research on the early identification of \nindividuals with dyslexia and professional development for teachers and \nschool administrators.\n  There is a lack of research on curricula development and educational \ntools for students with dyslexia, and I am happy to report that this \nbill would fund that research into that as well.\n  Finally, as we heard from our expert witnesses during the committee \nhearings on this topic, there is a significant gap in getting the \nresearch from the laboratories into the hands of teachers and \nadministrators. To address this gap, we need more research on \nunderstanding which experimental innovations will be successful in the \nclassrooms and research on how best to scale those successful \ninterventions.\n  Having an intervention work in the laboratory is not enough. The \nintervention needs to work in classroom settings, which are very \nheterogeneous environments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a first cousin who was raised just across the \nriver in Fairfax County. He was a most clever child because he managed \nto make it all the way to eighth grade before they realized that he \ndidn't know how to read. He has had a good career, but I wonder what \nkind of professor or Supreme Court Justice or even rocket scientist he \nwould have made with early intervention.\n  Mr. Speaker, my oldest child had a passel of learning disabilities \nbut also had and has a very high IQ. At the school he attended to \naddress these disabilities, the walls were adorned with photos of \nAlbert Einstein, Winston Churchill, and Thomas Edison.\n  These remarkable men remind us of the promise of every child, that a \nlearning disability like dyslexia need not hold a child back from an \nextraordinary life and an extraordinary education. This is why we need \nthe READ Act: to help realize the promise of every child with dyslexia.\n  On this remarkable bipartisan night, I want to thank my Texas \nfriends, Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson, for working across \nthe aisle together to make improvements to this bill during the \ncommittee process.\n  I am proud to be an original cosponsor of this bill, and I urge my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank \nMr. Beyer for his generous comments. It has been nice working together \nwith him on this particular bill.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Virginia (Mrs. Comstock), \nwho happens to be the chair of the Research and Technology Subcommittee \nof the full Science Committee.\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the Research \nExcellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, also known as the READ \nAct.\n  Coming from a family of educators and as the daughter of a librarian, \nI truly understand the effects a reading disability can have on \nchildren. Reading opens up such a wide world for children and for all \nof us, and no one should be cut off from that beautiful world that \nreading opens up to us.\n  When dyslexia goes undiagnosed, it can result in struggles in the \nclassroom and continue through into their careers as adults.\n  Despite knowledge of the condition since the 19th century, many \nAmericans remain undiagnosed and untreated. Given what we know today \nand we know the advancements we can make with research and technology, \nwe need to make sure we are not letting that stand.\n  In July, I joined a bipartisan group of my colleagues to cosponsor \nthe READ Act. The bill requires the President's annual budget request \nto Congress to include a line item for the Research in Disabilities \nEducation program of the National Science Foundation.\n  It also requires the National Science Foundation to devote at least \n$5 million annually to dyslexia research, which would focus on best \npractices for early identification of children and students with \ndyslexia, professional development about dyslexia for teachers and \nadministrators, and then programs development and evidence-based \neducational tools for children and all of those who are dealing with \nthis.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Smith, the committee staff, the \nranking members, and everyone who supported this important bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Brownley).\n  Ms. BROWNLEY of California. Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the \nCongressional Dyslexia Caucus, I rise in strong support of this \nbipartisan bill, the READ Act, which will ensure, finally, that science \ndrives informed public policy.\n  I want to thank Chairman Smith for his passionate leadership on this \nissue. Today is a day, I think, that we can all celebrate, and I want \nto thank him very, very much for all of his efforts.\n  The READ Act will increase National Science Foundation research on \ndyslexia, including best practices on early identification and \nprofessional development for teachers and school administrators.\n  It will also support research on the most effective teaching \npractices and curriculum models for students with dyslexia.\n  The research this bill supports can make a difference, a big, big \ndifference, in the lives of millions of American children. Learning \ndisabilities like dyslexia and attention-related disorders affect as \nmany as one in five children in our country.\n  It was my daughter Hannah's struggle with dyslexia, that led me, \nquite frankly, to public service. Out of real frustration, I ran for my \nlocal school board because, as a parent, it was clear to me that our \nschools were unprepared to meet my daughter's needs and to meet the \nneeds of students with dyslexia, and teachers had never been properly \ntrained to identify this learning disability.\n\n  After 12 years on the school board, I was elected to my State \nlegislature. And as chair of the California Assembly on Education, I \nalso worked to improve education for students with learning \ndisabilities.\n  Now, as a Member of Congress, I want to do my part at the Federal \nlevel.\n  Across the country, many States are stepping up to this challenge. \nThey have passed new laws to update their education codes, get \nassistive technology into more classrooms, and to boost teacher \ntraining.\n  Advancements in cognitive science can teach us much more about how \nthe brain develops and, therefore, how children learn.\n  In closing, I want to share with everyone that my daughter is now 30 \nyears old. She speaks three languages, and she is saving the world one \nlife at a time in Africa. So she finally got the services she needs and \nis being very successful in life and following her own dreams.\n  I also want to thank, again, the gentleman from Texas, who is my co-\nchair on the Dyslexia Caucus, as well as all the members of the Science \nCommittee for their bipartisan support for the READ Act.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this very important piece of \nlegislation.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom\n\n[[Page H7186]]\n\nOhio (Mr. Johnson), who is a distinguished member of the Science \nCommittee.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. I thank the chairman. I am grateful for all the \nwork that the Dyslexia Caucus has done to advance this very, very \nimportant piece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3033, the Research Excellence \nand Advancements for Dyslexia, or the READ Act. This important \nlegislation would require that the President's annual budget to \nCongress specifically fund the Research in Disabilities Education \nprogram at the National Science Foundation. It would also require NSF \nto devote at least $5 million annually to dyslexia research.\n  You are probably going to hear multiple Members come up tonight and \ntalk about personal stories, about how this hits so very close to home \nfor some of us. I have a 13-year-old granddaughter in Texas, Marin \nMangiaracinia. I have watched over the years as she and her mother and \nher dad have struggled to help try to identify the problems that she \nhas with learning, teachers that were unprepared to diagnose, to \nidentify the symptoms of dyslexia.\n  Even then, once she was diagnosed and identified, having those tools \nand support applied consistently from one school to another or from one \nteacher to another is still problematic.\n  Today Marin is a member of the National Honor Society because of the \nhelp that has been provided to her. But she still struggles. She has \ncreated a Web site on her own to draw attention to this important \nproblem, and she is working hard to improve herself personally.\n  I can't say enough about how proud I am of her and the many others \nthat are afflicted with this condition.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport H.R. 3033.\n  Mr. BEYER. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Westerman), who is a member of the Science \nCommittee.\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight in support of the READ Act. I rise as the \nhusband of a special education teacher and not just any special \neducation teacher, one that has a real passion for helping children \nwith reading disabilities and one that has seen firsthand the successes \nthat happen when research-based interventions are used with children \nwith dyslexia.\n  Dyslexia is the most common learning disability. It affects more than \n90 percent of all individuals identified as learning disabled. It is \nestimated to affect one out of six U.S. schoolchildren.\n  This learning disability causes difficulty with reading \ncomprehension, math, and a variety of other subject areas. Students \nwith dyslexia should receive research-based instruction so they have \nthe best opportunity to learn and succeed in the 21st century. That is \nwhy I cosponsored the READ Act of 2015, a bill that requires the \nNational Science Foundation to fund dyslexia research.\n  NSF-supported research will strengthen practical interventions, \nincluding early identification of dyslexia, development of curricula, \nand other tools to help dyslexics. It will help identify scalable \nmodels for implementing dyslexia programs in schools.\n  The READ Act does not increase Federal spending. It authorizes \nmultidirectorate, merit-reviewed, and competitively awarded dyslexia \nprojects using funds appropriated for the NSF Research and Related \nActivities Account and the education and human resources directorate. \nThis bill is good for students, it is good for educators, and it is \ngood for America.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo), who is a member of the Appropriations \nCommittee but, more importantly, is a former member of the Science \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. I thank the gentleman from Texas, the entire Dyslexia \nCaucus, and also the comments from many of my colleagues tonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the READ Act. Dyslexia is one of \nthe most common learning disabilities in the United States, affecting \nan estimated 8.5 million schoolchildren and one in six Americans in \nsome form. Despite these statistics, millions of children go \nundiagnosed and millions more do not receive proper educational \nassistance.\n  The READ Act addresses this problem by requiring the National Science \nFoundation to fund research that promotes greater awareness of how to \nidentify students with dyslexia and how to tailor a curriculum to \nbetter fit their needs. The READ Act also aims to put more resources in \nthe hands of parents, teachers, and students.\n  As an original cosponsor of this bill, a member of the bipartisan \nCongressional Dyslexia Caucus, and as a parent who has seen firsthand \nthe challenges facing today's dyslexic students, I firmly believe that \nresearch focused on practical applications is needed to not only help \nunderstand dyslexia, but also to afford students an education that \nenables them to succeed in the classroom and reach their full \npotential.\n  The READ Act provides an opportunity for a brighter and more \nproductive future for millions of Americans. For these reasons, I fully \nsupport the READ Act and encourage my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), who is a member of the Energy and Commerce \nCommittee and a former member of the Science Committee.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3033, the \nResearch Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act, the READ Act.\n  Dyslexia is a personal issue for my family. My daughter struggled to \nlearn to read. She dreaded reading aloud in class and worrying about \nwhat her classmates thought affected her self-esteem.\n  My wife and I had her tutored, and we had some testing. With hard \nwork, our daughter was able to catch up and surpass her classmates. But \nit wasn't until high school that she was diagnosed with dyslexia.\n  This is an important piece of legislation that dedicates specific \nfunds to dyslexia research, including early detection. This bill will \nhelp more children get a proper diagnosis.\n  I sometimes wonder, had my wife and I not been engaged in this \nprocess, what might have become of my daughter's academic career and \nwhat about all the other students out there who may be misdiagnosed. So \nI encourage my colleagues to support the READ Act.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close if the \ngentleman from Virginia has no more speakers.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime to close.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the Members on both sides of the aisle who have \ncosponsored the READ Act and spoken in favor of the bill.\n  Today we can shine a light on dyslexia and help millions of Americans \nhave a brighter and more prosperous future.\n  I can think of no better way to honor Dyslexia Awareness Month than \nto pass the READ Act, a bill that will help students and individuals \nwith dyslexia and the parents and teachers who support them in very \npractical ways.\n  Jay Leno, Walt Disney, Steve Jobs, and Carol Greider, the 2009 Nobel \nPrize winner in medicine, among others, are some of the most recognized \nand brilliant creators and innovators who have struggled with dyslexia \nbut have not let it limit them.\n  We need to enable those with dyslexia to achieve their maximum \npotential. The READ Act will help accomplish this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH.R. 3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia Act\n  H.R. 3033 would require the National Science Foundation to have a \nline item for the Research in Disabilities Education program and to \nfund at least $5 million dollars a year on dyslexia research. This \nwould include research on the early identification of individuals with \ndyslexia, professional development for\n\n[[Page H7187]]\n\nteachers and school administrators, curricula development and \neducational tools, and implementation and scaling of successful models \nof dyslexia intervention.\n  I have known several people who have dyslexia. Although dyslexia is a \nlifelong condition, if someone gets proper diagnosis and instruction, \nthey can succeed in school and go on to have successful careers.\n  The National Science Foundation currently supports fundamental \nresearch across a number of scientific fields that provide a foundation \nfor dyslexia research. Also, the National Science Foundation is a \nleader in educational research and funds learning science directly and \nindirectly related to dyslexia.\n  A significant amount of the National Science Foundation research \nrelevant to dyslexia is funded out of the Social, Behavioral, and \nEconomic Sciences Directorate and the Education and Human Resources \nDirectorate--two important National Science Foundation Directorates \nthat fund high-priority research. Research funded by the Biological \nSciences Directorate also contributes to foundational knowledge about \nthe neuroscience behind dyslexia.\n  I was pleased that when this bill was considered by the House \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee, we worked in a bipartisan \nmanner and made several improvements to the bill, including \nincorporating some of the suggestions that expert witnesses had given \nus during Committee hearings.\n  I want to thank my fellow Texan, Chairman Smith for working across \nthe aisle on this bill. I support the bill and urge my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge my support for H.R. \n3033, the Research Excellence and Advancements for Dyslexia (READ) Act. \nI would like to emphasize the importance of supporting the academic \ndevelopment of the 8.5 million American school children struggling with \ndyslexia.\n  Before they are diagnosed, children with dyslexia often struggle in \nschool. Early detection of dyslexia can save students and parents the \nfrustration that occurs as a result of the student's unexpected decline \nin academic performance. I am fighting for increased funding of the \nNational Science Foundation's Research in Disabilities Education to \nsupport these children and their families. Research is crucial to \nensure that dyslexic children have the opportunity to reach their full \npotential. That is why it is vitally important to expand funding for \nresearch in all of our schools and communities.\n  In my District, I have spoken with many parents concerned about the \nlack of programs designed to assist with the diagnosis and development \nof dyslexic children. By passing this legislation, we will continue our \nlegacy of supporting children and families. The READ Act would require \nthat the President's annual budget request to Congress includes a line \nitem for the Research in Disabilities Education program of the National \nScience Foundation and requires the National Science Foundation to \nconduct research on dyslexia. In addition, the National Science \nFoundation would encourage efforts to understand and address \ndisability-based differences in STEM education and workforce \nparticipation, including dyslexic learners.\n  I am grateful that our chamber has taken this important step to \nensure that dyslexic children and their families receive the support \nthey need. I want to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for \nsupporting children's education and further dedicating ourselves to \nserving our hard-working American families and their children.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3033, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7187-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          DAY OF THE DEPLOYED\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of the 10th anniversary of the National Day of the \nDeployed, which honors all the men and women who have been deployed and \nwho have dedicated their lives to the defense and the continued freedom \nof our Nation.\n  On Sunday, October 25, I attended a welcome home celebration for 25 \nmembers of the 112th Air Operations Squadron based in State College, \nPennsylvania. These men and women were involved in all aspects of air \noperations in the Middle East and have been instrumental in the fight \nagainst ISIS. The 112th Air Operations Squadron was the first in the \nNation to be deployed in this manner many years ago, setting precedent \nfor similar units that have been deployed since.\n  Mr. Speaker, the deployed men and women of the United States Armed \nForces leave behind their families to travel overseas in order to serve \nour country in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan, along with other \nmissions throughout Asia and Europe. Their sacrifices embody bravery \nand the love for our country.\n  I welcome those brave individuals home and pray for those who are \nstill serving our country overseas. May we recognize them on this 10th \nNational Day of the Deployed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7187-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7187]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             CLIMATE CHANGE\n\n  (Mr. HONDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, last week's historic storm, Hurricane \nPatricia, was the strongest hurricane on record. My thoughts are with \nthose who lost their loved ones, their homes, and their livelihoods.\n  We must ensure that the thousands affected have access to food, \nshelter, clean water, services, and the resources to rebuild their \nlives to limit the impact of Patricia's devastation. But we should not \nlimit the storm's impact on our consciousness. Hurricane Patricia \nshould be a wake-up call that our planet's climate is changing.\n  September was the warmest month ever recorded. As our planet warms, \nwe expect more extreme weather: lengthier droughts, higher floods, and \nstronger storms.\n  Our Nation must invest in understanding and better preparing for the \neffects of climate change. Deprioritizing earth science and capping \nspending for research programs is irresponsible and shortsighted.\n  Hurricane Patricia showed how being informed and prepared about \ncoming storms can save lives.

It started with his \ncareer as a player at the University of Minnesota, where he started \nover 100 games for the Golden Gophers.\n  After his playing career was over, he began his coaching career at \nGolden Valley Lutheran College before working his way up to the NBA. \nFlip coached the Minnesota Timberwolves to their first winning season, \ntheir first playoff appearance, and to an appearance in the Western \nConference finals.\n  More than accolades, though, Flip was a mentor to many. The \noutpouring of grief from players, coaches, sportswriters, and fans \nshows just what he meant to those who knew him. Mr. Speaker, Flip \nSaunders was a basketball icon in Minnesota, and he will be greatly \nmissed.\n  Our thoughts and prayers are with his wife Debbie and their four \nchildren.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7187-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H7187-H7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  2015\n   WHY DOES THE IRS NEED SURVEILLANCE EQUIPMENT? TO SPY ON AMERICANS\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Department of Justice has closed \nits investigation into Lois Lerner and her band of bungling bureaucrats \nat the IRS. Choosing political expediency, it won't prosecute the \nactors.\n  But according to news reports today, not only did officials at the \nIRS abuse their power by targeting the administration's political \nenemies, now they possess spy equipment to do it.\n\n[[Page H7188]]\n\n  Now the IRS will have ``sophisticated cellphone dragnet equipment \nknown as Stingray.'' These devices ``work by pretending to be cellphone \ntowers in order to strip metadata and in some cases even content from \nphones which connect to them.''\n  Mr. Speaker, why does the IRS want to spy on Americans? It sounds \nlike the old Soviet Union to me. The Fourth Amendment protects \nAmericans from this type of widespread, abusive government spying.\n  It is time for Congress to make sure that the constitutional right of \nprivacy applies to the IRS and to this new technology. Technology may \nchange, but the Constitution does not.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7188-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Payne (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of a \nmedical procedure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "26"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/26/house-section/article/H7188-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H7188]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n EXPENDITURES BY THE OFFICE OF GENERAL COUNSEL UNDER HOUSE RESOLUTION \n                          676, 113TH CONGRESS\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on House \n           Administration,\n                                 Washington, DC, October 26, 2015.\n     Hon.
