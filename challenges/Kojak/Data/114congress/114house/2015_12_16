Mr. Speaker, the terrorist attack in San \nBernardino, the deadliest attack on U.S. soil since September 11, made \nit clear that our homeland is vulnerable to terrorists.\n  The terrorist couple's attack also made it clear that there are \nserious screening problems associated with the K-1 fiance(e) visa \nprogram.

Mr. Speaker, tomorrow the House will vote on an omnibus \nspending bill, and I look forward to supporting that bill because it \ndoes so much good for America, moves us forward, and brings us together \nas a body to move America forward. Included in there is the amendment I \nhave had on the House floor, and the Senate accepted to add an \nadditional $4 million to test rape kits.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a horrific backlog of rape kits in this \ncountry, and the Federal Government has stepped forward. Now we will \nstep forward with $45 million--last year it was $41 million--to give to \nlocal governments to reduce the backlog. That means we will be able to \ncatch the guilty and stop them before they violate the law again and \nviolate another woman, because rapists are often serial offenders.\n  I look forward to supporting the omnibus bill, protecting women in \nAmerica, and finding justice for criminals.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9332-7", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9332]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        TRANSPARENCY AND ACCOUNTABILITY OF FAILED EXCHANGES ACT\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, the only thing 5 years of ObamaCare has shown \nus has been its multiple and continuous flaws. When this legislation \nwas signed into law, the President freely gave money away to establish \nState exchanges. However, they forgot one piece of the puzzle: They \nprovided no provisions for recouping funds when the State exchanges \nfailed.\n  Mr. Speaker, these accounts spent billions of taxpayer dollars and \nprovided zero solutions to protect taxpayers when States decided to \nstop operating the exchanges. Where is the accountability? This burden \ncannot be placed on the taxpayer.\n  Today I introduced the Transparency and Accountability of Failed \nExchanges Act to ensure Americans are not on the hook for the billions \nthat were recklessly doled out to the States to establish these State \nexchanges. By promoting accountability and transparency, my legislation \nfixes the problems by providing clear steps to recover Federal funds \nwhen State exchanges fail, and it requires unused funds to be returned \nback to the Treasury Department to pay down the national debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this legislation that \npromotes accountability and transparency.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9332-8", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9332-H9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BOOSTING TIMBERING IN THE ALLEGHENY NATIONAL FOREST\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to once again \nreinforce the importance of proper management of our Nation's national \nforests.\n  Over the past two decades, timber harvests in the Allegheny National \nForest have fallen dramatically, following a trend we have seen in \nnational\n\n[[Page H9333]]\n\nforests nationwide. This has a domino effect on communities and school \ndistricts in and around the forest, because, since 1908, counties in \nnational forests are entitled to 25 percent of the receipts from timber \nsales under the 1908 Good Neighbor Compact.\n  These are communities which were built on the lumber industry and \nnatural resources. Many are among the most rural, poorest in \nPennsylvania, and the funding from timber sales is critical for \nschools, roads, and other public services, something these towns and \nschool districts depend on.\n  Due to this diminished revenue and various challenges forest \ncommunities continue to face, we must pass real reform that leads to \ngood management practices in our national forests. As such, I continue \nto support the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, or H.R. 2647. I \nbelieve this legislation is a key to increasing timber harvests in our \nnational forests, which will not only benefit our communities but will \ncreate a forest that is healthier and less prone to wildfires and \ninvasive species.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9333-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           NORTHERN CALIFORNIA ACADEMY NOMINEE ANNOUNCEMENTS\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n                              {time}  0915\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2820, the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act, introduced by my \ncolleagues, Representative Chris Smith of New Jersey and Representative \nDoris Matsui of California.\n  This bill is another example of the Energy and Commerce Committee's \nongoing effort to work together in a bipartisan manner to strengthen \npublic health and solve problems in our Nation's healthcare system.\n  H.R. 2820 reauthorizes the National Cord Blood Inventory program and \nthe C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program through fiscal year \n2020,\n\n[[Page H9334]]\n\nwhich provides Federal support for cord blood donation and research \nessential to increasing patient access to transplants.\n  The National Cord Blood Inventory, the NCBI, is a program to collect, \nstore, and distribute umbilical cord blood to those in need of a cord \nblood stem cell transplant. These cord blood units must meet specific \ncriteria, and are available through the C.W. Bill Young Cell \nTransplantation Program to treat patients who need a transplant.\n  The blood-forming cells from cord blood have unique qualities that \nhelp some patients who would otherwise be unable to have a potentially \nlifesaving transplant. NCBI is the largest and most diverse marrow \nregistry in the world.\n  The C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program provides support to \npatients who undergo a transplant and helps match donors to patients \nwho are in need of an unrelated marrow donor. Seventy percent of all \npatients who need a transplant don't have a match donor in their \nfamily, and this program gives them somewhere to turn.\n  I support H.R. 2820. I urge my colleagues to support this important \npiece of legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  H.R. 2820, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization \nAct, would continue the highly successfully Be The Match Registry for \nbone marrow and umbilical cord blood transplantation.\n  This program provides hope to people in need of lifesaving \ntransplants. Each year about 20,000 patients receive blood marrow \ntransplants. Seventy percent of those patients do not find a match \nwithin their family and instead rely on the Be The Match Registry to \nfind a non-relative bone marrow donor.\n  That is why continued Federal support for the Be The Match Registry \nand its nearly 12.5 million registered bone marrow donors and \ncollection of more than 209,000 cord blood units is so important.\n  I am glad that we have come together on a bipartisan basis in our \ncommittee and in the House and the Senate to support this lifesaving \nprogram.\n  I want to thank Congresswoman Matsui for her leadership in this area. \nI urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' to concur with Senate H.R. 2820.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to reiterate the important work that the National Marrow \nDonor Program does for patients. Be The Match, operated by the National \nMarrow Donor Program, has facilitated more than 68,000 marrow and cord \nblood transplants, which is an average of more than 520 transplants a \nmonth. They conducted their first transplant as the National Marrow \nDonor Program in 1987.\n  They also continue to lead the way in developing new cellular \ntherapies, in advancing services to speed the transplant process, and \nimproving treatments for post-transplant complications. Be The Match \ninvests in dedicated researchers whose countless hours in the lab and \ncaring for patients have helped more patients than ever before to \nreceive a transplant.\n  Beyond establishing the registry, investment in medical research over \nthe years has been essential in helping find the answers that save the \nlives of more patients.\n  In 1990, the Nobel Prize in Medicine was awarded to Dr. E. Donnall \nThomas for discoveries in cellular transplantation.\n  In 1994, the first peripheral blood stem cell collected for use in \nunrelated transplants occurred.\n  In 1998, the cord blood program was launched.\n  In 2001, the NMDP Repository was built, one of the world's largest \ntissue sample storage facilities used for medical research.\n  In 2004, Be The Match and the NMDP partnered with the Medical College \nof Wisconsin to create the Center for International Blood and Marrow \nTransplant Research.\n  The great work and discovery continues. I urge bipartisan support for \nH.R. 2820 and support for discovery and cures for patients.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n2820, the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of \n2015.\n  This bill reauthorizes the National Cord Blood Inventory program and \nthe C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, two programs that \nsave lives every day through bone marrow transplants and blood \ninfusions.\n  This bill is very similar to legislation that the Georgia General \nAssembly passed in 2007, establishing the newborn umbilical cord blood \nbank. I voted for that legislation in the Georgia General Assembly, and \nI will vote in favor of this legislation.\n  For some patients who have leukemia, lymphoma, sickle cell anemia, or \na life-threatening blood cancer, help from programs like the National \nCord Blood Inventory program and the C.W. Bill Young Cell \nTransplantation Program, may be their last hope at living longer, \nhealthier lives. That is why H.R. 2820 is so important.\n  This bill reauthorizes these two programs through 2020, and continues \nto provide lifesaving techniques and research to many who fight for \ntheir lives every day.\n  This bill originally passed the House on September 8 by voice vote. I \nencourage my colleagues to support it again.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), the prime sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  (Mr. SMITH of New Jersey asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank, first of all, \nour distinguished chairman, Chairman Pitts, for his extraordinary work \non this legislation.\n  I also want to thank Mr. Gene Green of Texas, Mr. Pallone, and, of \ncourse, Chairman Upton for his strong support of this reauthorization.\n  In the Senate, we have had a tremendous team of Orrin Hatch, Jack \nReed, Richard Burr, and Al Franken, who again worked in a very \nbipartisan way to ensure that this life-affirming, lifesaving \nlegislation not only made it through the Senate, but was beefed up, \nmade stronger.\n  People talk about the lack of bipartisanship. I do believe this is \none of those bills where we have all come together to try to say--\nwhether it be bone marrow or adult stem cells in the form of cord \nblood--that it be made available to as many people as possible in the \nmost usable and efficacious way.\n  Mr. Speaker, just let me say--and we know this and I will try not to \nbe too redundant because I think the chairman has explained it--the \nbill under consideration by the House today does reauthorize through \n2020 two critically important and complementary programs, the C.W. Bill \nYoung Cell Transplantation Program and the National Cord Blood \nInventory.\n  It is especially appropriate during this time of gift-giving to \nreauthorize these life-giving programs. Americans willing to give the \ngift of life to others are at the heart of the success of this program.\n  In reauthorizing it, we are grateful for the adult donors willing to \nprovide bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells as well as mothers \nwho donate their child's cord blood through public cord blood banks.\n  Under the National Cord Blood Inventory program, Mr. Speaker, \ncontracts are awarded to cord blood banks to collect cord blood units \ndonated after mothers give birth.\n  Around 4 million births occur in the United States every year. God, \nin his grace and love, has left a gift that then gives life and helps \nto cure diseases, including leukemia and other devastating blood-\nrelated diseases, left after that birth.\n  Again, cord blood and the placenta itself is teeming with stem cells \nthat are, again, highly efficacious in curing and mitigating disease.\n  Americans have access to more than 12 million adult volunteer donors \nand 209,000 cord blood units through Be The Match. The program's Bone \nMarrow and Cord Blood Coordinating Centers\n\n[[Page H9335]]\n\nmake information about bone marrow and cord blood transplants available \nto donors and patients. The Office of Patient Advocacy helps support \npatients and families dealing with a life-threatening diagnosis. The \nStem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database tracks results.\n  Again, if you want to know how something is working or not, you track \nit, and you are constantly recalibrating it in order to make it better.\n  Today's bill is the second reauthorization of the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act of 2005, a law that I authored a decade \nago, joined by Artur Davis of Alabama, legislation that, again, cleared \nthe Senate with the great help of Senator Orrin Hatch.\n  That law built upon the excellent work of our distinguished, late \ncolleague Bill Young of Florida to facilitate bone marrow transplants \nand created a brand-new national umbilical cord blood donation and \ntransplantation program.\n  Dr. Jeffrey Chell, the CEO of NMDP/Be The Match, has noted that, for \nmany diseases, including blood cancers and sickle cell anemia disease, \ncellular therapy is the best hope for a cure.\n  As he told Chairman Pitts and his committee, the patient population \nrising the most quickly is the elderly population, growing by double \ndigits every year. The reason for that is that the medical conditions \nfor which transplant is often the only cure tend to occur in older \npopulations; diseases like acute leukemia, myelofibrosis, and others.\n  Breathtaking scientific breakthroughs have turned medical waste, \npost-birth placentas, and umbilical cord blood into medical miracles, \ntreating more than 70 diseases--some say as many as 80--including \nleukemia, lymphoma, and sickle cell anemia.\n  Let me just conclude by pointing out that, during consideration of \nthe Senate HELP Committee, language was added to direct relevant \nagencies to study the state of science using adult stem cells and \nbirthing tissues to develop new therapies for patients.\n  Last year I visited Celgene Corporation in Summit, New Jersey, to \nlearn of their extraordinary efforts to use cord blood to heal diabetic \nfoot ulcers and how they turn amniotic membrane, an old placenta, into \nwound management that now has advanced past stage 3 clinical trials to \nthe approval and regulatory filings stage.\n  Again, I want to thank the chief cosponsor, Ms. Matsui; Mr. Jolly; \nand Mr. Fattah. Again, this is a bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill under consideration by the House today \nreauthorizes through 2020 two critically important and complementary \nprograms--the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program and National \nCord Blood Inventory.\n  During this time of gift-giving, it is incredibly timely to \nreauthorize these life-giving programs. Americans willing to give the \ngift of life to others are at the heart of the success of this program. \nIn reauthorizing it we are grateful for the adult donors willing to \nprovide bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, as well as mothers \nwho donate their child's cord blood through public cord blood banks.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, under the National Cord Blood Inventory Program \n(NCBI), contracts are awarded to cord blood banks to collect cord blood \nunits donated after mothers give birth. These units are then made \navailable through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program also \ncalled the Be the Match Registry. The Program provides a single point \nof access, enabling those in need of lifesaving transplants to search \nfor a match via an integrated nationwide network of bone marrow donors \nand cord blood stem cells. Americans have access to more than 12 \nmillion adult volunteer donors and 209,000 cord blood units through Be \nThe Match. The Program's Bone Marrow and Cord Blood Coordinating \nCenters makes information about bone marrow and cord blood transplant \navailable to donors and patients, and the Office of Patient Advocacy \nhelps support patients and families dealing with a life-threatening \ndiagnosis. And the Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database tracks \nresults.\n  The leadership of Senators Orrin Hatch, Jack Reed, Richard Burr and \nAl Franken was invaluable in shepherding this vital bill through the \nSenate. And special thanks to both Chairmen Upton and Pitts for their \noutstanding leadership and help on this bill, as well as the strong \nsupport by Ranking Members Pallone and Green. I am deeply grateful to \noriginal cosponsors Ms. Matsui, Mr. Jolly and Mr. Fattah for their \nimportant contributions.\n  Today's bill is the second reauthorization of the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Act of 2005, a law that I sponsored a decade \nago joined by Artur Davis of Alabama; legislation that cleared the \nSenate with the incomparable help of Senator Orrin Hatch. That law \nbuilt upon the excellent work of our distinguished late colleague Bill \nYoung of Florida to facilitate bone marrow transplants and created a \nbrand new national umbilical cord blood donation and transplantation \nprogram.\n  Dr. Jeffrey W. Chell, CEO of NMDP/Be the Match has noted that for \nmany diseases including blood cancers and sickle cell disease, cellular \ntherapy is the best hope for a cure. He told Chairman Pitts' \nsubcommittee that the patient population ``rising the most quickly is \nthe elderly population . . . growing by double digits every year, and \nthe reason for that is the medical conditions for which transplant is \noften the only cure tend to occur in older populations for diseases \nlike acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis \nand others.''\n  Breathtaking scientific breakthroughs have turned medical waste--post \nbirth placentas and umbilical cord blood--into medical miracles \ntreating more than 70 diseases including leukemia, lymphoma and sickle \ncell anemia.\n  Not only has God in His wisdom and goodness created a placenta and \numbilical cord to nurture and protect the precious life of an unborn \nchild, but now we know that another gift awaits us immediately after \nbirth. Something very special is left behind--cord blood that is \nteeming with lifesaving stem cells.\n  In addition to currently treating more than 70 diseases like sickle \ncell anemia and leukemia, cord blood units from NCBI banks are also \nmade available for research on future therapies. In groundbreaking \nresearch, Dr. Kurtzberg of Duke University also testified last June \nthat ``in addition to use in patients with malignant and genetic \ndiseases, cord blood is showing enormous potential for use in cellular \ntherapies and regenerative medicine. Cord blood derived vaccines \nagainst viruses and certain types of cancers are currently under \ndevelopment and in early phase clinical trials. Cells, manufactured \nfrom cord blood units are being developed to boost recovery of the \nimmune system. Cells regulating autoimmunity (Regulatory T cells) are \nalso in clinical trials. These approaches, which often utilize cord \nblood banked in family banks, may help patients with Type 1 Diabetes, \nas well as other diseases.''\n  Dr. Kurtzberg further testified that she and others are developing \nuses for cord blood to treat acquired brain disorders. ``Over the past \nsix years'' she said ``we have initiated trials of autologous (the \npatient's own) cord blood in babies with birth asphyxia, cerebral \npalsy, hearing loss and autism . . .''\n  Dr. Kurtzberg has also said ``We've learned that when donor cells are \ninfused into one's body, they go to the brain and help heal the brain. \nWhen a child has a brain injury around birth, we can use their own cord \nblood cells to correct the damage that's occurred.''\n  Inportantly, during consideration in the Senate HELP Committee, \nlanguage was added to direct the relevant agencies to study the state \nof science using adult stem cells and birthing tissues to develop new \ntherapies for patients. Last year, Mr. Speaker, I visited Celgene \nCorporation of Summit, New Jersey to learn of their extraordinary \nefforts to use cord blood to heal diabetic foot ulcers and how they've \nturned amniotic membrane--an old placenta--into wound management that \nhas now advanced past stage 3 clinical trials to the approval and \nregulatory filings stage.\n  H.R. 2820 authorizes $265 million over five years and will ensure \nthat thousands of present-day and future patients benefit from the \nexciting field of regenerative medicine.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) that the House suspend the \nrules and concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 2820.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9335-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9335-H9337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0930\n     NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVIST DEBT RELIEF EXTENSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 4246) to exempt for an additional 4-year period, from the \napplication of the means-test presumption of\n\n[[Page H9336]]\n\nabuse under chapter 7, qualifying members of reserve components of the \nArmed Forces and members of the National Guard who, after September 11, \n2001, are called to active duty or to perform a homeland defense \nactivity for not less than 90 days.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4246\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``National Guard and Reservist \n     Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVISTS DEBT RELIEF AMENDMENT.\n\n       Section 4(b) of the National Guard and Reservists Debt \n     Relief Act of 2008 (Public Law 110-438; 122 Stat. 5000) is \n     amended by striking ``7-year'' and inserting ``11-year''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4246, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Every day at home and abroad, uniformed men and women risk their \nlives to protect our freedom and way of life. Among those brave souls \nare military reservists and members of the National Guard, who have \nbeen called to duty in Iraq, Afghanistan, and in many other places \nacross the globe. We are eternally grateful for their service to our \ncountry.\n  The Federal Government has a responsibility to ease the transition of \nreservists and guardsmen back into civilian life upon their return \nhome. Some may return home with physical handicaps. For others, \npsychological challenges face them and their families. Some of these \nveterans and their families have suffered financial hardships, and, \noccasionally, bankruptcy is the unfortunate last resort. In a chapter 7 \nbankruptcy, debtors surrender virtually all of their assets to the \nbankruptcy trustee and receive a discharge from their debts at the end \nof the short case.\n  In 2005, Congress made a number of reforms to the Bankruptcy Code \nunder the Bankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act. A \nsignificant policy goal of that Act was to address abuses of the \nchapter 7 bankruptcy process. To that end, Congress inserted into the \nBankruptcy Code a threshold test to gauge whether debtors have \ndisposable income that can be used to pay their debts. This is commonly \nreferred to as the ``means test.''\n  If debtors are able to pay some portion of their debts from their \ndisposable monthly incomes, then the filing of a chapter 7 bankruptcy \ncase is presumed to be an abuse of the bankruptcy system. Debtors can \ncontest that presumption or can seek relief under other bankruptcy \nchapters, including chapter 13, under which they can restructure how to \npay for their debts over time from their disposable incomes.\n  In 2008, Congress recognized that military reservists and National \nGuardsmen sometimes confront unique financial challenges as a \nconsequence of their military service. For instance, if these military \nmembers receive hazard pay during their service, that could actually \ninflate the results of the disposable income calculation under the \nmeans test, lifting them out of chapter 7 eligibility. So Congress \nenacted the National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Act, which \nPresident Bush signed into law in October of 2008. This Act allows \nreservists and National Guardsmen to bypass the means test, making it \neasier for them to file a chapter 7 case.\n  The original Act expired in 2011, but it was extended for an \nadditional 4 years. The exemption is, once again, set to expire on \nDecember 19. H.R. 4246, introduced by Mr. Cohen and Mr. Forbes, further \nextends the existing exemption to 2019.\n  We continue to call on our guardsmen and reservists to serve our \ncountry. We should ensure that those military members who fall on hard \ntimes are not denied access to bankruptcy because of their service to \ntheir country. The bill before us today extends the sunset date by 4 \nyears, at which time Congress will have the opportunity to reexamine \nwhether this exception to the means test continues to be necessary.\n  I thank the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen) and the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Forbes) for introducing this legislation; and I urge \nmy colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Conyers is the ranking member, and I appreciate his support just \nas I appreciate Mr. Goodlatte for bringing this bill to the floor. \nBills don't get to the floor without the chairman of the committee \nhaving recommended them; so I thank Mr. Goodlatte and I thank Mr. \nConyers, as I have been thinking about the apology for slavery and Jim \nCrow that came to this floor 7 years ago but that wouldn't have without \nthe work of then-Chairman Conyers; so I thank him again.\n  Today, I thank Mr. Forbes and my other sponsors, Mr. Nadler and Mr. \nRohrabacher, who have cosponsored this bill with me.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4246, the National Guard \nand Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015.\n  This bipartisan legislation ensures that certain members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves who fall on hard economic times after their \nservice will continue to obtain the bankruptcy relief which we have \ngranted them in the past so they won't have to fill out substantial \npaperwork that is required by the so-called ``means test'' under \nchapter 7 of the Bankruptcy Code and meet that test.\n  The means test came into effect about 10 years ago when President \nBush signed into law what is called the BAPCPA, the Bankruptcy Abuse \nPrevention and Consumer Protection Act, which made numerous amendments \nto the bankruptcy law. It provided a means test, which made it more \ndifficult to get into bankruptcy court. This gives National Guardsmen \nand reservists an opportunity to extinguish their debts without having \nto go through that difficult test.\n  The National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Act of 2008 created an \nexception to the means test's presumption of abuse for members of the \nNational Guard and Reserves who after September 11 served on Active \nDuty or in a homeland defense activity for at least 90 days. The \nexception remains available for 540 days after the servicemember leaves \nthe military.\n  Many servicemembers, we know, are subjected to unscrupulous lenders \nand payday loans, and we have seen stories that show that up to, I \nthink, 11 percent of servicemembers have been taking out payday loans. \nEleven percent of enlisted personnel in the Active Duty military obtain \nthese loans, which include vehicle title loans, pawnshop loans, and \nother high-interest loans; so they are preyed upon.\n  In understanding they give service to our country and are preyed upon \nby folks near the military establishment in the communities, it is \nappropriate that we give them this relief. It is a way for our Nation \nto recognize the sacrifices made by National Guard and Reserve members \nwho have served on Active Duty or in homeland defense since September \n11 and who may be suffering from financial hardship.\n  The bill is supported by the National Association of Consumer \nBankruptcy Attorneys and by the Veterans of Foreign Wars.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers and my fellow \ncosponsors; and I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation that continues a very good practice that benefits \nour Guard and Reserve members.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H9337]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4246, the \n``National Guard and Reservist Debt Relief Extension Act of 2015.''\n  It has been ten years since President Bush signed into law the \nBankruptcy Abuse Prevention and Consumer Protection Act, a bill that \nmade numerous amendments to the Bankruptcy Code, many of which \npertained to consumer debtors.\n  In particular, the Act established a means test mechanism--\npurportedly intended to determine a debtor's ability to repay debts--\nthat requires a presumption of abuse if the debtor has income in excess \nof specified thresholds.\n  H.R. 4246 would continue the current exemption from this presumption \nfor certain qualifying National Guard members and reserve component \nmembers of the Armed Services.\n  This exemption, which was first enacted in 2008 on a bipartisan \nbasis, is due to expire in just a few days on December 19th.\n  H.R. 4246 recognizes that some of those who serve in the military \nencounter financial difficulties during or in the wake of their service \nand that they merit relief from the additional proof requirements of \nthe means test.\n  In fact, servicemembers are often targeted by unscrupulous lenders. \nAs reported by the Wall Street Journal earlier this year, payday \nlenders prey on service members and their families at twice the rate \nthat they use to target civilians.\n  These short-term, high-interest loans are often used to provide small \namounts of money to pay for unexpected or emergency expenditures or to \nobtain advances on tax refunds.\n  Yet, as a result of excessive interest rates, these loans can quickly \nballoon into overwhelming debt obligations. According to the Journal, \nsome servicemembers have paid as much as 600 percent to 700 percent for \nthe life of their loans, or even four times the amount of the original \nloan.\n  In 2013, about 11 percent of enlisted personnel in the active duty \nmilitary obtained payday loans, which included vehicle title loans, \npawnshop loans, and other high-interest loans.\n  So, at least for those servicemembers who seek bankruptcy protection \nin response to financial distress, H.R. 4246 ensures that they are \nexempted from the presumption of abuse if he or she is on active duty \nor is performing a homeland defense activity for a specified period.\n  I commend the gentleman from Tennessee, Steve Cohen, for his \nleadership on this legislation and for his enduring commitment to our \nNation's servicemembers.\n  Accordingly, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to join \nme in supporting H.R. 4246.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 4246.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9337-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9337-H9338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EMERGENCY INFORMATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) and the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and \nextend their remarks and to include extraneous material on S. 1090.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  Currently, the Robert T. Stafford Disaster Relief and Emergency \nAssistance Act, also known as the Stafford Act, provides for assistance \nto governments and to nonprofit organizations to rebuild damaged \nfacilities following a declared disaster.\n  S. 1090, the Emergency Information Improvement Act of 2015, clarifies \nthe eligibility of certain not-for-profit broadcasting facilities for \ndisaster assistance that is consistent with existing policy.\n  These stations provide essential alerts and information before, \nduring, and after disasters and emergencies. In fact, these \nbroadcasters are an integral component of our national public alert and \nwarning system. Following a disaster, it is critical that these \nfacilities get up and running as soon as possible to ensure the public \nreceives necessary emergency information. For example, during recent \nmajor disasters, these broadcasters were critical to getting \ninformation to the public quickly.\n  I want to thank Congressman Palazzo for his leadership on shepherding \nthis bill through committee and for getting it here to the House floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  S. 1090, the Emergency Information Improvement Act of 2015, would \nclarify the eligibility of certain broadcasting facilities for public \nassistance.\n  Broadcasters are critical partners when it comes to emergency \nmanagement in the face of a disaster. One of the best ways to prevent \ndeaths and injuries during a disaster is to warn those who are in \nharm's way of impending danger. This allows people to take the \nnecessary precautions to avoid injury and death and to minimize \nproperty damage. Broadcasters work hand in hand with emergency managers \nto provide this notice before a disaster strikes. After a disaster, the \nbroadcasters' role remains just as critical. They continue airing \ninformation about ongoing hazards and aid recovery efforts by providing \nhow-to information on accessing recovery assistance.\n  From Hurricane Sandy to this year's floods in the Carolinas, the \nemergency broadcasts save lives and keep people out of harm's way. This \nis not just about large-scale disasters. When a violent storm caused \nthe sudden collapse of a concert stage in my hometown of Indianapolis, \nIndiana, local broadcasters kept a tragedy from becoming that much \nworse. Timely alerts enabled Fair officials to clear the Midway minutes \nbefore the storm struck, potentially saving the lives of hundreds of \npeople. We see this all over the country every year.\n  Unfortunately, broadcast facilities are not immune to hazards, which \nis why this bill is so important. When broadcasting facilities are \ndamaged by a disaster, we must ensure that they are eligible for \nrecovery assistance so that they can be up and running in time for the \nnext hazard.\n  I would note, Mr. Speaker, that this language is absolutely identical \nto the language that my good friend from New York (Mr. Nadler) has been \nso tirelessly advocating for; so I want to thank him for his efforts in \nbringing this issue to our attention and for his diligence in ensuring \nthis matter was brought to the House floor.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of the \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I give my full support of Senate Bill 1090, \nthe Emergency Information Improvement Act. Congressman Brian Higgins of \nNew York and I sponsored\n\n[[Page H9338]]\n\nthe House version of this bill, and we are proud to see this simple but \nvery important piece of legislation pass.\n  Disasters strike every year in every corner of America. Hurricanes on \nthe Gulf Coast and Eastern Seaboard, ice storms in the Midwest and \nplains states, wild fires in the West, tornados through our Nation's \nheartlands and flooding in Texas, the Carolinas, and elsewhere.\n  During a disaster, local public radio stations play an essential role \nin delivering information about response efforts, local relief \nsupplies, evacuation orders and emergency routes, where to find food, \nshelter and fuel as well as on-the-ground, at-the-scene reporting to \nhelp affected communities understand and respond.\n  Approximately 98 percent of the American population has access to a \npublic radio or TV signal. Current federal emergency response and \nrelief statutes are ambiguous on whether local public broadcasting \nstations are eligible for emergency financial assistance when damaged \nby storms and other disasters. This legislation amends the Stafford Act \nto make clear that local public radio and broadcasting stations are \neligible recipients of disaster relief. The Emergency Information \nImprovement Act brings greater stability to the availability of \ncritical information during times of crisis.\n  Its passage by Congress will significantly boost our efforts to \nensure that all Americans have the information they need when they need \nit during occurrences of natural and man-made disasters. It will \nguarantee that locally licensed stations are eligible for federal \ndisaster relief funding in the event their facilities are impacted by a \ndisaster.\n  I want to personally thank my colleagues in the Senate, Senators Ted \nCruz and Cory Booker, for introducing companion legislation in the \nSenate and for their hard work in seeing this important piece of \nlegislation pass their chamber.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the consideration of H.J. Res. 78.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to present H.J. Res. 78, a short-term \ncontinuing resolution that will fund the government through December \n22.\n  This morning, we posted a full-year omnibus funding bill. The bill \nwill responsibly fund the government for the remainder of fiscal 2016 \nyear at the level set by the Bipartisan Budget Act passed in October. \nWe are set to consider it later this week.\n  However, our current funding mechanism expires today at midnight. To \nallow for enough time to read and process this legislation, it is \nnecessary at this point that we pass another continuing resolution to \nkeep the lights on in our government.\n  The legislation we have before us today simply extends current levels \nof funding for critical government programs and services for 6 \nadditional days through next Tuesday. It is very short and limited in \nscope, buying us enough time to shepherd the omnibus through to \nenactment and then for the bill to be enrolled, sent to the President, \nand signed into law.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bill, to give us the time to \nconsider the full appropriations package, and bring the fiscal year \n2016 appropriations process to a close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  For the second time in a week, I rise in half-hearted support for the \ncontinuing resolution before us. This is the third time the Republican \nmajority has brought us to the brink of a shutdown in just the past 11 \nweeks. It has been over 2\\1/2\\ months since we passed a bipartisan 2-\nyear budget agreement that set guidelines for appropriations. We should \nhave final bills signed into law by now. There are no excuses for these \nconstant delays.\n  Unfortunately, Republicans' insistence on including dangerous, \nharmful policies in spending bills that would restrict women's \nreproductive health decisions, harm the environment, and roll back \nconsumer protections, just to name a few, delayed the ability of \nCongress to come to a fair, bipartisan agreement on time.\n  However, we did know throughout this process that Republicans would \nneed Democratic votes to pass the omnibus. That is why I am pleased to \nsay we were able to get rid of more than 150 poison pill riders, \nincluding those related to women's health, labor, such as efforts to \nblock the fiduciary rule and the joint employer rule, consumer \nfinancial protection, clean air and water--all gone. However, I was \ndisappointed we were unable to reverse a 19-year-old prohibition on \nFederal funding for the research of gun violence.\n  The budget agreement enacted in November provided additional funding, \nallowing us to make critical investments, reflecting Democratic values. \nThere are some large increases to the National Institutes of Health and \nthe Army Corps of Engineers, for example, Head Start, energy research, \nCOPS hiring, nutrition funding, and so much more. We also prevented \nfurther cuts to the EPA and other agencies routinely targeted by \nRepublicans. I am disappointed that the omnibus does not deal \nadequately with Puerto Rico's crisis. It does carry the 9/11 health and \ncompensation fund. The omnibus carries some tax matters, including the \nCadillac tax and solar and wind tax credits.\n  In all, the package is a mixed bag. Each Member will have to read the \ndetails for him- or herself.\n  While I will vote to keep the government open today, Mr. Speaker, the \nAmerican people deserve a Congress that does its job on time and puts \nthe interests of hardworking families ahead of special interests.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the joint resolution, H.J.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise with a heavy heart to pay \ntribute to the 14 innocent lives lost on December 2 in San Bernardino, \nCalifornia, in the terrorism attack at the Inland Regional Center.\n  In the wake of this terrorist act, our San Bernardino community has \ncome together and supported one another during this dark chapter in our \nregion and our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I ask my colleagues, fellow Americans, and those \nwho hear this message around the world, to pray for the families of the \n14 victims, the speedy recovery of the 22 injured, the countless first \nresponders that helped that day, and for the health and resilience of \nthe San Bernardino community.\n  In the aftermath of this pain, I have seen firsthand the tenacity and \nthe spirit of the area that we call the Inland Empire. We have said \nloudly, as one community, that this tragedy will not define us and it \nwill not divide us.\n  We will not be afraid to come together in fellowship, to work \ntogether, to mourn together, or to rebuild together. Across faiths and \nacross culture, we will support one another in this time of need.\n  Mr. Speaker, San Bernardino has been forced to soldier through \ndifficult times before. As we face this new and difficult hurdle, I \nknow my community will continue to stand together to show our country \nand our region the resolve of this city and of these people to heal. We \nare San Bernardino united.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am joined by my colleagues, and I ask the House to \npause for a moment of silence in honor of those affected by the \nterrorist act in San Bernardino on December 2.\n  The SPEAKER. The House will observe a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9339-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9339-H9340]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVIST DEBT RELIEF EXTENSION ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER.

Mr. Speaker, there are a few certainties in life: \ndeath, taxes, and my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) asking for a \ncolloquy about every week, but the schedule of this House in December \nis not one of those certainties. So I rise today to ensure that the \nMembers of this body have the most up-to-date information on the floor \nschedule in the House.\n  Currently, the House is scheduled to be in session and voting on \nThursday and Friday of this week. Members are advised that we are \nexpected to remain in session until we finish our business for the \nyear.\n  At this point, we expect to consider the tax extender package \ntomorrow, and the omnibus on Friday. Should there be any further \nchanges to the schedule, I will be sure to notify the Members as soon \nas possible.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Can the leader tell me what the expectation would be for Members on \nFriday as to when would be a target date to complete business on \nFriday?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. We will convene at 9 a.m. It is our anticipation as \nlong as it goes as scheduled that we can be walking off the floor by \nnoon.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for the information.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9340-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9340-H9341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EMERGENCY INFORMATION IMPROVEMENT ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Emmer of Minnesota).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude any extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this measure.\n  In particular, I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina, Mr. \nMark Meadows, for being an early leader on this issue, focusing on \nHezbollah and on this legislation.\n  I also want to thank Congressman David Scott of Georgia. He served \nfor 8 years on the Foreign Affairs Committee as vice chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade.\n  I would just mention that, as chairman of the NATO Parliamentary \nAssembly Committee that researched and wrote the report on Iran's \nnuclear weapons program, he has unique insights with respect to the \nthreat posed by Hezbollah--not just to Israel, but to the West. We \nthank them both for their work on this measure.\n  I also want to thank Senators Rubio and Shaheen for recognizing the \nurgency of this problem and working in a bipartisan way to ensure that \nthis legislation was able to pass the Senate so that today we can send \nit to the President's desk.\n  And, most importantly, I want to thank my good friend and colleague, \nthe gentleman from New York, Mr. Eliot Engel, for his work to push back \nagainst Iran and its proxies that threaten the United States and \nthreaten our allies globally.\n  Now, I will say that this day is overdue. This past May, the House \npassed this bill by a vote of 423-0. In fact, last Congress the House \nalso passed legislation spearheaded by Mr. Meadows in the 113th \nCongress 404-0, which the\n\n[[Page H9344]]\n\nother body failed to take up. Thankfully, this year is different \nbecause right now, Iran is on a roll.\n  Last week we learned the regime test-fired another ballistic missile \nin violation of two U.N. resolutions. Meanwhile, Iran continues to hold \nAmerican hostages. And its terrorist proxy--which is Hezbollah--is \nwreaking havoc throughout the Middle East.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we confront this kind of aggression. \nWe cannot stand by while the Iranian regime exports violence and \nexports its revolutionary ideology. That is why this legislation \ntargeting Hezbollah is so important.\n  Prior to September 11, 2001, Hezbollah was responsible--before that \nattack by al Qaeda--for more American deaths than any other terrorist \norganization on this planet. In 1983, Hezbollah suicide bombers struck \nthe U.S. marine barracks in Beirut, killing 241 American servicemen, \nand in a similar attack in 1996, in Saudi Arabia, killed 19 American \nservicemen.\n  Hezbollah continues to serve as Iran's frontline against Israel, with \n100,000 rockets pointed at our ally. The terrorist group also plays a \nkey role in Iran's effort to prop up Syria's murderous Assad regime. \nThousands of Hezbollah fighters freely cross the border between Lebanon \nand Syria to join the fight.\n  Unfortunately, the threat posed by Hezbollah and other Iranian \nproxies is poised to become even more dangerous.\n  Iran is Hezbollah's primary benefactor, giving the Lebanese political \nparty and militant group some $200 million a year in addition to \nweapons, training, intelligence, and logistical assistance as well.\n  Over the past few years, Iran has been forced to cut back its \nfinancial support to Hezbollah due to the international sanctions \nregime that the Obama administration will dismantle in the coming \nmonths.\n  As a result of the sanctions relief due to Tehran under the Iran \ndeal, Hezbollah will see additional funding come its way, a boost that \nwill benefit Hezbollah's regional and international operations.\n  With more money, Hezbollah will step up its aid to Shia militias in \nIraq and Yemen in cooperation with Iran. It will increase its presence \nin Syria, and, most significantly, it is going to increase its threat \nto Israel.\n  Finally, increased funding will help Hezbollah rebuild its \ncapabilities beyond the Middle East. A newly enriched Hezbollah will be \nmore aggressive at home and abroad, boosting its destabilizing \nactivities inside and outside of Lebanon.\n  Yet, this is not a foregone conclusion. This legislation represents \nan important first step in pushing back against Iran and Hezbollah and \nrepairing the damage that the administration's sanctions relief for \nTehran has done to our national security.\n  Hezbollah is worried, as this bill puts Hezbollah's sources of \nfinancing under additional scrutiny, particularly those resources \noutside of Lebanon, given that many Lebanese banks have stepped up \ntheir game now to prevent money laundering.\n  It will also promote the application of advanced antiterrorism and \nantimoney laundering methods to both financial institutions and \nbusiness enterprises operating as financial institutions, such as those \nadopted by regional banks, including many in Lebanon.\n  In addition to targeting the terrorist organization's diverse \nfinancial network, the legislation also requires the U.S. Government to \nfocus on Hezbollah's global logistics network and its transnational \norganized criminal enterprises, including its drug smuggling \noperations, key areas of expansion for that terrorist organization.\n  How do I know they are worried? Because they said so in their own \nwords. After the Senate passage of this legislation, Hezbollah issued a \nformal statement condemning the Senate vote and describing it as a \n``crime'' against Hezbollah. With their international networks, \nparticularly their most lucrative networks outside of Lebanon in Africa \nand Latin America, in our crosshairs, they should be worried. They \nshould be worried.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to support this critical measure.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of the Hezbollah International Financing \nPrevention Act.\n  The House first passed this bipartisan legislation on May 14 by a \nvote of 423-0. That is as bipartisan as you can get. On November 17, \nthe Senate sent the bill back to us with a number of very modest \nchanges. By passing it again today, we send it to the President's desk.\n  I want to commend my friend, Chairman Royce, for being the driving \nforce behind this very, very important bill. When Chairman Royce \nintroduced the bill, I was glad to join as an original cosponsor.\n  I also want to acknowledge Representatives Deutch, Meadows, and Meng \nfor their had work on this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, over a decade ago, I authored the Syria Accountability \nand Lebanese Sovereignty Restoration Act, which is now law. My partner, \nIleana Ros-Lehtinen of Florida, and I pushed very hard for many years \nto get this bill finally passed by both Houses and signed into law by \nthe President.\n  This measure aimed to end Syrian support for terrorism, including \nsupport to groups such as Hezbollah. Since then, Hezbollah has found \nnew ways to siphon resources and expand its reach, all the while \nworking toward the same goal: to undermine Lebanese political \nindependence and support Iran's dangerous agenda throughout the region.\n  It is a bit ironic that the group that really controls Lebanon today \nis not really the Lebanese Government, but it is Hezbollah, which \nreally has the same type of duplication, but they are stronger \nmilitarily than the Lebanese Government. That is a shame for Lebanon. \nIt really is.\n  We know the aggregation that Hezbollah has had with Lebanon's wars \nagainst Israel and being Iran's proxy in Syria and doing all kinds of \nthings that are detrimental to the world. Our laws to crack down on \nthis group of Hezbollah need to keep pace. Again, their goal is to \nundermine Lebanese political independence and support Iran's dangerous \ngoals. We need to be one step ahead of them.\n  Iran is the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. Let's not \nforget that. While the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and its Quds \nForce spread instability throughout the region, Iran's most destructive \nterrorist tool has been Hezbollah.\n  Among other things, this heinous group was behind the bombings of the \nU.S. Embassy and marine barracks in Lebanon and the Israel embassy and \nJewish community center in Buenos Aires, Argentina.\n  Hezbollah's nefarious activities are not limited to terrorism. The \ngroup has put down roots in drug trafficking and other forms of \ntransnational crime. Hezbollah has become a sophisticated and complex \nterrorist organization, and we need a response adequate to meet this \nchallenge.\n  This legislation will move the ball forward by sanctioning foreign \nbanks for knowingly doing business with Hezbollah. We need to send a \nclear message to companies getting tangled up with this terrorist \ngroup. That message is: Walk away or face the consequences of the \nUnited States of America.\n  The bill would also shine a bright light on Al-Manar, Hezbollah's \ntelevision station, itself a specially designated terrorist group. \nChairman Royce and I, working together through the years, especially \nlisten to what is being broadcast.\n  During the cold war, when we had Radio Free America and television \nbroadcasts, we felt that the message that the United States was getting \nto these countries was very important. And we believed--both of us--\nthat it did, in fact, play a major role in the collapse of the Soviet \nUnion because they were fed the truth by us. We are strong supporters \nof continuing that kind of thing.\n  Hezbollah uses Al-Manar for logistical propaganda and fundraising \npurposes. It defies reason that this station is still carried by the \nsatellite providers all over the world. Can you imagine that?\n  Let me say that again. This legislation shines a bright light on Al-\nManar, which is Hezbollah's television station--itself, a specially \ndesignated terrorist group--and Hezbollah uses this station for \nlogistical propaganda and fundraising purposes. It is outrageous that \nthis station is still carried by satellite providers all over the \nworld.\n\n[[Page H9345]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  We need to expose this puppet organization for what it is. Our \ngovernment needs new powers provided in this legislation, and I am \npleased that the House and Senate worked together to get the bill \nacross the finish line.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation; and I, \nagain, thank Chairman Royce for pushing this, for being the driving \nforce of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski), a member of the House Committee on Armed \nServices.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2297, legislation that \nwill impose sanctions on international financial institutions that \nknowingly engage in business with Hezbollah.\n  Hezbollah is one of the world's largest, most dangerous, well-funded \nterrorist organizations. Trained, funded, and deployed as a proxy of \nthe Iranian Government, with operations spanning several continents, \nthe Shiite group has effectively taken over the Lebanese Government and \nhas launched thousands of rockets at Israeli civilians.\n  There is no question that Hezbollah is stronger than ever. They have \nmurdered Americans, Israelis, Syrians, and citizens of other nations. \nThey have amassed an arsenal of advanced weaponry, including 150,000 \nrockets and missiles; have made technological advances; and have gained \nbattlefield experience in Syria, all which have helped turn Hezbollah \ninto what could be Israel's most dangerous enemy in a generation.\n  The bill also requires that President Obama report to Congress on \nHezbollah's involvement in its drug business, money laundering, and \nother criminal activities--all of which are critical to funding its \nterrorism.\n  We cannot jeopardize our national security and continue to ignore the \nserious threat that Hezbollah poses to our country and to our allies, \nincluding Israel. While this bill is not a silver bullet, it is a huge \nstep in the right direction.\n  I thank the chairman and the committee for their work on this \nimportant measure.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. David Scott), who serves on the Financial Services \nCommittee, who was a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nwho has served as vice chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade. Congressman Scott is also a member of the \nNATO Parliamentary Assembly. He does such a fine job, and I want \neveryone to know he grew up in my district.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and \nreally appreciate that.\n  I, certainly, want to thank Chairman Royce for his very kind remarks \nthat he gave to me concerning our work.\n  Ladies and gentlemen of the House and ladies and gentlemen of \nAmerica, we have before us, perhaps, the most singular, significant \nbill and thing that we can do right now to send a bold, powerful \nmessage to the world that we are going to finally begin that really \nintricate process, with determination, to dismantle one of the single \nmost horrific terrorist groups on this Earth--Hezbollah.\n  Now, why do I say that?\n  I don't say that just to get up and say a few words. I have spent 12 \nyears on the NATO Parliamentary Assembly, and I have served as chairman \nof the Science, Space, and Technology Committee. For 3 hard years, we \ndid the research, and we wrote the report specifically on getting the \nreal truth out about Iran's nuclear weapons program. In the process of \ndoing that, we discovered the intricals, the tunnels and all of the \ndifferent things that gave support to Hezbollah by Iran. This is why \nthis is so important.\n  Let me just tell you that almost the single, solitary, main purpose \nfor Hezbollah is to destroy Israel. Make no mistake about it. Right \nnow, they have already got hundreds of missiles pointed toward Israel.\n  How can we do something right now to address this?\n  It is with this bill. You always follow the money, and the money \ntrails are so complex. You have corporations; you have dummy companies; \nyou also have individuals and third and fourth parties that our work \nfound out that Iran works through.\n  The language in this bill clearly points to and gives the President \nof the United States the authority. As a matter of fact, it is almost \nlike a very strong demand and request from us in the Congress. It is \nthe executive branch that has investigative power. The CIA, Special \nOps, and the entire military are at its disposal, including the FBI.\n  We are the single most powerful nation in the world, and it is about \ntime we stood up and showed the world that we are no longer going to \ntolerate Hezbollah and that we are no longer going to tolerate Iran's \nworking through these third parties to make the people of Israel suffer \nand live under the conditions under which they are living.\n  Let me get to the other crux of this matter.\n  It is as I said on CNN, in my commentary, that I was fighting very \nstrongly against--and I talked with the President--and fighting as to \nhow weak the position the Iranian agreement has put us in. Sure, they \nare going to get a nuclear weapon, probably within the next 9 years. \nThat worries us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. But the real Achilles' heel in this \nIranian agreement is where we simultaneously lift up the sanctions on \ntheir economy--and they are thriving now--and also unleash $150 billion \nright away--cash. At the same time, we know that, with this cash, \nalready both Russia and China have signed agreements to get the most \nsophisticated weapons there are.\n  This bill will help us because, in section 201, it very clearly \nstates that the President shall identify any country that is helping to \nfinance the terrorism coming out of Hezbollah. We will be able to track \nthis. We are sending a powerful message with this. Once Iran has this \ncash, there is no boundary as to what they can use it for. I guarantee \nyou, because Hezbollah is an arm--a very terroristic arm--of Iran, they \nwill channel money there, and that will help us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Finally, in my few minutes, ladies and \ngentlemen, we can't stop there, because Israel, as I said, is a target, \nand we have got to put forth a new memorandum of understanding. We need \nto do this, Members of the House, and we need to do it right away. The \nPresident and the executive branch need to go to work and start \nidentifying these people who are providing this support.\n  There is another step we have got to go through right away. We \nsupport Israel with a memorandum of understanding in the form of \nmilitary aid. Right now, it is at $3.1 billion annually; but, ladies \nand gentlemen, given the circumstances, we need to increase that to $5 \nbillion annually.\n  Now, why do I say that?\n  I hope that my previous remarks will give support to that. At no time \nhas Israel needed our help as they need it now. This was, in my humble \nopinion, a weak Iranian agreement. A lot was made out of it as to the \nUnited States and Israel. We need to send a powerful, strong message \nthat there is no light between the United States and Israel and that we \nare going to send $5 billion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. The other point is that our current \nappropriations for Israel end in 2017. I want to repeat that because I \ndon't think the people of America know the aid they will get. Where \nwould Israel be? It could have been blown away if they hadn't had the \nIron Dome; but it is because we had an understanding--a memorandum--and \nbecause we are giving them $3.1 billion.\n  With all of this upsurge of terrorism all around the world now--right \nhere in California just last week, in Paris, and all over--we may not \nthink we are\n\n[[Page H9346]]\n\ngoing to war, ladies and gentlemen, but war has been declared on the \nUnited States, on Israel, and on Europe. By George, it is time we \ndeclared war back on them. That is why we need to increase this \nmemorandum of understanding to that $5 billion mark for that year, and \nthat will send a powerful message as to how strong Israel and the \nUnited States' relationship is.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman.\n  First of all, let me thank our distinguished chairman for offering \nyet another important bill in the fight against terrorism, especially \nas it relates to Hezbollah. The Hezbollah International Financing \nPrevention Act of 2015, has been very adequately explained by both the \nchairman and the ranking member. I don't want to be redundant, but it \nis a very, very important bill that will make a difference.\n  Hezbollah, as we all know, is a terrorist organization and is a proxy \nof the Iranian regime, which directly threatens our close ally Israel \nas well as ourselves. This bill would help hobble Hezbollah's ability \nto finance its terrorist activities, and it is strongly deserving of \nthe support of every Member of this Chamber.\n  This bill sends a message to the administration. It seeks to mitigate \nat least some of the damage that has been unleashed by President \nObama's misguided policy towards Iran, and by an egregiously flawed \nnuclear arms deal that lifts sanctions that will free up billions of \ndollars for the regime in Tehran to finance anti-American and anti-\nIsrael terror groups, such as Hezbollah.\n  Let's not forget that Hezbollah is an organization that has attacked \nAmericans. It not only fires missiles unprovoked--like Hamas--into \nIsrael, but it finances all sorts of terror and bombings, including of \nU.S. Embassies. Many of the terrorists associated with Hezbollah were \ninvolved with the killing of the marines back in the early 1980s. One \nof those marines was Paul Innocenzi, from my district--from my \nhometown--who left behind his dear wife and children. She was left a \nwidow, as were many others, by that horrific act of terrorism.\n  I ask Members to support this bill. Again, I thank Chairman Royce for \nhis leadership. I will remind my colleagues that, I think, to date, the \nchairman has had about 35--three dozen--hearings on Iran and on issues \nrelated to Iran. Every aspect of our misguided policy has been focused \nupon, as have the ideas that seek, to mitigate the damage. This is one \nof those initiatives. Interdict the money flow, and you can help to \nstop some of the terrorism.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Colleagues, in closing, we all know too well that Iran is the world's \nleading state sponsor of terror and that its most destructive terrorist \ntool is Hezbollah. This group's nefarious activities are not limited to \nterrorism. They range from drug trafficking to other forms of illicit \nactivity. Hezbollah has transformed into one of the world's most \nsophisticated and complex and dangerous terror organizations.\n  H.R. 2297 is the adequate response to meet this challenge. On the \nterror financing front, this bill would move the ball forward by \nsanctioning foreign banks for knowingly doing business with Hezbollah. \nThe bill would also expose Hezbollah's television apparatus, as I \nmentioned before, Al-Manar, which is used for logistical, propaganda, \nand fundraising purposes.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Again, I want to commend Chairman Royce and commend all the other \npeople who worked so hard making this a reality. This will be signed \ninto law. This will go to the President's desk. I think we can all be \nproud, once again, of the bipartisan way in which the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee works.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would just remind our colleague that, yes, indeed, Hezbollah has \ncost the lives of 260 marines and other U.S. service personnel.\n  I would share with you that in 2006, during the second Lebanon war--\nduring the Hezbollah war, as I would call it--I was in Haifa. At that \ntime, I witnessed what were probably 4,000 to 5,000 rockets being fired \nover a period of time into Israel and saw firsthand the human cost of \nthis.\n  I mentioned the 260 marines that died in two attacks. Going down to \nthe trauma hospital and seeing firsthand the 600 victims of those \nHezbollah attacks, including the realization that Hezbollah had \ntunnelled underneath Israel's territory to bring fighters up within \nIsrael, you see the impact that Iran's encouragement, money, and \ntraining is having on these terrorist fighters, and you see the \nconsequence and the cost in terms of human lives lost.\n  Representative Eliot Engel and I, after the Gaza conflict, by the \nway, were in one of these tunnels that came up right outside of a \nschool. This one was coming from Hamas but, again, financed by Iran. \nThe engineering work for the tunnels in Lebanon underneath the border \nthere was, again, done by Iran.\n  You look at these rockets, whether they are the antiaircraft rockets \nor the antiship rockets and missiles or the ground-to-ground missiles, \nwhere do they get these rockets? They get them from Iran. When I was in \nHaifa, there were maybe 15,000 of those rockets. Today, as you know, \nthere are over 100,000.\n  Mr. Engel and I have held a number of hearings on this subject. But \nthose 100,000 rockets have a much longer range, again, thanks to Iran. \nHezbollah, in the meantime, is gaining in its position and strength \nmonetarily, both from the money it gets from Iran and from its \nclandestine activities in smuggling. We have an opportunity with this \nlegislation to cut off its international financing.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for their work because we have got to \nhave a strategy that cuts off their illicit activities and that holds \nother countries and banking systems accountable. We have got to go \nafter the vulnerabilities that Hezbollah has in terms of sustaining \nthis terror network. Let's cut off their cash and their support system \nwith this legislation. I urge passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand concur in the Senate amendments to the bill, H.R. 2297.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan \nF. Boyle) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to include \nany extraneous material for the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I begin by thanking Representative Darrell Issa, a senior member of \nthe Foreign Affairs Committee and the former chairman of the Committee \non Oversight and Government Reform, for authoring this very \nstraightforward piece of legislation.\n  When catastrophe strikes overseas, America's first responders deploy \nall over the world. They assist in some of the most difficult and \ndamaged environments that we could only imagine: the 2010 earthquake in \nHaiti, the 2014 flooding in Paraguay, earlier this year following the \nearthquake in Nepal. Rushing to the front lines of human need, leaving \ntheir own families, they represent the true face of American \ncompassion.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Issa) is at the cutting edge of \nthis issue, and his trips to visit these spots speak on an issue that \nhe knows of very well when he says that these brave men and women have \nsaved countless lives on this planet over the years. This bill that he \nhas written, the First Responders Passport Act, is an important \namendment to the Passport Act of 1920, allowing the Secretary of State \nto waive passport fees for those first responders who have volunteered \nto serve our country and volunteered to travel abroad to aid others in \ntheir time of greatest need.\n  Currently, the passport fee waiver can only be exercised for a very \nlimited group, largely comprised of officers or employees of the U.S. \ntraveling abroad on official duty. What this bill would do is to extend \nthat waiver to include first responders that are working under a \ncontract with the United States Government.\n  The U.S. Agency for International Development contracts with \napproximately 450 first responders every year. These first responders \nare required to maintain a valid passport in case of immediate \ndeployment, which can cost as much as $165 per passport for a first-\ntime applicant. These fees are not covered by the USAID contract or the \ncountry but, rather, are paid out of pocket by the individual.\n  These first responders are serving in support of our national \ninterests. They are putting their own lives at risk to provide \nimmediate medical response following a natural disaster like the '04 \nIndian Ocean earthquake, which unleashed devastating tsunamis on \nThailand, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka.\n  Many of the first responders that deploy abroad come from the search \nand rescue teams based in Los Angeles County, California, and Fairfax \nCounty, Virginia. Waiving the passport fee for those brave and selfless \nenough to help those in the greatest need is the least we can do. I \ncommend Congressman Issa for doing this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member \nEngel, my colleague and friend from California (Mr. Issa), and my \nfellow Foreign Affairs Committee colleagues for their unanimous support \nin helping our first responders answer the call to service when a \nnatural disaster strikes abroad.\n  Every year, Americans bravely go abroad to help victims of natural \ndisasters in foreign lands, such as the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, the \n2008 cyclone in Yemen, and 2015 Hurricane Patricia in Mexico, just to \nname a few.\n  Earlier this year, the world was shocked by the images of Nepal's 7.8 \nmagnitude earthquake that killed over 8,600 and injured over 16,800. \nThe United States was one of the largest donors to the relief and \nrebuilding effort in the wake of this catastrophe through charitable \ndonations, DOD donations, and search and rescue operations and efforts. \nThe United States' search and rescue teams searched for survivors \ntrapped in debris.\n  These first responders continuously put their lives on the line at \nhome and abroad. Mr. Speaker, this is an example of American \nleadership. Their bravery and efforts do not go unnoticed. We should \nall do what we can to make their endeavors easier.\n  Unfortunately, American contractors and volunteers, despite being \ncoordinated by USAID, are subject to passport fees at their own expense \nwhen attempting to travel abroad in response to these disasters. To \nalleviate this obstacle, H.R. 3750, the First Responders Passport Act, \nwould allow the Secretary of State to grant their passports free of \ncharge.\n  I am proud to have introduced this commonsense bill with the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Issa) because contractors and volunteers \ndeserve the same treatment as government employees when they are being \nsent abroad to offer their service on behalf of our Nation.\n  Cultural diplomacy, like the services these brave men and women \nprovide in the face of international disasters, is critical to our \ninternational image and international relations. I ask that my \ncolleagues support this bipartisan, commonsense legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Issa), a senior member of the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and the author of this bill.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member \nEngel for bringing this, in a timely fashion, to the floor. I want to \nthank my partner in this legislation, Mr. Boyle of Pennsylvania.\n  Now, Congress often does things and makes a lot of to-do about it. I \ndon't want to overstate this simple technical correction, but I don't \nwant to understate it either. The fact is America is proud of people \nwho volunteer or choose, in the worst possible conditions, to go in \nharm's way, to go in devastation's way.\n  It is a small thing, but very meaningful, to say that, one, they \nwon't have to pay for their passport out of their own pocket, and, two, \nalthough normally the contracts for these first responders come out of \nLos Angeles and Fairfax County, should there be a major disaster again \nthat is beyond these first responders' capability, the law will allow \nfor anyone authorized by the United States Government to go and help in \nthese areas to be granted, as necessary, a passport, including \nexpediting fees, in order to get to the devastation quickly and with a \nminimum of bureaucracy involved.\n  America knows about Haiti, Nepal, Japan, and so many other devastated \nareas over the last few years. Until today, America never took the time \nto simply say in this small way thank you to our first responders: \nThank you for what you do. We certainly appreciate it enough for it to \ncome out of the taxpayers' pocket to make sure it doesn't have to come \nout of your own pocket when you are going, on behalf of the American \npeople, to help those in need around the world.\n  Again, I thank the chairman for his leadership in bringing this in a \ntimely fashion. I urge support.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself \nsuch time as I may consume for the purpose of closing.\n  I would just say, briefly, that we are reminded each and every day \nthat\n\n[[Page H9348]]\n\nAmerican leadership abroad is needed now more than ever. Yes, this has \na military component, it has an international relations and diplomacy \ncomponent, and it also has this soft power component.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a part of the soft power of the United States, \nharnessing the idealism and volunteerism of our people to do good for \nothers around the world when they are most in need. This is a rather \nsimple step that we can take to help those who are helping others. I am \nproud to support it, and I ask that all Members support our \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to recognize the work of Representative Issa and also \nRepresentative Brendan F. Boyle of Pennsylvania. I think that this \nbill, this First Responders Passport Act, is going to be an important \nchange in the law in terms of encouraging people to be first \nresponders.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  By extending a courtesy that we currently grant to employees of the \ngovernment, we here have an opportunity to get first responders who \nhave that expertise, those volunteers who travel the greatest distances \nto work in the harshest of conditions and to help those in greatest \nneed. This, to me, I think is a great concept.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill so that we can take care of \nthose who take care of others, our first responders.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 3750, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of the Global Health Innovation Act introduced by \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires).\n  I would just point out that, over the past two decades, we have made \nunprecedented progress in addressing some of the most difficult global \nhealth challenges of our time. Global rates of child mortality have \ndropped by 53 percent. Malaria deaths are down by 47 percent. Maternal \nmortality has been reduced by 44 percent. The eradication of polio is \nwithin reach.\n  Yet, despite these successes, we have a long way to go. The Ebola \noutbreak in West Africa should serve as a stark reminder of the global \nthreat of infectious disease. Though child and maternal mortality rates \nhave been drastically reduced, there are still 5.9 million children \nunder the age of 5 who died from preventable causes in 2015. There were \n830 mothers who died from preventable causes every day. I have been to \nAfrica and have often seen the disastrous effects of these diseases.\n  USAID's Global Development Lab and Center for Accelerating Innovation \nand Impact is working to address these global health challenges by \nbringing together science, technology, innovation to develop low-cost, \nhigh-impact health technologies.\n  This legislation, written by Mr. Sires, before us today seeks to \nsupport these efforts while bettering congressional oversight. It \ndirects the administrator of USAID to submit to Congress five annual \nreports on the development and use of global health innovations in its \nprograms, particularly those relating to HIV/AIDS, to maternal and \nchild health and to combating infectious diseases.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Sires), the \nranking member of the Subcommittee on the Western Hemisphere, for \nbringing this forward in a timely manner.\n  I urge Members to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SIRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nrise in support of this measure.\n  I want to start by thanking Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel \nfor their work on global health and their efforts to bring this bill to \nthe floor.\n  I would also like to thank the many Members who have cosponsored this \nbill, especially Congressman Mario Diaz-Balart, who has gracefully \nacted as the Republican lead.\n  Additionally, I would like to thank the staffers who worked \ndiligently to bring H.R. 2241 to the floor for a vote.\n  Infectious diseases and other health conditions still claim the lives \nof nearly 9 million people each year. Emerging health threats, such as \ndrug resistance, pose a serious threat to human health across the \nglobe.\n  New vaccines, drugs, tests, and other health tools are desperately \nneeded. Progress cannot be made without a sustained investment in \nresearch and development.\n  U.S. investments in global health research are central components of \nU.S.\n\n[[Page H9349]]\n\nforeign policy to increase national security, strengthen U.S. relations \naround the world, and reduce infectious diseases.\n  The U.S. has a legacy of leadership in global health research through \nagencies like USAID. That is why I was proud to introduce H.R. 2241, \nthe Global Health Innovation Act. This will provide the oversight \nneeded to gain a clearer picture of USAID's global health research and \ndevelopment.\n  Over the years, research and development projects have greatly \nexpanded at the USAID, searching for advancements toward an HIV- and \nAIDS-free generation and preventable maternal and childhood deaths, and \npreventable infectious diseases.\n  This legislation is an effort to keep up with the scope of USAID's \nexpanded efforts and ensure their research and development activities \nreflect their goals and priorities. This report asks them to provide \nclarity on their goals and metrics to better understand their work.\n  H.R. 2241 directs the USAID administrator to report annually to \nCongress on the development and use of global health innovations in \nUSAID programs, projects, and activities. The report must also include \nhow the Agency measures progress, investments, and developments toward \ntheir health-related goals.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in support of H.R. 2241 to allow \nCongress to exercise its oversight powers and ensure USAID's research \nand development efforts reflect their priorities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel once \nagain. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2241.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, the Global Health Innovation Act will enable \nCongress to conduct more effective oversight of USAID's effort to \ndevelop and expand access to low-cost, high-impact health technologies.\n  I support this bill, and I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2241, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I object to the vote on the ground that a \nquorum is not present and make the point of order that a quorum is not \npresent.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n  The point of no quorum is considered withdrawn.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9349-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9349-H9352]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         TRACKING FOREIGN FIGHTERS IN TERRORIST SAFE HAVENS ACT\n\n  Mr. LoBIONDO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. LoBiondo) and the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill, H.R. 4239.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, terrorism remains one of the greatest threats facing our \nNation today. As a member of both the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence and the Committee on Armed Services, I have seen how the \nbrave men and women of our Nation's Armed Forces and the intelligence \nservices battle this threat on a daily basis.\n  But the recent terrorist attack in San Bernardino has highlighted \nthat this is not just a threat to be faced by our servicemen and -\nwomen. We face this threat here at home, in our communities, from \nindividuals who have been radicalized abroad and entered our country \nwith the intent to do us harm.\n  We must focus our intelligence efforts and bring them to bear \ndirectly on the problem of individuals radicalizing abroad and \ntraveling to commit terrorist acts here at home. We must ensure that \nthis important information gets into the hands of our Nation's \nrepresentatives here in the United States Congress.\n  The bill we are debating today will do just that. The Tracking \nForeign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act requires the intelligence \ncommunity to report to Congress three important categories of \ninformation:\n  The total number of foreign fighters who have traveled to terrorist \nsafe havens, including their country of origin;\n  The number of U.S. citizens present in terrorist safe havens; and\n  The total number of foreign fighters who have left terrorist safe \nhavens or whose whereabouts are unknown.\n  This information is crucial to policymakers. It will help Members \nunderstand the size and scope of the threats we face, the potential \nrisk of terrorism at home, and how terrorist safe havens can undermine \nour national security.\n  By ensuring that this information goes to a wide range of \ncongressional committees, the bill ensures that relevant committees of \nCongress can begin to address this growing threat.\n  This legislation is also bipartisan. I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Swalwell) for cosponsoring this legislation.\n  I want to also thank Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff and my \ncolleagues on Homeland Security, Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member \nThompson.\n  Before closing, I want to take a moment to thank the men and women of\n\n[[Page H9350]]\n\nthis country who serve our intelligence community and our Armed Forces. \nI am honored to know so many of them in the course of my oversight work \nand to see their diligent efforts in helping to keep our Nation safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  First, let me express my thanks to Mr. LoBiondo, my colleague on the \nPermanent Select Committee on Intelligence and the chairman of its CIA \nSubcommittee.\n  I serve as the subcommittee's ranking member. I appreciate the \nbipartisan way that the chairman of the whole committee and our ranking \nmember, Mr. Schiff, as well as the way that Mr. LoBiondo and I have \napproached this critical issue of foreign fighter flow.\n  ISIS is one of the greatest threats facing the United States today. \nDefeating ISIS means that the United States and its allies must be more \ncoordinated in our efforts to scrub ISIS from this Earth and to protect \nAmericans at home than ISIS is in attacking us. This will require a \nmultifaceted approach, involving both foreign policy and the way that \nour intelligence community tracks ISIS here at home.\n  The threat posed by foreign fighters who travel to and from a foreign \nzone or a terrorist safe haven and then return to wreak havoc in the \nWest is both real and persistent.\n  The challenge is that, when these foreign fighters go to these \ncountries, if they are not killed on the battlefield, oftentimes they \nlearn even better training and are able to return either to Western \nEurope or other parts of the world or even the United States with \nimproved training and an increased hatred for innocent people. That \nleaves us very vulnerable.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  To help confront this threat, the Tracking Foreign Fighters in \nTerrorist Safe Havens Act builds on important provisions in the 2016 \nIntelligence Authorization Act which require a report on foreign \nfighter flows into and out of Syria and Iraq. This would expand the \nscope of that report.\n  This bill broadens this requirement by calling on the Director of \nNational Intelligence to report regularly on foreign fighter travel to \nand from any foreign safe haven or terrorist safe haven. If we do not \nknow who is going to fight in these hot zones, we will have an \nincomplete picture of our own vulnerabilities.\n  And, these reports have to be specific. They must include, for \nexample, the foreign fighters' countries of origin, the number of \nforeign fighters who have traveled to or departed each safe haven, and \nthe number of those whose whereabouts remain unknown.\n  Importantly, to the extent a report is submitted in a classified \nform, it must also include an unclassified summary of the report's \ncontents. I appreciate the chairman agreeing to my request to include \nthis unclassified requirement.\n  Increased transparency and public awareness is very important in the \nfight against terrorism. These broad, comprehensive reports will allow \nus to better understand the foreign fighter threat and, in turn, help \nall of us better protect our national security.\n  Let me again thank Mr. LoBiondo. I urge my colleagues to vote in \nsupport of the Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. McSally).\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4239, the \nTracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act. This \nlegislation fulfills a recommendation of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity's Task Force on Combating Terrorist and Foreign Fighter \nTravel, of which I was proud to be a member. In fact, our chairman, Mr. \nKatko, and another member, Mr. Hurd, are with us today to speak on this \nimportant legislation.\n  Our bipartisan task force investigated America's security \nvulnerabilities for 6 months. We produced a final report in September \nthat made 32 key findings and over 50 recommendations to make Americans \nsafer. Today's bill, which I cosponsored, is the direct result of one \nof these recommendations.\n  We know that ISIS is adept at propaganda and has used social media \nextensively to attract fighters to their cause. At least 30,000 people \nfrom 100 different countries have traveled to Iraq and Syria, including \n250 Americans. But their calls to action now extend past Syria and \nIraq. In fact, our Task Force found ISIS now has a direct presence, \naffiliates, or groups pledging support in at least 19 countries.\n  In my 26 years in uniform, including six deployments to the Middle \nEast and Afghanistan and a final assignment at U.S. Africa Command, we \nwatched foreign fighters flow to safe havens in Africa and the Middle \nEast to get training and join the Islamic extremist fight. ISIS has \naccelerated this dangerous dynamic and is expanding, despite the \nPresident declaring otherwise. So our efforts to track these fighters \nshould not be limited to Iraq and Syria. That is why our Task Force \nrecommended that the intelligence community regularly track and update \nCongress on foreign fighter flows to all terrorist sanctuaries, which \nis what this bill requires.\n  The administration's response to ISIS can only be described as \nanemic. We must take decisive action to defeat the ISIS threat and \nprotect Americans.\n  I am pleased that, in the last month, the House has taken action on \nseveral of our Task Force's recommendations. It is obvious that more \nwork remains. And if the President won't act, the House will.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting H.R. 4239.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Tracking Foreign Fighters in \nTerrorist Safe Havens Act, and I want to thank Chairman LoBiondo, \nRepresentative Swalwell, and the full committee chairman, Mr. Nunes, \nfor their leadership on this issue.\n  This bill will help inform Congress and the public on one of the most \npressing counterterrorism challenges we face today: the flow of foreign \nfighters from the West to and from Syria, Iraq, and other terrorist \nsafe havens.\n  The Paris attacks brought home the dangers posed by citizens of \nWestern nations who can move easily between countries, traveling to \nSyria and Iraq to fight with ISIS, and who may then return home to \ncommit horrific acts of terror and violence in their own countries.\n  Tracking foreign fighters is a constant concern of the intelligence \ncommunity and an issue on which we receive continual briefings. I \nbelieve these new reporting requirements will help keep Congress and \nthe Nation more fully informed about this very serious threat to our \nnational security.\n  Of course, tracking foreign fighters is not enough. We have to \nredouble our efforts to staunch the flow of foreign fighters to and \nfrom Syria and Iraq. In addition to intelligence coordination, this \nrequires a serious, substantial, and new commitment from Turkey, whose \nborder with Syria has proven to be a conduit for a large number of \nfighters, as well as oil, money, and arms entering and leaving Syria.\n  From the Mara line to the Euphrates, there is a 60-mile stretch along \nthe Turkish-Syrian border through which much of the illegal trafficking \nin fighters and goods flow to ISIS. Turkey must close that border to \nISIS. It has the power to do so, but does it have the will? Thus far, \nthe answer has been, tragically, no, and this must change.\n  Turkey must stop the flow of foreign fighters from crossing into \nSyria to join the fight. Where the Turks have been unable or unwilling \nto stop that flow, Kurdish forces have stepped up and demonstrated much \ngreater success. I believe that if the Turks are unwilling to do more \nto shut down the flow of foreign fighters and resources that cross that \nborder, we should increase our assistance to the Kurds, who have proven \nthemselves far and away the most effective anti-ISIS fighting force in \nthe region.\n  Once again, I thank the chairman and Representative Swalwell for \ntheir leadership on this issue. I hope that, in addition to these \nreports, we will also hear from the intelligence community\n\n[[Page H9351]]\n\nabout actions that Turkey takes to close down this critical 60-mile \nstretch of border between the Mara line and the Euphrates.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Hurd).\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, threat equals capabilities plus \nintent.\n  ISIS has demonstrated that it has both the capabilities and the \nintent to attack the homeland. ISIS has expanded far beyond Iraq and \nSyria. It has affiliates that have carried out deadly attacks in Egypt, \nLibya, Afghanistan, Yemen, Saudi Arabia, Tunisia, and France.\n  Groups and individuals have pledged their support to ISIS in numerous \nother places, including the Philippines, the Palestinian territories, \nNigeria, and Sudan. Tracking foreign fighters who travel to Iraq and \nSyria alone is not enough to mitigate the threat they pose to our \nnational security. Terrorist safe havens around the globe are potential \npetri dishes for bad guys aiming to do bad things to the U.S.\n\n  ISIS has explicitly encouraged fighters who cannot make it to Iraq \nand Syria to join their struggle in other locations. It is imperative \nthat our intelligence and defense efforts aim at tracking and stemming \nthe flow of fighters to and from all terrorist safe havens, even those \noutside of Iraq and Syria.\n  I was an undercover officer in the CIA, and I understand how \nimportant it is to track threat indicators early. We cannot wait until \none of these foreign fighters in a terrorist safe haven attempts an \nattack. We must preempt rather than react. This legislation supports \nour intelligence community's efforts to do just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from \nTexas for his service in the intelligence community, and I appreciate \nthe bipartisan nature of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. \nSewell).\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of our \nNation's security and in our ongoing fight against terrorists and \nextremism around the world. As a Member who serves on the Intelligence \nCommittee, the safety and security of the American people is my top \npriority.\n  H.R. 4239, the Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens \nAct, requires the intelligence community to report on foreign fighter \nflows to and from terrorist safe havens abroad.\n  The recent horrific terrorist attacks that occurred in Paris, Beirut, \nand here at home in San Bernardino, California, not only shake our very \nconscience, but also cause us to evaluate our own security measures and \nintelligence protocols.\n  This bill expands on the approach to tracking foreign fighters \noutlined in the Intelligence Authorization Act, and requires the DNI to \nproduce an additional written report on foreign fighter flows to and \nfrom terrorist safe havens abroad every 180 days. Each report would \ninclude invaluable details, such as countries of origin, the numbers of \nU.S. citizen foreign fighters, and the numbers of foreign fighters \nwhose whereabouts are unknown to us.\n  The threat of extremists returning to the United States from the \nbattlefields in Iraq and Syria are serious, and we must do what we can \nto prevent it. I am convinced that a more vigilant and robust foreign \nfighter tracking and reporting process is critically important to \nfighting terrorism and combating ISIS abroad, as well as extremism here \nat home.\n  We must evaluate our national counterterrorism strategy and policies \ncontinuously to ensure that we are doing everything within our power to \nprotect the American people and to defeat and destroy ISIS and all \nterrorists that seek to do us harm.\n  I want to congratulate the chairman and my colleague, Mr. Swalwell, \nfor their leadership on this effort, and I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Katko).\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentleman from New \nJersey for introducing this bill, and I rise today in support of it.\n  The tragic events in San Bernardino have brought ISIS violence to our \nshores. Attacks like this are aimed at undermining our democratic way \nof life and sowing fear among the citizens of our Nation. This threat \nmust be defeated, plain and simple. To defeat it, we need to respond in \nan intelligent manner that deals with the vulnerabilities and protects \nthe constitutional liberties that we hold dear.\n  The measure before us today strengthens our hand against terrorism, \nand I hope the House will join today in a strong, bipartisan manner to \nsupport this bill.\n  I had the privilege of chairing the bipartisan Task Force on \nCombating Terrorism and Foreign Fighter Travel. Over 6 months, we \ninvestigated security gaps at home and abroad to determine the best \nways to make America safe. We heard from stakeholders here in the \nUnited States, Europe, and the Middle East, about the unique challenges \nthey face every day in combating terrorism.\n  Out of this Task Force, we came up with 32 findings and over 50 \nrecommendations that will make our country and our allies safer, if \nadopted. This bill, Mr. Speaker, contains one of those recommendations, \nthat our intelligence community should report regularly on the flow of \nforeign fighters to terrorist safe havens.\n  The bill takes action to stop ISIS' practice of encouraging fighters \nto go to what it calls provinces in places like Libya to carry out acts \nof terrorism by improving the sharing of information on the flow of \nthese foreign fighters between nations.\n  Understanding where the enemy's safe havens are and tracking and \nanalyzing foreign fighter flows will better allow our intelligence \nagencies and the Department of Defense to strike effectively and deadly \nand give us a better picture of the ISIS threat.\n  As we leave to celebrate the holidays with our families, let's leave \nhaving taken action on this commonsense bill that will make every \nAmerican safer.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Carson).\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this \nlegislation, which I believe is critical to our national security and \nthat of our allies.\n  Public estimates indicate that over 30,000 foreign fighters, \nincluding some from the United States, have traveled to Iraq and Syria.\n  Over the last few years, Mr. Speaker, Americans watched as three \nteenage girls from Denver were arrested on their way to Syria. Ten \nyoung men from Minnesota were arrested--including the ringleader just \nlast week--for a similar attempt.\n  These young men and women, Mr. Speaker, and many others who make it \nto Syria, intend to carry out terrible atrocities against innocent \npeople. Even more concerning, we know that some people hope to return \nand bring their fight to American soil.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  As a member of the House Intelligence Committee, I have confidence \nthat the men and women in our intelligence community have the resources \nand expertise to keep us safe.\n  Every day, they are tracking foreign fighters around the world, \ncoordinating with our allies, and shutting down threats before they \nbecome a reality. We need to better understand this threat to create a \nwhole-of-government response.\n  Mr. Speaker, this information will help us conduct outreach into \naffected communities here at home so we can show parents what their \nkids are doing online and how to protect them from radicalization.\n  Mr. Speaker, it will help us expand our support and coordination with \nour allies, including Turkey and Iraq, to show them what they can do, \nwhat we can do, and combine our efforts to stop these fighters.\n  These reports, mandated in this legislation, will show where \nterrorists are coming from and where they train. It will help us assess \nwhen they may be returning home and what precautions we need to put in \nplace. In light of the attacks in San Bernardino and Paris, this is \nabsolutely critical.\n  I encourage support from my colleagues.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the\n\n[[Page H9352]]\n\ngentleman from Texas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank Chairman LoBiondo for \nhis hard work on this legislation. And I want to thank the House \nIntelligence Committee for working closely with my committee to get \nthis important legislation done. I can think of no more timely piece of \nlegislation. I want to thank Ranking Member Swalwell from California \nfor his hard work on this as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill. Hundreds of our people \nhave been radicalized, lured to the jihadist safe haven in Syria. They \nhave been joined by thousands of Westerners, forming a terrorist army \nunlike anything we have ever seen.\n  These foreign fighters represent a triple threat: They strengthen \ngroups like ISIS on the ground; they radicalize others back home; and, \nworst of all, they may be sent back to conduct terrorist attacks \nagainst us in the homeland.\n  We saw this in the streets of Paris, where battle-hardened extremists \nreturned from Syria prepared to kill. And here at home, we have \narrested so-called returnees from Syria, including one individual \nplotting a terrorist attack in Ohio.\n  Earlier this year, I launched a bipartisan congressional Task Force \non Combating Terrorists and Foreign Fighter Travel. One of their \nfindings was that we must do more to track ``the great jihadi \nmigration'' around the world.\n  Our intelligence about foreign fighters in Syria is improving, but as \nwe have seen, the threat can change almost overnight. ISIS is already \nurging its followers to go to its other sanctuaries in places like \nAfghanistan and Libya.\n  We need to stay a step ahead of this threat, which is why this \nlegislation requires the intelligence community to track extremist \ntravel patterns and to report on a regular basis to Congress. It also \nrequires agencies to monitor the number of U.S. citizens in terror \nhotspots and to report on how many individuals have departed those \nlocations.\n  This is the kind of early-warning intelligence we need in order to \ncreate a ``firebreak'' to slow the spread of Islamist terror, and to \nkeep Americans from being lured to new jihadist safe havens.\n  I would like to commend the task force for their hard work on this, \nincluding Mr. Katko.\n  And let me just say this. I get regular threat briefings, and I have \nnever seen a higher threat environment than we have seen since 9/11, \nand it is from the flow of foreign fighters.\n  We have 5,000 of them that have Western passports, 30,000 foreign \nfighters from 100 different countries; 250 Americans have left to join \nthe fight, and, Mr. Speaker, that is just who we know about.\n  Now we know they are communicating in dark space. As the Director of \nthe FBI says, they have one simple message: Come to fight in Syria or \nkill where you are. Unfortunately, we have seen them too often come to \nfight in Syria and, unfortunately, just recently, too many that have \ncome to kill here in the United States.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Quigley).\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, in these trying times, Congress needs to \nprovide leadership and answer the question: What really keeps Americans \nsafe?\n  ISIS has directed U.S. and Western passport holders to launch attacks \nat home and abroad, and this threat requires our vigilance. But it is \nfoolish to think we can effectively combat this terrorism blindly. \nCongress needs an accurate estimation of the number of foreign fighters \nwho have traveled to terrorist havens like Syria. We need to know how \nmany U.S. citizens are currently there, and we need to know the \nwhereabouts of those who have left.\n  Given that many of the terrorist attackers were European nationals, \nthe need for this intelligence is crucial in the fight against ISIS and \nthose who wish to harm the U.S.\n  The Tracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act provides \nfor a more clear understanding of the real threats to U.S. security and \nallows Congress to work in partnership with our national security \nagencies to defend against these threats. I am happy to support this \ncommonsense step to keep Americans safe.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this \nside, so I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for working in a \nbipartisan way to address one of the greatest threats that the United \nStates, our allies, and people in the Middle East face today, and that \nis ISIS. ISIS is a brutal, growing force, growing in its influence and \nability to carry out successful terrorist attacks, but also growing in \nits ability to inspire others to take up attacks on their own.\n  ISIS has been so successful these days that they don't even have to \norder attacks here in America. Their success has inspired others to \ntake up their own attacks. Until we are as coordinated as they are, \nthey will continue to be successful. We saw, in Paris, that a number of \nthe attackers were people who had traveled from Western Europe to Syria \nand then returned to carry out the horrific attacks we saw back in \nNovember.\n  But we can defeat ISIS. We have defeated evil as a country before, \nand this country works best when its leaders work to protect the \nAmerican people in a bipartisan way, as we are seeing today.\n  There is no silver bullet we can fire to stop ISIS. Instead, ISIS' \ndefeat will come at the hands of American leadership--American \nleadership in stitching together a coalition of countries willing and \nable to defeat ISIS--but also American leadership and its own \nintelligence community to protect us here at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me close by reiterating my strong support for the \nTracking Foreign Fighters in Terrorist Safe Havens Act. The information \nthat this will provide is an important step regarding foreign fighter \ntraining, and it will be of great importance as we continue to fight \nterrorism at home and abroad and secure our homeland.\n\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Once again, I join in thanking my colleague from California (Mr. \nSwalwell). I think the approach we have had to this is exactly what we \nneed in combating terrorism.\n  It is hard to imagine, even just a few years ago, that we would be \nfacing this threat that we face today and this threat of terrorism that \nwe have seen, this barbaric face in Paris and in San Bernardino, the \nfact that the enemy is evolving in so many different ways, and the fact \nthat we have to be right 100 percent of the time and that they have so \nmany different avenues that they can pursue.\n  This piece of legislation is another piece to the puzzle which will \nhelp our country and our agencies be able to figure things out. Our \nintelligence community works tirelessly with law enforcement to be able \nto figure out what the next challenge is.\n  I hope the people of America understand the expertise and \nprofessionalism that the intelligence community and law enforcement \nbring to the table to keep our country safe. I hope my colleagues \nunderstand how important this legislation is and everyone votes ``yes'' \nto support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Tipton). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. LoBiondo) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 4239, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9352-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9352-H9355]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSTRENGTHENING CYBERSECURITY INFORMATION SHARING AND COORDINATION IN OUR \n                           PORTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller) and the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nTorres) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Michigan.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3878, and I urge its passage.\n  Since the terrorist attacks of 9/11, the U.S. Congress has \nappropriated $2.4 billion in port security grant funds to protect port \nfacilities against potential terror attacks. As a nation, we have done \na fairly good job of updating the physical security at ports, but the \nU.S. Government has been very slow to ensure that our ports are secure \nfrom cyber vulnerabilities.\n  For example, cybersecurity of our Nation's critical infrastructure \nhas been on the Government Accountability Office's High Risk List since \n2003, yet we have not fully engaged on cybersecurity efforts at the \nNation's 360 seaports.\n  The threat of a cyber attack is real, and, when addressing the \nprotection of maritime critical infrastructure, we must clearly define \nthe roles and responsibilities for ensuring our Nation's ports are \nprotected.\n  Under the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002, the Coast \nGuard is identified as the government agency responsible for ensuring \nthe physical security at our Nation's port infrastructure. This bill \nmakes it clear that the Coast Guard is also the primary agency \nresponsible for ensuring the maritime sector is prepared to prevent and \nto respond to cybersecurity risk and vulnerability.\n  More than $1 trillion of goods--from cars, to oil, to corn, and \neverything in between--move through our Nation's seaports each and \nevery year. Like many industries in America, port facilities and ship \noperators are increasingly moving cargo through our ports using \nautomated industrial control systems.\n  While this automation certainly has a lot of benefits, such as \nreducing the time that it takes to stock our shelves and lowering the \ncost of doing business, it doesn't come without risks. These computer \nsystems are controlling machinery at port facilities to move containers \nand fill tanks and onload and offload ships.\n  Terror groups, nation-states, criminal organizations, hackers, and \neven disgruntled employees could breach these systems, with potentially \ncatastrophic results to the Nation's security and economy.\n  Breaches in the maritime domain are particularly concerning, not only \nfrom an economic standpoint, but because the dangerous cargos, such as \nliquefied natural gas and other dangerous cargos, that also pass \nthrough our Nation's seaports are at risk.\n  Just as we have hardened physical security at our Nation's ports, we \nneed to do the same in virtual space to protect the systems critical to \nthe maritime transportation system against malicious actors. This bill \ndoes just that, and it requires the Coast Guard to develop a \ncomprehensive cyber risk assessment specific to the vulnerabilities of \nthe maritime industry. It directs the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nencourage participation with information sharing to better streamline \ncoordination at the national level.\n  H.R. 3878 is a bipartisan piece of legislation, introduced by my \ncolleague from California (Mrs. Torres), and I give her great credit \nfor this piece of legislation, working with so many Members on this. It \nactually is the result of a hearing held by the Homeland Security \nSubcommittee that I chaired back in October on the subject of \ncybersecurity at our Nation's ports.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  The bill clarifies the Department of Homeland Security's role in \nmaritime cybersecurity as well as it ensures that port facilities work \nwith the Coast Guard to identify cyber risks and vulnerabilities and \nshare best practices across the industry. This is the first step, Mr. \nSpeaker, in protecting our ports from cyber threats, and I certainly \nurge my colleagues to join this commonsense, bipartisan legislation.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentlewoman from California for her work \non this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3878, the Strengthening \nCybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced H.R. 3878, the Strengthening Cybersecurity \nInformation Sharing and Coordination in\n\n[[Page H9354]]\n\nOur Ports Act, to ensure the Department of Homeland Security takes a \nmore proactive approach to address cybersecurity risks at our Nation's \nports and to improve cybersecurity information sharing and coordination \nbetween public and private partners at maritime facilities.\n  The United States has approximately 360 commercial sea and river \nports which use cyber technology to move over $1 trillion worth of \ncargo each year. The Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach and other \nports in California account for almost 40 percent of the cargo entering \nthis country, and nearly 30 percent of the country's exports leave \nthrough California ports.\n  The Port of Los Angeles is the number one port by container volume \nand cargo value in the United States, seeing around $1.2 billion worth \nof cargo each day. Each year, the Port of Long Beach handles more than \n6.8 million 20-foot container units in cargo value at $180 billion and \nis the second busiest port in the U.S. With so much economic activity \nhappening at our Nation's ports, protecting the cyber networks they \nrely on is critical to our local and national economy.\n  This past October, the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security \non which I serve held a hearing focused on the threat of cyber attacks \nat a port and how the Coast Guard is working with private and public \npartners to protect maritime critical infrastructure against such \nattacks. This is of particular interest to me because many of the goods \nthat enter through the Ports of Long Beach and Los Angeles come \ndirectly to my district where the goods are redistributed throughout \nthe Nation. The hearing was called in response to a June 2014 GAO \nreport recommending the Department of Homeland Security take action to \nstrengthen cybersecurity at our Nation's ports.\n  Mr. Speaker, the report found that maritime Sector Coordinating \nCouncils are no longer active. These councils include port owners, \noperators, and related private industry associations. This means that \ntoday there is no one entity that coordinates information sharing \nbetween the ports, the private sector, and government stakeholders.\n  At the October subcommittee hearing, we received testimony that \ninformation sharing on cyber risks at ports should be stronger and that \nsome ports lack the resources to prevent, identify, and respond to \ncyber attacks. To address these challenges, I introduced H.R. 3878, \nwhich will require the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \nCommandant of the U.S. Coast Guard to take several steps to enhance \ncybersecurity at our ports.\n  Specifically, it requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nestablish guidelines for reporting cybersecurity risks, to develop and \nimplement a maritime cybersecurity risk model, and to make \nrecommendations on enhancing the sharing of cyber information. It also \nrequires the Coast Guard to direct Area Maritime Security Committees to \naddress cybersecurity risks. These measures will create an environment \nwhere DHS, the Coast Guard, ports, and stakeholders work together to \nenhance cybersecurity at our Nation's ports.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and Subcommittee \nChairwoman Miller for their cooperation and the bipartisan nature of \nthe staff discussions on this bill. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues \nto support H.R. 3878.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the distinguished gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3878, the \nStrengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our \nPorts Act of 2015.\n  This bill by my friend Representative Torres contains an amendment I \noffered at committee, which makes an important change to the Maritime \nTransportation Security Act of 2002.\n  More than $1.3 trillion worth of cargo travels through U.S. ports \neach year, making them a truly critical part of our Nation's \ninfrastructure. Any disruption or slowdown of activity could have a \ntremendous impact on the entire economy, costing billions of dollars \nevery day.\n  Ensuring the security of our maritime infrastructure is a complex \ntask and one that falls primarily on the United States Coast Guard. \nHowever, while the Coast Guard has the history and the expertise to \nprovide physical security, its mission of ensuring that our maritime \ninfrastructure is safe from cyber threats is still evolving.\n  Currently, the Maritime Transportation Security Act of 2002 requires \nvessels and port facilities to conduct vulnerability assessments and \ndevelop security plans for physical security, access controls, \nprocedural security measures, and communication systems. My amendment \nin committee added cybersecurity to that list. This addition will make \nit crystal clear that the Coast Guard has the specific authority to \nrequire maritime vessels and facilities to incorporate cybersecurity \ninto their assessments and plans.\n  The need for this change and the underlying legislation was \nhighlighted during a hearing before the Border and Maritime Security \nSubcommittee on the topic of cybersecurity at our Nation's ports. In \nthat hearing, we heard how a range of actors--from narcotics \ntraffickers to terrorist organizations, and even nation-states--could \nexploit cyber vulnerabilities at our ports for the purpose of smuggling \nillicit materials or causing severe economic disruption. Mr. Speaker, \nthis legislation will ensure that we are better prepared to respond to \nthe growing cyber threat to our Nation's maritime infrastructure.\n  I thank Representative Torres for offering this legislation and for \naccepting my amendment at committee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Lowenthal).\n  (Mr. LOWENTHAL asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3878, the Strengthening \nCybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act of \n2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, in southern California, I represent the Port of Long \nBeach, which is one of the busiest seaports in the country, is set to \nhandle more than 7 million containers this year, and accounts for \nnearly 20 percent of all the loaded containers moving throughout our \nNation. It is a critical link for trade between our country and Asia \nand is a linchpin for our national security and our national economy. \nIn other words, the security of the Port of Long Beach is not to be \ntreated lightly.\n\n  I am not a stranger to the critical nature of the port, but we are \nnow learning about emerging port-specific cyber threats. This body \nrecently took the first steps to fight off the growing threats to our \nNation's cybersecurity with a number of bills and hearings on this \ntopic. I am glad that out of those hearings, our attention now turns to \nthe cybersecurity of our critical infrastructure, including the \nhundreds of cargo ports in this country.\n  As a result of H.R. 3878, we would see working groups forming at our \nports and coming together to address port-specific cybersecurity \nvulnerabilities. These findings would be shared with appropriate \nstakeholders, including Federal and local governments, port \nauthorities, terminal operators, as well as law enforcement, in an \neffort to enhance cybersecurity situational awareness at the ports.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am confident that these working groups will continue \nto find innovative solutions in response to this emerging threat. \nWithin the working groups, I hope that they will codify key definitions \nand classification mechanisms and that they will come out of these \ndiscussions to ensure the effectiveness of the group.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant bill.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Hahn).\n  Ms. HAHN. I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Torres, for introducing \nthis very important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, as co-chair and cofounder of the Congressional PORTS \nCaucus and also as a representative of the busiest port complex in the \nNation,\n\n[[Page H9355]]\n\nI have long advocated for much-needed cybersecurity at our Nation's \nports.\n  In 2013, a report by the Brookings Institution found that there is a \nserious cybersecurity gap at many of our Nation's ports, putting them \nat risk for an attack. A significant cyber attack at one of our major \nports could bring commerce in an entire region to a halt and send shock \nwaves throughout the national and global economies.\n  This is a problem that needs to be addressed, but unfortunately, we \ndo not have a clear picture of where cybersecurity vulnerabilities \nexist at our ports.\n  Earlier this year, the House passed my amendment to instruct the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to identify gaps in cybersecurity at \nthe Nation's 10 most at-risk ports and then to make recommendations for \nhow we can address these problems. I am pleased that that amendment has \nbeen included in the omnibus that we will be voting on later this week.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill we are talking about today expands on this \nprogress and is a great vehicle to identify cybersecurity problems at \nour Nation's ports. I would like to commend my colleague Congresswoman \nTorres for bringing this important issue to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers. If \nthe gentlewoman from California is prepared to close, I will then close \nfor our side.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3878 will enhance our understanding of cyber risks \nat our ports and the countermeasures needed to mitigate them.\n  With the increased levels of technology at maritime facilities, all \npublic and private port stakeholders must share information and \ncoordinate efforts to make sure that our Nation's ports are protected \nfrom cyber attacks.\n  Again, I appreciate the bipartisan cooperation on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 3878.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I simply, once again, urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 3878. It is a very good bill, and it is a \nvery important bill--again, in a bipartisan way--for the security of \nour ports and the homeland security of our Nation as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I speak in support of H.R. 3878, the \nStrengthening Cybersecurity Information Sharing and Coordination in Our \nPorts Act.\n  I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for their \nbipartisan work and stewardship of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nwork, which includes H.R. 3878.\n  Congresswoman Torres should be commended for her hard work that led \nto the introduction of the Strengthening Cybersecurity Information \nSharing and Coordination in Our Ports Act.\n  H.R. 3878, requires the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to seek \nto enhance cybersecurity situational awareness and information sharing \nbetween maritime security stakeholders, the maritime industry, port \nowners and operators, which include maritime terminal owners and \noperators.\n  This bill requires DHS to:\n  consult with the Coast Guard to enhance participation by the Maritime \nInformation Sharing and Analysis Center in the National Cybersecurity \nand Communications Integration Center; and\n  request that the National Maritime Security Advisory Committee report \nand make recommendations to DHS on methods to enhance cybersecurity and \ninformation sharing between stakeholders.\n  The bill also assures DHS leadership in port security by requiring \nthe agency's maritime security risk assessments to include \ncybersecurity risks to ports and the maritime border of the United \nStates.\n  Ports serve as America's gateway to the global economy. The nation's \neconomic prosperity rests on the ability of containerized and bulk \ncargo arriving unimpeded at U.S. ports to support the rapid delivery \nsystem that underpins the manufacturing and retail sectors.\n  My service in the House of Representatives has focused on making sure \nthat our nation is secure and prosperous.\n  A central component of national security is the ability of our \nInternational Ports to move goods into and out of the country.\n  The Port of Houston is critical infrastructure:\n  According to the Department of Commerce in 2012, Texas exports \ntotaled $265 billion.\n  The Port of Houston is a 25-mile-long complex of diversified public \nand private facilities located just a few hours' sailing time from the \nGulf of Mexico.\n  In 2012 ship channel-related businesses contributed 1,026,820 jobs \nand generated more than $178.5 billion in statewide economic impact.\n  In 2014, the Port of Houston was ranked among U.S. ports as the 1st \nin foreign tonnage; largest Texas port with 46 percent of market share \nby tonnage and 95 percent market share in containers by total TEUS in \n2014; largest Gulf Coast container port, handling 67 percent of U.S. \nGulf Coast container traffic in 2014; and 2nd ranked U.S. port in terms \nof total foreign cargo value.\n  The Government Accountability Office (GAO), reports that this port, \nand its waterways, and vessels are part of an economic engine handling \nmore than $700 billion in merchandise annually.\n  A Maritime Cyber-RISKS report published in 2014 outlined examples of \ncybersecurity vulnerabilities that are specific to ports.\n  The Cyberattacks examined included:\n  Theft of money by deceiving a company into transferring large amounts \nof funds to a bank account owned by criminals;\n  In 2013, the FBI issued a warning to maritime companies warning them \nof a fraud committed against several companies using a man-in-the-\nmiddle cyberattack that resulted in $1.65 million in losses.\n  In this attack an impersonation occurs when the email address of a \ntrusted party is co-opted or taken over by an unknown 3rd party.\n  The trusted 3rd party makes a request to change banking information \nthat should be used to provide payment for legitimate services provided \nan established business relationship.\n  The legitimate business is not aware of the request to change bank \npayment information.\n  When the payment is sent, thieves receive it and quickly close the \naccount so that the funds cannot be retrieved.\n  Another malicious attack that does not involve theft of funds can \noccur if the location of cargo information is deleted by a cyber-\nattacker.\n  According to CyberKeel this type of attack happened to a shipping \ncompany in 2011.\n  In this attack data related to rates, loading, cargo number, date and \nplace were corrupted.\n  This cyberattack meant that no one at the port could identify where \ncontainers were, whether they loaded, nor identify which containers \nwere on ships.\n  Cyberattack that targeted technology used by companies who are taking \nreceipt of cargo at port locations.\n  The Firmware software code on handheld scanning technology that reads \nbarcodes on containers was corrupted by malware.\n  When the scanners were plugged into the company's network the \ncorrupted code started a series of automated cyberattacks that searched \nthe company's network for financial information.\n  After finding the information, a connection was established with a \ncomputer in China.\n  Cyberattack at the Port of Antwerp was run by a drug smuggling ring.\n  In this attack the cyber criminals were able to gain control of the \nport terminal system that allowed them to release containers to their \nown trucks without the knowledge of port authorities.\n  This attack is particularly chilling when considering our efforts to \nprotect against weapons of mass destruction in the form of biological, \nnuclear and chemical weapons from being brought into the country \nundetected.\n  This type of attack also has implications for persons entering the \ncountry undetected.\n  The same attack carried out against port worker automated \nidentification systems would open the door on a host of domestic \nsecurity issues.\n  Our nation has thousands of miles of coastlines, lakes, and rivers \nand hundreds of ports that provide opportunities for legitimate travel, \ntrade, and recreation.\n  At the same time, these waterways offer opportunities for terrorists \nand their instruments, and drug smugglers to enter our country.\n  Cybersecurity at ports must be national priority, for this reason, I \nask my colleagues to join me in voting in favor of H.R. 3878.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Donovan). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) that the House \nsuspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3878, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9355-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9355-H9356]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend the Wayne County \nHigh School football team on winning the 5A Mississippi State Football \nChampionship.\n  The War Eagles finished their 12-3 season in a 45-41 victory over the \ndefending State champion, Oxford High School.\n  In the final minutes of the game, four-star defensive tackle Benito \nJones caught a touchdown pass from Reggie Stewart, putting the War \nEagles ahead. Earlier this year, Jones was named a Dandy Dozen, which \nis a title given to the top 12 high school football players in \nMississippi.\n  It takes resilience, perseverance, and, most importantly, skill to \nbeat a defending champion on its home turf in Oxford. That is why I \ncongratulate the team, Coach Todd Mangum and his staff, and the parents \nand administrators for bringing home the State title.\n  We are proud of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9358-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          TAKE OFF YOUR MASKS\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, last week, the Las Vegas Review-Journal, \nwhich is the largest newspaper in Nevada and is one of the largest in \nthe Southwest, was sold to a group of unknown investors.\n  We know little about the details of the sale except that the paper \nwas purchased for $140 million by a group of financiers, including some \nwho allegedly have ties to Las Vegas. We know nothing about the group, \nnothing about its business ties, its political positions, or its \npotential conflicts of interest.\n  Several watchdog and journalistic integrity groups, including the \nSociety of Professional Journalists, have rightly called for the new \nowners to be transparent and reveal their identities or risk having the \nquality and value of the information they provide rightly questioned by \nreaders and employees.\n  I applaud the many hard-working reporters, editors, photographers, \nand columnists at the RJ who have protested this lack of transparency \nand journalistic ethics.\n  It is time for the new owners to take off their masks and prove they \nhave nothing to hide.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9358-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               OBAMACARE\n\n  (Mr. BARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, being uninsured in the era of ObamaCare is \nabout to get a lot more expensive. The penalty for individuals and \nfamilies who cannot afford ObamaCare-approved plans will double next \nyear.\n  Congress will soon finalize a reconciliation bill that will repeal \nthis punitive individual mandate tax. We urge the President to sign \nthis bill for the sake of American families who can't afford this \npenalty.\n  Rather than punish Americans who can't afford to buy ObamaCare's \nexpensive insurance with an equally unaffordable tax, here is a better \nidea: Let's give uninsured Americans the freedom to purchase high-\nquality private insurance on a more affordable basis.\n  House Republicans have and will continue to offer the American people \nan alternative to ObamaCare. We call it the American Health Care Reform \nAct. This legislation, which I helped draft and which I cosponsored, \nwill actually decrease the cost of health care without growing \ngovernment.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to end this costly experiment called \nObamaCare and to actually focus on solutions that will lower costs and \nmake life easier for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9358-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9358]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING AURORA GODOY\n\n  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. RUIZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and to honor the life of \n26-year-old Aurora Banales Godoy of San Jacinto, California, whose life \nwas taken in the December 2 terrorist attack in San Bernardino, \nCalifornia.\n  ``Rora,'' as she was called by her family, had a caring, loving, and \nhappy personality, and she smiled a lot. She would always lend a \nhelping hand when needed even without being asked.\n  Rora graduated from Carson High School in California and attended \nculinary school. She worked for the San Bernardino County's Department \nof Environmental Health. She married her high school sweetheart, James \nGodoy, and is mother to Alexander, a beautiful 2-year-old boy.\n  Rora's legacy will live on through Alexander's happy demeanor and \nsmiles. Rora's passion was to be a great mom and wife. She enjoyed \nbaking, scrapbooking, Disneyland, the Green Bay Packers, and ``Star \nWars'' movies.\n  We will miss Rora's laugh; but as she would say, ``What can I do to \nget through this? Smile. Everything will be okay, and happiness will \ncome back again.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9358-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9358-H9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               BOKO HARAM\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, as we remain correctly focused on the\n\n[[Page H9359]]\n\nISIS threat, less attention is being paid to Boko Haram.\n  Over the past few years, Boko Haram has evolved from a regional to a \nglobal threat. Boko Haram is one of the world's deadliest terror \ngroups, and it has pledged allegiance to ISIS. It has also been almost \n2 years since Boko Haram kidnapped hundreds of Nigerian schoolgirls.\n  I want to thank my south Florida colleague, Frederica Wilson, for her \nleadership in reminding all of us about this tragic terrorist attack.\n  We must bring back our girls. We are right to be concerned by the \nthreat that ISIS poses to our national security and to the world; but \nwe cannot ignore the threat posed by Boko Haram.\n  Mr. Speaker, ISIS, Boko Haram, and so many other radical Islamic \ngroups are being given the time and space to operate; so we must \nredouble our efforts to defeat these Islamic extremist groups.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9359-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      CONGRATULATING THE LOS ANGELES CONSOLIDATED SCHOOL DISTRICT\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have had both the sobering and \nserious responsibility of serving on the Homeland Security Committee \nsince the heinous acts of 9/11.\n  I rise today to give comfort to and to thank the Los Angeles \nConsolidated School District for its swift response. I know that the \nreports of its actions received conflicting commentary, but it had the \nresponsibility for over 600,000 children. I believe, when \nadministrators act seriously, competently, and thoughtfully, they need \nto know that we appreciate it.\n  We live in very difficult and challenging times. It is a horrific \nperson who sends false threats and who frightens the general public; \nbut it is a wise leader who takes it seriously to protect his \nconstituents. In this instance, the Los Angeles Consolidated School \nDistrict, its superintendent, and all of those involved in making the \ndecision to protect those children did the right thing.\n  We live in very difficult times, and we here in the United States are \ncontinuing to try and define and refine our alert system and to do the \nkind of intelligence work to provide our local authorities with the \nright information; but, as a parent, I congratulate them for standing \nup for the children and making sure that those children and teachers \nand others were safe.\n  God help us that we will purge out the horrificness and horribleness \nof terroristic acts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9359-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1500\n                       BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, we are $18 trillion in the red. Specifically, \nour Federal debt, which is a combination of debt held by the public and \ndebt held by government accounts, stands at $18.7 trillion. That means \nevery man, woman, and child owes roughly $58,000 right now, and it will \nno doubt rise day by day.\n  At the beginning of the year 2000, we were $5 trillion underwater. \nFast-forward a few years to when President Obama took office, and we \nwere approximately $10 trillion in debt. Today, we are almost double \nthat.\n  I came to Congress to make the difficult decisions to help put our \nNation back on the path of growth, because right now I am fearful that \nmy children and my grandchildren will not have the same opportunities.\n  It is for these reasons that I have authored and introduced a \nbalanced budget amendment. In fact, 45 States have some type of \nbalanced budget requirement already in law. It is time the Federal \nGovernment follows suit.\n  My amendment will prohibit outlays from exceeding receipts.

Chew, Jr.\n  Reverend Chew was born in a little town in east Texas and moved to \nFort Worth, where he served as pastor of the Shiloh Missionary Baptist \nChurch for 56 years. I can tell you that, during his time at Shiloh, \nReverend Chew not only impacted the Northside community where the \nchurch was located, but the greater overall Fort Worth and Tarrant \nCounty communities.\n  Reverend Chew served on the Fort Worth Human Relations Commission, \nthe Missionary Baptist Church General Convention of Texas, and also was \none of the early founders of a group, the Black Ecumenical Leadership \nAlliance, also known as BELA. His church was very committed to the \nNAACP and often held various NAACP meetings at the church. Reverend \nChew, previous to his service in the ministry, was also a veteran of \nWorld War II.\n  He will be greatly missed in the Fort Worth community. He was a great \ngentleman, a legend. Let's pray for our friends at the Shiloh \nMissionary Baptist Church.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9359-4", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9359]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       REMEMBERING GRETCHEN QUIE\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor an American patriot \nand hero. On December 10, 2015, Brigadier General Herbert Jack Lloyd \nwas called home to be with his Savior, away from the war and strife he \nknew most all of his adult life.\n  General Lloyd served 35 years in the United States Army, moving from \nprivate to brigadier general, commanding at entry level from squad \nleader to assistant division commander. On July 16, 2014, General Lloyd \nwas inducted into the Army Ranger Hall of Fame. Brigadier General Lloyd \nhas received numerous decorations throughout his service, including \nthree combat jumps with the 6th Vietnamese Parachute Battalion, two \nSilver Stars, seven Bronze Stars, and two Purple Hearts.\n  Mr. Speaker, though I could expound on the godly, courageous, and \npatriotic life lived by General Lloyd, I will simply read a sentence \nfrom the General's obituary that he wrote himself: ``If there is \nnothing worth dying for--in this sense--there is nothing worth living \nfor.''

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Swalwell) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to kick off the \nlatest Future Forum Special Order hour. Today we will be talking about \nsomething of unique importance to millennials across the United States \nand, in fact, the world: climate change and what we do about it.\n  Joining me today are Members from across our country. We have \nCongressman Boyle from the Philadelphia area, Congressman Lieu from the \nLos Angeles area, and Congressman Gallego from the Phoenix area.\n  Why is the risk of climate change so unique and important to \nmillennials? Well, they know that the very world in which they live--\nand the one that we will give to our children--is in danger of \nexperiencing catastrophic environmental changes. It is our future that \nis on the line, and it is our future that is in danger.\n  I also encourage anyone watching this to participate in the \nconversation at #futureforum, and I will engage our Members under that \nhashtag.\n  First, I want to start with Congressman Lieu.\n  I would ask you, Congressman, in the Los Angeles area, a place where \nyoung people are thriving and young people across the world are moving \nto, what are you hearing from millennials in the Los Angeles area?\n  Is it anything like what I heard in southern California when Scott \nPeters and I were down there last month and we talked to students at \nthe University of California, San Diego, and we had a word cloud? This \nis where you ask participants in the audience to text in what issue is \nmost important to them, and the one that is more important gets bigger \nand bigger in font size. As you can see here in this photograph, \nclimate was the number one issue on the minds of people down in San \nDiego. Is that what you are hearing in the Los Angeles area?\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Absolutely. That is why I am very pleased \nand proud that the University of California system became the first, \nand currently the only, university to be a part of Bill Gates' \nbreakthrough energy fund.\n  We are taking some great steps in California to mitigate carbon \npollution. As you know, California passed the Global Warming Solutions \nAct last decade, and it is one of the strongest laws in the world. One \nof the first bills I authored seeks to replicate California's laws \nnationwide.\n  It is an important issue for millennials because it is going to \ndirectly affect you in the coming decades. It is going to affect our \nchildren and grandchildren. So we need to make sure that we mitigate \ncarbon pollution.\n  All of us are busy. We all deal with a thousand issues, but carbon \npollution is the one issue that can kill humanity as a species if we \ndon't do anything about it.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Thank you, Congressman Lieu.\n  Something that is quite interesting to me is that for millennials, \nwhen polled or asked about climate change, it is not a partisan issue. \nIn this House, it feels quite like a partisan issue.\n  My question for Congressman Boyle: Across the country from Los \nAngeles, is addressing climate change a partisan issue, and what are \nyou hearing from millennials in the Philadelphia area?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. First, I just want to commend \nthe gentleman Mr. Swalwell for his excellent leadership when it comes \nto this issue of utmost importance to our generation, but also to all \nthe other issues that face our generation, especially the student loan \ndebt issue that he and I have spoken about a number of times here on \nthis House floor.\n\n[[Page H9361]]\n\n  With respect to climate change, this should not be a partisan issue. \nIndeed, in Europe, for decades, centre-right parties acknowledged and \nstill to this day acknowledge the existence of global climate change \nand work to address it.\n  Here in the United States, however, it has, unfortunately, become a \npartisan issue. Yet, what is so interesting is that, when I go about my \ndistrict in Philadelphia and in suburban Philadelphia and Montgomery \nCounty, Pennsylvania, and I speak specifically to small-business \nowners, small-business owners, by the way, at least half of whom are \nprobably Republican, each and every one of them is talking to me about \nways and investments that they are making to ensure that they can get \nmore bang for their buck when it comes to energy and things that they \nare doing, investments that they are making to ensure that we do better \nas far as the environment, yet at the same time also reduce costs.\n  I did a tour back in the spring of a major company in my district \nthat has made a massive investment in terms of solar panels on the \nroofs. This is a major facility, a family-owned business. This is not \nan insignificant amount of money they have spent in terms of this \ninvestment. They would not be doing so if they thought this was a hoax. \nThey would not be doing so if they thought, by transitioning to \nrenewables, they are able to bring down their energy costs and pour \nmore money back into their business.\n  We need to end, especially in this House, this false dichotomy \nbetween doing what is right for our economy and doing what is right for \nour climate and for the next generation. The fact is, if we are smart \nand show the best of American ingenuity, we can do both.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Gallego, I am curious. You \nlook at this poster board, and we see that 73 percent of people aged 18 \nto 29 believe that the Earth is warming. Clearly, 73 percent of people \nin that age range are not Democrats. They are not Republicans. In fact, \nyoung people are quite independent minded.\n  Are you finding that people in your congressional district in the \nPhoenix area believe that the Earth is warming and that mankind is not \nonly responsible for that, but has an obligation to do something about \nit?\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Well, in Phoenix, we are always used to pretty warm \nweather. Of course, as of late, we actually have noticed it has \nactually gotten a lot, lot warmer, and we are worried.\n  Within that 73 percent range, you will meet a lot of people from all \ndemographic backgrounds, especially Latino and African American \ncommunities, that are particularly worried. These are the communities \nthat are growing still, a very young population, but also, \nunfortunately, tend to have less money.\n  What that means is, when it gets hotter--and it continues to get \nhotter in Arizona--and they are going to have to pay for higher air-\nconditioning costs or are going to have to pay more for water service, \nthey are the ones who are going to be directly impacted by climate \nchange.\n  These young people--the average age of the Latino in Arizona is about \n25--have to see into the future. What they see in the future is a State \nand a country that is warmer, that has less water, and that did not \nmake the kind of energy investments that we could have done for many \nyears.\n  Right now the politicians of today do not have the vision for the new \nenergy future. That is why you see those high numbers. Those high \nnumbers are a direct reflection of young millennials who really, truly \ncare about the future and are projecting into the future what they \nthink is important for stability of not just this country, but the \npopulation on Earth.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Now, Congressman Lieu, talking about this \nstatistic, in the Los Angeles area, there is a lot that young people \nare doing with startups, especially in clean energy.\n  I had the opportunity to visit an incubator hub, thousands of square \nfeet where they are working in Los Angeles in the Arts District to try \nand solve some of the greatest climate challenges we have through \nrenewable energy sources.\n  What are you seeing as far as innovation in your area where people \nare saying: You know what. This is not a false choice between fossil \nfuels and doing nothing about it? Are you seeing something there at \nhome?\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. When California passed our landmark \nGlobal Warming Solutions Act, we had huge investments in green energy \nactually come into the State. California has now been a leader in green \ntechnology in terms of solar, in terms of biofuels and other \ntechnologies.\n  If you want to do that, people do come to California. It really has \nhelped to jump-start parts of our community. I agree with \nRepresentative Boyle. It is a false choice between the economy and \nclimate mitigation. You can do both.\n  I also do want to note that it is not just young people who realize \nthis. You have also now organizations that you traditionally would not \ncall progressive coming on board, saying that carbon pollution is a \nproblem. You have got the Catholic Church saying that we need to \naddress climate change now. You have got the U.S. military.\n  One of the great things about our military is it is exceptional, it \nis amazing, because it actually deals with facts. The U.S. military \ntakes the world as it is, not as they think it should be or in some \nfantasyland. When the U.S. military looked at the science and the \nfacts, they said that this is a national security problem.\n  We are having more severe weather events. We are going to have food \nshortages in other parts of the world causing migrations, causing \nconflicts. In terms of the U.S. military's own fuel use, it is very \ndifficult to transport a lot of fuel over long distances. They are \nactually looking at renewables, at solar, at other renewable sources.\n  Lastly, let me just say, as we stand here today, one of the world's \nlargest oil companies, ExxonMobil, believes in climate change. They \nbelieve it is caused by the burning of fossil fuels, and they support a \nprice on carbon. Now, we wish it didn't take them over three decades to \ncome to this position, but that is their position today.\n  Since they don't say it very loudly, I am going to say it very \nloudly. ExxonMobil believes in climate change. For those who don't, you \nmay want to think what does that oil company know that you don't.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. If oil companies believe in climate \nchange, you can, too. I think that is the message here today.\n  In Paris, over the past few weeks, over a hundred countries, \nthousands of world leaders, gathered to declare what over 98 percent of \nthe scientific community has always known, which is that climate change \nis real. Man has caused it, and we must do something about it.\n  The reaction in my congressional district has been one of enthusiasm. \nPeople are happy to see that internationally this is being addressed. \nIt is not just the United States. It is not just the giants, but every \ncountry across the globe is recognizing this.\n  What are you hearing at home, Congressman Boyle, about the Paris \ntalks and what can come out of it?\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Well, the first thing is the \nfact that 194, 195 nations or so from all around the world could come \ntogether and agree on one document as ambitious as this one is is truly \ninspiring not just on the issue of climate change, but, indeed, as we \nlook at all the other immense challenges that we face as a human race.\n  I think that it is great specifically for this issue, but it also \nshows what we can do together if our hearts are in the right place and \nwe are dedicated toward saving this planet.\n  I also just want to follow up on something that Mr. Lieu said, which \nis a great point in terms of talking about the broader coalition of \npeople who want action on this incredibly important issue.\n  I would add one more to his extensive list, and that is the insurance \ncompanies. Insurance companies, especially on the East Coast, \nespecially in south Florida and the entire Florida peninsula, have a \ngreat deal of exposure at stake.\n  They understand that right now--not 20 years from now, not 100 years \nfrom now--as we speak, there are parts of Florida, there are parts of \nVirginia Beach, that are flooding when it is not even raining. These \nare real consequences that we have to deal with.\n\n[[Page H9362]]\n\n  For those of us in the Philadelphia area, in New York, New Jersey, I \nnever imagined we would be riding out a hurricane and having to deal \nwith the aftereffects--3 years later still dealing with those \naftereffects, by the way--and the price tag for that for insurance \ncompanies was absolutely enormous.\n  One thing that we all need to consider--and this is a really shocking \nstatistic, but sadly true--last month, November of 2015, was the \nwarmest month in recorded history. Those records have gone back since \n1880. We know that this is not a 1-month phenomenon, that indeed it is \njust a continuation of the trend that we have been dealing with.\n  I would really urge those who want to make this a partisan issue and \npart of the usual food fight that too often goes on around here, this \nissue is going to face Democrats, Republicans, Independents, every \nsingle person in our country, every single person on Earth.\n  The sooner that we take politics out of this and that we come \ntogether on a comprehensive solution that balances, yes, our economic \nneeds with, also, our needs to tackle this issue, the better off all \nAmericans will be.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. I am glad that you mentioned, Congressman \nLieu, the work that is being done in and among our Armed Forces.\n  Congressman Gallego, you served in Iraq, and you are a member of the \nCommittee on Armed Services right now. I strongly believe that drilling \nour way out of this is not going to produce the energy results that we \nneed, and, of course, as we know, it will be harmful to the Earth, that \nthere are actually ways through innovation.\n  That is something that America has always done. We have innovated our \nway out of the problems that have challenged us. Whether it comes to \nwind, solar, alternative fuel cells, we are doing that from a national \nsecurity posture.\n  In my congressional district, we have Lawrence Livermore National \nLaboratory and Sandia National Laboratory. At Sandia, they are doing \nwork with oil companies at what is called the combustion research \nfacility, where they are trying to make the automobile engine more \nefficient. At Lawrence Livermore, at the national emission facility, \nwhich is the largest and most energetic inertial confinement fusion \ndevice built to date and the largest laser in the world, fusion holds \nthe promise of providing a practically limitless supply of clean energy \nto the world.\n  I am wondering, Congressman Gallego, just as someone who has worked \nin the military, defending our country before, somebody who overseas \nthe military now in Congress, what can we do from a national security \nposture to address climate change?\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Well, first we have to recognize that it truly is a \nnational security issue in two areas. One, if you look at how we \nmobilize our troops, when you are out there--and I was a frontliner. I \nserved with the United States Marine Corps as an infantryman.\n  Many times I was far away from a base, but I still needed resources. \nSo people had to drop off my food. People had to drop off a generator \nto power the computers that gave us the information we needed.\n  That was all done, unfortunately, by trucks that were exposing \nthemselves to IEDs to bring us gasoline to basically power these \ngenerators to even keep us warm when it got really cold, things of that \nnature.\n  If we had a strong investment in green technology that allowed us to \nhave energy independence down at the module level, it would reduce the \namount of men and women that have to be on these dangerous roads.\n  When we kind of look at the grander scope of how you actually \neffectively fight a war, the first thing you do is you try to take away \ntheir energy resources. The first thing you do is you take out their \nelectrical grid, you take out any opportunity for them to actually be \nable to move. That includes what we know now as gasoline.\n  If you look at some of our greatest victories, when Sherman was \npushing through Europe, when Patton was fighting in World War II, what \nthey did was effectively cut off the axis powers' ability to basically \nfeed their engines by destroying their capability of refining oil into \ngasoline.\n  If we want to also make sure that we, as a country, have strong \nnational security going now and into the future, we have to make sure \nthat we are energy independent. Most of the hydrocarbons that are still \nin existence in this world are not in the United States. They are found \nin a lot of countries that are not stable allies of ours or in a very \nunstable region.\n  For example, Venezuela is one of our biggest oil partners. Even if \nyou go down to the Middle East, they are in a very unstable area. We \nstill rely on that area for a lot of our oil or the world, in general. \nIf we do not receive their oil, they do set the price of the \ncommodities, which also affects, obviously, a lot of our national \nsecurity posture.\n  If we were truly serious about understanding what we need to do in \nthe future to continue having a strong national security that defends \nthe American way of life, energy independence through renewables is the \nway to do it.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Gallego, you come from one of \nthe hottest spots in the United States.\n  Congressman Boyle, you also alluded to November being the hottest \nmonth on record. It seems like every month we learn that the month \nbefore was the hottest month on record.\n  We are in the United States. If we were in Australia or South \nAmerica, hearing that November is the hottest month on record may not \nbe as surprising as a month that is in the dead of fall and the dawn of \nwinter in the United States.\n  Congressman Lieu, you represent a district that for 40 years before \nyou were there was represented by the great Henry Waxman, someone who \ndid a lot of good work on this floor to address climate change.\n  In our home State of California, while the future specific day-to-day \neffects of climate change are not yet known, projections not only show \na rise in sea levels across the world and threatening our coast in \nCalifornia, but models are also suggesting increasingly extreme weather \nevents.\n  Whether you are in the Los Angeles area or in the San Francisco Bay \narea, we have been experiencing drought-like conditions for years as \nwell as hurricanes on the East Coast in places like the northeast that \nhave not seen the intensity like Hurricane Sandy, which we have seen \nbefore.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  And so, as we adapt for our current climate and any rapid change in \nour environment, I want to know, Congressman Lieu, can you talk a \nlittle bit about weather events and why this is a threat to coastal \ncommunities?\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Representative Swalwell, that is a great \npoint you make. Whether you call it science, facts, or measurements, \nyou can measure climate change. So we know that last year was the \nhottest year in recorded history, only to be outdone by the first 6 \nmonths of this year, only to be outdone again, as Representative Boyle \nmentioned, by November--last month. We know that ocean levels have \nrisen 8 inches in about the last century, and just since 1992, they \nhave risen about 3 inches.\n  I love my district, which stretches from Malibu, south through Santa \nMonica, Manhattan Beach, Palos Verdes, and along the coast, and I don't \nwant my constituents all moving to Representative Gallego's district \nbecause they are getting flooded.\n  It is important that we look at this. The projections show that by \n2050, large parts of American coastal areas will be at risk of \nflooding--and that is a huge problem. So we have to not only pay \nattention to that as a national security interest, but just for people \nto live their normal lives. And Mother Nature does not discriminate.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Congressman Lieu, an interesting fact \nabout that number. NASA projects that by 2050, between $66 billion and \n$106 billion worth of existing coastal property will likely be below \nsea level nationwide, with $238 billion to $507 billion worth of \nproperty below sea level by 2100. And so it certainly has, as you said, \nnot just the livelihood effect on it, but also a price tag, as we have \nseen.\n  I mentioned Congressman Gallego served in the military. I believe you \nalso serve today as a reservist. If you will, talk about the national \nsecurity threat because of climate change.\n\n[[Page H9363]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. I am very honored to have Los Angeles Air \nForce Base in my district. It was the first base to actually go green \nin terms of its vehicles. So all the vehicles the L.A. Air Force Base \nuses on the government side are energy-efficient electric vehicles. \nThey are the first large institution to develop a vehicle-to-grid \nprogram where you actually plug in the vehicle and it gives electricity \nback to the grid when the grid needs it. If you can get that \nwidespread, that would be a game changer across America. So the \nmilitary is very focused on this issue.\n  Again, what makes America an exceptional country--one of the best in \nthe world--is we actually rely on facts and science and measurements. \nNinety-seven percent of scientists looking at this issue have said that \nclimate change is real, it is largely caused by humans, and we need to \ndo something about it or else we are going to be in a great world of \nhurt.\n  If 9 out of 10 doctors said your child shows the symptoms of \ndiabetes, would you keep feeding your child Snickers bars? You would be \ncrazy if you do that. You would actually go and seek treatment. It \nmakes no sense for folks to believe in doctors and science and math and \ntechnology and then, on this one narrow issue of carbon pollution, \nsimply for ideological reasons, say we are not going to trust any \nscience or facts or measurements.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Bringing us back to what millennials \nbelieve on this issue. Some of you have participated in our Future \nForum dialogue.\n  On January 14, Congressman Lieu will be in the Los Angeles area \nhosting a Future Forum dialogue on climate change, student loan debt, \nand the other issues facing our generation. But some of the science, as \nyou mentioned, behind millennial beliefs is quite powerful.\n  According to a 2014 Harstad poll, 80 percent of millennials favor the \nidea of requiring utilities to generate at least a third of their power \nfrom renewable sources like solar and wind by 2030. That also falls in \nline with what much of the rest of the developed world is doing.\n  There was a New York Times story last year highlighting that, by the \nend of 2014, Germany would receive nearly a third of its energy through \nrenewable sources. Two-thirds of young adults age 18 to 34, according \nto a National Geographic article, say they are inclined to vote for \ncandidates who support cutting greenhouse gases and increasing \nfinancial incentives for renewable energy. And in a 2015 poll by \nNextGen Climate, 75 percent of voters under the age of 35 say they \nwould be more likely to vote for a candidate who pledged to turn the \ncountry to 50 percent clean energy by 2030.\n  So we have talked about the national security argument, we have \ntalked about the economic advantages and, of course, the livelihood \nthreat of flooding in extreme weather events.\n  Congressman Boyle, what about American exceptionalism? Are we any \nless capable than Germany or Denmark or any of these other countries of \naddressing climate change?\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Well, for anyone to believe \nthat--I know there are some right now who are running for President \ntrying to denigrate America and talk about what is all supposedly wrong \nwith us. I would point out that the whole history of our country has \nbeen seeing enormous challenges and meeting them and defeating them. \nThat has been the entire history from Valley Forge, which I am \nprivileged to represent, all the way through to the present day.\n  I would also say to the men and women of my generation--of our \ngeneration--who might be understandably skeptical on this issue because \neach and every month they hear the same statistics we do that this past \nmonth was the hottest month on record, only to be beaten by the \nsucceeding month, that we have actually been here before in terms of \ndealing with environmental degradation.\n  As for our parents' generation, they faced two particularly strong \nissues that seemed very difficult to meet and defeat. One was with \nrespect to the ozone layer. If we were having this conversation in the \nearly 1970s, a great deal of the talk was about repairing the ozone \nlayer. Even when some of us were kids, that was an issue. Notice that \nyou don't hear about that anymore. That is because we made the \nimportant changes that were necessary, and we solved that problem.\n  A second was with respect to our waterways and rivers. I am proud to \nrepresent, Mr. Speaker, and to my colleagues here, the Delaware River \nin Philadelphia, which actually separates Pennsylvania from New Jersey. \nIt is a beautiful waterway. It is also a very historic one, as that is \nwhere, famously, on Christmas Day 1776, George Washington and our \nsoldiers crossed the Delaware into the Battle of Trenton to defeat the \nHessians and help launch our young Nation on its way to independence.\n  Well, a previous generation ago, that waterway, as well as the Hudson \nRiver and countless others, was in its worst state ever. Today, that \nsame Delaware River is cleaner than at any point in our grandparents' \nlifetime. That is an enormous achievement. It is one that, 40, 50 years \nago, most people would have predicted could not have been accomplished.\n  So I would say to all Americans, but especially to those of our \ngeneration, yes, this is an enormous problem, but, yes, we can also \ndefeat it. Yes, we can also rise to the occasion, just as we have with \neach and every other major challenge our Nation has faced.\n\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. That is right, Mr. Boyle.\n  Mr. Gallego has seen this with me. He came out to my congressional \ndistrict and spoke with millennials in the San Francisco Bay Area. We \nare aspirational. We are optimistic. We are collaborative. In fact, we \ncame out of the family cell phone plan, so we are used to solving all \nsorts of problems with group think and then actually arriving at a \ndecision. That is what we do: We collaborate, we solve small problems, \nwe think big, and we take on the larger problems.\n  Your closing thoughts, Congressman Gallego, on what our generation \ncan do to address this threat to our national security, our livelihood, \nand our economy.\n  Mr. GALLEGO. I think if we actually lean back on the strengths of our \ngeneration, that is what we need to do. We are a very empathetic \ngeneration. We care about our community. We care about our world. And \nbeing able to translate that into political power is important.\n  Whether you vote for a Democrat, Republican, or Independent, make \nsure they understand that is your priority, to be represented by \nsomebody who understands the threat of climate change and you want to \nsee action.\n  We also need to get involved more on the economic innovation side \nthat comes with the new energy future. We are going to be developing \nthe technologies that are really going to be making the biggest impacts \nin terms of slowing down the warming of the Earth.\n  And it is our friends and colleagues now that are working in labs and \ndoing the startups in Los Angeles, Phoenix, and San Francisco that are \ncreating the technology of tomorrow. We need to continue to be pushing \nforward, supporting their efforts, supporting them through R But, \nmore importantly, having a Congress that is supportive and \nunderstanding of the challenges of climate change is the key to all \nthat.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Thank you, Congressman Gallego, for \nparticipating today.\n  Thank you, Congressman Lieu, for your service to our country and for \nstanding up for Americans now in this new world and understanding that \nthis is a national security issue as well.\n  Congressman Lieu, if you want to, give us your closing thoughts on \nclimate change and what millennials--and everyone, as you said--can do \nabout this issue.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mother Nature does not discriminate. \nWhether you are 20 years old, a Republican or Democrat or a member of \nthe Green Party, the laws of physics and the laws of chemistry do not \nnegotiate.\n  We are now in a danger zone when it comes to carbon pollution. If we \ndon't act quickly to reduce carbon pollution, in the coming decades we \nare going to be in a world of hurt. We are going to have far more \nextreme weather events, far more national security issues.\n  So, working together, it is my hope that we can pass strong \nlegislation through this Congress, and I believe we will because, in a \ndemocracy, the side with the facts eventually wins.\n\n[[Page H9364]]\n\n  Thank you, Representative Swalwell, for having this terrific Future \nForum event on the floor today.\n  Mr. SWALWELL of California. Thank you, Congressman Lieu.\n  It has been exciting going to the nine cities across America and \ntalking to young people and learning their thoughts. As the Future \nForum, our goal has been first to listen, and then to engage with \nmillennials, whether it is going to their college campuses, community \ncolleges, workforces, incubator and startup hubs; and then it is to \ncrowdsource these problems, and then for the lawmakers of Future Forum \nto come back to this body and this Chamber and act on the issues that \nyoung Americans care about.\n  It is the largest generation America has ever known. It is the most \ndiverse generation that America has ever known. It is an aspirational \ngeneration that wants to solve problems and not sit on the sidelines \nand watch our sea levels rise and watch the Earth get warmer. It is a \ngeneration that feels a sense of responsibility that we are only on \nthis Earth for a very short period of time, and we will be judged by \nwhat we leave to the next generation.\n  So, yes, we can do something about it. Young Americans are committed \nto fighting climate change. They know it is our own reality and the \nreality of those who will inherit this Earth, and they know it is \nbetter to start now, before it is too late.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9364-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9364-H9367]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1545\n                           BUDGETARY CONCERNS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Schweikert) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Speaker, as we get ourselves sort of organized, \nyou will actually notice a couple of these boards are a little worn. It \nis because it is a, shall we say, the continuation of a theme. But this \nis sort of an auspicious day to actually do some of this, as we are \ngetting ready to do the omnibus, the big budgetary bill.\n  What is so important here is, I want, everyone, first, to understand \nthe $1.1-plus trillion we are talking about is solely what we call the \ndiscretionary portion of the budget. This is the portion of the budget \nwe debate here, we do amendments, we work through; and then, in this \nparticular case, because of a series of blocks and frustrations and \ngame-playing that happened previously, we get here to the end and we \nare trying to package it all together. But it is not the majority, it \nis not anywhere near close to the majority of our Federal spending.\n  So take a look at this board. And this is for 2015. So we are right \nnow working on the budget for the 2016 appropriation cycle.\n  If you see the blue, the blue is mandatory spending. Those are things \nlike Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid and other parts of the \nwelfare portion of our budget that are formula-driven, that you hit a \ncertain age, you get a benefit; you fall below a certain income, you \nget a certain benefit. It is about 69-plus percent of our spending, and \nthis is for last year.\n  Only 31 percent of the 2015 budget actually goes through this sort of \nnormal appropriation process, and that is really important to \nunderstand the scale of the spending and how little of it actually is \ndebated, because it is a formula. It is also the portion of our \nspending that is exploding.\n  So we are going to walk through a couple of these boards today. One \nof my goals is actually to also walk through and talk about what is \nactually happening in some of the mandatory spending, and why, for all \nof us, we are going to have to have that very honest, very difficult, \nvery math fact-based conversation.\n  In my district, the Scottsdale, Phoenix area, I am incredibly \nblessed. I have an amazing constituency, I have a wonderful area, but \nwe have done 100+ of these budget townhalls over the last couple of \nyears, and I will get people who will come in and say, but that number \ndoesn't feel right. I know it may not feel right.\n  Previous politicians on both sides, I think, have underplayed what is \nhappening in this country demographically and what it actually means to \nour commitment.\n  So if you are someone who really, really, really cares about keeping \nthis country safe, you need to be willing to start to understand what \nis happening in these numbers. You need to understand the financial \npressure that is going to be on your ability to finance the military. \nIf you care about health care, you need to understand the financial \npressure that is going to be coming to deal with those, medical \nresearch, education.\n  So let's first get our head around what is both happening, and then \nwe are going to actually walk through some demographic slides. And the \nreason I want to do that is to understand, this isn't the type of \ndiscussion where you can throw a switch and the solutions are simple.\n  The next slide, this is actually sort of walking through the \nprojections, and, understand, these projections have actually changed a \nlittle bit, but I didn't have a chance to finish all the calculations. \nSo this is, functionally, four budget cycles from now. So it is the \n2020 budget. We are right now doing the 2016 budget.\n  At that point, 76 percent of the spending is Medicare, Medicaid, \nSocial Security, interest on the debt, veterans benefits, and other \ntransfer programs, welfare programs; 76. Remember, the budget cycle we \njust finished, it was 69. In, functionally, 4 or 5 years, it becomes 76 \npercent of all of our spending.\n  So if you care about the military, if you care about healthcare \nresearch, if you care about foreign aid, if you care about any of those \nthings, it is shrinking rather dramatically as a percentage of our \ntotal spending.\n  Yet, you have got to understand, from 2015 to that 2020 budget, this \ngovernment is going to go from, I think it is a $3-some trillion budget \nto a $4.1 trillion budget. So in that few years, we are going to \nactually increase by $1 trillion in spending and revenues, and some of \nthose revenues come from borrowing. Yet, the ratio continues to explode \nbecause it is going into that mandatory spending.\n  This is demographics. This is reality. And unless you have a solution \nfor baby boomers to stop, like me, turning gray, we have to grow up and \ndeal with it. I find here in Washington there is pathological avoidance \nof the reality that is upon us.\n  I am going to do this without knocking anything down. And I believe \nthese are already up on our Web site, the ability to sort of take a \nlook and see where is the money actually going; because I can't tell \nyou how many times we would do those budget townhalls and someone would \ncome in the door and say, Well, David, if you just did this, if you \nwould get rid of foreign aid, that would take care of the problem. Then \nyou go to this slide and try showing them that the tiny, tiny, tiny \nlittle sliver right there was foreign aid.\n  Well, David, if you would just get rid of this. Well, waste and fraud \nis huge. The reality of it, we know in Medicare and Medicaid and many \nof these things, we have to come up with more dramatically efficient \nways, the use of technology. We are going to start to talk about that \nat the end of this, that there really are some solutions we need to be \nembracing. But they are little slivers.\n  Do you see the blue areas? Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid, \nwelfare benefits, interest on the debt? As you saw today, with the Fed \nstarting to raise interest rates, we expect, in just a few years, \ninterest to be bigger than the defense budget. In about 7 years, \ninterest will be approaching $1 trillion a year.\n  Understand, this is the reality of the math. This is no more happy \ntalk that seems to go around in politics. It is math.\n  This portion over here, if you take out the Defense Department--so if \nyou look at defense and all this blue, these here are all the agencies. \nIt is important to understand these numbers, because I have been \nheartbroken at how often we do townhalls around our State, and there is \nthis misunderstanding of where the money is actually being \nappropriated.\n  So we are going to talk about a little bit of the demographics of \nwhat is going on, but also, how much trouble, how much difficulty is \nSocial Security in?\n\n[[Page H9365]]\n\n  Remember, they used to say it is the third rail of politics, you are \nnot allowed to talk about it or tell the truth about it, but we have a \nmoral obligation to explain what is going on. How about Medicare? How \nabout some of these others?\n  So I wanted you to see this particular slide here, and this just \ngives you a sense of also what is happening with us demographically.\n\n  I can remember many, many years ago, sitting in a statistics class \nover at Arizona State University--I love that school--and this is, I \nthink, in the early eighties, and the professor is showing graphs \nsaying, you have got to understand, in the 2015-2028 point, you have \nall these baby boomers that move into retirement, so I am sure the \ngovernment, I am sure Washington, D.C., will make sure they have these \nmassive amounts of reserves set aside to provide benefits for our \nseniors.\n  Well, being one of those ``end of the baby boomer folks,'' and now \nbeing here in Washington realizing: That money isn't there. So when you \nlook at this particular chart--and the only reason it is partially \nhere--you see 2018, it is the next to the last bar. And then, all of a \nsudden, the last bar, do you see it is shooting up? We have hit the \ntime they have called the inflection point.\n  So, in 22 months, we hit the time that we have talked about for 30 \nyears, that the debt is going to start to explode in this country; \n2018. We are doing the 2016 budget right now. We are already in the \n2016 budget. So 22 months from now, the debt starts to explode.\n  So we are going to have a good year this year, though, because of \nsome of the budget deal that was done about a month or so ago; and some \nof the other, lifting some of the spending caps of sequestration, we \nare going to end up with a larger deficit this year.\n  So I guess the best number I have seen right now is $440 billion, \n$450 billion this year. But come 2018, a couple of years from now, it \nstarts to take off, and it takes off for, functionally, the next 40 \nyears. This is the reality that is facing us. So, if you care about the \nmilitary and education and all these other things, understand what is \nabout to happen.\n  Here, actually, are some of the slides that start to become more \ndifficult to talk about, and I am actually sort of frustrated that we \ndon't do more of this.\n  This particular chart here--and actually, I think this one I may have \ntaken from The Wall Street Journal. And for folks who are actually \ninterested in these demographic facts and how they affect your country, \nbut also affect the world, The Wall Street Journal actually just \nrecently finished a series I think they call ``2050,'' and it actually \nhas some of the best narratives, best graphs, best details I have ever \nseen in sort of walking through, that this just isn't an American \ntrend.\n  Take a look at the numbers you see in China and other places around \nthe world, where the aging of the population, compared to the benefits \nthat have been promised, compared to the number of workers, and that \nimbalance, and what that means to future economic growth for the world, \nlet alone just the United States.\n  But do you see this line where it starts to explode off the charts? \nThat is, functionally, enrollment in Social Security. So when we were \nat 2008, we had about 41 million folks who were in Social Security. \nToday, I believe now we have crossed 50 million, so 2008-2015, this is \nthe reality of how quickly that slope. And it is the what? It is the \nbaby boomers.\n  Remember, we have about 76 million of our brothers and sisters who \nturn 65 in about an 18-year period. The first one, the first baby \nboomer crossed that threshold, I believe, in late 2008. So we are in \nthat demographic inflection.\n  You are going to start to see more and more of this reflected in our \neconomic growth, in the debt, and the movement of your Federal \nGovernment resources into retirement programs for those who are over \n65. Whether it be medical, whether it be indigent medical, whether it \nbe Social Security and others, it is our commitment. We have made these \npromises. We have also made a promise that we need to find some way to \npay for them, and that is where this discussion, hopefully, is going to \ntake us.\n  This slide is a bit more of a concern. We are doing a project in our \noffice right now. We have a little, a couple of folks set aside in our \noffice called the ``Idea Shop,'' and they try to do sort of detailed \nresearch outside the day-to-day chaos that is being a Member of \nCongress.\n  It is really the bottom point here that I want to pop out at you, and \nthat is the number of our brothers and sisters, the number of our \nfellow Americans, that are 55-64, so they are heading towards \nretirement. Nineteen percent of them have no retirement savings at all, \nso they are solely dependent on Social Security and the medical \nbenefits that they will receive from Medicare.\n  If we bounce up one, 25 percent of those older than 45 have, \nfunctionally, no money set aside.\n  Now, I accept we have just come through a pretty rough economic \ncycle, but the last couple of years it is getting better. It is still \nnot great, but this is a point where we are starting to step up and \nunderstand we need a revolution in this country's Tax Code. We need a \nrevolution in how we regulate in this country.\n  We all walk around with these supercomputers in our pocket. \nInformation is ultimately the greatest regulator in a society, and yet \nwe still try and design these command-and-control functions of \nbureaucracies like it was the 1930s.\n  We are also going to do a little talking about embracing the new \neconomy, the hyper-efficient economy, that will, hopefully, maximize \neconomic growth.\n  But everything, whether it be from immigration, to Tax Code, to \nregulatory codes, everything, now the first words out of that \npolitician's, that policymaker's, that researcher's, and you, as the \nconstituent's mouth needs to be, how does this maximize economic growth \nfor the country, because I want to keep my commitment to the young and \nour commitments to seniors. When you look at the numbers, it does not \nhappen unless we can get this economic expansion, some economic growth \nreally working.\n  So as we go through these slides--the other thing is also, for \nsomeone that is also really interested in these, we try to put these up \non our social media, but these are some of the different projects we \nare working on.\n  Now, on this one, this is just to sort of understand, one more time--\nand I know I am repeating myself with the different slides, but we did \na budget deal about, what, 2 months ago? Social Security Disability was \ngoing broke. Social Security Disability in early, mid-2016 was, \nfunctionally, the trust fund for that was going to be gone.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  So the solution that Congress supported--I voted ``no,'' but that is \nbecause we thought we had a more elegant solution. Functionally, the \npolitical will was not there for the types of reforms we thought were \nappropriate.\n  They reached in and took $114 billion out of the big Social Security \ntrust fund and moved it over here to the Social Security disability \nfund to shore it up. Okay. That was their solution, but there was \nalmost no discussion around this body that it shortened the life of \nSocial Security by about another year.\n  So when you take a look--the reason we are showing these is--take a \nlook at this middle one. If you were to exclude the interest--now, \nunderstand, the revenues for Social Security come from really two pots, \nthe taxes and then the money it has loaned to the government back to \nthe general fund.\n  So the Federal Government--I know it is just an accounting gimmick \nback and forth because we are paying ourselves interest, but that is \nwhat we do. We pay ourselves interest, and that is considered one of \nthe revenue sources for Social Security.\n  So if you were to take taxes and interest, but if you were to look at \nthat midline and say, instead of the sort of bookkeeping entry we do \nback and forth, no interest, just the revenues from taxes on FICA, \nSocial Security, it went negative in 2010. So more money was going out \nto beneficiaries than what has been coming in in taxes.\n  But if you actually put both the interest and the tax stream, it goes \nnegative no longer in 2022. It goes negative now in 2021. So if I had a \nbig marker, I would walk over there and cross that out. Of course, I \nwould also knock over the board in doing it. So, functionally, 5 years, \n60 months from now, Social Security goes negative.\n\n[[Page H9366]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is no longer that theoretical discussion we were \nhaving saying sometime off in the future, sometime in 2027, sometime in \n2040. It is 5 years. It is less than one U.S. senatorial term that \nSocial Security goes negative.\n  Mr. Speaker, how much discussion do you see in the political class, \nin the researcher class, the policy class, and in our communities \nsaying: ``We need to deal with this today because every day we wait it \nbecomes more difficult''?\n  If we look at the history of the last couple of decades when those of \nus who care about this deeply have gotten behind microphones and \nstarted to point out the numbers, we see the television ad the next \ncampaign, whether it be pushing Paul Ryan or a look-alike off of a \ncliff and saying that Paul Ryan wants to try to reform your \nentitlements because--the fact of the matter is Medicare is going \nbankrupt. He wants to save the system. But if we can scare you to \ndeath, it becomes a great political issue.\n  I also believe the voters are way ahead of the political class in \nunderstanding we need to step up and do hard things to fix these. I \nalso want to make the argument that these are the biggest issues in \nfront of us because, if we don't do it, then everything in the future \nis going to be how do we survive the promises we have made in our \nentitlements. And it is coming fast. Remember, Social Security goes \nnegative in about 60 months. That is how fast it is coming at us.\n  This was just to sort of reemphasize the fact--do you see that little \nred area? That is what we did in the budget deal a couple months ago. \nWe grabbed that $114 billion and pulled it out of Social Security. \nBecause of that, we shortened the life. We tried to do this without \nknocking them over. This was just another variation of the same set of \nnumbers.\n  So now you know the reality. We have some on Medicare. But when you \nstart to see some of the charts, we have charts that say that, if there \nis not a substantial economic expansion, Medicare could be 7 years and \nthe trust fund is substantially drained.\n  Remember, these are supposed to be freestanding trust funds. The way \nthe law works is you start to cut benefits. We need to avoid these. So \nhow do you do it? How do you avoid these?\n  The first argument I want to make is it is next year when we start to \ndiscuss tax reform, a tax reform that maximizes economic growth, maybe \nnot the benefit for the group you belong to or the industry you are in, \nbut the tax reform that benefits the entire country to maximize \neconomic growth.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am also asking for a revolution in the way we look at \nthe regulatory state. There are a few people who have written about \nthis. There are a few people who have thought about this.\n  For a couple of years I sat on the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee. We would have debates back and forth with the EPA on: ``How \ndid you get to this regulation? How did you find this out?''\n  They would say: ``We are not going to give you our data sets. It is \nproprietary. We are just doing the command and control.''\n  I learned there is this intense frustration. There is this fight out \nthere between I believe people who make money off the regulatory state \nand those who functionally pay for it, which is all of us.\n  The fact of the matter is the crowdsourcing of information and data. \nAre we actually doing the most efficient methodology to have clean \nwater and the most efficient technology to have clean air?\n  How about in my financial world? I sit on the Financial Services \nCommittee. This is going to get a little geeky. But, in 2008, the bonds \nthat were backed by mortgages blew up.\n  All of a sudden we found out there were lots and lots and lots of \nmortgages and deeds of trust rolled into these bonds that stopped \nperforming. There were lots of debates and discussions of these were \ntoxic loans, they were Alt-A that were put into these bonds, whatever \nthe reason. How did we not know?\n  So we set up a financial system that bundled these mortgages into \nbonds. Are you telling me that, from the regulatory state, if we had \ndesigned an information-based regulatory system where those of us--when \nI was Maricopa County treasurer and you were looking at buying debt to \npark the cash you had so you would get a rate of return for your \ntaxpayers, you would pick up the phone and call Moody's or call S or \ncall the rating and say: ``Hey, is this a safe bond? Is this A rated? \nIs it AAA?'' or whatever it is. You would get a phone call back. They \nwould say: ``Yes. It is fine.'' That was your due diligence.\n  How about a system that uses information so the information flows \nsaying: ``Hey, the bond you are looking at, you now have 5 percent of \nthe loans on it that aren't making their payments,'' ``Hey, do you \nrealize this bond has an intense geographic concentration so, if \nsomething happens in that geography, you are going to have ever greater \ndifficulties?''\n  All of a sudden the regulators that are built into the system come in \nand bayonet the wounded after the war is lost. Sorry. That was one of \nmy father's favorite sayings.\n  But the fact of the matter is the way we do much of our regulation is \nafter the sins have happened instead of using information to avoid the \nmistake in the beginning. So I am making the argument that that type \nof revolutionary thinking in the way we, as a society, regulate will \nmaximize economic growth.\n\n  On immigration, you need to change this immigration system. When you \nrealize that two-thirds of the immigration population is familial--and \nI know this sets people's hair on fire.\n  But if you are going to take in 1 million, 1.2 million, legal \nimmigrants into the country this year, you do realize two-thirds of \nthat population functionally gets to come to the United States because \nof a family member, where much of the rest of the world, whether it be \nAustralia, New Zealand, Great Britain, Canada, have moved to a system \nthat maximizes talent because they figured out they desperately need \neconomic growth to keep their commitments.\n  But there is a fourth one that is almost never talked about and I can \nactually start to see here in Congress and I see it in our State \nlegislatures, and that is actually the new economy.\n  I promise sometime when we get back in January we are going to do a \npresentation of how the new economy can both change how the government \nfunctions, but also, if we can get out of its way, it provides \nopportunity for everyone and, hopefully, maybe some escape velocity \neconomically.\n  So let me throw you first just a simple concept. How many of you out \nthere have ever ridden in a ride share or seen these things they call \nlike Zipcar where you hit the button on your phone and you are able to \njust use a car? Why doesn't government do that?\n  I think we saw some data that there are 176,000 cars that are either \nowned or leased by the Federal Government. We found one small agency \nthat had more vehicles than employees.\n  So if I came to you right now and said: ``Let's rethink this. Does \nthis agency here belong owning their own little vehicle fleet and this \nagency that is right next door belong owning theirs?''\n  Why wouldn't you pool them together and create a simple app that does \ntwo things? It says the cars belong to everyone in the agency. You hit \nthe button and say: ``I need to use one today, and tomorrow I don't \nneed one'' and, ``Oh, by the way, the technology says that I am going \nto this community'' and it tells you who else from the bureaucracy is \nalso going in the same direction.\n  It is already happening in the private sector. Now think of it even \nmore expansive. Why is it just the Federal Government? Why wouldn't it \nbe your State, your local, your tribal?\n  Another example we are working on right now in Arizona and we are \nactually working on with some of my State legislators is this concept \nfor capital assets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I live in Maricopa County. It is maybe the third or \nfourth most populous county in the country. It is made up of 30-some \ncities and tribal communities.\n  How many of those communities own the really expensive earthmovers? \nHow many of those earthmovers are used to their max every single day? \nIf they are not, why isn't a simple app created to\n\n[[Page H9367]]\n\nshare? So do this tribal community, this city, this county, and this \ngovernment each need to own their own? Why aren't they put on sharing \nplatforms?\n  The concept is real simple. Capital assets need to be maximized. It \nis like the concept of a classroom. At 3:45, when school is out, does \nthat classroom become the community college? At 7:30, does it become \nthe senior learning class? It is a building. We are paying to heat and \ncool it. It is there. We spent the capital money. How do you maximize \nthe utilization of capital assets?\n  Mr. Speaker, this is happening in the private world. Much of this \ntechnology is coming out of Silicon Valley and other hubs of innovation \nin our country. We need to open ourselves up in the government and say: \n``We need to be embracing this technology to move it to ourselves.''\n  In the last half of this, I see fights starting to break out on the \nnew technology and how it changes how we work. It changes our \noptionality. We need to understand that technology is changing our \nsociety. But if we can get out of the way, it can actually really \nprovide us some opportunities.\n  So there are crazy thoughts. We are researching these. Let's say you \nare one of these drivers, whether it be an Uber platform or something \nelse and there is this argument saying, well, you are being treated as \na self-employed 1099 or you are getting direct payments electronically \nor you are doing Airbnb or these sorts of things. How is that going to \nhelp you fund your Social Security?\n  Maybe we need to rethink it. Maybe it really is time to have that \nhonest conversation of should you be allowed to have that account that \nis truly yours and set up your technology that every time you have a \nclient and you take them and deliver them to a location, every time you \nhave guests in your Airbnb, every time you provide a certain service, \nyou can use that technology so that a little bit of that money goes to \nyour retirement account.\n  We have the technology. It would be a very low-cost way to do it. And \nwe start to engage in the technology revolution that is happening \naround us to basically embrace it, not be scared of it, and at the same \ntime use that technology to shore up what we have just talked about, \nthe devastating actuarial math we are running into.\n  Mr. Speaker, I know there is a political battle coming in this \nbecause, for some of my brothers and sisters on the other side, it is \nvery much: How do I unionize that population? How do I do this type of \ncontrol? How do I have this?\n  For many of those on the more free market side, we are making the \nargument for individuals to be able to use technology and the new \neconomy to pursue their optionality, maximizing the value of their \ntime. They need to be allowed to do that.\n  We are Americans. Being free is part of the basic--it is supposed to \nbe part of our DNA. At the same time, use that same creativity, that \nsame optionality, to not be afraid of it, but to use that technology to \nactually grow the economy and embrace the empowerment of individuals to \ndeal with the very problems we were showing on those slides.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9367-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9367-H9369]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  RESOLUTION TO HONOR AND PRAISE THE AMERICAN JEWISH COMMITTEE ON ITS \n                           109TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the subject matter of my \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as I move forward with this \nSpecial Order hour, because the AJC has been very close in Houston, \nTexas, to a leading citizen, the Honorable William Alexander Lawson, I \nthink it appropriate to let it be known that the AJC stands in sympathy \nwith a good many persons with reference to Pastor Lawson's loss of his \nwife, the Honorable Audrey Lawson.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  She will be funeralized on Friday at 11 a.m.--that would be central \nstandard time--in Houston, Texas, at the Wheeler Avenue Baptist Church. \nPastor Lawson has worked very closely with the AJC and many other \nJewish organizations. I would dare say that he has been a nexus between \nvarious communities and the Jewish community. I am saddened by his loss \nand want him to know that the AJC as well as my good offices send him \nour condolences.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, we are here to present H. Res. 518. H. Res. 518 \nhonors and praises the American Jewish Committee on the occasion of its \n109th anniversary. I am proud to tell you, Mr. Speaker, that on the \ncampus today here at the Capitol we have visitors from the AJC. We have \nRichard Foltin, who is the Director of National and Legislative Affairs \nin AJC's Office of Government and International Affairs, in Washington, \nD.C. He happens to be accompanied by an intelligent, beautiful lady, \nwho works with the AJC. Her name is Daniela Erazo. They are here, and I \nam proud to let them know that we are most excited about their being \nhere on the occasion of the introduction of this resolution.\n  This resolution has been cosigned by a good number of Members of \nCongress. I would like to, because this is very special to us, give \ntheir names so that the Record will be clear as to who the cosponsors \nare.\n  The original cosponsors are: the Honorable Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, \nFlorida's 27th District; the Honorable Emanuel Cleaver, Missouri's \nFifth District; the Honorable Steve Cohen, Tennessee's Ninth District; \nthe Honorable Alcee Hastings, Florida's 20th District; the Honorable \nSander Levin, Minnesota's Ninth District; the Honorable Jerrold Nadler, \nNew York's 10th District; the Honorable Charles Rangel, New York's 13th \nDistrict; the Honorable David Scott, Georgia's 13th District; the \nHonorable Frederica Wilson, Florida's 24th District; the Honorable Tom \nMacArthur, New Jersey's Third District; and, of course, the Honorable \nDebbie Wasserman Schultz, Florida's 23rd District, whom I mentioned \nearlier.\n  This resolution is one that acknowledges the mission of the AJC, \nwhich is to enhance the well-being of the Jewish people and Israel, and \nto advocate and advance Jewish rights and Jewish values in the United \nStates and around the world. The AJC is committed to combating racial \nprejudice, anti-Semitism, and sponsoring and supporting issues related \nto the State of Israel.\n  The AJC has a rich history. It was founded on November 11, 1906, in \nNew York City, by a group of American Jews who wanted to raise \nawareness about some of the atrocities that were taking place against \nJewish people in Russia as well as in other places. This leadership \nwent on to add as its list of duties, I suppose, doing all that they \ncould to help in the fight against racism here in this country.\n  I am proud to tell you that the local chapter of the AJC in Houston, \nTexas, currently has as its director, Randy Czarlinsky. He is a dear \nfriend. The president is Marcia Nichols. She is a friend as well.\n  But I am also going to mention a friend who was there in 1989. His \nname is David Mincberg. David Mincberg and I worked together. I was the \npresident of the Houston branch of the NAACP. At that time, we had an \nunfortunate circumstance occur in Houston, Texas. We had a city council \nperson make a racial slur. The AJC and the NAACP worked very closely \ntogether.\n  David Mincberg was one of the leading citizens to stand up and \ndenounce this racial slur that took place and call for the resignation \nof the city council person. It had been prognosticated by one of our \nlocal persons who was in the community associated with political \nscience.\n  He went on to explain that this person probably could have won. I \nhave not mentioned his name. I see no need to. He probably could have \nwon his office because there still was some support for him--\nsubstantial support, I might add. But because David Mincberg and the \nAJC stood with the African American community, by and\n\n[[Page H9368]]\n\nthrough the NAACP and other organizations, this city council person \ndecided to apologize and to resign from office.\n  This is but one example of how the AJC has made a difference in the \nlives of people who are not directly associated with the AJC. I think \nall people of goodwill are by virtue of the fact that the AJC is on a \nmission to do those things that will enhance the quality of life for \npeople around the world, especially as they suffer from discrimination \nand other forms of atrocities that would cause them to have a quality \nof life that is unacceptable.\n  To this end, I would like to just mention some of the varied \ncircumstances that the AJC has been involved with.\n  When Hurricane Katrina hit in 2005, the AJC organized a delegation to \ntravel to the Gulf to bring relief and aid to the victims. This was \nquite an effort that the AJC put together. It contributed about $1.9 \nmillion in relief funds to help these victims to make sure that they \nhad housing and to make sure that places of worship were rebuilt.\n  I would also add that the AJC, in 2010, received a wonderful honor. \nDillard University decided that they would dedicate their new Distance \nLearning Center in honor of the AJC, as the AJC donated about $200,000 \nto this university.\n  In 2005, the AJC's efforts with reference to the tsunami relief fund \nshould be acknowledged. This tsunami relief fund consisted of about \n$900,000 that went to help persons who were the victims of the tsunami \nin the Indian Ocean. This was a major disaster. I am proud to know that \nthe AJC played a role in helping persons to receive not only what we \ncall relief, but actually an understanding that they were not alone, \nthat there were people in distant places who were willing to stand with \nthem to make sure that they received the help that human beings beset \nby tragedy richly deserve.\n  In 2004, with the Dominican Republic and Haiti when there were \nfloods, the AJC made a contribution.\n  In 2001, there was an earthquake in El Salvador, and the AJC made a \ndonation.\n  In 2000, with the Lebanese refugees in northern Israel, the AJC made \na donation to assist them.\n  And in 1999, with the Muslim refugees in Kosovo, the AJC made a \nfinancial contribution.\n  The AJC has been there in most of the major disasters around the \nworld to be a hand to those in times of need, as evidenced by the \nrecord that I am building.\n  I would also note that the AJC was there in 1954. In 1954, the NAACP \nwas litigating Brown v. Board of Education. The AJC filed an amicus \nbrief in this case supporting the efforts of the NAACP and the other \norganizations--there were many--but the AJC was one of the leading \norganizations helping us to fight the discrimination that was taking \nplace in our schools, such that the schools would be open to all, that \nthere would no longer be segregation in schools in the United States of \nAmerica.\n  As a result of what the AJC and the NAACP were able to accomplish, \nthe rest, of course, is history. Brown v. Board of Education was won by \nthe NAACP, with the aid of other organizations, including the AJC. We \nnow have integrated schools. I would dare say that, without the help of \nthe AJC and donations and helping us with some of the test materials \nwith reference to how people are impacted by segregation--the \npsychological evaluations and the materials related thereto--without \nthese things, we may not have won that lawsuit. The AJC has been \ninstrumental in helping us with this type of invidious discrimination.\n\n  In 1965, the AJC presented Reverend Dr. Martin Luther King with the \nAmerican Liberties Medallion for his exceptional advancement of the \nprinciples of human liberty. Dr. King, as you know, was a freedom \nfighter for all. While he was doing this, he had the aid and comfort of \nthe AJC. The AJC was there to help him with marches and with the \nprotest movement, but also there to help him as he went through some of \nthe difficult times. I can remember the Edmund Pettus Bridge, for \nexample. There were members of the AJC who were on-site to march with \nDr. King after what we call Bloody Sunday had taken place.\n  The AJC and its members also established the Transatlantic Institute \nto promote Transatlantic cooperation for global security, Middle East \npeace, and human rights. This was done in 2004.\n  The AJC is a champion not only of human rights for Israel, but also \nfor Palestinians. The AJC supports a two-state solution. The AJC \nencourages peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian leadership. \nThe AJC believes that a peaceful solution with the parties negotiating \nit is the best way to have a long and lasting peace in the Middle East.\n  I must tell you that I have been involved with the Houston AJC as \nthey go through some of these difficult issues and talk through them \nand work through them, and I am honored to support the AJC in its \nefforts to bring peace to not only Israel and Palestine, but also to \nthe entire Middle East. The AJC is very much concerned about the \ndiaspora on the whole, but more specifically about their friends and \nneighbors in the Middle East and bringing peace.\n  The AJC, in 2007, joined me and other colleagues, especially \nRepresentative Laura Richardson, in a resolution that we had, H. Res. \n826, a resolution condemning noose intimidation.\n  In 2006, we had, at that time, some persons who felt it necessary to \nhang nooses in various places to intimidate and to incite others to do \ndastardly deeds. The AJC joined with us to denounce this type of \nbehavior. As a result, while I don't say that there are no nooses being \nplaced in places for the purpose of intimidation, I can say that they \nare not as prevalent as they were back in 2006-2007. I am honored at \nthe AJC was there to help us with this endeavor.\n  In 2008, the AJC visited South Sudan to study how Israel could assist \nin the preparation for South Sudanese independence. I had the honor of \ngoing to Sudan myself. I was not with the AJC at the time, but I did \nhave an opportunity to see some of the needs of the people. They were \ngreat, they were many, they were varied, and the AJC was there to \nassist with the independence movement.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The AJC does things that go far beyond what, perhaps, many think it \nshould be doing or has been doing.\n  In 2015, the AJC joined the chorus of civil rights groups in \ncondemning bans on Muslims from entering the United States. This is one \nof their most recent activities. The AJC believes that religion should \nbe respected and that, because a person happens to be of a given \nreligion, it is no reason to conclude that a person can be banned or \nshould be banned from the United States of America. The AJC respects \nall religions.\n  The AJC is an entity that established a full-time office in Israel. \nIt did this for the first time such that it would have a means by which \nit could advocate for peace between the Israelis and their Arab \nneighbors; so they wanted to make sure that they had an office on the \nground in Israel. While it appears to be a Jewish organization--and it \nis--it still wanted to make sure that its presence was immediately \nknown in the State of Israel.\n  The AJC has long supported comprehensive immigration reform, and they \nwant this type of reform done once the security of the Nation's borders \nhas been put in place. Once the borders are secure, the AJC wants that \ncomprehensive immigration reform. In fact, it would be great if it \ncould all happen at the same time, and we push for this.\n  The AJC is an organization of goodwill, is an organization that has \nwithstood the test of time, and is an organization that is diverse in \nevery aspect of its existence as its membership is very diverse, and it \npreaches diversity.\n  In Houston, Texas, the AJC has, on many occasions, talked about the \nrich diversity of Houston, Texas. In fact, on an annual basis, an event \nis sponsored in Houston, Texas, wherein diversity is celebrated. We \ntalk about this at what is called America's Table. We talk about all of \nthe various ethnicities that are at America's Table, and we talk about \nhow we all came to America's Table. We talk about the greatness of \nAmerica. We talk about how there is but one race--the human race. We \ncelebrate our rich diversity such that we can appreciate each other.\n  The AJC has made it possible for people who may not have had an \nopportunity to meet and to greet each other\n\n[[Page H9369]]\n\nin an informal setting to sit at the table of brotherhood and to get to \nknow each other in such a way as to not only develop a relationship but \nas to develop a friendship. The AJC is a supporter of relationship \nbuilding, but, more importantly, of establishing relationships that can \nlead to friendships.\n  So I am honored today, Mr. Speaker, to present H. Res. 518, a \nresolution to help us acknowledge the great work of the AJC, not only \nthis year, but in each year to come, such that this House of \nRepresentatives will annually record and recognize the accomplishments \nof the AJC and its members.\n  I mentioned Sander Levin, who is from Michigan. I may have said \n``Minnesota'' earlier. I want to correct the Record. He is a dear \nfriend and a great supporter of this resolution, and he is also a \nperson who has been in the fight for human rights. That means human \nrights as they relate to all people, not just to some people.\n  I am honored to close with a very brief word about the AJC and what I \nsee in the future.\n  I believe that the AJC, given its history, is going to help us write \na future that will bring peace to Israel and its neighbors. I believe \nthat the AJC has demonstrated that it not only wants to be of benefit \nto Israel, but also to its neighbors. I believe that, with its \ninvolvement here and in Israel, the AJC is going to make a difference.\n  I think that the AJC, because of its history, will help us through \nthis immigration reform debate. The AJC does a lot of research, and it \nhas a lot of intelligence on how this type of circumstance, with people \nliving in the shadows, can impact the lives of people beyond their \nphysical existence and also beyond their mental existence. I am proud \nthat the AJC is providing this type of intelligence.\n  I believe that the AJC, in the future, will help us with issues \nrelated to police community relations. The AJC is always available to \nhelp us when we have these turbulent times, when there are \ncircumstances that must be addressed by communities that are grieving. \nThe AJC helps us to bring the communities together so that we can, at \nsome point, come to a conclusion that is beneficial to the community as \na whole and to the persons who have been injured or harmed.\n  In the future, I believe, as the AJC moves forward with its various \nprograms, it will help us with the hopes and with the aspirations of \npeople who are suffering in places around the world from various \nnatural disasters. I think they will do even more to help persons who \nare suffering from natural disasters. They have done an awful lot in \nevery circumstance that is mentionable to date, but I do think that \nthey will do even more. They have a wide reach, and they make sure that \nthey are present, in some way, in order to be of assistance.\n  The AJC has been there. My prediction is that it will be there and \nthat it will make a difference when it is present. I am honored to have \nreceived this time, and I do trust that Members who have statements \nwill place them in the Record.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. WASSERMAN SCHULTZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as a proud original \ncosponsor of House Resolution 518, Honoring and Praising the American \nJewish Committee on the Occasion of its 109th anniversary, and to more \nbroadly commend and celebrate the work of AJC. Thank you to my \ncolleague Representative Al Green for organizing this special order \nhour.\n  Originally founded to raise awareness about the targeting of Jewish \ncommunities in Russia, AJC has become a leading voice and advocate \nagainst racism and prejudice here in the United States and around the \nworld. Rooted in the Jewish values of tikkun olam--repairing the \nworld--and of being a voice for those who cannot speak for themselves, \nAJC has been a key actor in pivotal movements and legislative victories \nincluding the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act, and for \ncomprehensive immigration reform. As we continue to work to fulfill the \ncomplete visions of those movements, AJC will continue to be on the \nfront lines.\n  AJC has partnered with governments all over the world to promote \ntolerance and understanding and successfully worked to restore and \npreserve Jewish historical and cultural centers from India to Morocco \nto Argentina. This work is critical not only for supporting Jewish \ncommunities and historical memory abroad, but also for the broader goal \nof promoting intercultural and interreligious understanding in the face \nof hatred and violence.\n  On a more personal level, as a young legislator in the Florida House, \nthe American Jewish Committee took me on my first trip to Israel in \n1995. That mission was nothing short of transformative. Although I felt \na connection to the land of Israel as a Jew, that trip was the first of \nmany that has deepened my connection to the land, to the history and \nreinforcing my steadfast commitment to supporting the state of Israel \nand the U.S.-Israel relationship. With threats coming from across and \nwithin her borders, our support for this relationship has perhaps never \nbeen more important.\n  So again, I commend the American Jewish Committee for its work on \nbehalf of the Jewish community, on behalf of Israel, and on behalf of \nall the people its work impacts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9369-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9369-H9372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LIFTING THE CRUDE OIL EXPORT BAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hill). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Dakota (Mr. Cramer) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk a little bit about one \ncomponent of the omnibus tax extender package that is dominating the \nlegislative agenda as we wrap up this year.\n  The one piece of the package that I want to talk about is the lifting \nof the crude oil export ban, which is an issue that has passed twice \nnow in the House of Representatives--in fact, as a stand-alone bill. \nH.R. 702, the lifting of the crude oil export ban, passed with 62 \npercent of the vote.\n  As is often the case, good bills that are passed by the House often \nlanguish in the Senate for a number of reasons. Perhaps one of the main \nreasons bills languish in the Senate is that their rules are as \nantiquated as is this export ban on crude oil.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to take some time to talk about this provision \nand why it is important that we lift the crude oil export ban. I want \nto talk a little bit about the history that led to the export ban in \nthe first place, and I want to talk about a more optimistic future as \nwe look at the oil renaissance--what it has created and what it can \ncreate.\n  As I said, the export ban really is an antiquated law. It was put in \nplace 42 years ago, which was a very different time in our country. It \nwas different for a number of reasons, not the least of which being \nthat the ban on exporting crude oil came at a time when our country did \nnot enjoy energy abundance as we do today. It, rather, suffered from a \nscarcity of energy resources--a scarcity of oil, a scarcity of all \nkinds of energy--and, certainly, from a scarcity of the products that \nare created by oil. It suffered even from a scarcity, frankly, of some \nof the technologies that make the development of fossil fuels and, yes, \nof new, cleaner--greener, if you will--energy sources.\n  We are nothing in this country but for our innovation. I think \ninnovation is the key to much of our success. It is not that the United \nStates really had a scarcity of resources, but that, rather, we had a \nscarcity of technology to develop those resources. As the technology \ndeveloped to get more and more of our energy resources and to develop \nthem, it also progressed to make it more and more efficient to develop \nthem and to make it cleaner to develop them. I am happy to elaborate.\n  I represent the great State of North Dakota. I am the only Member of \nthe people's House from the State of North Dakota. We have just over \n700,000 people in my State. So, like my 434 colleagues, I represent, \nroughly, 700,000 citizens. It just so happens that they make up a \nState.\n  In just the past few years alone, we have lost 80,000 U.S. jobs, just \nin the last year, 80,000 U.S. jobs, because our oil producers have been \nforced to scale back their rigs by nearly 60 percent. That is the \nresult of a collapse in price.\n  Why is there a collapse in price? There is a collapse in price \nlargely because we are producing a lot more, and, of course, we cannot \nsell the product outside of the United States. Obviously, you can't \nproduce more than your consumers can take in.\n  In North Dakota, we grow a lot of crops. We grow a lot of food to \nfeed a hungry world. In fact, we are the number one producer of \nanywhere from 12 to 16 or 18 crops depending on the year. We produce a \nlot of wheat, but we can't begin to eat it all. We produce a lot of\n\n[[Page H9370]]\n\ncattle. We produce a lot of honey. We produce a lot of sunflowers. We \nproduce a lot of beans. We produce a lot of products that we couldn't \nbegin to consume in this country, but there are hungry people all over \nthe world who would love to consume it.\n  So we are always innovating, creating new breeds and technologies and \nfarming practices and chemicals and, yes, modifying the product. Why? \nIt is because there is not more land on which to grow more food, but \nthere are many more people who need to eat it throughout the world.\n  The same is true, in many respects, of energy. Yet now, as we have \ncome upon this time with this renaissance that was created--again, not \nbecause God suddenly put more oil under the ground, but because of \ntechnology--the advancement of horizontal drilling and hydraulic \nfracturing has unlocked billions of barrels of oil that were always \nthere or were at least there for several years--decades, centuries, \nmillennia. It has unlocked it because of technology.\n  We talk a lot about energy independence and about the goal to get \nthere. Yes, that is a noble goal. I would submit, though, that more \nimportant than that is energy security. And I have heard the Chair, Mr. \nSpeaker, talk about the topic of energy security with great eloquence. \nEnergy security is like food security. It is the ability to develop and \nto produce what you need as well as to produce for the global \nmarketplace, increasing our influence in the world. I am going to get \ninto that in a little bit.\n  Let's not forget about the jobs. Let me talk for a minute about the \njobs in my home State of North Dakota, which is now the second leading \nproducing State of oil, second only to Texas.\n  I was an economic development director for our State at a time when \nwe were beginning to diversify our economy, at a time when out-\nmigration was just starting to plateau. Since that time, we have become \nthe fastest growing economy in the country and have the fastest growing \npopulation in the country. We now have the second highest per capita \npersonal income in the country and the lowest unemployment rate in the \ncountry. In fact, we still, even with this downturn, have more jobs \nthan we have people looking for work in North Dakota.\n  I have seen people go from poverty to prosperity. There is nothing \nwrong with that. I have seen truck drivers become fleet owners. I have \nseen short order cooks become restauranteurs. I have seen carpenters \nbecome developers.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  I have seen people who have a water well become entrepreneurs selling \nwater for hydraulic fracturing.\n  I have seen the renaissance lift people up. While a rising tide lifts \nall boats, they don't necessarily all get lifted at the exact same \ntime. So there is a little bit of massaging and intervention that goes \non to help people even during the boom, if you will, to keep up.\n  According to an IHS Energy study, for every one job created in the \noil and gas sector, there are six jobs created in the broader economy. \nI can tell you, Mr. Speaker, from my experience in North Dakota, that \nis definitely true. It is not just the oil rig worker. It is not just \nthe truck driver. It is not just the pipeline worker.\n  All of them, as important as they are and as good of jobs as they \nare, it is that restaurant owner. It is the hair dresser. It is the \nMain Street retailer, the person selling groceries. It is the \nentrepreneur who comes up with an idea no one else had thought of \nbefore. It is the entrepreneur that sees the problem that needs a fix, \nfinds the fix, sells it and markets it and becomes an employer as well, \nrather than just an employee.\n  By the way, the American jobs created by the oil renaissance of \nrecent years exists in all 50 States.\n  Speaker Ryan put out this chart today, this little graphic piece, \nidentifying the opportunities that lifting the crude oil export ban \nwould have that go beyond the renaissance that we have experienced in \nrecent years. Lifting the oil export ban would create an estimated 1 \nmillion American jobs in nearly all 50 States. That is because the \nsupply chain that it takes to produce the oil, to discover the oil, to \nmove the oil, to refine the oil, to finance, to do the accounting, it \nis in every State.\n  In fact, the President's home State of Illinois is one of the \ngreatest beneficiaries of the oil renaissance. Many of these 1 million \njobs would be created right there within a matter of years. It would \nadd, imagine now, $170 billion--with a B--to our gross domestic product \nevery year.\n  At a time when we are looking for revenue to meet the priorities of \nour Nation, at a time while unemployment has come down, we still have a \nvery, very low workforce participation rate, at a time when our \neducation system doesn't always match the opportunities, we have the \nopportunity with these additional dollars and the additional job \nopportunities to meet the demands of a growing economy. All the while, \nwe could, with lifting the crude oil export ban, meet the market \ndemands around the world.\n  Mr. Speaker, I happen to think that history can be a great teacher. I \nsaid earlier that I want to address the history or the context of this \nexport ban. How did this come to be?\n  You know, as I said, much has been written and said by me and my \ncolleagues and others in the industry how lifting the export ban would \nbe good for our economy, how it would be good for job creation, and how \nit would be good for the United States of America. The history of how \nit came to be, I think, is useful.\n  It was the Yom Kippur war in 1972 led by Syria--an attack by Syria \nbacked up by, Mr. Speaker, none other than the Soviet Union--against \nour friends, Israel. It was the United States, as has been the rich \ntradition of our country, who came to the defense of our best friend \nand ally in democracy who shares our values in the Middle East, Israel. \nSyria and the Soviet Union pitted against Israel, backed by the United \nStates.\n  The Yom Kippur war led to the oil embargoes of 1973, which caused a \nreaction, leading eventually to this crude oil export ban. You might \nrecall in the seventies, Mr. Speaker--I do, barely, but I do--the gas \nshortages, the rationing of gas, sales limited to 10 gallons of gas per \ncustomer, as is illustrated in this poster, this real picture of the \n1970s.\n  Now, while it might have been a well-meaning policy to put a ban on \nexporting crude oil with the idea that somehow we could produce enough \noil in the United States or, at least, we ought to hoard what we have, \nit is not like the United States was a leading producer of oil. We \nweren't what we are today.\n  Today, we are the number one producer of oil and gas. Gas, as you \nknow, can be exported. By the way, refined petroleum products can also \nbe exported.\n  So that is what led to the ban. The problem is, as I said earlier, \nthis isn't 1973 anymore. This is not 1979. This is not 1989. This is a \ntime when we have energy abundance. We have oil abundance to the point \nwhere we have every storage facility, including pipelines, ships, and \ntanks, full of oil. We are still producing light, sweet crude, I might \nadd. In a little bit, I will get to the difference between that and \nthis heavy sour crude and the various market mixes that demand that.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I started out reminding the Chamber, we passed H.R. \n702 with 62 percent of the vote, a large bipartisan vote. That was a \nbill introduced by my friend, Representative Joe Barton of Texas. He is \nin the Chamber with us, and I would like to yield such time as he would \nlike to explain why this is such an important piece of this week's \nomnibus and tax package.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Barton).\n  Mr. BARTON. Mr. Speaker, the first thing that I want to do is commend \nthe gentleman from North Dakota for his hard work on this. He is an \noriginal cosponsor of H.R. 702. He is a valued member of the ad hoc \nwhip team that we put together.\n  He and I have worked the floor. We have had dinners with undecided \nMembers. We have helped coordinate action efforts with some of the \noutside groups that are supportive.\n  You have been unflagging in his help on this. I could say similar \nthings about the Speaker in the chair. The gentleman from Arkansas has \nalso been a valued member of our team.\n\n[[Page H9371]]\n\n  What I want to focus on is to explain to the Members what this means \nstrategically to the United States of America. The world produces and \nconsumes about 95 million barrels of oil per day right now; 95 million. \nThree countries, the United States, Saudi Arabia, and Russia, combined \nproduce about 30 percent of that, a little over 30 million barrels a \nday between those three countries. Right now, Saudi Arabia would be \nnumber one, Russia would be number two, and the United States would be \nnumber three at about 9 million barrels a day production here in the \nUnited States.\n  Until this bill becomes law, which we hope will pass the House and \nthe Senate and the President will sign it this weekend, if you want to \nchange the world oil markets, it takes five or six phone calls. The \nchairman of OPEC, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting \nCountries, who have their headquarters in Vienna, would make four or \nfive phone calls to the various oil ministers of Saudi Arabia, Iran, \nLibya, Nigeria.\n  If they all agree on a price and a production quota, they have a \nmeeting, they get all the member states to ratify it, and they set the \nprice. A handful of people set the world price. That is the way it has \nbeen done since the mid-1970s during the Arab oil embargo.\n  If we repeal the ban on U.S. crude oil exports, which I think we are \ngoing to do, and the President signs the bill next week, we have about \n500 million barrels of oil in storage in Oklahoma, Louisiana, and \nTexas, up in the Midwest where the gentleman is from. Believe it or \nnot, there is some in California and some even up on the East Coast. \nThere is privately owned oil that is just sitting there.\n\n  The chairman of OPEC calls those same five oil ministers and says, \nBoys, we need to raise the price. We are going to cut production. Each \nof you guys, your nation, we agree to cut production to half a million \nbarrels a day. We are going to tighten up the market, and we are going \nto raise the price. And they all agree to do it.\n  Well, that word is going to get out. Somebody in Houston is going to \nsay, Well, I have got 10 million barrels right here. Somebody in Corpus \nChristi, somebody in New Orleans, somebody in Mobile, Alabama, somebody \nin New York City or Long Beach, California, there will be oil on the \nmarket to replace the production cutbacks of OPEC, if not in minutes, \nin hours.\n  What we are doing is taking the keys from OPEC and giving the keys to \nthe American people, the free market. Who has the biggest oil reserves \nin the world, if you include our alternative shale reserves? The United \nStates of America. Who has the best technology in the world? United \nStates of America. Who has the best people, the best seismic engineers, \nthe best production engineers, the best oil field workers, the best \ntruck drivers, the best pipeliners? The United States of America.\n  So, by golly, within a week, we are going to unleash the free market \ncompetitive enterprise of the American people on the world oil market. \nThese other countries--Russia, Saudi Arabia, Iran, Iraq, Nigeria, and \nLibya--they can increase production a little bit, but there is only one \ncountry in the world that could literally double production within 4 or \n5 years. Guess who that is? The United States of America\n  So what we are doing this week in the omnibus--there are lots of \nreasons to be for it. If you want to take control of energy policy away \nfrom a handful of oil ministers who are primarily in the Middle East, \nvote for this bill and put control in the market. Let the Americans \ncompete with the Mexicans and the Canadians and the Saudis and the \nIraqis and the Russians and anybody else who wants to sell oil.\n  We don't realize what we are about to do, but it has tremendous \neconomic and strategic implications for freedom everywhere in the \nworld. You, sir, from North Dakota have helped make that possible. The \ngentleman in the chair from Arkansas has helped make that possible. The \n262 Members of this House, Republicans and Democrats--Henry Cuellar of \nLaredo, Texas--has helped make that possible.\n  Next week is going to be a great week, it is going to be a milestone \nweek, and we are going to look back, this is when we took back control \nfrom OPEC and gave it to the free market and to the American \nentrepreneurial spirit.\n  I thank Congressman Cramer for his hard work. I am proud to have him \nas one of the leaders in this effort.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Barton for his kind words \nand his tireless effort on behalf of the employees, the workers, the \neconomy of our country, and for articulating so beautifully and so \nperfectly, without rehearsal, the next chapter of what I began to talk \nabout when I talk about the historical context. We are reliving much of \nthat history right now.\n  As we think about ISIS, as we think about Iran and a path to a \nnuclear weapon, when we think about what is going on with Russia's \nmovement further and further into Europe and its growing influence, the \nbear is back. Here we have the opportunity to use the peaceful tools of \nenergy development rather than the weapons of war.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Never has the world needed it more. You talked about the bipartisan \neffort and how proud we are to work hand in hand with our Democratic \nMember friends, what a blessing that has been. One of the best, a \ngentleman that I have grown to not just know and appreciate, but to \nlove, is Representative David Scott of Georgia, whose heart for the \nthings that matter has in many ways changed mine, I have to admit. He \nhas changed mine.\n  He has offered amendments to multiple bills, an amendment to multiple \nbills that I have now joined him in offering. It is not one on this \nbill, but I want to read the amendment because it is relevant to what \nwe are doing. It is a simple amendment.\n  Representative Scott from Georgia offered this, and I join him in it, \nif not as an amendment, at least as an instruction. I quote now from \nhis amendment:\n\n       Knowing that young Black men in the United States ages 18 \n     to 37 are the hardest hit, at a 38 percent unemployment rate, \n     and as high as 50 percent in some of our States and cities, \n     the U.S. Congress, through this act, strongly requests the \n     labor unions and contractors who will participate in the \n     development of our oil infrastructure to actively recruit \n     qualified said young Black men ages 18 to 37 for employment \n     with their existing apprenticeship programs.\n\n  His amendment goes on to say:\n\n       These labor union apprenticeship programs will be conducted \n     in conjunction with the National Electrical Contractors \n     Association and the United Association of Journeymen and \n     Apprentices of the Plumbing and Pipe Fitting Industry of the \n     United States and Canada, under the auspices of the National \n     Joint Apprenticeship and Training Committee, which allows \n     apprentices to ``Earn While You Learn.''\n\n  As I said earlier, if we, as capitalists, people who support the free \nenterprise system--and this is clearly support of free markets--if we \nbelieve that a rising tide can lift all boats, let's lend a hand. Let's \nprove it. Let's prove it by giving more opportunities to populations \nthat have disadvantages in our marketplace and prove to them that we \ncan, in fact, lift all boats.\n  I might add--and, Chairman Barton, if you want to explain some of \nthis and comment on this--there is another important provision that was \nin H.R. 702 that is also part of this bill, and that gets to the use of \nsupport for the maritime security program. Would you be willing to \nshare a couple minutes about that, because that is an important part of \nwhat we are doing.\n  Mr. BARTON. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. CRAMER. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. BARTON. We have a fleet of privately owned ships that are \nnormally in private commercial operation and that are owned by the \ncompanies that operate here in the ports of the United States. We pay a \nsmall fee each year from the Department of Defense so that, if these \nships ever need to be used to transport military supplies overseas, \nthey have to cease commercial operation and carry the military cargo.\n  They are only used when it is--I won't say an emergency, but a \nspecial situation. In this bill, we have some funding that increases \nthe per-ship reimbursement rate slightly so that it makes it feasible \nfor these ships to be on standby for our military to use. It was \noffered by the chairman of the full committee--I think Chairman Fred \nUpton--when our bill was on the floor, and it was included in the \nmanager's amendment. It was made part of the\n\n[[Page H9372]]\n\nbill then and is in the bill that is before us that we are going to \nvote on on Friday. It is a way to help in a cost-effective way our \nmilitary when they need lift capacity to get military supplies overseas \nin a tense situation.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Making this vehicle another all-important appropriate \nvehicle for this amendment because the main piece of the omnibus \npackage is, of course, increased spending for our defense. But you said \ncost effective. You are right, having these flagships available really \nsaves the country the cost of about $52 billion worth of building the \nships, so it is a tremendous tool.\n  Mr. BARTON. It is a good deal for the taxpayer and a good deal for \nour troops.\n  Mr. CRAMER. It definitely is. Thank you for that, and thank you again \nfor your leadership.\n  Mr. BARTON. Thank you for your leadership. I am going to have to \nexcuse myself, but thank you for this Special Order.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I am going to wrap up, as well, with another \nhistory lesson. It is so interesting. I love history. I am not one who \nlooks back a lot. I do like to look in the rearview mirror once in a \nwhile to make sure I am still going straight as I move forward. I think \nwe as a Congress and as a country need to do the same.\n  It was on this very day, December 16, 1773, that patriots at Boston \nHarbor expressed their displeasure with a foreign power's influence \nover what they felt was an essential commodity. Participants of the \nBoston Tea Party, many of whom were small-business owners, well versed \nin and practitioners of the teachings of Adam Smith and, yes, free \nmarket economics, never would have envisioned that one commodity should \nbe arbitrarily discriminated against over another, especially by their \nown government. We have an opportunity with this commodity to make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is left? I see that Chairman \nShimkus is here and might have a word or two for us.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. CRAMER. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus), my \ngood friend.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. I want to thank my colleague from North Dakota and just \nsay a couple things.\n  First of all, what we have done on the omnibus is great public \npolicy. Crude oil is a commodity like corn and beans that should be \nsold on the world market.\n  Secondly, more oil on the world market lowers the prices for crude \noil for everybody.\n  Thirdly, on the international security arena, and by focus on Europe, \nand primarily the old captive nations of Eastern Europe, is that they \nare being held hostage by energy extortion by the Russians. The more we \nput more crude oil on the world market, the more that lowers the \ninternational price. That makes them have the opportunity to be free \nand independent from a totalitarian regime that is their neighbor to \nthe east.\n  I appreciate my colleague offering me up an opportunity to address \nthis.\n  Mr. CRAMER. That is the perfect wrap-up, Mr. Shimkus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/16/house-section/article/H9372-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9372]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
