The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the President ``avoids the battle, \ncomplains, and misses opportunities.'' Those were the words of Leon \nPanetta, President Obama's former Secretary of Defense and CIA \nDirector, in 2011.\n  At the time, Panetta, along with military commanders and the Joint \nChiefs of Staff, recommended that the United States leave 24,000 troops \nin Iraq to prevent that country from falling apart and becoming \nchaotic. According to Panetta, the administration was ``so eager to rid \nitself of Iraq that it was willing to withdraw rather than lock in \narrangements that would preserve American influence and our \ninterests.''\n  So the President ignored the advice of his own Secretary of Defense \nand top commanders and pulled troops out of Iraq in 2011. The timing, \njust before the 2012 Presidential election, to me, appeared to be based \non the politics of political convenience, not our own national \ninterests.\n  In any event, what is taking place today in 2015? Enter the Islamic \nState, ISIS. ISIS took advantage of the power vacuum left by America's \nabsence. So today ISIS is stronger than ever, spreading its reign of \nterror throughout the region.\n  ISIS practices religious genocide against people that don't agree \nwith it. They have redefined the term ``barbarian'' to an all new low. \nThey rape, pillage, loot, behead, and burn those in this ISIS war \nagainst the world's people.\n  ISIS not only controls a massive amount of territory in the Middle \nEast, it also controls the minds of thousands of foreign fighters, many \nfrom the United States. It is a sophisticated criminal enterprise that \nuses any and all ways to recruit, fundraise, and spread terror. It even \nuses American social media companies to promote its cause. Through \nAmerican companies like Twitter, ISIS is instantly and freely spreading \nits cancer of Islamic extremism to teenagers, recruiting them to join \nthe jihad and then launch attacks on the streets of America.\n  Since the President announced his campaign against ISIS, we have seen \nembarrassing results. Even the President admitted that the United \nStates did not have a complete strategy.\n  The ISIS terror has been going on for over a year and we don't have a \nplan to defeat them? This doesn't make a whole lot of sense.\n  The United States must answer this question: Is ISIS a national \nsecurity threat to us? If the answer is yes, then we must defeat them; \nand Congress needs to weigh in on this and make this decision.\n  If we decide that ISIS is a national security threat, then, of \ncourse, we need strategy, a complete strategy. The administration's \nplan so far is to train mercenaries to fight ISIS. However, just this \nweek, Secretary of Defense Carter admitted that the United States has \ntrained, get this, 60 so-called moderate Syrian rebels to fight ISIS--\njust 60.\n  The $500 million program that was supposed to fund 3,000 fighters \nbefore the end of 2015 has trained 60. So if I do my math correctly, \nMr. Speaker, we are spending about $8 million per fighter right now. \nThat is abysmal. That is no way to fight and win a war against terror.\n  Also, there are more Americans fighting with ISIS rebels than we have \ntrained fighters to fight against ISIS. Meanwhile in Iraq, just 8,800 \nfighters have been trained to fight ISIS compared to the goal of \n24,000.\n  This administration's strategy to defeat ISIS seems to be in chaos. \nEven the Kurds want to do their own fighting, and they have asked us \nfor military support. Our allies want to send direct aid to the Kurds, \nbut the administration won't let them do that. They have to send it \nthrough Baghdad for some reason.\n  It is time for the administration to stop being indecisively weak and \ndo the obvious. It needs to lead in this war against ISIS, and it needs \nto listen to the commanders.\n  The United States needs to act and have a plan to defeat this \ndetermined, well-financed enemy. It is a terrorist enterprise that is \nat war with us.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n[[Page H4868]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4868-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                       TRANS-PACIFIC PARTNERSHIP\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, last month Congress dealt with a trade \npackage that centered on trade promotion authority; and those actions, \nwhile important, were really just the beginning of a very long process.\n  Many important provisions of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the TPP, \nare still unresolved. There is a meeting at the end of this month in \nHawaii where the finance ministers of 12 countries come together in an \nattempt to resolve these final questions.\n  As I pointed out in my last meeting with the President, while I think \ntrade promotion authority is important and worthy of support, that \nsupport does not imply support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Indeed, because of the protections we built into the trade promotion \nauthority, it sets an appropriately high standard for approval. \nEverybody in America will have several months to examine the proposal \nif an agreement is reached to see if it measures up before the treaty \ncan even be voted on by Congress.\n  I am hopeful that we can use this time to clarify and refine areas, \nfor example, the investor state dispute process. While the United \nStates' investor state protections for public health and consumers are \nstronger than for most countries and are separate from the foreign \ninvestor state models that are being used by the United States Chamber \nof Commerce to promote the interests of Big Tobacco to undercut efforts \nto discourage smoking, there is still room for us to improve and \nclarify the American model, and we should do so.\n  Another important area deals with trade enforcement. Agreements that \nlook good on paper, if they are not enforceable or enforced, are \nessentially meaningless. It is extremely important for the \nadministration to demonstrate its commitment to enforcement.\n  We are trying to help with legislation that I have introduced in the \nHouse that we have been able to get in part of the Senate package that \nwould create a trade enforcement fund dedicated to help make sure \nagreements are enforced.\n  Another step the administration could take immediately is to deal \nwith disturbing actions in Peru that seem to undercut commitments that \nwere made in the existing Peru free trade agreement dealing with \nillegal logging. It appears that Peru has backtracked on its \ncommitments and that illegally harvested timber is finding its way into \ninternational markets and, indeed, into the United States. It would be \na simple act for the administration to take that would demonstrate its \ncommitment to strong enforcement by starting with Peru right now.\n  Another area that I am working on deals with access to medicines. It \nappears that the TPP draft falls short on incentives for affordability \nand consumer protections and the trade promotion authority objective to \n``ensure that trade agreements foster innovation and promote access to \nmedicines.'' We need some work here.\n  The May 10 agreement that was struck in 2007, which I was pleased to \nparticipate in, struck the right balance, creating incentives for \ninnovation in pharmaceutical research and access to timely and \naffordable medicine for developing countries. This was achieved in part \nby requiring changes to provisions dealing with patent linkage where it \nlooks like TPP is moving in the wrong direction.\n  The TPP includes new provisions which, while not addressed in the May \n10 agreement, are inconsistent with its spirit and its intent of \nensuring timely access to affordable medicines in developing countries. \nFor example, with biologic medicines, it appears the United States is \nseeking both patent linkage and 12 years of data exclusivity for all \ncountries. The former would require a change in U.S. law, and the \nlatter would prevent America from changing our laws to lower the \nexclusivity period, as has been proposed in the President's own budget \nproposal. The combination of these two would have enormous cost \nimplications both at home and abroad.\n  These are examples where I am working to make sure the final \nagreement measures up to the criteria we have established in the trade \npromotion authority.\n  I urge the administration and my colleagues to be clear about our \nintent and our expectations in order for any final agreement to be \nworthy of broad support.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4868-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4868]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            BACKPACK BUDDIES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, last week I had the \npleasure of meeting with Doug Erwin. Doug is an extraordinary member of \nour West Virginia community who started the charitable organization \ncalled Backpack Buddies.\n  In the summer, Backpack Buddies gives meal supplements to children in \nelementary, middle, and high schools who received free or reduced \nlunches during the school year. Oftentimes, the meal that they receive \nat school is the only food that they eat all day.\n  Doug became concerned about what these children did for food during \nthe summer. That is when Doug started Backpack Buddies.\n  For the last 3 years, communities in my district in the great State \nof West Virginia have come together to raise money to provide food to \nthese children so they can get the extra help they need during the \nsummer. Backpack Buddies is serving, now, over 1,600 children in \nPutnam, Boone, Cabell, and Kanawha Counties this summer.\n  I would like to thank Doug, the business leaders in our community, \nand the volunteers who help make Backpack Buddies possible.\n\n\n                              War on Coal\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. On a separate issue, Mr. Speaker, \nseveral weeks ago, President Obama sent two of his top cronies in his \nwar on coal, Interior Secretary Sally Jewell and Office of Surface \nMining Director Joseph Pizarchik, to my home State of West Virginia.\n  The apparent purpose of their visit was to seek input for a new Obama \nregulation that is estimated to kill 80,000 coal jobs, but their rule \nhad already been submitted for final review. They are not interested in \nhearing from West Virginians about the impact of their policies. \nInstead, they are checking a box.\n  It is clear that nothing will stop this President from trying to \nimplement his radical environmental agenda, and I will continue to do \neverything in my power to fight back on behalf of all West Virginians. \nThat is why, this year, I introduced H.R. 1644, the STREAM Act, which \nwill stop the President's antimining regulations. I also included a \nprovision in the House budget resolution that calls for defunding that \nregulation, and I will work with the appropriators to make sure it is \nnot funded.\n  I hope my colleagues in this Chamber will join me in this fight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4868-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4868-H4869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CAMPAIGN FINANCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, since the Supreme Court decision in Citizens \nUnited, we have seen a massive wave of secret spending in our political \nsystem. There was over $100 million in dark, unregulated, and anonymous \nmoney spent in the 2014 midterm election cycle; and with the \nPresidential race right around the corner, that number is expected to \nballoon to over $600 million.\n  While the problem is easy to identify, the solution is far more \ndifficult to achieve. Reluctantly, I have concluded that it is \nnecessary to amend our Constitution to address a long line of case law \nthat began before Citizens United and prevents the Congress from \nmeaningfully regulating campaign expenditures. The constitutional \namendment must not only overturn Citizens United, but the Arizona Free \nEnterprise Club's Freedom Club PAC v. Bennett decision, which struck \ndown an Arizona law that allowed public financing of a candidate if \ntheir opponent exceeded certain spending limits.\n  The amendment is simple. It would allow Congress to set reasonable \nlimits on expenditures and allow States to set up public financing for \ncandidates if they choose to do so.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I first ran for Congress in 2000, in a campaign that turned out to be \nthe\n\n[[Page H4869]]\n\nmost expensive in U.S. history and helped propel new campaign finance \nreform. It was this first-hand experience which convinced me that our \nelections have increasingly come to be polluted by ever-increasing \namounts of unregulated outside spending.\n  Millions of dollars in soft money, spending that avoided limits \nbecause of misguided legal distinctions between contributions to a \ncandidate and independent expenditures in support of a candidate, \nplagued that 2000 race and almost every major Federal race since.\n  On my very first day in Congress, I cosponsored the McCain-Feingold \nBipartisan Campaign Finance Reform Act, which attempted to ban soft \nmoney expenditures and allowed for public financing of campaigns. The \nbill passed, and for a brief window, the campaign finance system became \nmore transparent and limited. That was, sadly, short lived.\n  With Citizens United, the Supreme Court struck down decades of \nrestrictions on corporate campaign spending and freed corporations to \nspend unlimited funds to run campaign advertisements.\n  The court has also allowed wealthy individuals and groups to spend \nwith impunity, with only a theoretical restriction that they do not \ncoordinate with campaigns, but the reality is that the FEC has \ndismissed 29 cases in which super-PACs were suspected of illegally \ncoordinating with candidates without even investigating the claims.\n  Frustrating as it is for a candidate to contend with attacks by \nsuper-PACs or soft money, as I was, disclosure laws at least allow us \nto alert voters to the special interest which is behind those \nexpenditures. Candidates being drowned out in attacks paid for by dark \nmoney, however, don't have that luxury.\n  Groups who raise dark money do so by exploiting IRS regulations, \ndesignating them ``social welfare nonprofits,'' which allow them to \noperate tax exempt and raise unlimited money completely anonymously.\n  Nothing about funneling millions in secret dollars to support \ncampaigns could be construed to be in the interest of social welfare--\nnothing. Social welfare nonprofits are supposed to limit their \npolitical activity, but IRS audits, even of groups that spend vast \namounts of their time and budget in support of candidates, are \nextremely rare.\n  Investigations into complaints of abuse can take years, at which \npoint an election will long be over, the damage done.\n  The Supreme Court has overturned decades of legal precedent, the \nregulatory process is at a standstill, and still, we watch billions \npour into campaigns and in increasingly anonymous fashion.\n  Sadly, we are left with one option, a constitutional amendment that \nallows Congress to set reasonable limits on both donations and \nexpenditures and shines the light of day on both.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4869-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                  IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my colleagues to express \na deep concern about the ongoing negotiations with Iran over the \ncountry's nuclear capabilities.\n  As many of my colleagues have noted on the floor of this House, \npreventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is critical to securing \npeace in the region and protecting U.S. interests, including our close \nally Israel.\n  It was good to hear Secretary Kerry's recent commitment not ``to \nshave anywhere at the margins in order to just get an agreement'' and \nto work for an agreement that will pass scrutiny. However, media \nreports from the negotiations in Vienna indicate that Iran has tried to \nrenegotiate the previously released framework and continues to demand \nfurther concessions from international negotiators.\n  Among the latest demands from Tehran is that all United Nations \nsanctions against the country, including the ban on the import or \nexport of conventional arms, be lifted as part of any deal.\n  Well, I have a response to that demand: unacceptable. Lifting the \narms embargo would serve only to further destabilize the Middle East \nand accelerate Iran's arming of Shiite militias.\n  The Iranians have also sought to keep hidden Iran's current and \nprevious efforts to gain nuclear weapons capability. How can the \ninternational community know with certainty that Iran is complying with \nan agreement to reduce significantly its enrichment activities if the \nfull extent of these activities is kept secret?\n  It defies logic that such a request should be made and makes far less \nsense for such a request to be given any serious consideration.\n  Likewise, demands to limit IAEA inspectors to select sites, to \ninstall absurd bureaucratic processes to access additional sites, and \nto prohibit altogether inspections of so-called military sites should \nbe fully rejected.\n  Ultimately, it is critical that any deal prevents Iran from gaining \nnuclear weapons capabilities and ensures that international inspectors \ncan validate their adherence to an agreement's negotiated terms. If \nIran cannot negotiate in good faith, then perhaps it is time to leave \nthe negotiating table altogether.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4869-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4869-H4870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      STRONG STEM EDUCATION POLICY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, in a few short hours, we are going to be \nvoting in this Chamber on a rewrite of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, which is long overdue.\n  It has been 13 years since the No Child Left Behind Act was passed, \nand many educators and probably all Members have heard a lot of the \nclumsy and unworkable provisions that need a rewrite. More importantly, \nthere are other reasons why it is time for a new law for our K-12 \nsystem.\n  Educating our children is a dynamic process, and everything from \ntechnology in the classroom, as well as the workforce needs of our \nnational economy, have drastically changed in the last 13 years.\n  Clearly, as a nation, we need to use this rewrite of Federal \neducation law as an opportunity to equip our Nation, and particularly \nour children and grandchildren, with the tools they need to succeed.\n  One area which we all know needs updating and strengthening is the \narea of STEM education--science, technology, engineering, and math. \nEmployers all across the country are desperate to try and find incoming \nyoung people into our workforce who have these skills to succeed.\n  The good news is, in the last 13 years, STEM occupations have grown \nthree times faster than non-STEM occupations. In addition, the average \nincome is two times higher in terms of the wages of STEM-educated \nworkers compared to non-STEM. That is the good news.\n  The bad news is that only 16 percent of graduating high school \nseniors are interested in STEM. If you drill down deeper, young girls \nand young minorities are woefully underrepresented in the single \ndigits.\n  Clearly, we need to move stronger as a nation in the area of STEM. If \nyou look globally, China is producing 23 percent of the world's STEM \ndegree graduates--the U.S., only 10 percent.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you go back 58 years ago, our 34th President, Dwight \nEisenhower, confronted a similar moment of crisis in terms of our \neducation system.\n  In October 1957, the Soviet Union launched the Sputnik satellite, \nwhich shocked our Nation. We realized we were falling behind and that \nwe needed to step up our game in terms of our educational and research \nsystem. This Republican President led the charge to pass the National \nDefense Education Act in 1958, which boosted and set a national goal, a \nnational priority, for science and research across our country.\n  At the time that he signed the bill in 1958, he said that, in both \neducation and research, we needed to redouble our exertions, which will \nbe necessary on the part of all Americans if we are to rise to the \ndemands of our times.\n  He also noted that this bill, the National Defense Education Act, \nback in 1958, would ``do much to strengthen our American system of \neducation so it can meet the broad and increasing demands imposed upon \nit by considerations of basic national security.''\n  Fast forward 57 years, we now have a national STEM education \ncoalition\n\n[[Page H4870]]\n\nmade up of employers like Microsoft, the National Association of \nManufacturers, and the American Farm Bureau, who have come together \nwith a core set of principles on how we can today, in 2015, boost \nteachers with these hard science degrees in our elementary and high \nschools, how we can drill down and encourage, again, underrepresented \ngroups such as young girls and minorities to get involved and engaged \nin education.\n  We came forward on the Education and the Workforce Committee with an \namendment supported by the STEM coalition, and it was rejected on a \nparty-line vote by the Republican majority, who said that the national \ngovernment had no business being involved in local and State education \npolicy. That is totally unacceptable in terms of the challenges that \nour Nation faces today.\n  Unfortunately, the Rules Committee rejected our amendment from even \nbeing voted on today as part of the update of the No Child Left Behind \nbill.\n  Again, it is the ultimate measuring stick of the failure of this bill \nto address the needs our Nation faces in terms of K-12 education \npolicy. We should follow the example of this gentleman. He understood \nthat at times, we have to rise up as a full nation.\n  We can't rely on one local wealthy school district to invest in \nscience and technology and engineering and math and leave behind other \npopulations in this country because, as a nation, we need to come \ntogether to address and succeed and face this challenge. It will bring \ngood things in terms of higher income and more growth for our country \nif we embrace these types of policies.\n  The good news is that the Republican chairman of the Senate Education \nCommittee did embrace the STEM education coalition provisions, and they \nhave put it in their bill.\n  Today, unfortunately, we are going to go do this exercise, this \ntheater of passing a bill which woefully fails the test in terms of \nwhat our Nation faces today, but hopefully, later in the process, a \nconference committee will come together, and we will follow the example \nof Dwight Eisenhower and our bipartisan coalition of the 1950s to allow \nthis Nation to have the tools to succeed.\n  We need to pass strong STEM education policy for our young children.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4870-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4870]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   513TH AIR CONTROL GROUP DEPLOYMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute more than 40 citizen \nairmen of the 513th Air Control Group deploying to Southwest Asia this \nmonth in support of Operation Inherent Resolve in Iraq and Syria and \nalso continuing operations in Afghanistan.\n  The 513th is the Nation's only Reserve unit flying the E-3 AWACS \naircraft. I am proud that the 513th is based at Tinker Air Force Base \nin my home State of Oklahoma, and it is commanded by Colonel David W. \nRobertson.\n  I flew the Navy version of the AWACS, the E-2 Hawkeye, both on Active \nDuty and as a reservist. The AWACS is the Air Force's ``quarterback in \nthe sky,'' calling the plays and managing the fight from an airborne \nplatform.\n  I know firsthand that the AWACS is absolutely essential to projecting \nair power. Without it, our forces would be like an orchestra with no \nconductor.\n  Mr. Speaker, we just celebrated yet another year of independence. We \nshould remember that our war of independence was fought almost \nexclusively by citizen warriors, ordinary citizens who put their lives \non hold and at risk, many of them giving the ultimate sacrifice for our \nindependence.\n  The 513th continues our great citizen warrior tradition. Among the \ncitizen airmen deploying are Realtors, IT specialists, and even a \npastor. We should recognize that this is a voluntary assignment. These \nreservists have raised their hands and answered the call voluntarily, \nwhen less than 1 percent of our fellow citizens serve in the military.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 513th demonstrates the value of our military's \nReserve component and National Guardsmen. Looking across the 513th, you \nwill find skill standards, capabilities, and operational readiness \nrates equal to or better than the Active component.\n  When I was in the Reserves flying the E-2 Hawkeye, I can tell you \nthat the amount of talent that we held in the Reserve component was \namazing. It was very clear that these folks had the confidence, the \ncapability, and the institutional knowledge to carry on the tradition \nof excellence that was in the Navy when they moved to the Reserves.\n  The amount of talent and skills is also true with the Air Force. We \nsaw it when you think about the fighter squadrons that fought in the \nopening days of the war in Afghanistan. The Reserve fighter squadron \nwas the one that had the highest percentage of bombs on target.\n  The Reserve and the Air National Guard are critical to our Nation's \nmilitary readiness. It is important to retain and even expand the \nreserve component size, missions, and capabilities.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, while I rise to give a special thanks to the \n513th reservists deploying to Southwest Asia, let me also mention this \nunit's other recent accomplishments.\n  To say that the 513th is in high demand would be a huge \nunderstatement. In the past 6 months, the 513th has controlled training \nmissions for over 200 fighters and bombers, supported critical flight \ntests, managed air operation center support in Germany, and controlled \neight large-force exercises, including Felix Virgo in Louisiana, \nNorthern Edge in Alaska, and CHUMEX in Florida.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by once again recognizing the citizen \nairmen of the 513th Air Control Group from Tinker Air Force Base.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4870-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4870-H4871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                             OPPOSE H.R. 5\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nopposition to the current version of H.R. 5, the House Republican bill \nwhich seeks to reauthorize the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, \nand encourage my colleagues to adopt the Democratic substitute offered \nby Ranking Member Bobby Scott.\n  Let me start by reading you a quote that truly strikes me as telling \nof where we have come from and where we find ourselves today. On May \n22, 1964, at the University of Michigan, President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson remarked:\n\n       In many places, classrooms are overcrowded and curricula \n     are outdated. Most of our qualified teachers are underpaid, \n     and many of our paid teachers are underqualified. So we must \n     give every child a place to sit and a teacher to learn from. \n     Poverty is not a bar for learning, and learning must often \n     escape from poverty.\n\n  President Johnson went on to say:\n\n       But more classrooms and more teachers are just not enough. \n     We must seek an educational system which grows in excellence \n     as it grows in size. This means better training for our \n     teachers. It means preparing our youth to enjoy their hours \n     of leisure as well as their hours of labor. It means \n     exploring new techniques of teaching, to find new ways to \n     stimulate the love of learning and the capacity for creation.\n\n  Let's just take a moment to let that sink in.\n  Those were words read in 1964, during President Johnson's Great \nSociety Speech. Almost every single point in President Johnson's \nremarks has direct import of the perils our education system faces \ntoday.\n  Teachers are still underpaid, and in so many areas, underqualified. \nClassroom sizes are increasing, and the quality of education is \ncontinuing to deteriorate.\n  Hunger and poverty continue to afflict our inner-city students in an \nalarmingly disproportionate rate, and disparity of resources and access \nto a quality education seems, at times, to continue expanding. The \nachievement gap between our most impoverished students remains \ninextricably tied to the wealth gap, and the numbers are discouraging.\n  Instead of moving forward by improving on and implementing lessons \nlearned from the failed policies of No Child Left Behind, H.R. 5 guts \nthe core intent of the original Elementary and Secondary Education Act \nof 1965.\n\n[[Page H4871]]\n\n  H.R. 5 is like a blast from the past and fails our students and their \nfamilies in a myriad of ways. Among some of the most egregious \nprovisions in this proposed iteration of ESEA, H.R. 5 includes the \nconcept of portability for title I funds.\n  Sold and messaged as a promotion of choice, portability instead \nadversely affects students who are in schools and districts with the \nhighest concentration of poverty and need. In short, portability is a \nruse, one that takes resources from, rather than gives to our most \nunderserved and needy children.\n  Additionally, as the ranking member of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee, and a longtime advocate of STEM--science, \ntechnology, mathematics, and engineering--education, I was alarmed by \nthe utter and complete exclusion of any reference to STEM education \nwithin this base text.\n  We should be retooling our education system to fit the needs of our \never-evolving globalized economy, not running back to the factory-style \neducation that doesn't provide our children with the skills they need \nto compete.\n  Education is the ladder to opportunity and central to keeping alive \nthe American Dream. We must fight to ensure that every single child, \nregardless of their background, is given the opportunity to reach their \nGod-given potential.\n  No matter what race--Black, White, Hispanic, Asian, or Native \nAmerican--rich, poor, immigrant or not, we must remain steadfast in our \ndedication to equality and the equity of opportunity.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to take this bill back to the drawing \nboard and make sure that education in America is reflective of our \nprinciples as a nation. I urge my colleagues to make sure that we \nprotect the American Dream and keep America the land of equal \nopportunity.\n  If you work hard and play by the rules, everyone deserves a fair shot \nand a fair shake at a fulfilling life. The ZIP Code you grow up in \nshould not determine the life you live.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4871-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, although we have recently \nentered into July, I rise today in recognition of National Dairy Month, \nwhich has taken place every June since 1937.\n  As I travel across Pennsylvania and throughout the Pennsylvania Fifth \nCongressional District, I am always inspired by our farmers and our \nfarm families. They work hard. They work 7 days a week. Their work is \narduous, and the challenges of running a farm are never ending.\n  Mr. Speaker, farming isn't just a business to these hardworking \nfolks; it is the fabric of rural America. The Commonwealth's history is \nrooted in agriculture, and the dairy industry continues to be the \nlargest sector of this industry.\n  Most, about 99 percent of our dairy farms in Pennsylvania, are \nfamily-owned and operated, and our average herd size is about 72 head.\n  The Commonwealth's robust dairy industry produces 10 billion pounds \nof milk annually, and that number continues to surge. In fact, \nPennsylvania ranks fifth in the Nation when it comes to dairy \nproduction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of National Dairy Month, in \nsupport of our dairy farmers and farm families, and to also say thank \nyou to all of these folks for providing us with food and fiber.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4871-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRESS MUST REAUTHORIZE THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY EDUCATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Ms. Fudge) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FUDGE. Mr. Speaker, today we find ourselves on the House floor \nyet again debating H.R. 5. After several months of delay, the majority \nparty has yet to realize that this bill is not in the best interest of \nAmerica's children.\n  We all agree that Congress must reauthorize a strong Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. H.R. 5 does not meet the test.\n  Any reauthorization must ensure that education is properly funded at \nthe State and Federal level for all of America's children; that all \nstudents have access to a well-rounded education, which includes \nsubjects like physical education, music, and the arts; and that \nstudents are annually assessed, which allows for parents and teachers \nto measure students' progress.\n  H.R. 5 does none of these things. Instead, it fails our students, our \nteachers, and our families. The bill drastically reduces education \nfunding, eliminates and weakens protections for disabled students, \nfails to provide a well-rounded education for all students, and \ngenerally makes it more difficult to educate those for whom the act was \ndesigned to protect.\n  The bill turns title I funding into a block grant. The program would \ndisproportionately harm disadvantaged and low-income students. Schools \nacross the country, including some in my own congressional district, \nrely on these funds to help ensure children are given a fair chance to \nmeet State academic standards.\n  H.R. 5 also allows title I dollars to become portable, which would \ndivert much-needed funds from the highest need poverty schools and \ndistricts.\n  H.R. 5 removes requirements that States ensure students graduate from \nhigh school college and career ready. The bill focuses primarily on \nmath and reading assessments, without providing any programmatic \nsupport for literacy, for STEM, and for other subjects that provide a \nwell-rounded curriculum. It eliminates wraparound support services, \nwhich are very important to needy students. It eliminates afterschool, \nfamily engagement, physical, dental, and mental health programs.\n  This year, we commemorate the 50th anniversary of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act. The bill, essentially a civil rights law, \nreaffirmed that every child has the right to an equal opportunity for a \nquality education.\n  However, H.R. 5 undermines the law's original intent, turning back \nthe clock on equity and accountability in American public education and \nignores the needs of America's most vulnerable students. H.R. 5 is a \nstep backward in our country's education system. This legislation fails \nour students and their families.\n  America deserves better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4871-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4871-H4872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REAUTHORIZE THE LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will \nbe considering the appropriations bill for the Department of the \nInterior for the upcoming fiscal year.\n  I rise today to express my support for a robust and continued funding \nfor and the permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Over this past Independence Day weekend, I was particularly reminded \nof how so many of us enjoy the natural wonders of our hometowns and \ncommunities, from picnics at playgrounds, baseball games on municipal \nrecreational fields, honoring our heritage and celebrating our \nindependence with fireworks, music and parades at local historic sites \nand parks.\n  That is part of why the Land and Water Conservation Fund is so \nimportant. It helps our communities protect critical lands by providing \nState and local governments with necessary funding and flexibility to \ndevelop and improve lands for public access and recreational enjoyment. \nIt is part of highlighting the heritage and character in my district in \nsoutheastern Pennsylvania.\n  My home State of Pennsylvania has received approximately $295 million \nin the past five decades from the Land and Conservation Water Fund. It \nhas protected places with national significance, such as Gettysburg \nNational Military Park, Valley Forge National Historical Park, and John \nHeinz Wildlife Refuge.\n  In addition, in my congressional district, we can thank the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund for helping fund the building of the Birdsboro \nWaters Forest Legacy project, protecting critical woodlands at the East\n\n[[Page H4872]]\n\nCoventry Wineberry Estates, expanding Shaw's Bridge in East Bradford \nTownship, and enhancing Pottstown Borough Memorial Park with a new dog \npark, pavilions, restrooms, ball fields, and walking trails.\n  Mr. Speaker, one thing that was apparent this past weekend was just \nhow integral our public lands and outdoor recreation areas are to our \nheritage, civic identity, and local community.\n  I believe the Land and Water Conservation Fund is one of our most \nimportant conservation programs and an excellent example of a \nbipartisan commitment to safeguarding natural resources, promoting our \ncultural heritage, and expanding recreational opportunities not just \nfor a moment in time, but for future generations as well.\n  I also believe it is a program that allows our local communities to \ndream big about how to best go about enhancing their communities for \ntheir residents.\n  As an original cosponsor of H.R. 1814, which would permanently \nreauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund, I am looking forward \nto working with my colleagues in an effort to help communities across \nthis country create lasting legacies of public access to the cultural \nand recreational opportunities identified by officials in their local \ncommunities as being worthy of funding for future projects.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4872-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4872]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   STUDENT SUCCESS ACT FAILS STUDENTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to express my strong \nopposition to H.R. 5, the so-called Student Success Act. I am deeply \ndisappointed in the majority for bringing such an economically careless \nand socially egregious bill to the floor today.\n  If passed, H.R. 5 would take more than $7 million from the highest \nneed schools in my home State of Alabama. It is really an abomination \nthat this body would do this to our constituents and do this to our \nstudents.\n  H.R. 5 abandons the Federal Government's historic role in elementary \nand secondary education. Furthermore, this bill neglects our sacred \nresponsibility to ensure that all children, irrespective of race, \nclass, disability, or socioeconomic class, are given the opportunity to \nattain a high quality education.\n  Each of us in this body has the opportunity to send our own children \nto the finest K-12 institutions in this country, but our privilege \nisn't universal, and we shouldn't legislate as if it is.\n  In the Seventh Congressional District of Alabama, that privilege, the \nability to send our children to the private schools or public schools \nof choice, is nearly nonexistent.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  More than 70 percent of the public school students in my district \nreceive free or reduced lunch, and they live in families that live \nbelow the poverty line. And of the 26 school districts that serve my \nconstituents, only two of them have a poverty rate that is less than 56 \npercent.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act was first written in \nrecognition of the impact that concentrated poverty has on a school \nsystem's ability to adequately support the educational programs needed \nto serve vulnerable communities.\n  But H.R. 5 would strip the ESEA of the protections for these students \nby diverting title I funds. This approach is backwards, and our \nchildren deserve better. If I were grading this bill, I would \ndefinitely give it an F.\n  As a proud product of Selma High School, this is deeply personal to \nme. Today more than 90 percent of the Selma High School students in my \ndistrict, from my old high school, receive free and reduced lunch. \nUnder H.R. 5, this school would lose nearly 20 percent of its Federal \nfunding.\n  The greatest opportunity that we can give any child is a quality \neducation. This is why I cannot support this bill, which diverts title \nI funds from 92 percent of the schools in my district. This would \nfurther tilt the playing field against poor kids.\n  These children belong to all of us. Unfortunately, this bill is proof \nthat somewhere along the line we have abandoned the most sacred \nAmerican principle, that all children--I mean all children--are our \nchildren.\n  We cannot deny that a rising tide lifts all boats. The economic and \nsocial costs of refusing to accept these facts are steep.\n  When President Johnson signed the Elementary and Secondary Education \nAct in 1964, he stated, ``As President of the United States, I believe \ndeeply no law I have signed or will ever sign means more to the future \nof America than this bill.'' President Johnson was right then, and he \nis right now.\n  To promote our educational progress, we must replace No Child Left \nBehind with a strong bipartisan bill, one that advances what works and \nimproves upon what does not. Unfortunately, this bill does neither.\n  I urge this body to oppose this reckless bill, H.R. 5. Our children \ndeserve better. Our constituents deserve better. This Nation deserves \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4872-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4872-H4873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           KELO V. NEW LONDON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to highlight an issue that \nI believe we must pay closer attention to in this Chamber and in this \nCongress. You see, on June 23, Mr. Speaker, we marked the tenth \nanniversary of an important Supreme Court case. That case was Kelo v. \nNew London.\n  Now, the title of the case really means nothing. But I point to \nSusette Kelo, who I have here depicted in this picture. She was the \nplaintiff in that case. And what happened in that case was this, Mr. \nSpeaker, a real tragedy:\n  She was told by her government that they were going to take her home \nand give it to another private owner for development. You heard me \nright, Mr. Speaker. She was told that her home was going to be taken by \nour government because they were picking the winners and losers because \nthey felt they knew best how to utilize her property and give it to \nanother private owner to develop it the way that private owner wanted \nto do.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, Susette Kelo stood up. She fought this fight. She \nwas told by her friends, she was told by her real estate agents, she \nwas told by her lawyers: Just roll over. The government always wins, \nand they are going to win this battle.\n  But she fought it all the way to the Supreme Court. And what \nhappened, however, is that that advice from her friends and from her \nreal estate agent and her lawyers came true. The government won.\n  But that day we all lost, as American citizens. Because here is what \nhappened after that case. She lost her home. And this is a picture of \nher property--well, no longer her property--but that property, as it \nexists today. They demolished her home. They took her property. She \nlost her piece of the American Dream. And the result of it is a vacant \nlot that sits in New London.\n  Mr. Speaker, I highlight this case today because it reminds us of an \nissue that we must fight for, and that is a fundamental freedom that we \nall enjoy as American citizens, to own and to use our property.\n  It is something that is fundamental to our U.S. Constitution. It is \nsomething fundamental to us as American citizens. And it is time for us \nto unite, as Republicans and Democrats, and say enough is enough. We \nmust push back on Big Government. We must stand with individuals.\n  This land belongs to them, not our government. And that is something \nthat I am afraid that started 10 years ago and continues to this day \nwith actions of Big Government day in and day out, where government \nregulations, government overreach--local, Federal, State level--act in \na way that takes away these fundamental property rights that so many \nhave fought for.\n  So in Congress I have led the fight. I formed the Private Property \nRights Caucus, with Members from Maine to Alabama to California. I have \nsponsored and authored the Defense of Property Rights Act to say enough \nis enough. We are going to stand with individuals, and we are going to \nfight this Big Government overreach.\n  Mr. Speaker, these hard-fought rights have come at the expense of so \nmany, the blood of those who fought to preserve our freedoms, the blood \nof our Founding Fathers and the vision they\n\n[[Page H4873]]\n\nset forth in our Constitution. And this Kelo case was a moment in time \nat a drop of a gavel when those fundamental rights were threatened and \nlost.\n  So I stand today and ask my colleagues and all of the people across \nAmerica to stand with us, to stand with me, to make sure we coordinate \nour efforts to make sure that our fundamental property rights are \nprotected and individuals like Susette Kelo are rewarded for her \nbravery in taking the fight.\n  Though she may have lost that battle, I stand with her to win this \nwar to protect our fundamental property rights that so many have fought \nfor over the years.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4873-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    STUDENT SUCCESS ACT FALLS SHORT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Adams) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in opposition to H.R. 5.\n  Education is a civil right. And when the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act was passed in 1965, its purpose was to ensure access to a \nquality education for our neediest students that are often low income \nand minority.\n  We can all agree that ESEA reauthorization is long overdue. However, \nthe proposal put forth by Republicans falls short and makes a bad \nsituation worse.\n  Each day that No Child Left Behind is law is one more day that we \nare, in fact, leaving children behind.\n  H.R. 5 is not the answer. Voting for this bill means voting against \nour students, our teachers, and our schools. A vote for H.R. 5 is a \nvote to take money from our poorest and most at-risk students. It is a \nvote to erase the educational gains we have made over the past 50 \nyears. It is a vote to deny many of our students a chance at real \nsuccess.\n  It is time to wake up. It is time to vote ``no'' on H.R. 5.\n  Congress passed ESEA 50 years ago with the intent of protecting our \nstudents by providing quality and equal education. Today, instead of \nputting forth a bipartisan bill that moves us closer to equal and \nquality education for every child, Republicans have introduced a bill \nto roll back the hands of time and undo our progress.\n  H.R. 5 turns its back on some of our most vulnerable student \npopulations. It lacks the accountability measures to ensure student \nsuccess.\n  A report from the Southern Education Foundation found that more than \n50 percent of our public school students live in poverty. Title I has \nalways been the main source of Federal funding for our country's \npoorest students.\n  H.R. 5 would reverse this longstanding practice and, instead, remove \nmoney from our school districts with the greatest need, diluting their \nability to meaningfully fund programs that serve low-income students.\n  At a time when 40 percent of college students take remedial courses \nand employers continue to complain of inadequate preparation for high \nschool graduates, we must ensure that all students are college ready \nand are career ready. H.R. 5 allows States to lower standards that lead \nto students graduating unprepared.\n  So how can we expect our students to compete in a global economy when \nthey aren't prepared? We need to invest in the future of our children, \nsupport our teachers and our principals, ensure the success of our \nneediest students.\n  And that is why I am proud to support the amendment of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia (Mr. Scott), and I thank him for his leadership in \nchallenging H.R. 5.\n  This amendment reaffirms the Federal Government's proper role in \neducation, addressing many of the problems that surround No Child Left \nBehind.\n  Students in low-income families already have obvious disadvantages. \nThis amendment prioritizes early education to help our students start \nout strong. It puts protections in place against bullying, and it \nsupports the physical, mental, and emotional stability of students. It \ngets rid of AYP and also makes important investments in STEM education.\n  Education should be an issue that unites us, not divides us. The \nScott amendment is exactly what our schools and our students and our \nteachers need.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for the Scott amendment and not for H.R. \n5 because H.R. 5 fails on all accounts. It fails our neediest students. \nIt fails to invest in our teachers and principals. And it fails to \nprepare students for college and careers and to address the core \nprinciples of Federal education policies.\n  H.R. 5 deserves an F. I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4873-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4873]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRATULATING THE U.S. WOMEN'S WORLD CUP SOCCER TEAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Olson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. OLSON. Mr. Speaker, this past Sunday, the day after our \nIndependence Day, the U.S. women's World Cup team gave us the best \nfireworks show ever. They lit up the team that beat them 4 years ago in \nthe World Cup, Japan.\n  We scored in the third minute, the fifth minute, the 14th minute, and \nthe 16th minute. 4-0 in 16 minutes. We had gone over 5\\1/2\\ hours \nwithout giving up a goal. Japan was done.\n  Our women won every game because they left their egos in the locker \nroom. When they jogged onto that field, they were a team full of love, \nlove of soccer, love of America, and love of each other, their \nteammates.\n  The best example of that love was a small blue arm band. It is worn \nby our team captain. If you missed this band's journey through our \nvictory on Sunday, I will recount it for you.\n  It was on Christie Rampone's left arm as her gold medal was placed \naround her neck. It was her second gold medal in a World Cup match. She \nis closer to my age than all of her teammates. Sunday was her last \nWorld Cup game.\n  She got that blue band from Abby Wombach, the greatest woman soccer \nplayer in American history. That is her picture beside me.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPuerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PIERLUISI. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. territory of Puerto Rico, home \nto 3.5 million American citizens, stands at a crossroads. The Governor \nrecently announced that Puerto Rico cannot pay all of its debts. The \nGovernor's comments were not constructive because they lacked \nprecision.\n  Puerto Rico's total debt is about $72 billion, and the structure of \nthis debt is complex. About 17 entities in Puerto Rico have bonds \noutstanding, from the central government to public corporations. The \nterms, source of repayment, and the level of legal protection for each \nbond varies.\n\n[[Page H4874]]\n\n  For instance, bonds issued by the central government received \npriority payment under the Puerto Rico Constitution, which was \nauthorized and approved by Congress. Accordingly, when the Governor \nasserted that Puerto Rico cannot pay its debts, the sweeping nature of \nhis comments raised many practical and legal questions and generated \nconsiderable anxiety.\n  Mr. Speaker, the crisis in Puerto Rico is real, and it must be \nconfronted with composure, competence, and candor. To this end, I want \nto articulate a simple truth, but one that is often overlooked: namely, \nthe challenges we face are structural in nature and, therefore, require \nstructural solutions, at both the Puerto Rico and the Federal level.\n  Within Puerto Rico, more discipline by the territory government is \nimperative. We must learn to live within our means. Puerto Rico's \npolitical leaders have shown the capacity to develop sound strategies, \nbut have not always demonstrated the same ability to effectively \nexecute those strategies. Performance, not planning, is the problem. We \ncan do better, and for the sake of our constituents, we must do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, honest self-appraisal and self-criticism are essential, \nbut cannot be limited to Puerto Rico. If the American public is under \nthe impression that Puerto Rico is solely to blame for this crisis, it \nis profoundly mistaken.\n  The source of the problem in Puerto Rico is not its people, who are \ntalented and hard-working, nor is it our political leaders, who are no \nbetter or worse than their counterparts in other U.S. jurisdictions who \nat times also overpromise and underdeliver; instead, the root cause of \nthe problem is our political status, which has given rise to a system \nof severe and entrenched inequality that makes it exceptionally \ndifficult to succeed and exceptionally easy to fail.\n  The direct link between Puerto Rico's political status and its \neconomic problems was explored at a recent congressional hearing. The \nhearing served to underscore that there are more American citizens in \nPuerto Rico than in 21 States, that they serve in the U.S. military in \nlarge numbers, but that they cannot vote for President or Senators and \nhave only one nonvoting Delegate in this House.\n  The hearing highlighted that, as a territory, Puerto Rico can be and \noften is treated worse than the States under Federal laws, from \nMedicaid to the earned income tax credit to chapter 9 of the Bankruptcy \nCode. To compensate for the deficiency in Federal economic support, the \nPuerto Rico Government has borrowed heavily, which explains the \nexcessive debt.\n  In recent years, 250,000 island residents have moved to the States, \nand these numbers are only growing. Once in the States, they are \nentitled to full voting rights and equal treatment under the law, \nrights they were denied in Puerto Rico.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an intolerable situation. My constituents have \ntolerated it for too long, and they will tolerate it no longer. They \nvoted for statehood in a local referendum in 2012, and they will vote \nfor statehood again in even greater numbers in a Federal referendum in \n2017.\n  My message to my colleagues is simple. If you give us the same rights \nand responsibilities as our fellow American citizens and let us rise or \nfall on our merits, we will rise; but, if you continue to treat us like \nsecond-class citizens, don't profess to be surprised when we fall.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4874-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He immigrated to \nCalifornia in 1952 and became a proud American citizen, serving in the \nUnited States Army at Fort Hood. In 1975, he found his way to North \nTexas where he opened his first restaurant.\n  He loved to serve people, not only with good Mexican food, but giving \nback to the community that he loved.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 5, a \nmisguided bill which denies America's children access to high-quality \neducation.\n  Today, greater numbers of economically disadvantaged children are \nentering our public schools. For example, in my State of Texas, of the \n5 million students enrolled in public schools in 2014 statewide, more \nthan 3 million would be adversely impacted if we vote to pass H.R. 5.\n  This Republican bill abandons the Federal Government's historic \ncommitment to educating disadvantaged populations. H.R. 5 block grants \nvital Federal programs, such as title I of the education code targeted \nfor English language learners, migrant children, neglected and \ndelinquent youth, and Native American education.\n  The bill allows States and districts to siphon away these Federal \nfunds and use them for other purposes because of the proposed changes \nin the intent of the many education programs passed many years ago--50 \nyears ago to be exact--under the leadership of President Lyndon Baines \nJohnson.\n  H.R. 5 would provide inadequate funding and move backward on equity \nand accountability, harming the education of our Nation's children.\n  I respectfully urge Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle to \nvote ``no'' on final passage today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4876-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4876]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                               A NAVY MAN\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express concern \nabout continued acquisition of private lands by the Federal Government.\n  The Federal Government currently owns about 30 percent of the land in \nour country but is unable to properly maintain this land, as evidenced \nby the Park Service's staggering $11.5 billion backlog of maintenance \nprojects, yet the Federal Government continues to spend limited \ntaxpayer dollars and resources on more land. For example, many of my \nconstituents are facing a push by the government to take over \nhistorically private land.\n  A June 30 New York Times article, entitled, ``Let's Fix Our Parks, \nNot Add More,'' further illustrates the scope of this problem, \ncriticizing the administration's decision to add seven new parks to the \nsystem.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose future land purchases and instead \nfocus the Interior Department's attention on properly maintaining \nexisting Federal lands to ensure access for generations to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4876-6", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4876-H4877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight an issue that \ndeserves our immediate attention: the Republican leadership's failure \nto bring the reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank to the House \nfloor for a vote.\n  The Ex-Im Bank plays a critical role in our economy, opening \ninternational markets to U.S. businesses by facilitating the sale of \nAmerican goods and services overseas. The Bank evens the playing field \nfor American companies, enabling them to compete based on the quality \nof their products, not on the financing term they can offer.\n  Allowing the Bank's authorization to expire will have real-world \nconsequences, Mr. Speaker. If we don't act, American businesses that \nemploy tens of thousands of our workers will struggle to survive in \nthis competitive global marketplace.\n  There is no question that there are enough votes in both the House \nand the Senate to pass the Ex-Im Bank reauthorization at this point on \na bipartisan basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, for the sake of American businesses and workers, the \nRepublican leadership needs to stop playing to their out-of-touch base \nand start\n\n[[Page H4877]]\n\nacting in the best interests of the American people by reauthorizing \nthe Ex-Im Bank immediately.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4877-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HIGHLIGHTING THE VITAL ROLE OF FORT POLK, LOUISIANA\n\n  (Mr. BOUSTANY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BOUSTANY.

This team was recognized as a superior brigade \ncombat team, awarding it the Meritorious Unit Citation for its efforts \nin Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Any cuts to this award-winning unit would deal a devastating blow to \nthe post, its surrounding communities, and Louisiana as a whole.

Mr. Speaker, on July 31, the highway and transit trust \nfund will expire.\n  So what does the expiration of the trust fund mean to America, to \nAmerican families?\n  It means the potential loss of over 600,000 jobs. It means the \ncancelation of major infrastructure projects. In fact, I heard this \nmorning that five States have already canceled or delayed major \nprojects because of Congress' lack of ability to do its work.\n  My home State of Michigan, we know more than anyplace that if we \ninvest in our roads and bridges and rails, we grow our economy.\n  Other nations, instead of planning months ahead, are planning years \nahead and building infrastructure. China, for example, is spending 10 \ntimes what we are as a percentage of their GDP on infrastructure.\n  Meanwhile, back in May, instead of thinking about the decades to come \nand hundreds of thousands of jobs, this Congress passed a 2-month \nextension, a self-imposed, manmade crisis, governing crisis to crisis \non every big issue that we deal with.\n  We can't let this happen. This Congress needs to do its job. We need \nto come together in a bipartisan way--we can do it--and pass an \nextension of the highway trust fund that invests in America and puts \nAmerican workers back to work rebuilding this country.\n  If we don't do this, we cannot expect our economy to grow.

Mr. \nRay moved to Blue Ridge, Georgia, 10 years ago to pursue his career in \nmortgage banking, but he ended up doing barbecue. He calls it \nbeginner's luck, but I think it is turning into a legacy and a \ntradition in north Georgia. You see, customers travel from hundreds of \nmiles to experience the secret recipe at Joe's BBQ, and it has been \nnamed number one as proof of the fruits of their labor.\n  So now we have many coming to northeast Georgia to experience what we \nin the Ninth District always knew: the best barbecue is in north \nGeorgia, the greatest place in world.

Several years ago \na father and his two sons were killed by an illegal immigrant felon \nwho, again, San Francisco refused to detain for Federal immigration \nauthorities.\n  The evidence is clear. Sanctuary city laws make our cities less safe \nand endanger Americans.

Mr. Speaker, during a severe drought crisis, such as \nthe one now in California, we must focus on solutions that create water \nand maintain a clean water supply. That is why I am stressing how \ncrucial the Clean Water and Safe Drinking Water State Revolving Funds \nare.\n  Clean and safe water is essential for our homes, farms, and \nbusinesses. These funds help finance projects that treat domestic \nsewage, capture stormwater run-off, and deliver drinking water to homes \nand businesses. SFR programs are the only low-cost loans available for \nmany small- and medium-sized communities to finance clean water \ninfrastructure.\n  Every dollar that we invest in water infrastructure comes back to our \neconomy six times over. Cutting the SFR programs will have a crippling \neffect on our communities' abilities to meet water needs.\n  Republicans say they support drought relief. But, in reality, they \nhave cut desperately needed funds for both these programs, a 23 percent \ncut in the House Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies \nAppropriations bill being debated today.\n  Congress must provide necessary funding to maintain our Nation's \naging water infrastructure.

We know \nlow-income children and English language learners are negatively \nimpacted when education funding is block-granted or made portable.\n  H.R. 5 does all these things: It locks in cuts to title I funding, \nblock-grants many of the funding streams dedicated to specific at-risk \npopulations, and it allows these funds to be diverted away from the \ndistricts and schools that need them most.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act is meant to promote \nopportunity, Mr. Speaker, not take it away.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today as well in strong opposition to \nH.R. 5, the so-called Student Success Act.\n  There should be no question that education in this country is a \nright, not a privilege. Every student deserves the opportunity to \nsucceed, and that opportunity begins with equal access to high-quality \neducation.\n  But this bill severely undercuts our public schools. It slashes \nfunding and takes away critical resources from students with the \ngreatest needs. It eliminates key protections for students with \ndisabilities. It guts support for vital afterschool programs.\n  And on the Central Coast of California, where I am from, our high \nschool graduation rates have continuously improved over the past 5 \nyears, exceeding statewide averages.\n  We must build upon these successes, not turn the clock backwards by \ndismantling equity and accountability standards. We must instead \ncontinue to move forward, deliver the promise of a great education and \nthe opportunity for a bright future. Sadly, this bill only takes away \nthat promise.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on H.R. 5.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4879-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4879]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PASTOR BERNYCE CLAUSEL\n\n  (Ms. GRAHAM asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. GRAHAM.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, on Tuesday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported a House rule, House Resolution 347, providing for \nconsideration of two important pieces of legislation for which I am \nhonored to be able to bring forward for consideration by this \nlegislative body: H.R. 2647, the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, \nand H.R. 5, the Student Success Act.\n  The rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2647 under a structured \nrule with four amendments made in order, a majority of which were \noffered by our Democratic colleague Members of the House. The rule also \nprovides for further consideration of H.R. 5 under a structured rule \nwith four additional amendments that were made in order.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2647, the \nResilient Federal Forests Act of 2015, a bill that is critically \nimportant to my district in central Washington State which is, \nunfortunately, once again facing another devastating wildfire season.\n  This bipartisan, comprehensive legislation is aimed at expediting and \nimproving forest management activities in Federal forests. It builds \nupon many legislative concepts introduced in this and in previous \nCongresses to address disastrous consequences of catastrophic wildfire, \ninsect and disease infestations, and other threats to our Nation's \nforests.\n  H.R. 2647 would return resilience to the overgrown, fire-prone \nforests that encompass a great deal of land in the Western United \nStates. It would dramatically improve the health and resiliency of our \nFederal forests and rangelands by simplifying environmental process \nrequirements, curtailing project planning times, and reducing the cost \nof implementing forest management projects, all while still ensuring \nrobust protection of the environment.\n  Mr. Speaker, just last year, my district in central Washington \nendured the Carlton Complex fire, the largest wildfire in our State's \nhistory, which was responsible for the destruction of over 300 homes \nand businesses. This devastating, catastrophic wildfire crippled many \nparts of my district, and many of my constituents are still trying to \nrecover; yet it seems, as soon as we start to move past one major \nwildfire, another is immediately on our doorstep, literally.\n  Almost 10 days ago, new fires broke out in Washington State in cities \nlike Wenatchee and Quincy and counties, including Benton, Chelan, \nGrant, Adams and Douglas, immediately spreading and some requiring \nWashington State fire mobilization resources to keep them from \nescalating. As the West continues to face severe drought conditions, \nthe threat of wildfire will only continue to worsen.\n  In order to begin to prevent and address these fires, we need to \nreform the way we prepare for, respond to, and fund wildfire response \nand mitigation efforts. We cannot continue to limp from one devastating \nfire season to the next, leaving little to no time, and even less \nfunding, available for reforestation, rehabilitation, and overall \nforest management.\n  This bill addresses those shortcomings by providing new methods of \nfunding, which will tackle the problem of fire borrowing. It also \nincludes tools the Forest Service can implement immediately to treat \nthousands of acres of forest land at a lower cost.\n  Earlier this year, the House Natural Resources Committee's \nSubcommittee on Federal Lands, of which I am a member, held a hearing \non this bill. One of the witnesses testifying was U.S. Forest Service \nChief Tom Tidwell.\n  In his opening comments, Chief Tidwell remarked that ``the Forest \nService is encouraged by many of the goals outlined within'' the bill \nand ``welcomes legislation that incentivizes collaboration and expands \nthe toolset that we can use to complete critical work on our Nation's \nforests without overriding environmental laws.''\n  I believe these comments reflect the bipartisan nature in which the \nlegislation was drafted and highlights the necessity of the reforms we \nare considering here today.\n  Mr. Speaker, it should also be noted that, because of the reforms and \nstreamlined authorities in this bill, there will be an increase in \nacres of treated land, all at no additional costs to taxpayers. This \nlegislation is essential and desperately needed to change the current \npath of forest management on public lands, which is outdated, \nunsustainable, and dangerous.\n  This rule also provides for further consideration of H.R. 5, the \nStudent Success Act, an education reform bill that reduces the Federal \nGovernment's footprint and restores local control over education by \neliminating wasteful and duplicative Federal programs and replacing \nthem with guidelines that maintain both high-performance expectations \nand appropriate levels of funding.\n  This legislation provides local governments with the flexibility \nnecessary to develop appropriate strategies with which to serve their \nstudents, parents, and communities.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, known as No Child Left \nBehind, has been due for reauthorization since 2007. Because it has not \nbeen reauthorized, the administration has been free to circumvent \nCongress and impose its own vision of education reform on the country, \nresulting in unprecedented intervention in local education issues.\n  The Student Success Act addresses this overreach by streamlining and \neliminating more than 70 elementary and secondary education programs \nthat have been deemed ineffective and instead promotes a more focused, \nefficient, and appropriate Federal law in the Nation's education \nsystem.\n  H.R. 5 will eliminate the current one-size-fits-all Federal \naccountability requirement and replace it with State-determined \naccountability systems designed to maintain high expectation for our \nNation's schools. Additionally, the bill supports and encourages \nparental engagement in their children's education by helping parents to \nenroll their children in charter schools and allowing title I funds to \nfollow low-income children to the school of their parents' choice.\n  Mr. Speaker, a well-educated workforce is imperative to the health \nand vitality of both our Nation's children and our economy. The Student \nSuccess Act will benefit students, parents, teachers, and school \nadministrators by returning responsibility for student achievement to \nthe States and local communities while maintaining high standards and \nexpectations for our Nation's students, teachers, and schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good, straightforward rule, allowing for \nconsideration of two critical pieces of legislation that will help \nprotect our rural communities, provide much-needed reforms to our \neducation system, and ensure that we are prepared to respond to \ndevastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued many areas of \nour country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support the rule's adoption; I urge my colleagues to \nsupport both the rule and the underlying bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Washington for yielding me the customary \n30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this morning, I got to meet with one of the \nsuperintendents from my district, Bruce Messinger, superintendent of \nthe Boulder Valley\n\n[[Page H4881]]\n\nSchool District. Bruce told me, as so many others have over the \nprevious years, how the outdated policies under No Child Left Behind \nstifle innovation and burden teachers and principals with a culture of \novertesting.\n  I remember a lot of these concerns well because I served on our State \nBoard of Education in Colorado from 2000 to 2006, when we were \noriginally implementing No Child Left Behind; and just as we are now \nfrustrated, we were then frustrated with the lack of flexibility, the \nfact that solutions were coming out of Washington rather than honoring \nour local accountability system in how we were able to make things work \nlocally, and a formula, adequate yearly progress, that we knew wouldn't \nwork.\n  We knew that we wouldn't have 100 percent proficiency in all \nsubgroups within a decade. We knew we needed reasonable goals to look \nat student achievement growth rather than the 1-year picture. Since \nthat time, there has been additional discretion given through a policy \nof waivers that have been given in many States, including my home State \nof Colorado, but I think we can all agree that it is past time to \nreauthorize and replace No Child Left Behind with a Federal education \npolicy that makes sense.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today is not that \npolicy that makes sense. One need go no further than the very beginning \nof the bill in the sense of Congress section on page 7, just to see \nsome of the Tea Party paranoia that underpins a lot of this bill.\n  It starts out on page 7 as a finding of Congress saying that the \nSecretary of Education, through three separate initiatives, has created \na system of waivers and grants that influence, incentivize, and coerce \nState educational agencies into implementing common national curriculum \nprograms of instruction and assessments for elementary and secondary \neducation, which is just patently false.\n  First of all, I believe this is a reference--incorrect of course--to \nthe Common Core standards. Now, first of all, standards are different \nfrom curriculum. Standards are certainly different from programs of \ninstruction which stem from curriculum, and standards are different \nfrom assessments.\n  Common Core was an effort of the States to create college- and \ncareer-ready standards. What the Federal Government and Secretary \nDuncan have attempted to do is say States need to have college- and \ncareer-ready standards.\n  We can't define success downwards and say that kids are passing the \ntest because it is a low test, it is an insufficient test. Whether \nStates want to do it through Common Core or other mechanisms and other \ntypes of standards, they are welcome to do it.\n  Now, none of that--and the most factually erroneous part--none of \nthat has to do with curriculum or program of instruction. Those are \nentirely developed at the local level. Standards and the grade level \nexpectations are one thing, as anybody involved with education knows; \ncurriculum is another.\n  This bill starts with a false premise. It starts with a premise that \nsomehow Washington is trying to run local school districts. That has \nnever been the case, nor should it be the case. If that is the \nbeginning of the essence of our cooperation, I think we can work \ntogether on a bill that empowers teachers, empowers local school \ndistricts, and empowers States with an accountability system that makes \nsense and the resources they need to meet the learning needs of all \nstudents.\n  Now, more than a decade has passed since Congress has authorized No \nChild Left Behind. While again, there are some good intentions in this \nbill, and there is some good language--which is also reflected in our \nDemocratic substitute--it is far outweighed by some of the unintended \nconsequences of the harmful language which will hurt students that is \nin this bill.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, let me give a little refresher on how we got here. \nIn early February, Chairman Kline introduced this bill. The bill was \nintroduced without input or buy-in from Democrats, and it was drafted \nwith zero committee hearings on ESEA.\n  The bill immediately went to markup and was passed along partisan \nlines. The bill resembles a bill last session that passed this Chamber \nwith zero Democratic votes. This bill is actually worse from my \nperspective and the perspective of Democrats, for a number of reasons \nthat I will get into, than the bill that attracted zero Democratic \nsupport last session.\n  This bill was brought before the House in February. It was then \npulled. Look, everybody can agree that this is a bad bill. Teachers say \nit is a bad bill; principals say it is a bad bill; parents say it is a \nbad bill; the civil rights community says it is a bad bill; \ndisabilities advocates say it is a bad bill, and the business community \nand the chamber do not support this bill.\n  I think--and I am sure they will mention it--the only group that we \ncan even find that supports this bill are superintendents. I am sure \nthey will find a few more. We will have an enormous record of \ndisability groups, civil rights groups, teachers groups, and many \nothers that oppose this bill for a number of reasons, and those reasons \nare correct.\n  If it looks bad, if it looks like a duck, it walks like a duck, and \nit quacks like a duck, it really is a duck. It is hard to bring \ntogether the business community, the civil rights community, and \nteachers unions around anything; and to bring them around saying that \nthis bill will result in less educational opportunities for American \nkids really is a crowning achievement.\n  We need a bill that prepares the next generation of our workforce \nwith the skills they need to succeed.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  We need an ESEA reauthorization that helps improve American \ncompetitiveness in the global economy. We need a bill that expects the \nbest of teachers and gives teachers the respect that they deserve as a \nprofession. We need a bill that cares about students with special needs \nand gives them the support they need. We need a bill that allows for \ninnovation in our schools. We need a bill that protects lesbian, gay, \nbisexual, and transgender students from discrimination and bullying; \nand yet both times that I offered an amendment to include the Student \nNon-Discrimination Act, it was not allowed in the Rules Committee. And \nwe need a bill that ensures that every child in America has access to a \nworld-class education, regardless of their ZIP Code, their race, their \nbackground, their socioeconomic class, or their sexual orientation.\n  The Democratic substitute that Mr. Scott has offered and will be \ndebated and voted on is a strong step forward and reflects many of \nthese priorities. It would have been wise for Chairman Kline and the \nsponsors of the bill to take a closer look at Mr. Scott's Democratic \nsubstitute and to have considered many of those provisions in the \nunderlying bill.\n  Now, I do want to point out a few of the good provisions in the bill, \nall of which are also reflected in the Democratic substitute and are \ngenerally reflected in some of the language being debated in the Senate \nas well.\n  As the founder of a public charter school network called the New \nAmerica School, I understand how the freedom to innovate and \nflexibility to pursue a unique mission can help public charter schools \nachieve the highest levels of success.\n  The New America School has campuses in two States--Colorado and New \nMexico--serving over 2,000 students from 40 countries. Just a few years \nago, I was honored to speak at its Colorado graduation, and it was \nmoving to hear the tales of some of the immigrant students who were \nserved by this school.\n  There is excellent language around the charter school title V \nprograms in both the Democratic substitute and nearly identical \nlanguage in the underlying bill that ups the bar on charter schools and \nmakes sure that the districts and States have best policies surrounding \naccountability for charter schools and makes sure that successful \ncharter school models can replicate and expand to serve more students.\n  I am also pleased that two of my amendments to H.R. 5 were made in \norder and have already passed the House in the previous debate in \nFebruary. One of my amendments encouraged collaboration among charter \nschools and traditional public schools, and another amendment allowed \nfunds to be used for open educational resources to help save districts \nand students money on textbooks and other programs. These resources \nthat are\n\n[[Page H4882]]\n\nopen source, which are licensed but free to use, can reduce the burden \nof overtesting and can help reduce costs in education.\n  Now, there is not a lot more to say with regard to the positive \nprovisions of this bill, but I want to talk about one of its biggest \nshortcomings and, namely, getting accountability right.\n  We can all agree that No Child Left Behind did not get accountability \nright, but the answer is to move forward and improve upon and make \naccountability work, not to take a step backward, which is what this \nbill does, by having a misguided set of principles defining performance \ntargets and accountability.\n  In fact, if this bill were to become law, States would not be \nrequired to set performance targets based on student growth, \nproficiency, or graduation rates. The bill doesn't define low-\nperforming schools, nor does it establish any parameters for \nintervention when we know a school isn't working.\n  One of the most compelling things that we can do here in Washington \nis equip local superintendents with the toolbox they need to help turn \naround persistently failing schools, and this bill fails to do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should provide schools with more flexibility to \ndesign school improvement programs that No Child Left Behind does, but \nwe should not provide schools with the option to do nothing and allow \ndropout factories to continue to exist, elementary schools where we \nknow that kids are falling further and further behind every year.\n  No child should be trapped in a failing school with no recourse. We \nneed to fix accountability, not step away from it. This bill \nconstitutes the Federal Government throwing up its arms and letting \nStates define success downward to make themselves look good while \nleaving more students behind.\n  This problem is compounded by another amendment that was not even \npreviously discussed that has now been allowed under this rule, namely, \nthe Salmon amendment, 129, which is universally opposed by civil rights \ngroups from the NAACP to La Raza to the Urban League to LULAC to the \nEducation Trust.\n  The Salmon amendment assumes that disadvantaged students aren't \ncapable of high achievement, perpetuating low expectations that are \nprojected on students of color, poor students, immigrant students, \nstudents with disabilities, and others.\n  This amendment effectively gives in to those political pressures \nwhich we all feel that work against disadvantaged students, that work \nagainst them at the district level because often their parents are not \nenfranchised members of the community or voting in school board races \nor serving on the board that work against them at the State level \nbecause they are up against the special interests and, yes, work \nagainst them here even in Washington.\n  This body needs to stand up for disadvantaged communities, needs to \nstand up for African Americans, Latinos, immigrant communities, those \nstudents with disabilities and ensure that any deficiency in the \nquality of instruction for disadvantaged communities is not swept under \nthe rug as the Salmon amendment would do.\n  I strongly encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nreject the Salmon amendment.\n  While No Child Left Behind certainly had its flaws, it did move us \nforward in continuing to serve low-income and minority students, \nEnglish language learners and students with disabilities.\n  H.R. 5 is a step backwards. Even without the Salmon amendment, it \nexcludes students with disabilities from school accountability systems. \nThe bill eliminates the 1 percent cap on alternate assessments based on \nalternative achievement standards.\n  Now, again, there is a real-world problem to be solved. There are \nsome kids with learning disabilities so severe that they can't be given \na test for accountability purposes. And that 1 percent number is an \narbitrary number. You can argue it should be half a percent, you can \nargue it should be 1\\1/2\\ percent. That is a very legitimate discussion \nto have. And I would be fully open, as many of my colleagues were, to \nfiguring out what that number is.\n  The answer is not to eliminate that number and effectively allow a \nState that might serve 12 percent of a population with students with \ndisabilities to say none of those students will be tested; none of \nthose students with individual education plans, none of those students \nwho might be dyslexic will be looked at in terms of how they are \nlearning.\n  Do you know what? My father was dyslexic, and it took him until fifth \ngrade to learn to read. But under provisions of this bill, he might \nnever have learned to read because he and millions of other Americans \nwith disabilities would be completely swept under the rug with the \nelimination of the cap.\n  This bill also fails to invest in our Nation's teachers. In February, \nI introduced the Great Teaching and Leading for Great Schools Act, \nwhich would advance a new definition of professional development based \non research and best practices.\n  Professional development doesn't have to simply be hiring someone to \nlecture teachers for a few hours while they are all bored. In fact, \nthere is better proven, data-proven ways that can help advance teaching \nand learning in schools, including collaborative peer networks, \nfeedback from teachers and principals, tying data in to ensure that our \nprofessional development opportunities work. Unfortunately, H.R. 5 \neliminates any requirement that ensures quality professional \ndevelopment for teachers.\n  Now, let me talk about one of the most concerning provisions in this \nbill to Democrats, including myself, and it has an innocuous name. It \nis called title I portability. It sounds like a good concept. It says \nthat Federal aid for students of poverty would follow the student.\n  Now, that sounds good, again, just as that finding that somehow the \nFederal Government should never do these programs of destruction in \nnational curriculum sounds good. But again, it is devoid of facts.\n  Let me tell you what the effect of this provision would do. What this \nprovision would do is it would shift millions of dollars from schools \nthat serve our most at-risk kids to schools that serve wealthier \nchildren.\n  The Center for American Progress recently released a report that \nbroke down exactly what the language would mean for high-need schools \nin each State. In Colorado alone, schools that serve students of \npoverty would lose over $8 million of funding.\n  So again, let's talk about how this works.\n  There is a threshold in each school district for schools that receive \ntitle I free and reduced lunch services. They are focused on the \nschools that serve the largest pockets of poverty.\n  In a school district like Boulder Valley School District whose \nsuperintendent was in to meet with me earlier today, they offer title I \nservices in their schools that have about 40 percent or more free and \nreduced lunch kids. That allows them to focus on the eight or nine \nschools that have the highest need in what is overall a fairly \nprosperous school district.\n  If this provision were passed, resources would be diverted out of \nthose schools that are in our neediest communities to the schools that \nare in our wealthiest communities.\n  As our ranking member has said and probably will say again, what \nproblem is it you are trying to solve by shifting resources from poor \nschools to wealthy schools? While, again, it is a noble concept, and if \nthere were a way to hold harmless or provide additional support for \nschools that serve at-risk kids, there might be some basis of \ndiscussion with myself and Members on my side of the aisle; but to \nsimply say that we are going to shift tens or hundreds of millions of \ndollars from schools that serve kids in communities of poverty to \nwealthier schools, under any possible accountability metric, I \nguarantee you, will only increase the already persistent learning gap \nthat exists between communities of poverty and prosperous communities, \nand is exactly the wrong way to go with regard to how we target our \nFederal resources to make the biggest difference in the lives of \nAmericans who deserve access to quality public education.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate my colleague on the other side of the aisle's enthusiasm \non this issue. This is an important topic, something that we have been \ndiscussing and debating for many, many\n\n[[Page H4883]]\n\nyears and will continue to, because all of us want to do right by the \nchildren in our school districts. They are our future. We have an equal \namount of enthusiasm on our side of the aisle.\n  At this time, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to the good \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), our majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I rise in support not only of the rule, but of the underlying \nlegislation with reforms that are included not only in the bill, but in \nthe amendments that are coming forward in this rule.\n  I first want to commend Chairman Kline and his staff for working over \nthe last few months with many members of our Conference that had some \nreal issues they wanted to see addressed in the bill. I want to talk \nabout a few of those, specifically, the Salmon amendment that this rule \nmakes in order that brings forward the ability for parents to opt out \nof testing in a way that doesn't impact the local school system.\n  This comes down to a question of whether or not you trust parents to \nmake the right decisions for their children in making real reforms that \ngive parents more control, getting Washington out of those decisions \nand allowing local innovation to move forward, and allowing parents to \nmake those decisions about what is best for their children. So the \nSalmon amendment does that. I strongly support it, and I know Chairman \nKline supports it as well.\n  I want to also point out the Rokita-Grothman amendment. This is an \namendment, again, that Chairman Kline worked very closely with a number \nof our members on to bring forward to reduce the timeframe of the \nauthorization. Instead of a 6-year authorization, it would be a 4-year \nauthorization to give an opportunity to let the next administration put \ntheir own prints on what they want to see in terms of education reform \nwhile allowing these other reforms to move forward. That is an \namendment that Chairman Kline supports, as I do, and, hopefully, gets \nadded to the bill.\n  The third amendment I want to talk about is the Zeldin amendment. \nThis is an amendment that gets the Federal Government out of Common \nCore, not only financially, but also taking the ability away from the \nSecretary of the Department to use things like Common Core as a \nbludgeon when they are determining whether or not to approve waivers. \nSo I think it is very important to get the Federal Government out of \nthose decisions of Common Core, and that is what the Zeldin amendment \ndoes.\n  And then, finally, the Walker amendment, allowing a vote on A-PLUS, \nis something that I support, and I am glad that that is in the rule as \nwell.\n  So many good reforms, not only with the amendments, but with the \nunderlying bill, to give parents more control and get the Federal \nGovernment out of those decisions, really good legislation to advance \nconservative causes in letting innovation happen at the local level.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Wilson), the ranking member of the Education and the \nWorkforce Subcommittee on Workforce Protections.\n  Ms. WILSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, as a former teacher, elementary \nschool principal, and school board member, I know firsthand that No \nChild Left Behind is in need of serious improvement. Improvements must \ntake substantial steps towards fulfilling the promises made by ESEA, \nthose simple, yet powerful, promises that are at the heart of this \ncivil rights law, promises made to all American children.\n  H.R. 5 ignores these promises and endangers the educational gains \nmade in the 50 years since ESEA was passed. H.R. 5 threatens to thrust \nus back to a time when the right to quality education was merely an \nintangible promise for disadvantaged children. It ignores the promises \nat the heart of this civil rights law.\n  We must take substantial steps towards fulfilling the promises made \nby ESEA. H.R. 5 ignores the promise to value every child by allowing \nStates and school districts to redirect funds away from the schools and \nthe children most in need. They call it portability. H.R. 5 ignores the \npromise that every child counts by using vague and undefined \naccountability measures and failing to provide Federal guardrails for \nstudent achievement.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  H.R. 5 ignores the promise that every child deserves a quality \neducation, and it does so by failing to address our excessive \ndependence on deeply problematic standardized tests. We need to move \ntoward more balanced forms of assessment that effectively measure \ndiverse kinds of success in teaching and learning.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have spent decades working to understand how children \nlearn, and I can tell you this--that this bill fails to meet the very \npromises that are essential for educating our children and that are at \nthe heart of the ESEA. I strongly urge all of my colleagues to vote \nagainst this bill of unfulfilled promises.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx), someone who really embodies something that I \nhave seen in this Congress on both sides of the aisle since my becoming \na Member, people who dedicate their lives to different fields. \nCongresswoman Foxx is a colleague and a member of the Rules Committee \nwho has dedicated her life to education.\n  Ms. FOXX. I thank my colleague from Washington for yielding and for \nhis kind comments.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's debate on education and the Student Success Act \nis a crucial one for our future.\n  Over the last five decades, the Federal Government's role in \neducation has increased dramatically. The Department of Education \ncurrently runs more than 80 K-12 education programs, many of which are \nduplicative or ineffective.\n  As a school board member in North Carolina, I saw how the vast \nreporting requirements for these Federal programs tie the hands of \nState and local school education leaders.\n  My colleagues on the House Education and the Workforce Committee and \nI have been working on the Student Success Act to make commonsense \nchanges to update Federal law, addressing the concerns raised following \nNo Child Left Behind.\n  Our legislation is centered on four principles: reducing the Federal \nfootprint in education, empowering parents, supporting effective \nteachers, and restoring local control.\n  H.R. 5, the Student Success Act, will also streamline the Department \nof Education's bureaucracy by eliminating more than 65 duplicative and \nineffective Federal education programs, cutting through the \nbureaucratic red tape that is stifling innovation in the classroom, \ngranting States and school districts the authority to use Federal \neducation funds as they believe will best meet the unique needs of \ntheir students.\n  Additionally, this legislation will take definitive steps to limit \nthe Secretary's authority by prohibiting him or her from coercing \nStates into adopting academic standards like the Common Core.\n  If we would like to reduce the Federal Government's role in \neducation, we must act. In the absence of congressional action, \nPresident Obama and his Education Department have taken unprecedented \nsteps to regulate education.\n  Beginning in 2011, the Obama administration began offering States \ntemporary waivers from No Child Left Behind's onerous burden in \nexchange for granting the Secretary of Education complete discretion to \ncoerce States into enacting the President's preferred education \nreforms.\n  The Student Success Act provides an important opportunity to stop \nPresident Obama's overreach into State and local education debates \nthrough his waiver scheme.\n  Mr. Speaker, our children deserve better. It is time to acknowledge \nmore Federal intrusion cannot address the challenges facing schools. \nThat is the promise of the Student Success Act: a reduced Federal role, \nfocused on restoring authority and control to parents, teachers, \nStates, and communities on how our children are educated.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule and the underlying bill.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan), a member of the Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce.\n\n[[Page H4884]]\n\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, on the 50th anniversary of the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Act, now more than ever we must ensure that every \nkid has access to a great school. It shouldn't matter who your parents \nare, what ZIP code you live in, or how many zeros are at the end of \nyour bank account.\n  H.R. 5 breaks the promise made 50 years ago to help all kids get a \ngood public education and to recognize the challenges faced by kids \nliving in poverty.\n  Republicans will have the opportunity to make their bad bill even \nworse by allowing an amendment to come to the floor today which \nessentially turns all of ESEA into a block grant, allowing States to \nuse Federal resources for any educational purpose, meaning States can \nredirect Federal funds towards taxpayer-funded vouchers for private and \nreligious schools.\n  That has been a failed experiment in Wisconsin, and that strips money \naway from public schools and hurts kids everywhere. I urge a ``no'' \nvote on H.R. 5, a bad bill that could likely get even worse today.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen), a fellow freshman.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the debate before this floor today is who knows best how \nto educate our children.\n  I rise today to speak about H.R. 5, the Student Success Act. This is \nlegislation that I believe goes a long way in getting the Federal \nGovernment out of the way of our schools and teachers and putting \neducation back in the right hands by restoring local control.\n  As a member of the Education and the Workforce Committee, I have \nspent several hours debating and marking up this legislation. I have \nalso visited several schools in my district and have spoken with \nparents, teachers, and administrators about the challenges they are \nfacing.\n  What I heard across the board was that top-down regulations from \nWashington are burdening our teachers with seemingly endless compliance \nrequirements.\n  Our educators should have the ability to focus on the individual \nneeds of their students and their classes. Instead, our current system \nis forcing them to spend time filling out paperwork and meeting this \none-size-fits-all requirement.\n  That is exactly why H.R. 5 is important legislation that I urge my \ncolleagues to support today. This bill replaces the current \naccountability system that says Washington knows what is best for our \nstudents, and it replaces it with a system that gives States and school \ndistricts the responsibility for measuring the success of their \nschools. Through bottom-up reforms, it restores local control and gives \nour educators more freedom to innovate.\n  I have personally seen in my district how students and communities \nbenefit from local innovation in schools. We have one such example in \nmy district that does not get $1 of Federal funding, and it takes \nchildren who are discarded by the public school system and makes \nsuccessful students from this group. I am very proud of what this \nschool has accomplished.\n  H.R. 5 empowers parents, just like at this school, with more \ninformation to hold schools accountable for effective teaching, and it \nexpands opportunities to send their children to a school that best \nmeets their needs. It also gets rid of almost 70 unnecessary Federal \nprograms and, instead, creates a block grant that provides money to the \nStates.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Under H.R. 5, States are protected from being coerced into \nadopting Common Core by the Department of Education, and they have the \nright to opt out of any program under the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, all of these are significant and needed steps to put the \nresponsibility of education back where it belongs, and that is with the \nStates, local school districts, parents, and the educators, as they \nknow what is best. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Committee \non Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, more than 60 years ago, in Brown vs. Board of Education, \nthe Supreme Court talked about the value of education when it said \nthat, these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be \nexpected to succeed in life if denied the opportunity of an education. \nSuch an opportunity where the State has undertaken to provide it is a \nright which must be made available to all on equal terms.\n  The fact is that equal educational opportunities were not and still \nare not always available in low-income areas, basically, for two \nreasons. First, we fund education through the real estate tax, \nvirtually guaranteeing that wealthy areas will have more resources; and \njust with the give and take in politics, you know that low-income areas \nwill generally get the short end of the stick.\n  In 1965, we enacted the Elementary and Secondary Education Act to \nrecognize the disparities in funding. It addresses ``the special \neducational needs of children of low-income families and the impact \nthat concentrations of low-income families have on the ability of local \neducational agencies to support adequate educational programs.''\n  While public education would remain fundamentally a local issue \nthrough ESEA, the government recognized that, without Federal oversight \nand support, districts would not address these inequities.\n  In the last reauthorization, better known as No Child Left Behind, in \naddition to money, Congress required States to identify and address \nachievement gaps.\n  Because of that work, the education of our children has been much \nimproved, as high school dropout rates are at historic lows, as the \nlong-term scores on the national tests have gone up, and as the \nachievement gaps for racial and ethnic minorities have actually been \nclosing, but the gap between rich and poor has actually been going up.\n  Mr. Speaker, with that background, the House has put forth its vision \nof the reauthorization of the ESEA, the Student Success Act. It \nviolates the original purpose of ESEA, first, by reducing the funding, \nbut also by changing the funding formula to take money from low-income \nareas and to give it to wealthy areas.\n  For example, Los Angeles, with 70 percent poverty, would lose about a \nquarter of its funding while Beverly Hills, with virtually no poverty, \nwould pick up about 30 percent in additional funding under that new \nformula.\n  This rule enables amendments that, if adopted in the bill, will \nsignificantly reduce the ability of States to determine academic \nachievement gaps.\n  Now, I recognize that everybody is mad at having to take tests, and \nwe address that in the bill by auditing the number of tests, making \nsure that there are as few as possible and that they are used for \npurposes which are validated.\n  The bill significantly scales back the ability of States to identify \nachievement gaps and then scales back their requirement to do anything \nabout it.\n  These are the major flaws in H.R. 5: less funding, less ability to \ndetermine the achievement gaps, and then no requirement to do anything \nabout it.\n  There are other problems with the bill, for example, block granting \nprograms that will end up underfunding bilingual education, afterschool \nprograms, STEM, arts education, and others. These vital programs will \ncertainly do worse.\n  Mr. Speaker, for these reasons, we should both defeat the rule. And \nif the rule passes, we should defeat the bill.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), another freshman \ncolleague.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the rule and \nof the underlying bill.\n  We have a chance today to help put our K-12 education system back on \ntrack, helping students all across this country.\n  Over the past 6 months, I have traveled in my district to listen to \nthe concerns of teachers, administrators, parents, and students.\n  One of the most common themes I hear is that there is too much \nconfusion coming from Washington and that\n\n[[Page H4885]]\n\nthose who know what is best--our educators and parents--are not getting \na say in our children's futures.\n  Local school districts understand the unique needs of their students \nfar better than any bureaucrat in Washington ever will.\n  From No Child Left Behind, Race to the Top, and waivers, the \nDepartment of Education has sent so many mixed signals that it is \nimpossible for teachers and administrators to focus on what is needed \nmost, flexibility to help students learn and succeed. This is why I am \na strong supporter of H.R. 5.\n  I commend Chairman John Kline and Subcommittee Chairman Todd Rokita \nfor putting forward legislation that ensures that students and schools \nare put first. Accountability will now be placed where it should have \nbeen all along, with States and local school districts.\n  Labeling half of all schools in the United States as failing has \ncaused the Department of Education to become far too overreaching in \ndefining accountability as they continue to shift the metrics on what \nis considered satisfactory.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 5 empowers parents and students by giving them \naccess to information about local schools in order to hold them \naccountable.\n  In addition, this bill eliminates 65 duplicative and underperforming \nprograms and consolidates the money into a new grant program for local \nschool districts. This money can be spent by districts to meet their \nunique needs.\n  Funding for title I remains robust in the bill, and students and \nparents retain the ability to make the best educational decisions for \nthem by providing access to charter schools and magnet schools.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Particularly important for my constituents in New York is language in \nH.R. 5 that prevents the Secretary of Education from forcing States to \nimplement Common Core.\n  I urge all Members to vote ``aye'' on the rule and to support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Mrs. Davis), a member of the Committee on Education \nand the Workforce.\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, here we go again, back to the \nsame bill we debated earlier this year that continues to embrace the \nidea that less Federal oversight over Federal dollars is what we need \nto transform K-12 education.\n  The opposition seems to believe that removing Federal standards would \nhelp local leaders make tough decisions. That is absolutely wrong. It \nactually makes it harder.\n  For 9 years, I served on a school board in a large urban school \ndistrict, and I remember agonizing over the decision to move money from \none high-needs school to another. In the end, it was the law and \nsafeguards around title I that helped direct us to make sure the money \nwent to the students that required the greatest assistance. This \nchanges that.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we need is a Federal law that gives guidance to \nlocal school board members that must deal with thousands of competing \ninterests every single day and which enables local leaders ultimately \nto make the right decision.\n  Mr. Speaker, today represents a missed opportunity. We need a 21st \ncentury education system that makes investment in all our Nation's \nchildren. That and only that will help our Nation compete in the global \neconomy. Today's reauthorization of ESEA not only misses the mark, but \nactually moves us in the wrong direction.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, a ``no'' vote on final passage and \nalso on the Salmon amendment.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Rokita), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Early \nChildhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the leadership, the gentleman from \nWashington, and the members of the Committee on Rules for bringing this \nrule to the floor. I think it is a good rule. I urge a ``yes'' vote on \nit and the underlying bill, which I am hopeful and pleased we are going \nto get to today.\n  In response to some of the last speakers, first of all, let me \nassociate myself with the remarks of Ms. Stefanik from New York. She is \nright on. This is exactly the kind of policy and law that we need in \nthis country at this particular time because it puts the trust and the \npersonal responsibility back in the hands of the people where it \nbelongs; and that is our parents, our teachers, our school principals, \nand superintendents.\n  How arrogant for anyone to think that we here in Washington know \nbetter how to raise our children than those children's parents, working \nhand in hand, side by side, with that child's teacher and school \nleaders.\n  This bill is needed. It is right on point. It is needed for the 21st \ncentury, and I want to address some of the misinformation that might be \nout there.\n  First of all, I want to be very clear, Mr. Speaker, that the civil \nrights protections, which I agree with my friend, the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Education and the Workforce, are very, very \nimportant--critical. That is all kept here. That language remains \nbecause it is essential.\n  Secondly, we mandate disaggregated data so that we can see from a \nholistic, collective standpoint how our children of whatever ethnic \nbackground are doing. That is very important. That is kept. Title I is \nthere. There is some more portability, but we think that is a good \nthing because choice in this subject is a good thing.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I would say that this isn't about money. \nFederal spending in education has gone up 300 percent since the Federal \nGovernment got involved in this business, and test results are flat. It \nis not about money. It is about leadership.\n  The best way to empower leaders is to give them the tools that they \nneed so that they can help our children grow and compete in the 21st \ncentury world and win. That is exactly what the Student Success Act \ndoes. It trusts teachers and parents over Washington bureaucrats.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for full support from this House for the rule and \nfor the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule \nwhich would allow for consideration of H.R. 5, a harmful bill that \nabandons our commitment to ensuring all children in my home State of \nArizona and across the country are afforded quality education that \nprepares them for success.\n  We can all agree that every child deserves a fair shot by giving them \nand their teachers the tools they need; but the reality is millions of \nkids face additional barriers that require targeted resources. \nUnfortunately, this bill turns its back on these kids by block granting \nall funding for English language learners, migrant students, and at-\nrisk students and lets the funding be spent elsewhere.\n  What is more, it eliminates requirements that schools improve the \neducation of English language learners each year. By removing \naccountability for the achievement and learning gains of Latinos and \nEnglish language learners, this bill ignores the real needs of kids and \nfamilies across our communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, a Latino child in Phoenix deserves every resource he or \nshe needs to succeed. That is why I strongly support the Democratic \nsubstitute amendment to H.R. 5 offered by my colleague Congressman \nScott. This alternative recognizes the needs of Latino students and \nensures proper oversight that we know is necessary.\n  I urge all my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5 and its dangerous \nprovisions for Latino students.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, when he first signed into law the \nElementary and Secondary Education Act, President Lyndon B. Johnson \ngreatly advanced both education and civil rights.\n  Now, here, 50 years later, the need for Federal support for our \nschools remains very real, but Republicans celebrate the anniversary by \neffectively repealing the civil rights portion, Title I, of this act.\n  In February, Republicans began consideration of this bill and then \nsuspended it because so many of their Members did not think it was \nextreme\n\n[[Page H4886]]\n\nenough in cutting aid to our schools. Since then, the Senate has come \ntogether in a bipartisan, though lacking, approach, but a better \napproach that recognizes the need for civil rights and public \neducation.\n  Just as it did previously on immigration reform, the House has \nrejected that bipartisan approach and has jumped off the right end with \na more extreme antieducation attitude.\n  In a few weeks, bright-faced young schoolchildren will put on their \nbackpacks and head off to school. As their number increases, this bill \nactually cuts the purchasing power available to our schools to meet \nthose growing needs.\n  Most importantly, Republicans would encourage the States to divert \naid from the schools with the greatest need and to actually use Federal \ndollars to replace what the States are already spending on education.\n  Not only does the bill shortchange our schools and our students, it \nalso eliminates dedicated funding for important programs like STEM--\nscience, technology, engineering, and math education. These STEM skills \nare driving innovation.\n  It is silent on support for our youngest Americans, as schools across \nthe country recognize that brain research supports having pre-K through \n12 education. We need not only accountability but funding. This bill \nshould be rejected. We cannot shut the door on these students.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the good gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, passage of this measure will restore \nresponsible management to our forests after decades of Federal neglect. \nMy district includes seven national forests which have suffered from \nincreasingly devastating forest fires caused by overgrown, mismanaged \nforests and has been economically hobbled by restrictions on forest \nmanagement.\n  Last year, in just one of my counties, just three forest fires burned \n200,000 acres. Our rural communities, public lands, and environment are \nbeing destroyed by this neglect.\n  This measure will return active management to our forests by \nincreasing flexibility; cutting red tape; and, most importantly, acting \nto manage forests before fires occur, not afterwards. Streamlining the \nreview process means that forest management can occur when it is \nactually needed to address dangerous conditions, not after years of \nlegal roadblocks.\n  Allowing categorical exclusions for postfire salvage and \nrehabilitation hastens forest recovery and prevents fuel buildup that \ncan contribute to the next future fire. Expanding local involvement in \nforest management will improve the data available for planning and \nrespect local priorities.\n  In light of Forest Service surveys finding that over 12 million \nSierra Nevada trees have died in the last year, we cannot afford to \nwait another year.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is imperative that we act today before our forests \nhave passed beyond any point where they can be restored to good forest \nhealth.\n  Mr. POLIS. I would like to inquire how much time remains on both \nsides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Allen). The gentleman from Colorado has \n2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Washington has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  Instead of engaging in partisan fights on so important an issue that, \nin essence, is about our future as a Nation and future generations, we \nshould find common ground. Education is a civil right. All students \ndeserve the opportunity of a world class, high-quality education.\n  This very week, the Senate is discussing their own version of ESEA \nreauthorization. Now, while nothing is perfect, their bill reflects the \nbipartisan spirit that would improve this bill if it was allowed in \nthis body.\n  Members of the Tri-Caucus and leaders of the New Democrat Coalition \nhave sent letters to the chairman and ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Health, Employment, Labor, and Pensions with a number \nof suggestions for their bill, but at least there is a bipartisan \nattempt to help prepare our Nation's kids for our future.\n  ESEA is one of the most significant pieces of legislation this body \nwill consider. It is a bill about our future. Members of this body are \neager to improve this bill and pass a reauthorized version to finally \nreplace No Child Left Behind.\n  No child should have to attend a failing school, and ZIP Code and \nrace should never determine the quality of an education that a child \nreceives. I think that is something, hopefully, we can agree on as a \ncore principle.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us retreats from our promise to our \nNation's students. H.R. 5 would bring us back to a time with no \naccountability standards, where students with disabilities are swept \nunder the rug.\n  It would divert money from the schools and kids that need it the \nmost; and with the Salmon amendment, it would sweep minority students, \nstudents with disabilities, new immigrant students, and low-income \nstudents under the rug, as they were in the past. Now that they have \nemerged, we must ensure that they meet all the learning needs for all \nstudents.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are shortchanging our Nation's kids by not being \nthoughtful and deliberate with this issue. It is rare that a bill would \nunite the business community, teachers, school boards, and many others \nin opposition, but H.R. 5 does this.\n  The bill's sponsors had 133 days to give students and our country a \nbill that they deserve.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  It is a shame that they didn't take better advantage of that \nopportunity.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule; ``no'' on the \nbill; ``no'' on the Salmon amendment; and ``yes'' on the Democratic \nsubstitute, which was thoughtfully put together to ensure that \nAmerica's next generation is prepared to carry on our legacy of global \nleadership and to put food on their tables as aspiring members of our \ngreat country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As you can tell, due to the number of colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle speaking today, these are critically important issues we are \nconsidering, important to the economic well-being of our country, as \nwell as to the health of our forest lands and the safety of rural \ncommunities.\n  Reforming our education system and the way we combat wildfires and \nmanage our forests is of the highest priority, and I urge my colleagues \nto support this rule, as well as both of the underlying bills.\n  This rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2647, the Resilient \nFederal Forests Act of 2015, a bipartisan, comprehensive bill aimed at \nexpediting and improving forest management activities in Federal \nforests.\n  This critical piece of legislation would address the disastrous \nconsequences of catastrophic wildfire and would return resilience to \nour overgrown, fire-prone forests by dramatically improving the health \nof our Federal forests and rangelands.\n  My district, as well as many other areas around the country, continue \nto face the threat of catastrophic wildfire, which is made worse by the \ncontinuing drought conditions and the poor management and maintenance \nof forests on our Federal lands.\n  We must begin to take steps to prevent and address these fires, which \nthis bill does by reforming the way we prepare, respond to, and fund \nwildfire response and mitigation efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot continue on this current path, where we limp \nfrom one devastating fire to the next, unable to break the cycle of \ndestructive fire seasons due to ineffective funding mechanisms, \ninsufficient forest maintenance, and a burdensome Federal permitting \nand review process.\n  This bill addresses these shortcomings by tackling the problem of \nfire borrowing, simplifying environmental process requirements, \nreducing project planning times, and lowering the cost of implementing \nforest management projects, all while ensuring robust environmental \nprotections.\n  Mr. Speaker, because of the reforms and streamlined authorities in \nthis bill, there will be an increase in acres of treated land, which \nwill come at no additional cost to our taxpayers. This legislation is \nessential and desperately needed to change the outdated, unsustainable, \nand ultimately dangerous system of forest management on Federal lands.\n\n[[Page H4887]]\n\n  This rule also provides for further consideration of H.R. 5, the \nStudent Success Act, a reform of our Nation's education system which \nreduces the Federal Government's footprint in State and local issues \nand restores control over education back to those on the ground who are \nbest qualified to make the decisions affecting their students, parents, \nteachers, and communities.\n  Mr. Speaker, a well-educated workforce is imperative to the health \nand vitality of both our Nation's children and our economy. The Student \nSuccess Act empowers parents, local communities, and State governments \nto lead the way in fixing America's broken educational system.\n  H.R. 5 will benefit students, parents, teachers, and school \nadministrators by returning responsibility for student achievement to \nthe States and local communities, while maintaining high standards and \nexpectations for our Nation's students, teachers, and schools.\n  This is a good, straightforward rule, Mr. Speaker, allowing for \nconsideration of two critical pieces of legislation that will help \nprotect our rural communities, provide much-needed reforms to our \neducation system, and ensure that we are prepared to respond to the \ndevastating and catastrophic wildfires that have plagued many areas of \nour country. I support the rule's adoption, and I urge my colleagues \nalso to support both the rule and the underlying bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to celebrate the \ncongressional version of the Women's World Cup Soccer team, the \nsoftball version.\n  I am here with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, my \nteammates, my sisters who played valiantly in the 7th Annual \nCongressional Women's Softball Game.\n  Congratulations to the women Members of Congress who beat the press \nin a shutout game, defending our title in back-to-back victories as \nCongressional Women's Softball Game Champions.\n  I want to thank my teammates on both sides of the aisle. They have \nbecome my sisters and my friends throughout the whole season.\n  It is always so amazing to think about what we do over 3 months with \nthe incredibly busy schedules that so many of us have, coming out to \npractice at 7:00 in the morning, two or three times a week. We did not \nhave a smaller turnout for practice than 10 Members at each practice at \n7:00 in the morning. And our hard work paid off.\n  This is a game that, I know, many of you know is near and dear to my \nheart.\n  I know that many of you know this. It bears repeating just because of \nthe reason that we play this game. I was\n\n[[Page H4888]]\n\ndiagnosed with breast cancer 7\\1/2\\ years ago, and today I am cancer \nfree at 41 years old.\n  It is really timely for us to be able to focus some attention on \nbreast cancer in young women, given the USPSTF recommendations and the \ndiscussions that we are having around making sure that we pay attention \nand help young women focus on their breast health. That is what this \ngame is all about.\n  We are so proud to tell you that since we started this game 7 years \nago, we have raised about $700,000 for the Young Survival Coalition. \n$200,000 of that was this game.\n  Without the leadership and dedication of our board of directors and \nour organizing committee, this game and the money we raise would not \nhave been possible.\n  I want to specifically thank our board president, Kate Yglesias \nHoughton, and all the members of board: Atalie Ebersole, Natalie \nBuchanan, Tori Barnes, and Kristen Buckler. Also, a huge thank you to \nthe members of the organizing committee: Jill Agostino, Sean Bartlett, \nGary Caruso, Kayla Dunlap, Katharine Emerson, Ben Gerdes, Jenna Glazer, \nKathryn Hamm, Erika Kelly, Jim Kiley, and Dana Paikowsky. A special \nshout-out to Eddie Perlmutter, who was one of our assistant coaches, \nand to our cheerleaders.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Alabama (Mrs. \nRoby), who for the second time this month and for the second time in \nthe last couple of weeks is actually standing next to me.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the \ngentlewoman from Florida's remarks.\n  I also would like to thank all of our colleagues here in this Chamber \ntoday that have not only come out and supported us, but also supported \nthe Young Survivors Coalition as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the survivors. Each member of this \nteam played either in memory of or on behalf of someone who is \ncurrently struggling with the fight with cancer.\n  So I would just say to mine, Rhonda McCall Walker, Mr. Speaker, who \ncame from Alabama and attended the game, along with so many others, \nthat we support these individuals. This is a really incredible thing \nthat the Members of Congress do.\n  Mr. Speaker, to the Bad News Babes, I would just say we are on it for \nnext year, too. So keep your guard up.\n  I would like to also recognize the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. \nCastor), who is the MVP. She played an incredible game. And ``most \nimproved'' is the gentlewoman from Arizona, Kyrsten Sinema.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4888-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4888-H4900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     DEPARTMENT OF THE INTERIOR, ENVIRONMENT, AND RELATED AGENCIES \n                        APPROPRIATIONS ACT, 2016\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Res. 337\n\n       Whereas Tibet is the center of Tibetan Buddhism, and His \n     Holiness the Dalai Lama is the most revered figure in Tibetan \n     Buddhism worldwide;\n       Whereas the Chinese response to the Tibetan Uprising in \n     1959 led to the exile of Tenzin Gyatso, His Holiness the 14th \n     Dalai Lama, Tibet's spiritual and temporal leader;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, who on July 6, \n     2015, celebrates his 80th birthday, has for over 50 years in \n     exile significantly advanced greater understanding, \n     tolerance, harmony and respect among the religious faiths of \n     the world;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has led the effort \n     to preserve the rich cultural, religious, historical and \n     linguistic heritage of the Tibetan people while at the same \n     time promoting the safeguarding of other endangered cultures \n     throughout the world;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has personally \n     promoted democratic self-government for Tibetans in exile and \n     in 2011 turned over political authority to the democratically \n     elected leadership of the Central Tibetan Administration;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama has been greatly \n     concerned by the state of the Tibetan environment and the \n     exploitation of its natural resources, including fresh \n     water--as rivers originating in the Tibetan plateau support \n     one-third of the world's population--and has promoted \n     environmental awareness in the region;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the \n     Nobel Peace Prize in 1989 in recognition of his efforts to \n     seek a peaceful resolution to the situation in Tibet, and to \n     promote non-violent methods for resolving conflict;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama was awarded the \n     Congressional Gold Medal in 2007 in recognition of his \n     promotion of democracy, freedom, and peace for the Tibetan \n     people; his efforts to preserve the cultural, religious, and \n     linguistic heritage of the Tibetan people; his promotion of \n     non-violence; and his contributions to global religious \n     understanding, human rights, and ecology;\n       Whereas His Holiness the 14th Dalai Lama, as the spiritual \n     leader of Tibetan Buddhism, publicly presented in 2011 the \n     religious process which Tibetan Buddhists should follow \n     regarding his reincarnation;\n       Whereas the Chinese central government has attempted to \n     interfere with the reincarnation process and the practice of \n     Tibetan Buddhist religious traditions; and Chinese officials \n     assert that the failure to secure Beijing's approval on the \n     Dalai Lama's reincarnation would make the process \n     ``illegal'';\n       Whereas in the words of Party official Zhu Weiqun, \n     ``Decision-making power over the reincarnation of the Dalai \n     Lama and over the end or survival of his lineage, resides \n     with the central government of China.'';\n       Whereas the Department of State's International Religious \n     Freedom Report for 2013 noted that in Tibetan areas of China \n     ``[r]epression was severe and increased around politically \n     sensitive events and religious anniversaries,'' and \n     ``[o]fficial interference in the practice of Tibetan Buddhist \n     religious traditions continued to generate profound \n     grievances'';\n       Whereas the Department of State has designated China as a \n     ``country of particular concern'' (CPC) for religious freedom \n     since 1999, and in its 2013 human rights report details that \n     ``under the banner of maintaining social stability and \n     combating separatism, the [Chinese] government has engaged in \n     the severe repression of Tibet's unique religious, cultural, \n     and linguistic heritage by, among other means, strictly \n     curtailing the civil rights of China's ethnic Tibetan \n     population, including the freedoms of speech, religion, \n     association, assembly, and movement'';\n       Whereas access to Tibetan areas of China for United States \n     officials, journalists, and other United States citizens, is \n     restricted by the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China, obscuring the full impact of the Chinese Government's \n     policies, including the disappearance of Tibetans who sought \n     to share information about human rights abuses on the Tibetan \n     Plateau;\n       Whereas the Department of State's 2014 Report on Tibet \n     Negotiations noted that ``The Dalai Lama's representatives \n     and Chinese officials have not met directly since the ninth \n     round of dialogue in January 2010.'';\n       Whereas, on March 10, 2015, the elected Tibetan leader \n     Sikyong Dr. Lobsang Sangay publicly stated ``The Envoys of \n     His Holiness the Dalai Lama are ready to engage in dialogue \n     with their Chinese counterpart any time and any place.'';\n       Whereas it is the objective of the United States \n     Government, consistent across administrations of different \n     political parties and as articulated in the Tibetan Policy \n     Act of 2002 (subtitle B of title VI of Public Law 107-228; 22 \n     U.S.C. 6901 note) to promote dialogue between the Government \n     of the People's Republic of China and the Dalai Lama or his \n     representatives to reach a negotiated agreement on Tibet;\n       Whereas China may be considering convening a Sixth Tibet \n     Work Forum to set policy on Tibet for the next five years or \n     so, with the last such work forum having been held in 2010; \n     and\n       Whereas the American people have a long-held concern for \n     and interest in the plight of the Tibetan people: Now, \n     therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) calls on the United States Government to fully \n     implement sections 613(a) and 621(c) of the Tibetan Policy \n     Act of 2002 by strongly encouraging representatives of the \n     Government of the People's Republic of China and His Holiness \n     the Dalai Lama to hold substantive dialogue, in keeping with \n     the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 and without preconditions, in \n     order to address Tibetan grievances and secure a negotiated \n     agreement for the Tibetan people;\n       (2) calls on the United States Government to fully \n     implement section 618 of the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 in \n     regard to the establishment of an office in Lhasa, Tibet, to \n     monitor political, economic and cultural developments in \n     Tibet, and to provide consular protection and citizen \n     services;\n       (3) urges the United States Government--\n       (A) to consistently raise Tibetan human rights and \n     political and religious freedom concerns at the United \n     States-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and other high-\n     level bilateral meetings;\n       (B) and the Special Coordinator for Tibetan Issues to offer \n     their assistance to China in its preparations for a potential \n     future Sixth Tibet Work Form; and\n       (C) to call for the immediate and unconditional release of \n     Tibetan political prisoners, including Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, \n     the 11th Panchen Lama, who was taken into custody by the \n     Chinese authorities and has been missing since 1995, Tenzin \n     Delek Rinpoche, and Khenpo Kartse (Khenpo Karma Tsewang);\n       (4) calls on the United States Government to underscore \n     that government interference in the Tibetan reincarnation \n     process is a violation of the internationally recognized \n     right to religious freedom and to highlight the fact that \n     other countries besides China have long Tibetan Buddhist \n     traditions, and that matters related to reincarnations in \n     Tibetan Buddhism are of keen interest to Tibetan Buddhist \n     populations worldwide;\n       (5) calls on the United States Government to recognize and \n     increase global public awareness and monitoring of the \n     upcoming electoral process through which the Tibetan\n\n[[Page H4901]]\n\n     people in exile will choose the next democratically elected \n     leader of the Central Tibetan Administration, the Sikyong;\n       (6) calls on the United States Government to fully \n     implement section 616(b) of the Tibetan Policy Act of 2002 by \n     using its voice and vote to encourage development \n     organizations and agencies to design and implement \n     development projects that fully comply with the Tibet Project \n     Principles;\n       (7) calls on United States and international governments, \n     organizations, and civil society to renew and reinforce \n     initiatives to promote the preservation of the distinct \n     religious, cultural, linguistic, and national identity of the \n     Tibetan people;\n       (8) calls on the Government of the People's Republic of \n     China to allow unrestricted access to the Tibetan areas of \n     China to United States officials, journalists, and other \n     United States citizens;\n       (9) affirms the Dalai Lama's desire for a negotiated \n     agreement for the Tibetan people, and urges the Chinese \n     government to enter into negotiations with the Dalai Lama and \n     his representatives; and\n       (10) reaffirms the unwavering friendship between the people \n     of the United States and the people of Tibet.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to submit statements or \nextraneous materials for the Record on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of House Resolution 337, \ncalling for substantive dialogue without preconditions to help secure a \nnegotiated agreement for the Tibetan people. I want to thank the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), my friend and colleague, for his \nleadership in introducing this bipartisan resolution.\n  This week, Madam Speaker, when so many voices around the world are \njoined in wishing his holiness the Dalai Lama a happy 80th birthday, it \nis a fitting time to recommit ourselves to Congress' longstanding \nsupport for the fundamental rights of the people of Tibet, because the \nsituation in Tibet has never been more bleak. Those basic rights \ninvolve fundamental and foundational rights of freedom of religion.\n  The recent State Department Human Rights Report offered a withering \ncriticism of the Chinese Government's oversight of Tibet and Tibetan \nareas in China. It said:\n\n       The government engaged in severe repression of Tibet's \n     religious, cultural, and religious heritage by, among other \n     means, strictly curtailing the civil rights of China's \n     Tibetan population, including the rights of the freedom of \n     speech, religion, association, assembly, and movement.\n\n  Unfortunately, the regime's interference extends even to the most \nelemental aspects of Tibetan Buddhist practice. This year marks the \n20th anniversary of the disappearance of the Panchen Lama, who was \ndetained by Chinese Government officials back in 1995 when he was a \nyoung child. Zhu Weiqun, a top Communist official dealing with ethnic \nand religious affairs, has claimed, ``decisionmaking power over the \nreincarnation of the Dalai Lama and over the end or survival of his \nlineage resides with the central Government of China.''\n  Sadly, we know that Tibetans have used self-immolations as a protest \nagainst religious and political oversight by the Chinese Government. \nThere have been 134 self-immolations since 2009. The numbers are \ndecreasing because of heavy security and punishments that target family \nmembers and entire villages. It is difficult to fathom the despair and \nthe desperation felt by Tibetans who take this last act of defiance. \nThe Chinese Government has blamed the Dalai Lama and ``foreign forces'' \nfor self-immolations instead of looking at how their own despicable \npolicies created such deep grievances.\n  Madam Speaker, the Tibetan people want to be free to practice their \nunique faith and to live by the dictates of their faith. This freedom \nis denied to them. The Chinese Government expanded its efforts last \nyear to transform Tibetan Buddhism into a state-managed institution. \nThey sought to undermine the devotion of the Tibetan people to the \nDalai Lama and control the process of selecting Buddhist leaders. The \nChinese Government wants a Tibetan Buddhism that is attractive to \ntourists and which allows the Communist Party to manage its affairs.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  The U.N. Special Rapporteur on religion recently criticized China's \nefforts to control Tibetan Buddhism and the process of selecting \nleaders. He said:\n\n       The Chinese Government is destroying the autonomy of \n     religious communities . . . creating schisms and pitting \n     people against each other in order to exercise control.\n\n  This is exactly what the Chinese Government has done to other \nreligious groups, including Catholics, Protestants, Muslims, and the \nFalun Gong. When the faithful don't fall in line, they are jailed.\n  Madam Speaker, the Congressional-Executive Commission on China, of \nwhich I serve as chairman, has a prisoner database that contains \nrecords on 617 Tibetan political and religious prisoners. Forty-four \npercent of those detained are monks, nuns, and religious teachers. \nAlmost all were imprisoned since 2008.\n  Unfortunately, our ability to get accurate information in real time \nabout this situation in Tibet is complicated by restrictions on access \nto Tibetan areas by United States officials, journalists, and other \nU.S. citizens. This has frustrated U.S. consular officers' ability to \nprovide services to American citizens.\n  In October 2013, the Chinese Government delayed access for over 48 \nhours during an emergency situation involving a bus accident that \nultimately resulted in the deaths of three U.S. citizens and injuries \nto others.\n  As the Chinese Government pushes for new consulates and official \nfacilities in the United States, our government must insist on an \nofficial presence in Lhasa, which is called for in section 618 of the \nTibetan Policy Act, which became law in the year 2002.\n  The Dalai Lama is recognized internationally for his commitment to \npeaceful and nonviolent conflict resolution. The recipient of the 1989 \nNobel Peace Prize and a Congressional Gold Medal winner in 2007, he has \nmade clear his willingness to engage in dialogue with Chinese \ncounterparts at any time, at any place, and without any preconditions.\n  Unfortunately, this commitment to peaceful dialogue is not \nreciprocal, and Chinese officials have not met directly with his \nrepresentatives in over 5 years. This is the longest break since the \ndialogue--or so-called dialogue--started in 2002.\n  Indeed, a Chinese Government white paper on Tibet published this \nApril states that China will ``only talk with private representatives \nof the Dalai Lama'' to discuss ``the future of the Dalai Lama'' and how \nhe can ``gain the forgiveness of the central government and the Chinese \npeople.''\n  That is outrageous. Instead of asking for the Dalai Lama's \nforgiveness for the decades of brutal repression, the Chinese \nGovernment demands that he ask the government of China for forgiveness.\n  This is unfortunate and highly counterproductive. If China's goal is \nto build a ``harmonious society'' in Tibet, which they love to tout, it \ncannot be done without the Dalai Lama. He is the spiritual leader of \nthe Tibetan people. His views are widely shared throughout Tibetan \nsociety, and he can be a constructive partner with China in addressing \ncontinuing tensions and deep-seated grievances.\n  In light of this, the resolution before us calls for fuller \nimplementation of existing U.S. law in support of direct dialogue \nbetween Chinese officials and the Dalai Lama; it calls for an official \nU.S. presence in Lhasa and urges our government to ensure that \nreligious rights and religious freedom issues are consistently raised \nin the U.S.-China Strategic and Economic Dialogue and other high-level \nmeetings.\n  It has many, many other provisions which I know the prime sponsor \nwill elaborate.\n  Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H. Res. 337, and I yield 1 \nminute to the gentlewoman from California\n\n[[Page H4902]]\n\n(Ms. Pelosi), our leader and one of the greatest champions of Tibet's \nstruggle for freedom.\n  Ms. PELOSI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \ncommend him for being a champion on human rights throughout the world.\n  I am pleased to associate myself with the remarks of Chairman Smith, \nand I thank him for his courageous, long-term dedication to human \nrights throughout the world and the recognition that what is happening \nin Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of our country and to the \nworld.\n  I thank him for enumerating some of the concerns that we have, and I \nknow that our distinguished ranking member will talk about some of what \nis contained in the resolution. I thank them both for their leadership.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and in \ncelebration of the 80th birthday of His Holiness the Dalai Lama, whose \nspiritual wisdom and friendship have been inspiring and uplifting to \nmany Tibetans, Americans, and people throughout the world.\n  His Holiness the Dalai Lama is a transcendent presence on the \ninternational stage. As a compassionate religious leader, astute \ndiplomat, and an undaunted believer in the power of nonviolence, the \nDalai Lama has earned the respect of people from many nations, many \nbackgrounds, and many faith traditions.\n  American Presidents and the American people have been inspired by His \nHoliness, who describes himself as a simple monk, ``no more, no less.'' \nThose American Presidents began with Franklin Roosevelt, who sent His \nHoliness the Dalai Lama a watch with the phases of the Moon on it for \nhis birthday when he was a little boy.\n  How prescient it was of President Roosevelt because His Holiness \nwould not only be a religious figure, but one who related so positively \nto science and its mysteries.\n  To Tibetan Buddhists, His Holiness is the earthly manifestation of \nthe living Buddha. To them and the international community, he is the \nspiritual leader of the Tibetan people. To millions of believers and \nadmirers, he is a source of wisdom and compassion. To young people, His \nHoliness is a positive example of how to make the world a better place.\n  As our colleague mentioned, the Chinese Government has refused to \nmeet with him. They are afraid to meet with him; they consider him a \nthreat, and that is so unnecessary. They accuse him of being for \nindependence when he has said for decades now that he is for autonomy \nfor Tibet.\n  The Chinese Government has brutally repressed Tibet's unique \nreligious, cultural, and linguistic heritage. The Chinese Government's \noppression of the Tibetan people and the Chinese Communist Party's \nvitriolic campaign against the Dalai Lama continues, which, again, \nchallenges us all to speak out.\n  Again, the situation in Tibet is a challenge to the conscience of the \nworld. If freedom-loving people do not speak out against oppression in \nTibet, then we have lost all moral authority to speak out on behalf of \nhuman rights anywhere in the world.\n  If it is a big country with whom we have big commercial interests, \nlike China, it deters us from using our voices in support of human \nrights. How then can we turn to smaller, less economically significant \ncountries and say, ``But for you, the standard is different''?\n  The Congress must continue to stand with the Tibetan people and stand \nwith His Holiness the Dalai Lama to ensure that Tibetan children are \nfree to learn their language, practice their faith, and honor their \nculture as they live in peace.\n  Perhaps one of the most remarkable achievements of His Holiness is \nhis profound and unbreakable connection with the people of Tibet. He \nhas won the Nobel Peace Prize, as was indicated; and we honored him \nwith a Congressional Gold Medal in 2007. At that time, it was an honor \nfor all of us that President George W. Bush and Mrs. Bush attended that \ngold medal ceremony.\n  An 80th birthday is a significant milestone in any culture, none more \nso than in Tibet. This is a moment to celebrate; yet on his birthday, \nJuly 6, Tibetans were still not even allowed to utter the Dalai Lama's \nname.\n  In the Dalai Lama's homeland, more than 140 Tibetans have self-\nimmolated to protest oppression by the Chinese Government and the \nChinese Communist Party's vitriolic campaign against the exiled Tibetan \nreligious; yet the people of Tibet persevere. They persevere in peace. \nThe nonviolent nature of the Tibetan struggle should serve as an \ninspiration to a world riven by conflict and devastating acts of \nviolence.\n  During his long life, the Dalai Lama has shown that harmony between \npeoples is based on freedom of expression, the freedom and courage to \nspeak the truth and treat others with mutual respect and dignity.\n  I just recall one incident when I was visiting His Holiness in India \nat Dharamsala. He had lamas come from all over to visit with our \nbipartisan congressional delegation who were visiting him there.\n  After people got up and talked about all the oppression and the \ncampaign against the Tibetans that was happening at that time, I got up \nto speak following that, and I said that we, in Congress, must act; we \nmust act in terms of legislation to support the people of Tibet.\n  I said so in a very forceful way because it was so sad to hear the \nstories of what was happening in Tibet, and I was so strong in my \nreaction to it. His Holiness followed me in the program, and he said: \n``I pray that we can rid Nancy of her negative attitudes.''\n  Anyway, there is no better way to honor the Dalai Lama on his 80th \nbirthday than by standing with him and the Tibetan people, vowing to \nkeep their cause alive.\n  As we wish His Holiness a peaceful and joyous birthday, we must \nrededicate ourselves to the cause of peace in the world and peace in \nour lives.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H. Res. 337. I am proud to have offered \nthis resolution that calls for the Chinese Government to sit down with \nTibet's leaders without preconditions, listen to their grievances, and \nwork toward an agreement that guarantees the rights and security of the \nTibetan people.\n  It also marks, as the Democratic leader pointed out, the 80th \nbirthday of the spiritual leader of the Tibetan people, His Holiness, \nthe 14th Dalai Lama.\n  I have had the privilege to meet His Holiness, who is truly a \nremarkable man, such a gentle spirit driven from within by incredible \nstrength and courage, a person of such humor and kindness whose life \nhas been marked by struggle and setback.\n  I first met him here in Washington many years ago. When you meet him, \nno matter your faith or background, you cannot help but feel the bond \nof common humanity and be drawn into his cause and the cause of the \nTibetan people; indeed, many in Congress have gotten behind this \neffort.\n  Let me, again, especially thank Leader Pelosi. There has been no \ngreater champion in Congress for the Tibetan struggle for freedom. For \nyears, she has held a light to the challenges the Tibetan people face \nin preserving their unique culture, language, and religion. I am \nhonored that she is cosponsoring this resolution.\n  Let me also thank Asia Subcommittee Chairman Matt Salmon, and co-\nchairmen of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, Representative Jim \nMcGovern and Representative Joseph Pitts, for supporting this measure. \nI thank my friend Mr. Smith of New Jersey as well.\n  Since 1951, the people of Tibet have lived under the shadow of the \nPeople's Republic of China, without guarantees of even the most basic \nrights and with no say in deciding Tibet's future. The Dalai Lama has \ndescribed the cultural genocide the Tibetan people have endured, forced \nassimilation and loss of language and cultural identity.\n  Today, as human rights conditions for the Tibetan people deteriorate \nand continue to deteriorate, as more monasteries come under government \ncontrol, as more people are arrested, the desperation of the Tibetan \npeople grows.\n  Tragically, more than 140 Tibetans have burned themselves alive in \nprotest of growing oppression; yet the Chinese authorities have not \nchanged course. Despite talk of mutual respect and social harmony, the \nreality in Tibet tells a very, very different story.\n\n[[Page H4903]]\n\n  Today, we look to the example set by the Dalai Lama and call for \nmeaningful change for the Tibetan people. The Dalai Lama's life has \nbeen a peaceful journey toward a better future for his people. It is in \nthat spirit that we call on the Chinese Government to negotiate without \npreconditions.\n  His Holiness has shown that democratic institutions can thrive \nalongside spiritual leadership. It is in that spirit that we urge the \nChinese Government not to involve itself in the spiritual succession \nprocess for the next Dalai Lama, should there be one.\n  The Dalai Lama has championed freedom of expression and freedom of \nconscience to promote mutual understanding and harmony. It is in this \nspirit that this resolution calls on China to allow unrestricted access \nto officials, journalists, and other America citizens.\n  Let's not forget the United States has an obligation to hold up these \nfreedoms as well. That is why this measure also calls on our own \ngovernment to press the issues of human rights, political rights, and \nreligious rights at the highest levels of the Chinese Government and to \ncall for the immediate release of Tibetan political prisoners.\n  Throughout his life, the Dalai Lama has worked for a peaceful path \nforward for the Tibetan people. We are grateful for his example and his \nwisdom. With this resolution, we urge China's leaders to do the right \nthing for Tibet.\n  I enthusiastically support this resolution; I urge my colleagues to \ndo the same, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 4 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern), the co-chair of the \nTom Lantos Human Rights Commission and a longtime supporter of the \nDalai Lama and of Tibet.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Engel) for yielding me the time and for his leadership on \nthis issue and on so many other issues.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Royce; Subcommittee Chairman Salmon; my \nfriend and fellow co-chair of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, \nCongressman Joe Pitts; as well as my colleague from New Jersey, \nCongressman Smith, for working in such a bipartisan way to bring this \nresolution to the House floor during this week when we are all \ncelebrating the 80th birthday of His Holiness, the Dalai Lama.\n  I especially want to thank Democratic Leader Pelosi for her many \nyears of leadership and support of the Tibetan people. She is a true \nchampion in the struggle to protect their basic human rights and \nautonomy.\n  We are all here because we care about the fundamental human rights of \nTibetans, including the right to worship as they choose and to enjoy \nand protect their culture. But we may be running out of time to \nguarantee those rights.\n  As we celebrate the 80th birthday of Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai \nLama, the Chinese Government has recently asserted its right to approve \nhis successor. The very continuation of the ancient line of Tibetan \nspiritual leadership and reincarnation is in question.\n  Next Tuesday, on July 14, the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission will \nhold a hearing on the situation in Tibet with the aim of identifying \nnew, creative ideas to advance the basic human rights of Tibetans and \nto ensure Tibetan autonomy.\n  I share the concerns of my colleagues that the situation in Tibet is \ndire.\n  Since 2009, more than 130 Tibetans inside China have taken the \nunimaginable step of setting themselves on fire. At least 112 are \nbelieved to have died. Some chose self-immolation to protest Chinese \nGovernment policies, others, to call for the return of the Dalai Lama. \nIn response, Chinese authorities have intensified official reprisals.\n  Surely the people of Tibet must wonder whether anyone is hearing \ntheir desperate cries. With this resolution, we are attempting to send \na clear message back to Tibet that, yes, we hear you. You are not \nalone.\n  Regrettably, the human rights abuses in Tibet are neither new nor \nunknown. On the contrary, Tibet is a very sensitive issue in U.S.-China \nrelations. U.S. policy is supposed to be guided by the Tibetan Policy \nAct of 2002, which encourages dialogue between the Chinese Government \nand representatives of the Dalai Lama, but Chinese intransigence has \nclosed down dialogue since 2010.\n  China also severely restricts access to Tibet and Tibetan regions, \nespecially for U.S. journalists, officials, and citizens, even though, \nI might add, Chinese citizens and officials enjoy unrestricted access \nhere in the United States.\n  In April, the Chinese Government issued a new white paper on Tibet, \nwith its own unbelievable version of history and an unprecedented \ndemand that the Dalai Lama publicly state that Tibet has been an \nintegral part of China since antiquity as a precondition for improving \nrelations with China.\n  Madam Speaker, we need to be doing something different. We need to \nhave the guts to take some action. Everyone in the world says how much \nthey admire the Dalai Lama. Every head of state, every international \norganization all declare how much they care about Tibet and worry about \nTibetan human rights abuses, but things have only gotten worse. We must \nall come together now to change the status quo, to change the game the \nChinese Government has been playing for so many decades.\n  The situation is urgent. It can wait no longer. And shame on all of \nus if we stand by with empty words and continue to watch the people of \nTibet suffer and their culture, religion, and way of life be \nexterminated day by day, year by year, until nothing is left.\n  So I thank my colleagues for bringing this urgent matter to the \nattention of Congress, and I urge all my colleagues to support H. Res. \n337.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the distinguished gentleman from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher).\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. What happens when the United States remains silent? \nWhat happens is repression and torture and the expansion of \ndictatorship, and, in the end, it makes the United States vulnerable.\n  We have sat back and permitted the Chinese to take whatever course \nthey want to suppress the people of Tibet for over three decades now. \nAnd has it made Tibet any better, the people any freer that we haven't \nput any demands on the Communist Party in Beijing?\n  Has it made war less likely between the United States?\n  Has there been any more, because we have given them such elbow room, \nthat the Chinese dictators in Beijing have decided to move on and treat \ntheir people a little bit better?\n  No. What has happened is there has been a growing repression and a \ngrowing chance of an altercation, an international altercation between \nChina and its neighbors and, yes, the United States.\n  It is time we stand up for the people of the world who are fighting, \nstruggling for their freedom, knowing that is what will make us secure, \nand nowhere is that more clear than in Tibet.\n  The people of Tibet are not Chinese people who are just reunited by \nthe Communist Chinese with the motherland in China. It has been a \ndistinct culture for centuries. And it wasn't until long after the \nCommunist Chinese had taken over the rest of China that they invaded \nTibet and subjugated its people.\n  The Dalai Lama is the spiritual leader, but also a symbolic force for \nfreedom of religion and humanitarianism in this world.\n  We, as Americans, need to make sure that we are on the side of the \nDalai Lama and the people of Tibet and in no way could our actions be \ninterpreted, our silence be interpreted to be acquiescence to the \nrepression that the people of Tibet have been experiencing these last \nthree and four decades.\n  I rise in support of H. Res. 337, and I thank my colleagues for the \nleadership that they have provided on this issue. Let's make sure \nAmerica stands tall, stands strong, and stands with the people of Tibet \nand other people seeking their freedom.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nto close.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 337. I think everyone who \nspoke\n\n[[Page H4904]]\n\nmade excellent points, and we are all of one mind. This is the right \nthing to do.\n  We should support this resolution to honor the deep humility, \nrespect, and peace that the Dalai Lama represents to us and to people \naround the world. We should support this resolution to underscore our \nfriendship and commitment to the Tibetan people and to all people who \nare oppressed and deprived of their basic rights.\n  Let me say that again, and to all people who are oppressed and \ndeprived of their basic rights.\n  And we should support this resolution on behalf of the Chinese people \nthemselves, the growing number of people inside China who understand \nChina itself will be more prosperous and more successful when their \ngovernment chooses to be genuinely open and respectful of all peoples \nand cultures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H. Res. 337, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time. I want to again thank my good friend and colleague Eliot Engel \nfor his excellent resolution. It is a bipartisan resolution.\n  I want to also thank Leader Pelosi for her eloquence on the floor \ntoday and for her love and respect that she has conveyed for decades to \nthe Dalai Lama and the people of Tibet.\n  This is a bipartisan resolution. It shows, I think, that we are \nabsolutely united, and I think that is an important message to send at \nthis critical juncture.\n  I also want to point out to my colleagues that China really is a \nplace where much is never as it seems to be. People who take trips \nthere, go on tours there, even Members of Congress who travel there \ncome away with a Potemkin village viewpoint of what is happening, \nespecially when torture and other degrading acts and cruelty is \nroutinely visited upon and imposed upon people that the Chinese \nGovernment deems to be of lesser value.\n  We see it with the Falun Gong. We see it with underground Christians. \nWe see it with the Uighurs. And we see it in Tibet, where there has \nbeen a systematic effort to eradicate the culture of Tibet. It is \ngenocide. They even used forced abortion as a way of genocide to kill \nthe children of Tibetan mothers.\n  Years ago I held a hearing in the mid-1990s, and it was on torture in \nthe People's Republic of China. And let us not forget, Chinese law \nproscribes torture. It prohibits torture. It is all a nice paper \npromise. It doesn't mean anything.\n  They have also signed the convention against torture, the U.N. \nconvention, and they love to ballyhoo that when they are at \ninternational fora and when their people travel here to the United \nStates.\n  But let's not forget, as well, that China took out a reservation to \nthe U.N. Convention Against Torture, Article 20, that exempts it from \naccepting any investigation about abuses. So the only one who will \ninvestigate China is the Chinese Government itself. They will not allow \nthe International Committee of the Red Cross. They will not allow U.S. \nrepresentatives and other bilateral or, I should say, multilateral \norganizations to come in and investigate allegations of torture.\n  Back in the early 1990s, again, I held this hearing, one of many. I \nhave held 53 hearings on human rights abuses in China over the years. \nBut this one we had six people, all of whom had been tortured with \nimpunity by the Chinese Government.\n  Palden Gyatso, who is a Buddhist monk, came to the Rayburn Building, \ntried to go through the security there and was stopped. He was stopped \nbecause he brought with him some of the implements of torture that are \nused routinely by the Chinese Government--cattle prods and other \nhideous instruments that are put under the arms and elsewhere to cause \nhorrific damage and pain to the victim--and he described in detail at \nthe hearing what he personally went through.\n  Regrettably, that continues to this day. The State Department's \nreport on human rights recently released reminds us that electric \nshocks, exposure to cold, and severe beatings, as well as extreme \nphysical labor, are routinely used against Tibetans and Tibetan \nBuddhists, in particular, just like they were against Palden Gyatso \nyears ago.\n  So it has not changed. It has actually gotten worse. And again, this \nresolution brings the light and scrutiny that is so necessary to these \nhideous practices.\n  So again, I urge my colleagues to support it, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution, H. Res. 337, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution, as amended, was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4904-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4904-H4908]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             EXPRESSING SENSE OF HOUSE REGARDING SREBRENICA\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I move to suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution (H. Res. 310) expressing the sense of the \nHouse of Representatives regarding Srebrenica.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 310\n\n       Whereas July 2015 will mark 20 years since the genocide at \n     Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       Whereas beginning in April 1992, aggression and ethnic \n     cleansing perpetrated by Bosnian Serb forces resulted in a \n     massive influx of Bosniaks seeking protection in Srebrenica \n     and its environs, which the United Nations Security Council \n     designated a ``safe area'' within the Srebrenica enclave in \n     Resolution 819 on April 16, 1993, under the protection of the \n     United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR);\n       Whereas the UNPROFOR presence in Srebrenica consisted of a \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion, with representatives of the \n     United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, the \n     International Committee of the Red Cross, and the \n     humanitarian medical aid agency Medecins Sans Frontieres \n     (Doctors Without Borders) helping to provide humanitarian \n     relief to the displaced population living in conditions of \n     massive overcrowding, destitution, and disease;\n       Whereas early in 1995, an intensified blockade of the \n     enclave by Bosnian Serb forces deprived the entire population \n     of humanitarian aid and outside communication and contact, \n     and effectively reduced the ability of the Dutch peacekeeping \n     battalion to deter aggression or otherwise respond \n     effectively to a deteriorating situation;\n       Whereas beginning on July 6, 1995, Bosnian Serb forces \n     attacked UNPROFOR outposts, seized control of the isolated \n     enclave, held captured Dutch soldiers hostage and, after \n     skirmishes with local defenders, took control of the town of \n     Srebrenica on July 11, 1995;\n       Whereas an estimated one-third of the population of \n     Srebrenica at the time, including a relatively small number \n     of soldiers, attempted to pass through the lines of Bosnian \n     Serb forces to the relative safety of Bosnian-government \n     controlled territory, but many were killed by patrols and \n     ambushes;\n       Whereas the remaining population sought protection with the \n     Dutch peacekeeping battalion at its headquarters in the \n     village of Potocari north of Srebrenica, but many of these \n     individuals were with seeming randomness seized by Bosnian \n     Serb forces to be beaten, raped, or executed;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces deported women, children, and \n     the elderly in buses, but held over 8,000 primarily Bosniak \n     men and boys at collection points and sites in northeastern \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina under their control, and then \n     summarily executed these captives and buried them in mass \n     graves;\n       Whereas Bosnian Serb forces, hoping to conceal evidence of \n     the massacre at Srebrenica, subsequently moved corpses from \n     initial mass grave sites to many secondary sites scattered \n     throughout parts of eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina under \n     their control;\n       Whereas the International Commission for Missing Persons \n     (ICMP) deserves recognition for its assistance to the \n     relevant institutions in Bosnia and Herzegovina in accounting \n     for close to 90 percent of those individuals reported missing \n     from Srebrenica, despite active attempts to conceal evidence \n     of the massacre, through the careful excavation of mass \n     graves sites and subsequent DNA analysis which confirmed the \n     true extent of the massacre;\n       Whereas the massacre at Srebrenica was among the worst of \n     many atrocities to occur in the conflict in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from April 1992 to November 1995, during which \n     the policies of aggression and ethnic cleansing pursued by \n     Bosnian Serb forces with the direct support of the Serbian \n     regime of Slobodan Milosevic and its followers ultimately led \n     to the displacement of more than 2,000,000 people, more than \n     100,000 killed, tens of thousands raped or otherwise tortured \n     and abused, including at concentration camps in the Prijedor \n     area, with the innocent civilians of Sarajevo and other urban\n\n[[Page H4905]]\n\n     centers repeatedly subjected to traumatic shelling and sniper \n     attacks;\n       Whereas in addition to being the primary victims at \n     Srebrenica, individuals with Bosniak heritage comprise the \n     vast majority of the victims during the conflict in Bosnia \n     and Herzegovina as a whole, especially among the civilian \n     population;\n       Whereas Article 2 of the Convention on the Prevention and \n     Punishment of the Crime of Genocide defines genocide as ``any \n     of the following acts committed with intent to destroy, in \n     whole or in part, a national, ethnical, racial or religious \n     group, as such: (a) killing members of the group; (b) causing \n     serious bodily or mental harm to members of the group; (c) \n     deliberately inflicting on the group conditions of life \n     calculated to bring about its physical destruction in whole \n     or in part; (d) imposing measures intended to prevent births \n     within the group; and (e) forcibly transferring children of \n     the group to another group'';\n       Whereas, on May 25, 1993, the United Nations Security \n     Council adopted Resolution 827 establishing the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY), based in \n     The Hague, the Netherlands, and charging the ICTY with \n     responsibility for investigating and prosecuting individuals \n     suspected of committing war crimes, genocide, crimes against \n     humanity and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions on \n     the territory of the former Yugoslavia since 1991;\n       Whereas the ICTY, along with courts in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina as well as in Serbia, have indicted and in most \n     cases convicted approximately three dozen individuals at \n     various levels of responsibility for grave breaches of the \n     1949 Geneva Conventions, violations of the laws or customs of \n     war, crimes against humanity, genocide, and complicity in \n     genocide associated with the massacre at Srebrenica, most \n     notably Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic whose trials are \n     ongoing;\n       Whereas both the ICTY and the International Court of \n     Justice (ICJ) have ruled that the actions of Bosnian Serb \n     forces in Srebrenica in July 1995 constitute genocide;\n       Whereas House Resolution 199, passed on June 27, 2005, \n     expressed the sense of the House of Representatives that the \n     aggression and ethnic cleansing committed by Serb forces in \n     Bosnia and Herzegovina meets the terms defining genocide \n     according to the 1949 Genocide Convention;\n       Whereas the United Nations has largely acknowledged its \n     failure to fulfill its responsibility to take actions and \n     make decisions that could have deterred the assault on \n     Srebrenica and prevented the subsequent genocide from \n     occurring;\n       Whereas some prominent Serbian and Bosnian Serb officials, \n     among others, have denied or at least refused to acknowledge \n     that the massacre at Srebrenica constituted a genocide, or \n     have sought otherwise to trivialize the extent and importance \n     of the massacre; and\n       Whereas the international community, including the United \n     States, has continued to provide personnel and resources, \n     including through direct military intervention, to prevent \n     further aggression and ethnic cleansing, to negotiate the \n     General Framework Agreement for Peace in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina (initialed in Dayton, Ohio, on November 21, 1995, \n     and signed in Paris on December 14, 1995), and to help ensure \n     its fullest implementation, including cooperation with the \n     International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia as \n     well as reconciliation among all of Bosnia and Herzegovina's \n     citizens: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) affirms that the policies of aggression and ethnic \n     cleansing as implemented by Serb forces in Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina from 1992 to 1995 meet the terms defining the \n     crime of genocide in Article 2 of the Convention on the \n     Prevention and Punishment of the Crime of Genocide;\n       (2) condemns statements that deny or question that the \n     massacre at Srebrenica constituted a genocide;\n       (3) urges the Atrocities Prevention Board, a United States \n     interagency committee established by the Administration in \n     2012, to study the lessons of Srebrenica and issue informed \n     guidance on how to prevent similar incidents from recurring \n     in the future, paying particular regard to troubled countries \n     including but not limited to Syria, the Central African \n     Republic and Burundi;\n       (4) encourages the United States to maintain and reaffirm \n     its policy of supporting the independence and territorial \n     integrity of Bosnia and Herzegovina, peace and stability in \n     southeastern Europe as a whole, and the right of all people \n     living in the region, regardless of national, racial, ethnic \n     or religious background, to return to their homes and enjoy \n     the benefits of democratic institutions, the rule of law, and \n     economic opportunity, as well as to know the fate of missing \n     relatives and friends;\n       (5) recognizes the achievement of the International \n     Commission for Missing Persons (ICMP) in accounting for those \n     missing in conflicts or natural disasters around the world \n     and believes that the ICMP deserves justified recognition for \n     its assistance to Bosnia and Herzegovina and its relevant \n     institutions in accounting for approximately ninety percent \n     of those reported missing after the Srebrenica massacre and \n     seventy percent of those reported missing during the whole of \n     the conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n       (6) welcomes the arrest and transfer to the International \n     Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY) of all \n     persons indicted for war crimes, crimes against humanity, \n     genocide and grave breaches of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, \n     particularly those of Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, \n     which has helped strengthen peace and encouraged \n     reconciliation between the countries of the region and their \n     citizens;\n       (7) asserts that it is in the national interest of the \n     United States that those individuals who are responsible for \n     these crimes and breaches should continue to be held \n     accountable for their actions, and that the work of the ICTY \n     therefore warrants continued support until all trials and \n     appeals have been completed; and\n       (8) honors the thousands of innocent people killed or \n     executed at Srebrenica in Bosnia and Herzegovina in July \n     1995, along with all individuals who were victimized during \n     the conflict and genocide in Bosnia and Herzegovina from 1992 \n     to 1995, as well as foreign nationals, including United \n     States citizens, and those individuals in Serbia, Bosnia and \n     Herzegovina, and other countries of the region who risked and \n     in some cases lost their lives during their brave defense of \n     human rights and fundamental freedoms, and advocacy of \n     respect for ethnic identity without discrimination.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to submit statements and \nextraneous materials for the Record on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Madam Speaker, this week, the world pauses to remember and reflect on \nthe Srebrenica genocide, horrific acts of brutality, wanton cruelty, \nand mass murder committed in Srebrenica beginning July 11, 20 years \nago.\n  This week, we pause to honor those brave Bosniaks who suffered and \ndied, victims of genocide. This week, the people in the United States \nand men and women of goodwill throughout the world again extend our \ndeepest condolences and respect to the mothers and surviving family \nmembers who have endured unspeakable sorrow and loss that time will \nnever abate. And this week, the international community must recommit \nitself to justice, once and for all, for those who perpetrated these \nheinous crimes.\n  Today, Ratko Mladic and Radovan Karadzic are incarcerated, awaiting \nfinal disposition of their cases before the International Tribunal for \nthe former Yugoslavia for multiple counts of genocide, crimes against \nhumanity, and violations of laws and customs of war.\n  Twenty years ago, Madam Speaker, an estimated 8,000 people were \nsystematically slaughtered by Bosnian Serb soldiers in the United \nNations-designated ``safe haven'' area of Srebrenica. They killed \nMuslim women and children, but especially sought out and murdered adult \nmales in that area.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  These brutal killings were not committed in battle. They were \ncommitted against people who were unarmed and helpless and who had been \nrepeatedly assured by Dutch peacekeepers that they would not be harmed \nif they surrendered.\n  The evidence is overwhelming that the executions were committed with \nthe specific intention of destroying the Bosnian Muslim population of \nthat area. This intention is the central element in the crime of \ngenocide.\n  The U.N. peacekeeping forces in Srebrenica were charged with \nenforcing Security Council Resolution 836, which had pledged to defend \nthe safe areas with ``all necessary means, including the use of \nforce.''\n  But when the moment of truth came, the U.N. forces offered only token \nresistance to the Serb offensive. Their military and political \ncommanders had redefined their primary mission not as the protection of \nthe people of Srebrenica, but as the safety of the U.N. forces \nthemselves.\n  When Bosnian Serb Commander Ratko Mladic threatened violence against \nthe blue-helmeted soldiers,\n\n[[Page H4906]]\n\nhere is the way one of those soldiers described the reaction. And I \nquote him: ``Everybody got a fright. You could easily get killed in \nsuch an operation. As far as I knew, we had not been sent to Srebrenica \nto defend the enclave, but, rather, as some kind of spruced-up \nobservers.''\n  So that is what the peacekeepers became: observers to genocide. Soon \nthey became something more than observers: enablers.\n  On July 13, the Dutch blue-helmet battalion handed Bosnian Muslims \nwho had sought safety within the U.N. compound over to the Serbs. They \nwatched as the men were separated from the women and children, a \nprocess which was already well known in Bosnia--it was at the time--as \na sign that the men were in imminent danger of being executed. These \nmen were never heard from again.\n  At one congressional hearing I chaired in March of 1998--and I had \nsix of them--Hasan Nuhanovic, the indigenous translator working for the \nU.N. peacekeepers in Srebrenica, testified.\n  He was there in the room. Hasan lost his family in the genocide. He \nwas there when Mladic and the commanders of the Dutch peacekeepers \ntalked about the terms.\n  Here is what he told my panel, in part:\n  ``On July 12, the day before the fall of Srebrenica, the Bosnian Serb \nArmy commander, General Ratko Mladic, requested a meeting with the \nDutchbat commander, Lieutenant Colonel Karemans, and local \nrepresentatives of Srebrenica in the nearby town of Bratunac outside \nthe enclave . . . During the meeting, Mladic assured the Dutch and \nlocal delegation that no harm would come to the refugees in Potocari . \n. .\n  ``Upon returning to the camp, three local representatives are ordered \nby Dutchbat deputy commander, Major Franken, to prepare a list of all \nmales, all men and boys between the ages of 16 and 65 among the \nrefugees inside and outside the camp. The list of the males among the \n6,000 inside the camp was completed the same day . . .\n  ``On July 13, the Dutch ordered 6,000 refugees out of the Potocari \ncamp. The Serbs were waiting at the gate, separating all males from the \nwomen and children. Major Franken stated that all the males whose names \nwere on the list would be safe . . . I watched my parents and my \nbrother being handed over to the Serbs at the gate. None of them have \nbeen seen since.\n  ``I want to explain here that the people hoped that the Dutch were \ngoing to protect them, the U.N. peacekeeping troops and all other \nmembers of all other organization who were present in Srebrenica who \nwere inside the camp, the people hoped that they would be protected, \nbut the Dutch soldiers and officer gave no other option to the refugees \nbut to leave. So the refugees inside were told to leave without any \nother choice. My family was told on the evening of 13 July that they \nshould leave. About 6 p.m., there were no more refugees inside the \ncamp.\n  ``I don't know if this is the topic of the meeting or hearing, but \nthe same night the Dutch soldiers had a party inside the camp because \nthey received two or three trucks full of beer and cigarettes. They \nplayed music while I was sitting, not knowing what happened to my \nfamily.''\n  As he went on to say later, they had all been slaughtered.\n  In July of 2007, Madam Speaker, I visited Srebrenica, where, together \nwith my good friends President Haris Silajdzic and the Grand Mufti of \nBosnia, Reis Ceric, I spoke at a solemn memorial service and witnessed \nthe internment of hundreds of wooden coffins of newly discovered \nvictims of the genocide.\n  It was a deeply moving experience to see 12 years then after the \ngenocide--now it is 20 years--families still grieving loved ones whose \nbodies were being identified, often miles from the killing sites, as \nSerb forces, trying to hide the evidence of their crimes, moved the \nbodies of their victims.\n  For the record, 10 years ago--in 2005--the House of Representatives \noverwhelmingly passed H. Res. 199, which I authored, which clearly and \nunambiguously condemned the Srebrenica massacre for what it was: \ngenocide.\n  That resolution was a landmark in the recognition of the Srebrenica \nmassacre as a genocide. Two years later the verdict of the \nInternational Court of Justice found the same, in confirming the ruling \nof the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia.\n  Today the international community is nearly unanimous when it \nproclaims that the Srebrenica massacre was a genocide. The resolution \ntoday, of course, supports that as well.\n  Astonishingly, Madam Speaker, there are some genocide deniers. That \nis why this resolution condemns statements that deny that the massacre \nat Srebrenica constituted genocide. Just last weekend Milorad Dodik, \nthe president of Republika Srpska, asserted that the Srebrenica \ngenocide is a lie.\n  Madam Speaker, just as it is doing in Ukraine, Russia is utilizing \nmisinformation and historical revisionism in an attempt to destabilize \nBosnia and the Balkan region. Today Russia vetoed a British U.N. \nSecurity Council resolution that reaffirms that Srebrenica was a \ngenocide.\n  Russia has encouraged Serbia itself to protest the resolution and \nemboldened genocide denialism in the Republika Srpska, one of Bosnia's \ntwo constituent entities.\n  Madam Speaker, this resolution also encourages the administration to \nfulfill other neglected responsibilities. In particular, it urges the \nAtrocities Prevention Board to study the lessons of Srebrenica and \nissue informed guidance on how to prevent similar incidents from \nrecurring in the future.\n  As you may know, the Atrocities Prevention Board is a U.S. \ninteragency committee established by the administration in 2012 to flag \npotential atrocities. However, since its creation, the board has been \nmarked by inaction and a complete lack of transparency.\n  This is unacceptable, especially as conflicts with disturbing \nparallels to Bosnia before the genocide continue to fester in Syria, \nthe Central African Republic, Burma, and in Burundi.\n  Africa, in particular, would stand to benefit from a more active \nboard. The conflict in Burundi is currently at a tipping point, and it \nabsolutely needs attention.\n\n  Madam Speaker, despite the need for much greater atrocities \nprevention in U.S. policy, there have been many promising developments \nin the Balkan region, and this needs to be underscored.\n  In particular, I would note that Serbia today is not the Serbia of \nthe Slobodan Milosevic era. That era was marked by nationalist \naggression against neighboring countries and peoples, as well as \nconsiderable repression at home.\n  One of those who testified at one of my hearings on Serbia, Curuvija, \na great young leader, was murdered on the second day after our bombing \nbegan by Serbian people. And the persons who did that have now been \nheld to account. So what has happened there--thankfully, there have now \nbeen significant changes in Serbia.\n  I want to thank my colleagues. I do hope we will have a strong show \nof support for this resolution.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H. Res. 310.\n  I am the lead sponsor of this resolution. And I remember 20 years ago \nbeing in this Chamber when that massacre happened. It is hard to \nbelieve that it has been 20 years since the Srebrenica genocide, and it \ncertainly was a genocide.\n  During the Bosnian war, the United Nations declared the area around \nthis small town a safe zone. On the eve of the massacre, tens of \nthousands of displaced Bosniak civilians had gathered under the \nprotection of the U.N. in what they thought was a safe zone.\n  They all rushed to that place, only to be slaughtered a little while \nlater. But the 400 U.N. peacekeepers could put up scarce resistance to \nthe army of the Republika Srpska, whose leaders were bent on wiping out \nthe Bosniak population.\n  Over the next few days, men and boys were lined up and mowed down by \nmachine guns. Children were murdered in front of their mothers. Women \nand girls were raped and beaten, as onlookers stood powerless to \nintervene. Bulldozers piled bodies into mass graves.\n  I remember that happened in our lifetime. It is hard to believe.\n  When the killing had ended, more than 8,000 Bosniaks--mostly men and\n\n[[Page H4907]]\n\nboys--had lost their lives in one of the bloodiest episodes on European \nsoil since World War II.\n  This resolution tells their tragic story. It praises the efforts to \nhold the guilty accountable. It demands that those efforts continue. It \nunderscores solidarity with the victims and calls for a reconciliation \nthat will one day see the lies, hatred, and violence of the past \nreplaced by true friendship and community.\n  This resolution tells the truth about what happened because telling \nthe truth--however painful--is the starting point for healing to begin.\n  We remember the Srebrenica genocide to honor the victims and to \nremind ourselves of the costs of indifference, of what can happen when \nwe say, well, that is somebody else's problem.\n  As this region of Europe heals--I have just come back from the \nBalkans--and charts a course toward a brighter future, I hope the \nlessons of this tragedy will be a guide for the United States and for \ncountries around the world fighting against tyranny and oppression.\n  Today there was a disgrace that happened at the United Nations. \nUnfortunately, there are many disgraces that happen at the United \nNations.\n  Two international courts have called the slaughter of Bosnian Serbs \nof some 8,000 Muslim men and boys who had sought refuge in what was \nsupposed to be a U.N.-protected site genocide.\n  Now, what happened today at the U.N.? Russia vetoed a U.N. resolution \ncalling Srebrenica a genocide. It passed the Security Council. Russia \nvetoed it.\n  You would think that a veto would be used for something of substance, \nnot a resolution. This resolution has substance, but you would not \nthink that Russia or any country would veto it.\n  Let me see what this defeated resolution stated. It stated that \nacceptance of ``the tragic events at Srebrenica as genocide is a \nprerequisite for reconciliation'' and ``condemns denial of this \ngenocide as hindering efforts towards reconciliation.''\n  The vote was ten countries in favor; Russia casting a veto; and four \nabstentions: China, Nigeria, Angola, and Venezuela.\n  The British Ambassador after the vote said that Britain was outraged \nby Russia's veto. And he said Russia's actions tarnish the memory of \nall those who died in the Srebrenica genocide. Russia will have to \njustify its behavior to the families of over 8,000 people murdered in \nthe worst atrocity in Europe since the second World War.\n  ``This is a defeat of justice,'' said Camil Durakovic, the mayor of \nSrebrenica. He added that the veto means that the U.N. is not \nrecognizing a decision by its own judicial branch, the International \nCourt of Justice, which has declared the tragedy a genocide. ``The \nworld has lost. The world, and especially Serbia, will have to face the \ntruth sooner or later.''\n  Our Ambassador Samantha Powell, who was a 24-year-old journalist in \nBosnia at the time of the Srebrenica massacre, told the Council that, \n``For all of the brutality of a horrific war, this was a singular \nhorror. It was genocide, a fact now proven again and again by \ninternational tribunals.''\n  ``Today's vote mattered,'' Power said. ``It mattered hugely to the \nfamilies of the victims of the Srebrenica genocide. Russia's veto is \nheartbreaking for those families, and it is a further stain on this \nCouncil's record.''\n  I read that into the Record because I think it is important to notice \nthe actions of Russia. We see their actions in Ukraine. We see their \nactions at the U.N. And we see the actions of the U.N., itself. And it \nreally is a shame.\n  So, again, we remember this genocide to honor its victims. It is not \nsomebody else's problem. It is all of our problems.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  In order to prevent it from happening in the future, we have to \naccurately recall what happened in the past.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from California (Mr. Royce), the distinguished \nchairman of the full Foreign Affairs Committee and a great leader on \nhuman rights.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Smith of New Jersey for \nbringing this bill up and keeping this atrocity and the lessons that it \nmeans for us today in front of this body, and as always, I appreciate \nMr. Engel's cooperation in seeing this resolution move to the floor.\n  I appreciate the powerful stories that were shared by Mr. Engel and \nby Mr. Smith today in terms of what happened on that day 20 years ago \nthis month as Bosnian Serb forces transformed what was supposed to be a \nU.N. safe haven for refugees into what became an extermination camp.\n  On that July day, 8,000 men and boys were massacred. As they shared \nwith you, Serb forces compiled detailed lists of those targeted for \nkilling. They separated families, and they drove those young Muslim men \nto various fields where they were summarily executed.\n  The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia ruled \nthat this act was an act of genocide--and rightly so. We do not know \nthe names of many of these victims, as these killers took extensive \nmeasures to cover their crimes. As a result, families have never found \ntheir missing relatives, and experts continue to uncover and identify \nremains at the scenes of these mass killings.\n  Former United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan has said that this \ntragedy will ``haunt the United Nations forever.'' Although it occurred \n20 years ago, this massacre continues to hinder progress towards peace \nin this troubled region. For while Serbia's President has apologized \nfor crimes committed, he and other Serbian officials still refuse to \nadmit the true extent of the brutality.\n  Mr. Speaker, today's resolution encourages Serbian authorities to \npublicly acknowledge the genocide that occurred, which would constitute \na major step forward in restoring relations with its neighbor.\n  This resolution also reaffirms U.S. policy to oppose mass atrocities \nin the strongest terms whenever and wherever they occur; but of course, \nthe Srebrenica genocide, along with others in Rwanda, Cambodia, and \nDarfur, are stark reminders that simply saying ``never again'' will \nnever be enough. Action is needed, and it is demanded as, around the \nworld, violent conflicts threaten to erupt once more into genocidal \ncampaigns.\n  I will name some right now. Ongoing abuses against the Rohingya \nMuslim population in Burma have caused human rights advocates to sound \nthe alarm over a ``grave risk of additional mass atrocities and even \ngenocide.'' Unable to claim citizenship in Burma or elsewhere and under \nconstant threat of violence, many have called the Rohingya Muslims \n``the most persecuted minority in the world,'' leading thousands upon \nthousands to flee their homes in overloaded boats. That is why I helped \nlead the effort last Congress to pass H. Res. 418, calling for an end \nto the persecution of the Rohingya people.\n  In Sri Lanka, anti-Muslim riots broke out last June killing four and \ninjuring dozens more. Acting with impunity under the Rajapaksa \ngovernment, extremist forces destroyed mosques and Muslim businesses, \ndisplacing thousands.\n  Under the Sirisena government, however, we have an opportunity to \npress for positive change and inclusivity in the newly elected \ngovernment there in Sri Lanka.\n  Extremist groups are similarly targeting minority communities in \nSyria, the Central African Republic, and Burundi. While we absolutely \nmust remember past atrocities, we are charged with doing all we can to \nstop today's violence. I don't want future Congresses having to \nmemorialize atrocities from our era now.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey, Mr. Chris \nSmith, for introducing this timely and important resolution; and, \nagain, I thank Mr. Engel.\n  I encourage my colleagues to join me in supporting this.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend my friend from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) for his \nleadership on this important resolution, and I am gratified that we \nheld this timely debate ahead of the solemn commemorations that will \ntake place in Srebrenica and around the world this weekend.\n  I thank our chairman for his leadership, Chairman Royce, as usual. It\n\n[[Page H4908]]\n\nshows that we worked again together on the Foreign Affairs Committee in \na very bipartisan manner. This transcends everything. This is genocide, \nand these resolutions are very, very important.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, let's think about this. The chairman said something \nthat really jostled my mind. I pointed out where a U.N. resolution was \nvetoed today by Russia. These men who were massacred in a genocide went \nto what they were told was a United Nations safe haven.\n  For this to happen under the auspices of the United Nations and then \nfor Russia to veto a United Nations resolution commemorating solemn, \nsolemn 20 years, it is just an absolute disgrace and irony; and it is \none of the reasons that the United Nations has trouble because of the \nhypocrisy, once again, that we see in that body.\n  By passing this resolution, we put the House solidly on record \nhonoring the thousands of innocent people killed at Srebrenica and all \nthose who suffered during the Bosnian war. We stand alongside those who \nrisked and continued to risk life and limb to defend the human rights \nof all people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this resolution \nunanimously, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to finally say a very special thanks to \nMajority Leader Kevin McCarthy for arranging for this bill to come to \nthe floor and of course to the Speaker, to Ed Royce, our distinguished \nchairman, and the ranking member for their strong support and \ncosponsorship of this resolution. It is bipartisan, and I think we are \nsending a clear and unambiguous message to the world, again, that \nSrebrenica was a genocide.\n  We must hold those to account who committed these atrocities. At \nleast two of the major perpetrators, hopefully, will soon get justice, \none at the end of this year and Mladic probably by 2017. The wheels of \njustice do turn slowly, but they are jailed right now. Above all, I \nthink we need to pray for the victims.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to pray for the loved ones who continue to \nsuffer unspeakable agony. I do hope the American people and all of us \nin the House and in this town will--especially as this remembrance \ncomes around beginning on July 11--keep these people who have suffered \nso much in our prayers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH. Res. 310, expressing the sense of the House of Representatives \nregarding Srebrenica. As a co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on \nBosnia, I believe it is crucial to distinguish the Srebrenica massacres \nas genocide while honoring the thousands of innocent people who were \nkilled in July twenty years ago.\n  In the early 1990s, following Bosnia and Herzegovina's declaration of \nnational sovereignty, Bosnian Serb forces attacked Eastern Bosnia in \norder to unify and secure Serb territory. During this struggle for \ncontrol, those Bosnian Serb forces, also called the Army of Republika \nSrpska committed crimes of ethnic cleansing of the non-Serb population. \nApproximately 8,000 Bosnian men and boys were systematically executed \nin 1995.\n  The situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina during this time was a \nfailure on behalf of the international community. In 1999, UN \nSecretary-General Kofi Annan acknowledged that the global community \nneeded to accept responsibility for the ethnic cleansing campaign in \nBosnia and Herzegovina that killed thousands of unarmed civilians in a \ntown designated as a ``safe area.''\n  For many years now, I have called on the United Nations to recognize \nSrebrenica as a genocide. Yesterday, I learned that Russia blocked the \nlatest effort by the United Kingdom to recognize the Srebrenica \nmassacres as a genocide, calling it ``not constructive, \nconfrontational, and politically-motivated.'' I am disappointed that \nthe UN is unable to formally recognize Europe's worst atrocity since \nWorld War II.\n  Although the global community cannot and will not distinguish \nSrebrenica as genocide, I applaud my fellow Bosnia Caucus co-chair, \nCongressman Chris Smith, for introducing this important resolution. \nWhile the UN's hands are tied, I am proud that the United States \ncontinues to be Bosnia and Herzegovina's greatest friend and ally. I \nurge my colleagues to support Bosnia and Herzegovina by voting in favor \nof this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Walker). The question is on the motion \noffered by the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith) that the House \nsuspend the rules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 310.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4908-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4908-H4935]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          STUDENT SUCCESS ACT\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KLINE.

Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Indiana (Mr. Rokita) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Indiana.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, my amendment is simple. It shortens \nauthorization of the act from 6 years to 4 years. I am very thankful \nfor the leadership of the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman) for \nhis work in leading this effort.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is the role of Congress to conduct oversight of \nFederal programs and regularly revisit the results of taxpayer \ninvestments. We began a process to replace No Child Left Behind 4 years \nago, and our goal\n\n[[Page H4909]]\n\nfrom the beginning has always been to roll back the Federal \nGovernment's authority over K-12 schools and return to State and local \neducation leaders the responsibility and opportunity to deliver a \nquality education to their students.\n  Now, the Student Success Act is a strong conservative proposal that \nreflects our shared principles for reducing the Federal role, restoring \nlocal control, and empowering individuals, not government bureaucrats. \nReducing the authorization to 4 years will give Congress and the next \nadministration a chance to ensure that these bold reforms are actually \nworking as intended.\n  Mr. Chairman, I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment to the underlying bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I had the opportunity to serve on our State \nBoard of Education in Colorado from 2001 to 2007, so this was during \nthe implementation phase of No Child Left Behind.\n  Now, we knew at the time many of the flaws we are hoping to address \nthrough ESEA reauthorization today, but it took several years just to \nget up to the point where we had the tests, we had the standards, and \nwe complied with it.\n  Education is a major public enterprise. In fact, it is the largest \npublic enterprise at the State and local level. One of the frustrations \nthat I have heard a lot of in the last few years--and it has really \namplified the frustration about testing--is the fact that the ball has \nbeen moving, the testing has been changed.\n  My State of Colorado, which is fairly typical, moved from one test, \nthe CSAP, to a temporary test, the TCAP, and then finally a third test, \nall in a period of 4 years.\n  What we need to do--and this is something that we will hear from \neducation stakeholders as varied as teachers, school boards, and \nprincipals--is stop moving the ball.\n  We know it is not going to be perfect. Let's give it a little bit of \ntime to work. Now, this bill is far from perfect, which is why I oppose \nthe underlying bill; but whatever set of rules you set in place, I feel \nit is important to allow the rulemaking, the State laws, to catch up, \nwhich takes a period of time, a period of years.\n  I think the longer reauthorization, through 2021, rather than \nreducing it to 4 years, is absolutely in the interests of ensuring that \nwhatever law we come up with can be implemented more effectively at the \nState and local level.\n  Not only is it frustrating for districts and teachers to chase a \nconstantly moving ball, it detracts from their most important effort, \nwhich is to educate the next generation of Americans.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota, Chairman Kline, the chairman of the full Education and \nWorkforce Committee. He has been a leader in the area of working on \nthese issues for a lot more than 4 years.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I just wanted to take literally a few seconds to say I \nunderstand the gentleman's purpose here. I think this improves the \nbill.\n  I support the amendment, and I urge my colleagues to vote for it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the \namendment.\n  As the gentleman from Colorado has indicated, if you have a good \nbill, you should have as long an authorization as possible. It allows \nfor better planning and the other things he mentioned.\n  But this is a bad bill. The funding formula takes from the poor and \ngives to the rich. It eliminates the responsibility to actually do \nsomething about the achievement gaps. I just believe the quicker we can \nget back to it, the better. So if you want to shorten the authorization \nso that the pain inflicted on this bill is shorter, I am for it.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for supporting the \namendment. The reasons he is supporting are completely wrong. We have \nincreased Federal spending, as the gentleman knows, on education over \n300 percent since the Federal Government has been involved. And guess \nwhat, Mr. Chairman, the results have been flat-lined.\n  This bill does anything but take from the poor and give to the rich. \nIn fact, it ensures that civil rights are protected and that children, \nwhatever socioeconomic background, aren't left behind, but they have \nthe opportunity to succeed in the 21st century and win.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Indiana has 3\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROKITA. I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Grothman), who is new to this Congress but is already \nmaking this mark. He has coauthored this amendment with me.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, well, one of the many reasons that this \nis a good bill is that it recognizes that the Federal Government is \ntaking too much control over education in this country.\n  One of the reasons the Federal Government should not get involved in \nmany, many things is they are not very nimble. When they make a \nmistake, rather than turning something around--you know, if a school \nboard makes a mistake, they may come back in a meeting 2 weeks later \nand undo the mistake they made. When the Federal Government makes a \nmistake, it can take 15 or 20 years, if ever, to admit they made a \nmistake.\n  Now, when the original No Child Left Behind bill passed, I used to \nmeet with school superintendents a couple times a month. They knew \nwithin months that that bill was horribly flawed.\n  Chairman Kline has worked very hard on this bill. It is a very good \nbill, but it is still a very big, complicated bill. And I am sure \nwithin months, years, a couple of years, local superintendents will \nreport changes they want to have made.\n  I think this is a very good amendment because, even though it doesn't \nassure us that we are going to revisit this in 4 years any more than \nthe original No Child Left Behind we were sure we were going to revisit \nin 7 years, I think it reminds Congress that at least in a 4-year \nperiod you ought to be looking at it, see what your local \nsuperintendents think, see what your local schoolteachers think, and \nsee if it can be improved. And, of course, it is going to be able to be \nimproved in 4 years. So that is the reason for the amendment.\n  I mean, if you told anybody back home we are passing a law and we \ndon't anticipate even looking at it again for 4 years, I think they \nwould think that is highly unusual. That defines one of the reasons why \nwe shouldn't get the Federal Government involved in a wide variety of \nthings.\n  Mr. ROKITA. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, of course you can look at a bill during its \nperiod of initial authorization. There are routinely cleanup bills that \nmove through this body.\n  And I wish--I wish--the No Child Left Behind had a cleanup bill in \n2002 or in 2003 or in 2004, all during its initial period of \nauthorization, but President Bush closed the doors on even the changes \nthat I think that we could have had broad consensus that we needed to \npass.\n  But of course whatever comes out of this ESEA process, if we can \nagree on cleanup things and unintended consequences 2 years, 3 years \nout, let's do them.\n  Look, the answer is not to move the ball. It leads to the spinning of \nthe wheels for a period of years. And rather than working on educating \nkids, people are working on complying with an ever-changing matrix of \nFederal, State, and local law.\n  There is a lot that happens after we pass a law in this body. It goes \nto Federal rulemaking, input from various constituencies, final rules. \nIt goes to States who might change their policies, State Boards of \nEducation, State commissioners. It goes down to districts, busy \nsuperintendents who are worried about bus schedules, who are\n\n[[Page H4910]]\n\nworried about opening new schools, have to worry about recommending to \ntheir boards the new policies that will comply with our new Federal \nlaw.\n  It takes a lot of time. It might take 2 years, 3 years before it \nfinally reaches those policy implementation levels on the ground at a \nlocal level. And guess what, if this amendment becomes law and the \nauthorization period is only 4 years, they might finally--finally--\nstart complying with this law only to find that there is a future \nCongress, a future President that moves the ball once again and starts \nthe whole cycle of spinning wheels all over again.\n  We need to make sure that whatever we do in this body, that we give \ntime for a thoughtful implementation of it at the State and local level \nthat doesn't detract from the core mission that the men and women who \nteach in our classrooms, the men and women who volunteer on school \nboards, the professionals who serve as superintendents commit their \nlives to in terms of educating kids.\n  So we need to move forward with a longer reauthorization. If there \nare cleanup matters that we can agree on during that authorization \nperiod, we should by no means preclude them from the discussion until \nthe end of this authorization. That was one of the problems with No \nChild Left Behind, that this body never had a follow-up discussion.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no,'' and I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Rokita).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 46 Offered by Mr. Walker\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Walker) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I am introducing the Academic Partnerships \nLead Us to Success, or the A-PLUS, Act.\n  When most of us come to Washington, one of the promises or one of the \nthings that we try and do best is to return as much power or, should I \nsay, decisionmaking back to the States and back to the people.\n  I believe the A-PLUS Act does that. It allows the States to opt out \nof as many as 80 different Federal programs, returning that \nopportunity. Some may say that No Child Left Behind, that it allows the \nopt out, and it does; but what it doesn't do, it doesn't allow the \nStates to opt out of the mandates and still keep their Federal funding. \nThat is why we believe this is a crucial amendment.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. DeSantis), my distinguished friend.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from North Carolina.\n  I am happy to cosponsor this amendment. I think of this amendment in \nterms of Common Core because we have had a lot of controversy over \nCommon Core. A lot of parents are upset about it, and they say: Look, \nthis was the Federal Government getting involved in education, and \npeople support it.\n  Congress said: Wait a minute. The Federal Government never mandated \nCommon Core. That never happened.\n  And, you know, that is true.\n  But what did happen was the Federal Government had a huge amount of \nmoney under President Obama's race to the top, and they said: Hey, \nStates--and this is during the recession and States needed the money--\nhere is some money, but you have got to do what we want you to do.\n  And so they conditioned that funding and really coerced a lot of \nStates into adopting something like Common Core.\n  And so I think what the A-PLUS does is it says: Okay. The Federal \nGovernment has gotten involved in K-12 education. I don't think it has \nbeen very successful from the very beginning, but if you are going to \nbe providing money, at least give the State the ability to take that \nmoney and use it as they see fit to try and innovate and to try to do \nthings that will improve the academic performance of their kids. But \ndon't condition the funding on following specific formulas that \nWashington knows best.\n  I think this really empowers States. I think this is something that \nwill empower local communities and, I think, ultimately will be better \noff as a matter of K-12 education. So I thank my friend from North \nCarolina for offering it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition \nto the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The amendment would literally let States just take the money and run \nwith no assurance that the billions of Federal dollars actually benefit \nthe populations of students that ESEA was intended to serve: low-\nincome, minority students who do not speak English, students with \ndisabilities.\n  The original purpose of ESEA was to address the special educational \nneeds of children of low-income families and the impact that \nconcentrations of low-income families have on the ability of local \neducational agencies to support adequate educational programs.\n  Subsequently, we added a requirement that you identify and address \nachievement gaps. That is the purpose of the law. If you just opt out \nand take it as a block grant, you don't have to address the problems \nthat the money is designed to cure.\n  The underlying bill violates the original purpose of the original \nESEA, and this amendment just makes it worse.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, I request how much time is remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 2\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, who better to address these problems than \nparents, States, and local school boards.\n  Let's talk about specifically what the A-PLUS Act does.\n  One, it restores education decisionmaking to State and local leaders \nwho are better positioned to make informed decisions about the needs of \ntheir local school communities. It allows States to consolidate funding \nfor any and all programs that are authorized under the ESEA, and it \nalso reduces bureaucracy and increases transparency of student outcomes \nby redirecting accountability to parents and taxpayers, not Washington.\n  Fundamentally, I believe that government is more accountable, almost \nalways, the more local, and it becomes more effective.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, there is a great potential for cooperation \nbetween Democrats and Republicans, as has historically been, with \nregard to education; and that lies in, of course, enhancing flexibility \nin freeing teachers and principals and districts from some of the \nbureaucratic constraints that they have that distract from their \nability to maximize education.\n  But along with that increased flexibility needs to come \naccountability; otherwise, we wind up with the worst of both worlds. \nAnd just like No Child Left Behind erred too far in the direction of \nnot enough flexibility with too much in the wrong kind of \naccountability, so, too, must we be careful not to err in the direction \nof too much flexibility without accountability.\n  It is important to make sure that as we increase the ways and the \nmanner that States and districts have to free up local innovation at \nthe classroom level, at the school level, at the district level, we \nneed to make sure and reiterate what our goals are here.\n  How do we make sure that all students are learning? How do we make \nsure that schools are serving students with disabilities under IDEA? \nHow do we make sure that districts and States are committed to closing \nthe achievement gap between students of color and White students, even \nin local jurisdictions that might not have that political will \nintrinsically? That is the Federal promise. That is the promise and the \nreason behind ESEA and our efforts to improve education across these \nUnited States.\n  To turn it over to the States effectively makes the referee a player \non the field. We need to have an objective look. The same people who \nare concerned with deciding exactly how moneys are spent cannot \nobjectively weigh whether it is working or whether it is not. That is \njust human nature.\n  We need to make sure that if States have additional flexibility in \ngrants--something I think that we can certainly work together on--if \nthey have\n\n[[Page H4912]]\n\nthat flexibility, we need to make sure there is an objective standard \nunder which what they are doing with that flexibility is determined to \nwork or not to work. And if it doesn't work, we need to encourage those \nStates to move in a different direction. If it does work, we can \nincrease our efforts to support them.\n  So again, there is a general premise here that can be worked on, but \nthe underlying amendment would be extremely detrimental to public \neducation.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina yielded back the \nbalance of his time. Did the gentleman intend to reserve?\n  Mr. WALKER. Yes.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman ask for unanimous consent to \nreclaim his 2 minutes of time?\n  Mr. WALKER. He yielded back 2 minutes to me. Is that correct?\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does the gentleman ask for unanimous consent?\n  Mr. WALKER. Yes.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from North \nCarolina may reclaim his 2 minutes of time.\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, a point of parliamentary inquiry.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman will state his parliamentary inquiry.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, to be clear, the gentleman was not yielded \ntime from the gentleman from Virginia.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is correct.\n  Mr. POLIS. The gentleman was granted his own time, which erroneously \nhe had yielded back to the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado is correct.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from North Carolina has 2 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Chairman, a lot of this is talk. And with due respect \nto my friend from Colorado, I hear the point. But I would say a lot of \nthat is we are hearing ``we, we this, we this, we the Federal, we \nthis.'' It really should be ``we the people at the State,'' ``we the \npeople at the local level.''\n  It is important that we get some of the power that we like to monger \nup here among us in this House to return it back to the States, to \nreturn it back to the individual school boards.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Who best knows to make these decisions other than these parents and \nthese school boards? We talk about accountability. As Dr. Phil would \nsay, ``How has that been working for us the last 40 years?''\n  We need to get the accountability back to where it goes, where it \nshould have been from the very beginning, and that is to the State \nlevel and to the local people, to the parents and the school boards.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, the ESEA passed in 1965 because \nStates and localities were not equitably funding the schools. The ESEA \nrequired the money to be spent primarily in the areas with a \nconcentration of low-income families. If this amendment passes, we can \nreasonably assume that they will go back to the way they were doing it.\n  This makes a bad bill even worse. So I would hope that we would \ndefeat the amendment and keep the requirement that the States, in using \nthe money, address the fiscal inequalities and achievement gaps.\n  With this amendment, there are no requirements that they do anything, \nand we can reasonably assume that they would go back to doing the \nthings they were doing to begin with before the ESEA passed. I would \nhope we would defeat this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from North \nCarolina will be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 47 Offered by Mr. Salmon\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 47 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-192.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 31, line 3, strike ``(3)(B)(ii)(II)'' and insert \n     ``(3)(B)(ii)(II), except that States shall allow the parent \n     of a student to opt such student out of the assessments \n     required under this paragraph for any reason and shall not \n     include such students in calculating the participation rate \n     under this clause''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Salmon) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chairman, I first want to thank Chairman Kline and \nRepresentative Rokita of the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce for working with me on this important amendment, which is to \nensure that parents have more authority and power over their children's \neducations.\n  My amendment is very, very simple. It would allow any parent to opt \nhis child out of high-stakes testing, and it would protect schools from \nbeing punished by the Federal Department of Education if parents opted \nto take their children out of these tests.\n  Since the 2001 reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary \nEducation Act, called No Child Left Behind, the Federal Government has \nplaced increasing importance on academic assessments in K-12 education.\n  Assessments are important and even necessary to understand and \nmeasure a child's academic progress. However, academic assessments have \nbecome an overutilized metric to evaluate everything from the quality \nof a teacher to the strength of a particular program.\n  Because of this frenzied obsession with high-stakes testing, more and \nmore time is being usurped from actual classroom learning. It was \nreported that the testing for a student in the 11th grade could take up \nto 27 days, a total of 15 percent of the entire school year, and a lot \nof the teachers complain about having to teach to the test. In fact, I \nthink that is why the NEA has come out in support of this amendment.\n  Parents are becoming increasingly fed up with such constant and \nonerous testing requirements, and so are the teachers. While some \nStates currently allow parents to opt their students out of \nassessments, there exists a simultaneous obligation on schools of a 95 \npercent participation rate in school assessments.\n  If schools don't meet these requirements, they risk enforcement \nmeasures from the Department of Education, which, at worst, could \ninclude losing access to Federal funding. These factors create a \nstrange environment of conflicting interests for students, parents, and \nschools.\n  My amendment would ease a school's fear of penalties by directing \nthat opted-out students not be counted among the 95 percent \nparticipation requirement while giving parents due power over their \nchildren's educations.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this important \namendment, which returns the power back to where it should be, with the \nparents.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, it is one thing to keep a light \non problems like achievement gaps, as the underlying bill does, but it \nkind of sweeps everything under the rug.\n  Before the participation threshold of 95 percent, only one State \nactually assessed 95 percent of students with disabilities, and it was \nnot unusual for\n\n[[Page H4913]]\n\nlow-achieving students to suddenly have field trips on testing day. If \nyou are not measuring the achievement gap, you can't deal with the \nachievement gap.\n  We need to make sure that enough students test, which is 95 percent, \nso that we can actually identify the achievement gaps and do something \nabout it. Parents do have the right to opt out, but when the dust \nsettles, at least 95 percent will have had to have taken the test.\n  We have situations now in which, if you eliminate that requirement, \nschool systems can encourage people not to show up on testing day. They \ncan have field trips on testing day and can manipulate the data so \nthat, if only half of the students are taking the test and if you make \nsure that it is the good students who are taking the test, your scores \nall of a sudden will go up.\n  The requirement that 95 percent get tested means you have meaningful \ndata so that you can find out what the problem is, and then you can \ndeal with it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Kline), the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. KLINE. I thank the gentleman for offering this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gentleman is expressing a concern here of parents, \nnot of schoolteachers and principals who want to put together field \ntrips. There is a great deal of anxiety on the part of some parents, \nand this is giving them some power.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment, and I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport it.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the underlying legislation and \nto the Salmon amendment.\n  Once again, we are considering legislation that does nothing to \nimprove equity in our public education system, assuring and ensuring \nthat resources are focused on student populations that have been \nhistorically marginalized, primarily children of color, English \nlanguage learners, children with disabilities, and poor kids. The \nlessons from No Child Left Behind are plentiful, some good that need \nimprovement and some that need to be eliminated from a reauthorization.\n  This amendment, along with the underlying legislation, continues to \ndismantle and remove the ESEA's significant mission, to deal with the \nissue of poverty in this country, marginalized communities, and kids \nwho are not achieving.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to oppose H.R. 5 and this \namendment. The current bill fails to provide all of our communities \nwith equitable educations.\n  Portability eliminates a maintenance of effort, block grants don't \naddress charter school accountability, and it eliminates provisions to \nprotect English learners in this country. With this amendment, we \neliminate the Nation's responsibility to be accountable and to ensure \nthat all children get an education.\n  I am astounded by the historical amnesia that goes on when we have \nthese discussions. The ESEA was formed for a purpose: to improve and to \ncreate equity and opportunity for children who didn't have it.\n  We have not reached a stage in this country when we can say that \nStates can take care of this. We can go back to those vestiges, as the \nranking member said, in which there was no equality, there was no \nopportunity, and tell the States, ``You can do what you want with this \nFederal money. And, by discretion, if you don't educate all of your \nchildren, that is okay. And if, by discretion, we can't hold anybody \naccountable for his lack of education, that is okay.''\n  That is the message we are going back to, and I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chairman, I take serious umbrage with the arrogance \nthat purveys this city in that we are the font of all knowledge. In \nfact, I lovingly joke with my constituents when I go back and say, ``I \nam from Washington, D.C., and I am here to help you.'' It always draws \na loud amount of laughter because everybody knows that that is not the \nway things really are.\n  If we can't trust our parents, who have the biggest vested interest \nin whether or not their children succeed in education, if we can't \ntrust the teachers, if we can't trust the local school boards, whose \nmembers also have to run for election, then we might as well just fold \nup and go home.\n\n  I have a lot more confidence in parents, in teachers, in our local \nschool boards, than I do in some nameless, faceless bureaucrat here in \nWashington, D.C. I say we put the power back where it should be: in the \nhands of parents and teachers and local school boards.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 1\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Polis).\n  Mr. POLIS. I thank the ranking member.\n  Mr. Chairman, one parent recently wrote me that she prefers that \nstudents with special needs be required to take tests. In her words, \n``The tests gave us the data we needed to see where my son needed \nadditional support.''\n  I rise in opposition to Mr. Salmon's amendment.\n  Before No Child Left Behind was passed, schools across the country \nwould systemically excluded students from tests in an effort to inflate \na school's overall performance and sweep deficiencies and \ndiscrimination under the rug.\n  This amendment, which would allow students to opt out of tests and \nallow those students to be omitted from the testing threshold, would \nmake it easier to, once again, exclude historically marginalized \nstudents from accountability systems.\n  There would be almost no way of knowing which students truly opted \nout, which were pushed out, and which students stayed at home at their \nschools' suggestion or traveled on an optional field trip.\n  In my home State of Colorado, a similar provision was brought up in \nthe State legislature, and over 400 business and community leaders \nstrongly publicly opposed the bill and succeeded in defeating it.\n  In order to close achievement gaps, we need data on every student, \nregardless of race, background, or disability. This kind of policy \nallows the very data we need the most on the most needy kids to be \nswept under the rug.\n  For that reason, I strongly urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  If this amendment passes, school systems will have an incentive to \naddress achievement gaps not by the hard work that it takes to close \nthe achievement gaps, but by just manipulating the data. That is wrong, \nand this amendment ought to be defeated.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 48 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 48 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-192.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike section 112 and insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 112.

Pursuant to House Resolution 347, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Polis) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, No Child Left Behind's metrics are outdated \nand rigid. On that we agree. But H.R. 5 in its current form abandons \nprovisions that are crucial to ensuring equal educational opportunities \nfor all of our Nation's students.\n  My amendment advances a more comprehensive and effective vision of \naccountability at the school district and State levels.\n  This new language expects States to set college- and career-ready \nstandards rather than to allow them to dumb down their standards in \norder to inflate their results.\n  It also requires States to set performance growth and graduation rate \ntargets that ensure that schools improve every year for all subgroups, \nincluding for students with disabilities.\n  One of the major deficiencies in H.R. 5 and one of the reasons that \nall of the advocacy groups for students with learning disabilities \noppose the bill is it effectively removes the accountability we have \nfor students with disabilities to ensure that they continue to learn.\n  There is currently a 1 percent cap on the students with the most \nsevere disabilities who are not tested. H.R. 5 would eliminate the 1 \npercent cap on alternative assessments based on alternative achievement \nstandards and would remove it altogether, allowing, ultimately, schools \nand States to decide not to have any accountability for those students \nwho need programs that meet their learning needs the most.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  The Democratic substitute amendment upholds our Nation's civil rights \nand equity responsibilities to ensure that all students receive a high-\nquality education.\n  It reinstates the 1 percent cap on alternative assessments for \nstudents with disabilities. It makes sure that accountability is a \nmeaningful word and takes meaningful steps toward getting \naccountability right, rather than allowing discrimination and bad \nchoices to continue to result in an increasing achievement gap across \nour country.\n  This amendment is also reflected in the Democratic substitute and \nwould make sure that we have an accountability system that prepares our \nstudents for the jobs and the workforce of the 21st century and to move \non to higher education.\n  Absent including this language or the Democratic substitute in the \nfinal passage of the bill, the bill in its current form would be a step \nbackward, a step to lower standards, a step to reduce accountability, \nand a step to allow deficiencies to be swept under the rug, as they \nonce were.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin).\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  My daughters just completed third grade, and I strongly support \nhigher standards for them and their generation, but we need to set up \nour children to succeed, not fail. We need to stop federally mandated \novertesting in our schools.\n  This amendment would be a giant leap backwards for education reform. \nRather than reforming the failed policies of No Child Left Behind, this \namendment embraces the most problematic portions, continuing to obsess \nover federally mandated performance standards and using that to measure \nteacher performance.\n\n[[Page H4924]]\n\n  What is most insulting is that this proposal is so flawed that the \nsponsor needs to leverage Federal money to lure cash-strapped States to \nbuy in because the proposal doesn't stand on its own merits.\n  Our schools need greater flexibility and local control. This \namendment would do the exact opposite, which is why I strongly oppose \nits passage and encourage all my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), the ranking member on the committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Chairman, the present law only requires \nthat States identify achievement gaps and prescribes exactly what has \nto be done to address the achievement gaps.\n  Unfortunately, the one-size-fits-all prescription has often failed to \neffectively address the achievement gaps. The underlying bill goes \noverboard by eliminating any requirement that something gets done. The \ngentleman's amendment reinstates the requirement that something be \ndone, but directs the States to develop their own locally tailored \nresponse to achievement gaps. This approach is much more likely to be \neffective and will be part of the Democratic substitute that will be \nvoted on shortly.\n  Mr. Chairman, before we leave the bill, I would like to thank many \nmembers of our staff that have worked on this bill since January. They \nhave spent days and nights and weekends working on the bill, and I \nwould like to acknowledge them and their work today.\n  Denise Forte, Jacque Chevalier, Christian Haines, Ashlyn Holeyfield, \nArika Trim, Tina Hone, Tylease Alli, Kiara Pesante, and Brian Kennedy \nall worked very hard on this bill and deserve significant recognition.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nUtah (Mrs. Love).\n  Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment. As a \nmayor and mainly as a mother--I have three children in public schools--\nI have found that the best solutions are found at the most local level.\n  This amendment puts a larger footprint in the hands of the Federal \nGovernment and gives more power to the Federal Government, instead of \nour local agencies. I believe that the best people to teach our \nstudents are the people at the local level. I trust teachers and \nparents to make decisions for students.\n  I made a promise that I was going to do everything I can to put the \ndecisionmaking back into the hands of people, not into the hands of the \nFederal Government. I believe that this amendment actually puts it into \nthe hands of the Federal Government and gives us a big step backwards.\n  I believe that we, as people, when we are given more options, we can \nmake better decisions; and when we make better decisions, we can do \nthat at a local level and not at a Federal level. I ask that we vote \nagainst this amendment. I stand in opposition of this amendment.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chair, I would like to inquire as to how much time \nremains.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Colorado has 1\\3/4\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Minnesota has 2\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman from Utah talked about \ndecisions and implementation at the local level. On that, we agree. \nWhat this amendment is about is accountability metrics under whether we \nlook at those decisions that are made locally and driven locally and by \nthe State work or don't work.\n  We want to allow the flexibility to get things right and close the \nachievement gap but not the flexibility to continue to ignore \npersistent gaps in our education system that continue to poorly serve \ntoo many low-income students and minority students.\n  Given that my amendment is included in its entirety in the Democratic \nsubstitute upon which we will be voting, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

PROTECTING CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES FROM ABUSIVE \n                   SECLUSION AND RESTRAINT PRACTICES.\n\n       (a) Purpose.-- The purpose of this section is to ensure a \n     safe learning environment and to protect each elementary and \n     secondary school student from physical or mental abuse, \n     aversive behavioral interventions that compromise student \n     health and safety, or any physical restraint or seclusion \n     when there is no imminent threat of physical injury or in a \n     manner otherwise inconsistent with the purposes of the \n     Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965 (21 U.S.C. \n     6301 et seq.).\n       (b) Regulation.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Education shall \n     promulgate regulations providing, at minimum, that school \n     personnel shall be prohibited from imposing on any elementary \n     or secondary school student the following:\n       (1) Mechanical restraints.\n       (2) Chemical restraints.\n       (3) Physical restraint or physical escort that restricts \n     breathing.\n       (4) Aversive behavioral interventions that compromise \n     health and safety such as excessive pain, use of heat or \n     cold, spraying bleach infused water in faces, and depriving \n     students of food and bathroom access for hours on end.\n\n  Ms. ESTY (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The gentlewoman from Connecticut is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill which \nwill not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, the \nbill will immediately proceed to final passage as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with serious concerns.\n  Today, we are voting on a bill that guts education funding; fails to \nprovide adequate support for our hard-working teachers; and turns our \nback on our schools, our communities, and our children.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we are not fixing No Child Left Behind, which has \nlong needed to be fixed, but instead, we are moving in the wrong \ndirection. As a room parent, as a PTA mom, I strongly believe that \nevery child deserves the opportunity for a quality education, and every \nchild deserves to be treated with dignity and respect.\n  The amendment I am offering today provides us the opportunity to live \nup to those goals. My amendment would guarantee continued funding for \nthe Individuals with Disabilities Education Act, known as IDEA.\n  Just today, I met with school superintendents from Connecticut who \nemphasize the critical role of Federal funding for IDEA, which provides \nimportant support for students with autism and cognitive disabilities, \nand my amendment would protect children with disabilities from abusive \nseclusion and restraint practices.\n  Last year, I met with a group of students from the FOCUS Center for \nAutism in Canton, Connecticut, in my district. They were incredible \nstudents, who bravely advocated for themselves and bluntly talked about \nthe challenges they face in the classroom.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, 1 in 68 American \nchildren is now on the autism spectrum, a tenfold increase in the last \n40 years. In Connecticut, too many students, particularly students who \nare on the autism spectrum, face unnecessary and dangerous seclusion \nand restraint.\n  According to the Connecticut State Department of Education and the \nOffice of the Child Advocate, there were 35,000 incidents of children \nbeing restrained or placed in seclusion last school year. Over 80 \npercent of these children were boys; the majority of them children of \ncolor, many of them were in elementary school--even as young as \npreschool--and many of them were on the autism spectrum.\n  Earlier this year, the Office of the Child Advocate in Connecticut \nreleased a report showing that, in the last 3 years, more than 1,300 \nConnecticut schoolchildren were injured during such restraint or \nseclusion. Nationwide, the nonpartisan Government Accountability Office \nfound hundreds of cases of alleged child abuse, including at least 20, \nthat is 20 deaths of children related to the use of these harmful \nmethods during the last two decades.\n  These stories are truly horrific: a 7-year-old dying after being held \nface down for hours by school staff, 5-year-olds with broken arms and \nbloody noses after being tied to chairs with bungee cords and duct tape \nby their teacher, and a 13-year-old who hung himself in the seclusion \nroom after prolonged confinement.\n  This is absolutely unacceptable. While Congress surely should not \nmicromanage discipline in local schools, we should--we should--step up \nto set standards to ensure that all our children are safe, and we \nshould fully fund IDEA to ensure support for all children with \ndisabilities.\n  Now, let me be clear. Many teachers do an outstanding job in what can \noften be a challenging classroom environment. Having children with \ndisabilities in the classroom can be a rewarding experience for the \nchild and for their classmates.\n  Children with learning disabilities will learn and excel with the \nright support. It is just not acceptable to say that we don't have \nenough time or enough money to provide that support.\n  Today, let's fully fund IDEA, support special education and services \nfor all children with disabilities, and restrict the dangerous \npractices of seclusion and restraint. We can do better; we must do \nbetter for our children.\n  I ask all House Members to join me to vote for this amendment, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of the point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Minnesota is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, we know this is a procedural attempt, a usual \nprocedural attempt, at the eleventh hour to derail this legislation. It \nis unfortunate because the American people have waited long enough for \nCongress to fix the problems plaguing our elementary and secondary \neducation system.\n  My colleagues, because it has been months since we have debated the \nunderlying bill and the challenge we face, I want to remind my \ncolleagues of what is at stake here.\n  It has been more than 7 years since No Child Left Behind expired--7 \nyears. That means, for 7 years, this Congress has failed to meet its \nbasic responsibility to replace the law. Each year we fail to act is \nanother year States are tied to flawed policies and students are \ntrapped in failing schools. No Child Left Behind continues as the law.\n  Education is a deeply personal issue for many Americans. It is a \ntopic discussed around kitchen tables, whether it is a child's report \ncard, a change taking place in a local school district, or perhaps even \npolicy changes being debated by Federal officials.\n  We were reminded of this reality just a few months ago.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  In February, we were making progress in advancing the Student Success \nAct, and we witnessed just how frustrated the American people are with \nthe Federal role in K-12 education and how that frustration has grown \nworse under this administration.\n  Rather than work with Congress to replace the law, the Obama \nadministration has spent years imposing its agenda on schools through \npet projects and conditional waivers.\n  Just listen to the national debate raging over Common Core and you \nwill quickly learn about the backlash against the Federal Government \nthat has taken place under this administration.\n  Because of this administration's unprecedented overreach, public \nanxiety and opposition to Federal intrusion is greater than it has ever \nbeen. The simple fact that Congress was considering changes to the law \nled countless individuals to speak out and raise concerns.\n  Unfortunately, some of those concerns were based on misinformation, \nbut they ultimately stem from a strong skepticism about the Federal \nrole in education, a skepticism that I and many others share.\n  Teachers, principals, parents, and education leaders desperately want\n\n[[Page H4934]]\n\nCongress to replace No Child Left Behind, but they are not just \nconcerned with getting rid of a bad law, they also deeply care about \nwhat replaces it. The public response we witnessed earlier this year \nmade that clear. We are here today because we are listening to the \nAmerican people.\n  The Student Success Act is a strong proposal to replace No Child Left \nBehind. It would eliminate dozens of ineffective and duplicative \nprograms, repeal Federal mandates dictating State spending, teacher \nquality, accountability, and school improvement, and provide parents \nvital support to hold schools accountable and rescue children from \nunderperforming schools.\n  Throughout this legislative process, we have adopted bipartisan \nimprovements to the bill, thanks to the work of both Republican and \nDemocrat Members. Now it is time to move forward.\n  We have an urgent responsibility to replace a flawed law with bold \nsolutions that will help provide every child in every school an \nexcellent education. That responsibility grows more urgent each day.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit and to \nvote ``yes'' on the Student Success Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. ESTY.

When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \nan amendment offered by the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy) had been \ndisposed of, and the bill had been read through page 132, line 24.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any person whose \n     disclosures of a proceeding with a disposition listed in \n     section 2313(c)(1) of title 41, United States Code, in the \n     Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System \n     include the term ``Fair Labor Standards Act'' and such \n     disposition is listed as ``willful'' or ``repeated''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, before I discuss my amendment, which is to \nprevent wage theft from violators who commit acts that are repeated and \nwillful and to stop such actors from partaking of Federal procurement \nin this bill, I would like to set the table just a little bit.\n  In 1980, Mr. Chair, CEO-to-worker pay ratio for Fortune 500 companies \nwas 20 to 1. Today it is 204 to 1, according to Bloomberg. At the same \ntime, the buying power of the minimum wage is now less than it was in \nthe 1960s.\n  The Economic Policy Institute found that, in total, the average low-\nwage worker loses a stunning $2,634 per year in unpaid wages, \nrepresenting about 15 percent of their earned income. It is \nparticularly egregious in the fast-food sector. A recent study by Hart \nResearch of fast-food workers found that about 89 percent reported some \nform of wage theft.\n  Lastly, in this case, I would like to point out, Mr. Chair, that the \nrecent report by the Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and \nPensions of the U.S. Senate revealed that 32 percent of the largest \nDepartment of Labor penalties for wage theft were levied against \nFederal contractors.\n  As I bring this amendment before the body today, Mr. Chairman, it is \nsimply to recognize that the hard work and the work that workers do who \nwork for Federal contractors must be recognized. We are not debating \ntoday over increasing or decreasing the minimum wage. We are just \nsaying the people who work hard ought to get the money that they \nearned.\n  I would hope that everyone in this body would be willing to say wage \ntheft is not okay. No hard-working American should ever have to worry \nthat her employer will refuse to pay her when she works overtime or \ntake money out of her paycheck, especially if she works for a Federal \ncontractor.\n\n[[Page H4936]]\n\n  This practice, as I mentioned already, is called wage theft. Right \nnow, Federal contractors who violate the Fair Labor Standards Act are \nstill allowed to apply for Federal contracts.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  This amendment seeks to ensure that funds may not be used to enter \ninto a contract with a government contractor that willfully or \nrepeatedly violates the Fair Labor Standards Act--willfully or \nrepeatedly.\n  It is important, Mr. Chairman, to point out that it is not easy to \nget a violation. You have got to work at it.\n  There is a database called the FAPISS database, to begin with, in \nwhich contractors have to report all their violations. Just because a \nwage and hour complaint comes to your door, it doesn't necessarily mean \nyou get a violation. In order to get a violation in the database, you \nhave to have a criminal conviction, a civil proceeding with a finding \nof fault, or an administrative proceeding with a finding of fault or a \npenalty of $5,000 or more or damages of $100,000 or more. You have got \nto really work at it. In other words, if you are found to owe back \nwages and you agree to pay them, there is not going to be a case for \nyou to have to report.\n  This amendment ensures that those in violation of the law do not get \ntaxpayer support. And we should reward good actors.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. The amendment doesn't recognize the suspension and \ndebarment process that is already in place for Federal contractors. It \ndoes not provide exceptions for critical, urgent, or compelling needs \nor allow for the consideration of mitigating factors.\n  I am concerned that this amendment would impose strict legal triggers \nand take away the ability for Federal agencies to investigate and \ndetermine appropriate remedies. I am also concerned that it would deny \nthe due process that the current suspension and debarment system \nprovides. And finally, this is an issue that should be thoroughly \nvetted through the authorization process, not through the appropriation \nprocess.\n  I would urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. \nMcCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in support of the amendment from the \ngentleman from Minnesota.\n  Every worker is entitled to receive pay for the hours they work; \nhowever, there are employers that refuse to pay for overtime, make \ntheir employees work off the clock, or refuse to pay minimum wage. At \nthe very least, we should take steps to ensure that these employers \ndon't receive new Federal contracts.\n  This amendment would ensure that lawbreaking contractors don't get \nrewarded for stealing from their employees.\n  I support this amendment, and I ask for an ``aye'' vote.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I would just, again, oppose this amendment. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Members, this has nothing to do with debarment. \nDebarment is a quasi-judicial process in which evidence is gathered and \nfindings are made. This is saying that, after somebody has been found \nto engage in repeated and willful violations of the Fair Labor \nStandards Act, such persons are not the kind of people we want to \nreward through our procurement system. This is totally different from \ndebarment.\n  What it is really saying is it reflects our values as a body and \nreflects our value of the dignity of work and that a dollar earned is a \ndollar that must be paid. And we should never be the kind of body that \nsays: ``Commit willful violations all you want; take workers' money \naway; you can still get another contract if you please.'' That is not \nthe kind of body that we are, and I urge a ``yes'' vote on the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n\n                                 study\n\n       Sec. __. Of the amounts made available by this Act to pay \n     retention bonuses to Senior Executive Service personnel at \n     the Environmental Protection Agency, not more than $50,000 \n     shall be made available to be used by the Department of the \n     Interior to conduct a study on whether Agricola Americus \n     should be classified as an endangered species.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman from Colorado and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, my amendment appropriates up to $50,000 from the \nretention bonuses of Senior Executive Service personnel at the EPA to \nconduct a study of whether Agricola Americus, the American farmer, \nshould be classified as an endangered species.\n  This money should be used to determine whether there is crucial \nhabitat that is essential for the conservation of the species and \nacting in accordance with 16 U.S.C. chapter 35 if such a finding is \nmade.\n  The Federal Government is no stranger to using its regulatory powers \nto interfere in important national issues, so it came as a surprise \nwhen I discovered that the Federal Government had overlooked the most \nendangered species in America.\n  The Fish and Wildlife Service has been so thorough in designating \nanimals as endangered all around farms, but for some reason hasn't seen \nthe plight of the American farmer.\n  Paul Harvey recognized, in 1978, that God made Agricola Americus with \na unique set of characteristics essential to our Nation, so I am \ntroubled that the number of farmers in America has steadily declined \nover the last six decades.\n  Not only has the number of American farmers shrunk, but so has the \nnumber of farms. Those lost have mainly been family farms, passed down \nthrough generations of hard work and built up with years of sweat \nequity. They have faced numerous manmade obstacles that interfere with \ntheir environment and encroach on their natural territory. They have \nbeen subject to the ravages of wolves released by the very agency that \nshould be tasked with protecting this essential American species.\n  Yet the Department of the Interior does not have a monopoly on \nsociety's invasion of the American farmer and the habitat. Family farms \nhave been destroyed by the death tax, regulated out of business by FDA \nand EPA mandates, and forced to dump crops by outdated government \nprograms that even now are being struck down by the Supreme Court.\n  How much more of this regulatory onslaught can the Agricola Americus \ntake before we recognize the harm of our actions and work to make sure \nthat we are not complicit in its disappearance? We cannot leave the \nfarmer alone in the eye of this regulatory storm.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I make a point of order against the \namendment because it provides an appropriation for an unauthorized \nprogram and, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI. Clause 2 of rule \nXXI states in pertinent part:\n  ``An appropriation may not be in order as an amendment for an \nexpenditure not previously authorized by law.''\n\n[[Page H4937]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, the amendment proposes to appropriate funds. The \namendment, therefore, violates clause 2 of rule XXI.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point \nof order?\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to pay the salaries and expenses of personnel or any \n     other entity to negotiate or conclude a settlement with the \n     Federal Government that includes terms requiring the \n     defendant to donate or contribute funds to an organization or \n     individual.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, my amendment bars the EPA and the Department of \nthe Interior and any of its agencies from requiring mandatory donations \nto third-party groups as part of any settlement agreements the agencies \nenter into.\n  In agencies across the government, settlement funds are being \nfunneled to third-party groups, contravening congressional budget \nauthority. A recent investigation by the House Judiciary and Financial \nServices Committees found as much as half a billion dollars had been \ndiverted by the Department of Justice to third parties as a result of \nthese settlements in the past year. This is inexcusable, and it is not \nunique to the Department of Justice.\n  The Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency, \nand the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service routinely sue and then enter \ninto settlements with businesses and individuals who are then forced to \nmake donations to third-party groups.\n  This is all made possible because community service is expressly \nallowed as a condition of probation by the United States Criminal Code. \nIn addition, the United States sentencing guidelines allow community \nservice where it is reasonably designed to repair the harm caused by \nthe offense. This results in settlement funds being directed to \nsupposed ``community service'' groups. This is a practice that must be \nbrought to an end.\n  As Thomas Jefferson once wrote:\n\n       To compel a man to furnish contributions of money for the \n     propagation of opinions which he disbelieves and abhors is \n     sinful and tyrannical.\n\n  In this case, businesses and individuals are being sued by the \ngovernment for violating environmental regulations, and then as part of \nthe settlement, they have to make payments to the environmental \norganizations that engage in advocacy supporting the regulations. This \npower grab is abhorrent.\n  Please support my amendment and stop these agencies from funneling \ncourt settlement funds to radical environmentalists.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. The fact is that this is a very broadly written \namendment that would prevent the Federal Government from requiring \npolluters to pay for cleanup costs. Specifically, I would point out \nthat the EPA is involved in numerous consent decree negotiations that \nresult in payments to the Federal Government by responsible parties.\n  The ability of the Federal Government to recoup these funds from \npolluters is an essential part of maintaining good environmental policy \nand protecting public health and protecting taxpayers, not polluters. \nFor example, some Superfund sites that the EPA may spend Superfund \ntrust moneys up front to initiate the cleanup of a potential \nresponsible party are not yet identified or the cleanup order or \nsettlement agreement with the identified parties is not yet finalized.\n  In the event that the EPA does expend Superfund moneys at a site with \nveritable parties, reimbursements may be included in the terms of any \nsettlement agreement that may be entered into with the parties. \nHowever, this amendment would prevent the EPA from receiving such \nreimbursements from the responsible parties in such an instance.\n  There are also times when defendants in settlement negotiations seek \npayments to third parties rather than the Federal Government. One such \nexample is the settlement negotiations that followed the catastrophe at \nthe Deepwater Horizon spill in the Gulf of Mexico.\n  As part of the criminal settlements that BP and Transocean reached \nwith the Federal Government, the National Fish and Wildlife Foundation, \na congressionally chartered nonprofit, received the funds to undertake \nthe projects to help remedy the harm that occurred in the Gulf of \nMexico--something I would agree all needed to happen--yet under this \namendment, those payments would have been prohibited. It would be \ncompletely irresponsible.\n  This amendment is bad for the taxpayer, bad for public policy, and \nvery bad for the environment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCK. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, once again, voting for this amendment and \nhaving it move forward would be completely irresponsible. This \namendment is bad public policy, bad for environment, and it is bad for \nthe taxpayer. I urge defeat of this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Buck\n\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to pay a Federal employee for any period of time \n     during which such employee is using official time under \n     section 7131 of title 5, United States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Colorado and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chair, my amendment would prohibit paying any Federal \nemployee for the time spent not working for the taxpayers but working \nfor a third party, a labor union. This practice is known as ``official \ntime.''\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Unlike any other type of third-party organization, labor unions have \nbeen granted the privilege of being able to have taxpayer-funded \nemployees do their business on duty time, instead of doing the \ntaxpayers' work.\n  Like any other type of private entity, labor unions should pay for \ntheir own employees to work for them. The taxpayers should not be \npicking up the tab for this practice.\n  According to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management, this practice \ncosts taxpayers approximately $156 million per year. That is assuming \nthat the agencies are correctly reporting the amounts spent, and there \nhave been indications that this number actually underreports the total \ncost.\n  In some instances, we are not talking about just a few minutes here \nand there for an agency employee who is a union official to confer with \nmanagement about a workplace issue. Sometimes, the agency employee is \nactually working full time for the labor union, all the while being \npaid by the taxpayers for this union work.\n  For instance, the IRS has more than 200 employees working full time \nfor labor unions; the VA has over 250 employees working full time for \nlabor unions--this at a time when there is a significant backlog of \ncases to be processed.\n  One of these employees doesn't even work in a VA facility but, \ninstead, works remotely from a private office in D.C.\n\n[[Page H4938]]\n\n  The EPA, while not having as many personnel on full-time official \ntime as some agencies, still pays over $1.6 million just for those \npersonnel who are working full time for their union.\n  Some agencies, such as the Department of Transportation, have \nnumerous employees making over $170,000 per year, while working full \ntime for the union. This is more than almost all Federal employees \nmake, higher than the salaries of many Senate-confirmed Assistant \nSecretaries.\n  My amendment would not prohibit this practice, but would make certain \nthat the right party pays for this work, the labor union. It is not \nright to force our taxpayers to pay the bill to subsidize these private \norganizations any more than it would be right to force them to \nsubsidize other private organizations such as the National Rifle \nAssociation or the Sierra Club.\n  Like any business, labor unions should pay the cost for their own \nemployees, not taxpayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, this amendment clearly would serve no \npurpose but to erode collective bargaining rights for civil service \nemployees and may violate collective bargaining agreements negotiated \nbetween workers and these agencies.\n  Federal unions are legally required to provide representation to all \nmembers of bargaining units, whether or not those workers elect to pay \nvoluntary union dues. Representation for employees working their way \nthrough the administrative procedures is a cost-effective process for \nadministrating and adjudicating agency policies.\n  The alternative for official time is for the government agencies to \npay for costly third-party attorney and arbitration fees. Eliminating \nofficial time would increase costs, and it would increase more time and \neffort for agencies to work out any conflicts with employees. That \ndrives up the cost for taxpayers.\n  Official time is essential to maintaining workplace safety. Union \nrepresentation uses official time to set procedures to protect \nemployees from on-the-job hazards. Official time is used to allow \nemployees to participate in work groups with management teams to \nimprove the process and improve performance outcomes.\n  Under current law, official time may not be used to solicit \nmembership, may not be used to conduct internal union meetings, may not \nbe used to elect union officers, may not be used to engage in any \npartisan activities, and the notion that official time is used for any \nof these purposes is false.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, once again, this amendment would serve no \npurpose but to erode the collective bargaining rights of civil service \nFederal employees, hard-working Americans.\n  For that reason, I urge a ``no'' vote, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Colorado \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from American \nSamoa (Mrs. Radewagen) for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. Mr. Chair, I would like to commend Chairman Calvert, \nRanking Member McCollum, and the Appropriations Committee staff for \ntheir efforts in bringing this important bill to the floor.\n  I would also like to congratulate Chairman Calvert on his leadership \nin overseeing this measure and his continued success as chairman of the \nsubcommittee.\n  I want to take this opportunity to highlight just a small portion of \nthe needs and shortfalls that the territories are facing. In \nparticular, I want to bring to your attention some of the funding \nissues facing American Samoa.\n  Each year, the Office of Insular Affairs provides grant funds to \nAmerican Samoa for the operation of local government, including the \njudiciary, Department of Education, and the local hospital. The purpose \nof this program is to fund the difference between budget needs and \nlocal revenues.\n  Mr. Chairman, the world has changed much since the inception of this \nprogram to assist American Samoa government operations, and additional \nneeds have arisen.\n  Local revenues have remained relatively constant; the infrastructure \nhas become dated and in disrepair, and outside influences, particularly \nChina, have begun to make inroads into the region with the development \nof a port in the neighboring independent Samoa and future plans for a \nnaval base in the same area.\n  We have also seen a dramatic spike in world conflict since the \ninception of the program. This increased military activity by both \nfriendly and hostile nations has simultaneously created the need for \nincreased border security, an element severely lacking in American \nSamoa and one not funded under the current parameters of the program.\n  American Samoa is also facing severe infrastructure deficiency, which \nhas caused undue hardship to both our people and businesses that rely \nupon our roads, airport, and port.\n  In fact, the recent decision by the NOAA National Weather Service to \nterminate weather observation service in American Samoa, which our \nlocal airport relies upon for flight operations, has prompted the need \nfor the construction of a tower at Pago Pago International Airport. \nThis facility would serve as a standard control tower and would also \ncontain the weather monitoring service after NOAA ceases operations in \nAmerican Samoa.\n  Mr. Chairman, my home district was devastated by a tsunami on \nSeptember 29, 2009, that killed many of our people. I was there at the \ntime. If it hadn't been for the fact that I had a scheduled meeting at \nthat very time and was already awake, I could have been killed by the \nwave. We lost our tuna cannery the day after the tsunami, which was \nhalf of our private sector employment.\n  We also are suffering from the prolonged recession here in the States \nand suffered another setback with the recent longshoremen's strike that \nexposed just how dependent we are on outside resources.\n  Chairman Calvert, I encourage the committee that, when considering \nfunding levels for the territories, to keep in mind our economic and \ngeographic isolation and the extreme disparity in opportunities for \ngrowth between these regions and the States.\n  Mr. Chairman, I look forward to working with the committee to \nincrease funding for the territories which will help alleviate the many \nissues we are facing.\n  Mr. CALVERT. As someone who has always had the utmost respect for our \nfellow countrymen from the territories, I look forward to working with \nthe gentlewoman from American Samoa, and I want to thank her for her \nefforts to inform the committee on the issues of the insular areas.\n  I am well aware of just how dedicated to our country the people of \nAmerican Samoa are, as displayed by their extremely high rate of \nenlistment in our Nation's Armed Forces.\n  Your membership in this body is highly valued, and the appointment as \nvice chairman of the Indian, Insular, and Alaska Native Affairs \nSubcommittee as a first-term member is a testament to the perspective \nand leadership you bring to Congress.\n  Through your leadership, your people are well respected and have \nfound themselves a champion for their cause.\n  Mrs. RADEWAGEN. At a time when we are faced with the need to reduce \nfunding in many areas of government, I thank the committee for \npreserving the budgetary assistance to American Samoa.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his kind words and continued \nleadership,\n\n[[Page H4939]]\n\nand I look forward to working with him to ensure that the territories \nare given the same opportunity as the States.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grothman\n\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this act may \n     be used to regulate the location of the placement of a \n     monitor of pollutants under the clean air act in any county \n     provided such county has at least one monitor.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, right now, the Environmental Protection \nAgency makes the determination whether a county is what they call a \nnonattainment zone based on readings, the amount of ozone that various \nmonitors come up with. If you are a nonattainment zone, it results in \nproblems for both individuals and business.\n  Individuals in counties in my area have two problems. First of all, \nif you are nonattainment, you might have to have gasoline that is \nprobably a little bit inferior in quality, as well as more expensive.\n  I always think the price of gasoline is an important thing because it \ndoesn't matter; either wealthy or poor, it is something you have to be \nable to afford. If you are knocking up your price of gasoline by 5 or \n10 cents a year, that can be a very damaging thing for someone who \ndoesn't have that great a salary.\n  Secondly, if you are a nonattainment zone, every car has to be \nchecked for emissions. Maybe there are some wealthy environmentalists \nthat it is no big deal--if their car fails the emissions test, they can \nafford to spend another $900 on a catalytic converter or something \nwildly more expensive. For somebody not well off, it maybe puts you in \na position which you have to buy a whole new car.\n  It is another problem for businesses. Manufacturing is very important \nto this country. If you crack down on a business and say that you have \nto do different things to affect the amount of ozone that may be \nemitted from your factory, it can be very cost prohibitive and put \nAmerican business at a competitive disadvantage.\n  These determinations are made by air monitors. In every county, the \namount of ozone that is detected by these monitors may vary greatly \nfrom one part of the county to another part of the county.\n  It is our opinion that sometimes in the past, in my district, if you \nput an air monitor right on Lake Michigan, due to the effect the sun \nhas on the water, you might get disproportionately high readings and \nwind up having to put your individuals and businesses in a situation \nwhich they are in nonattainment.\n  This is particularly onerous because, sometimes, whether or not you \nhave a high ozone rating or not has nothing whatsoever to do with \nanything that is going on within your county.\n  My district, for example, is maybe 70 miles from Chicago, where most \nof the pollutants come from; so here you are, stuck trying to make your \nair cleaner and cleaner, and there is very little you can do to affect \nit anyway.\n  In any event, it seems fair that you should be able to put an air \nmonitor anywhere within that county. You shouldn't have a situation in \nwhich, in the past, an air monitor was placed at an area where you got \na disproportionately high reading.\n  The purpose of this amendment is to say that the Environmental \nProtection Agency, that I am sure has a budget tight as a drum, should \nnot have to waste any time worrying about where that air monitor is and \nwhere we are determining whether or not we have an ozone problem in a \ncounty.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maine is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nWisconsin would prohibit funds for regulating the location of air \nmonitors in counties.\n  The Clean Air Act requires every State to establish a network of air \nmonitoring stations for criteria pollutants, using criteria set by the \nEPA for their location and operation.\n  EPA's ambient air monitoring network assessment guidance provides \nStates and counties with information about the assessment of technical \naspects of ambient air monitoring networks. The guidance is designed to \nbe flexible and expandable. It does not dictate specific locations for \nplacement for air monitors.\n  The amendment would block EPA oversight of air quality monitoring, \nmaking possible a scenario in which counties could game the system by \nlocating monitors in places that show the lowest amount of pollution \nrather than where they get the best representative data.\n  Let us look no further than today's paper to understand why we need \nto ensure the proper collection of air quality data.\n  A headline in the Wisconsin Ag Connection reads: Canadian Wildfires \nPrompt State to Issue Air Quality Notice.\n  The article reports that the Department of Natural Resources has \nissued an air quality notice for all 72 Wisconsin counties this week. \nState air quality monitors are recording elevated concentrations of \nfine particles at several locations around the State, particularly \nacross northern and western Wisconsin.\n  And some sites are recording values in the ``unhealthy for \nsensitive'' category, which includes children, elderly people, \nindividuals with respiratory and cardiac problems, and people engaged \nin strenuous activities for prolonged periods of time.\n  This amendment would stop a transparent, science-based process to \nlocate monitors where they will provide the most useful information \nabout air quality.\n  Mr. Chairman, I don't think it is appropriate to dictate a nationwide \nmoratorium on air quality monitoring in response to what appears to be \na local issue perhaps in the gentleman's State of Wisconsin.\n  This amendment is harmful to local governments that depend on EPA's \ntechnical expertise when determining the best location for an air \nmonitor placement. I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chair, first of all, the gentlewoman from Maine \nmakes a point not about this amendment specifically, but about the \noverall program.\n  And that is you have a situation right now in which, apparently, the \nDepartment of Natural Resources is making a determination that we have \nunsafe air based upon fires that are hundreds of miles away that the \nlocal people can't do anything about.\n  Secondly, the gentlewoman says it is tying the hands of local units \nof government. That is not true. Under this amendment, the local units \nof government have more flexibility.\n  The question is can the Federal Government tie the hands of local \nunits of government, which they shouldn't be able to do.\n  So it is a good amendment. I think it is something that is going to, \nin the long term, benefit American business and, even more, benefit \nAmerican individuals, particularly poor people, who don't have a lot of \nextra money, are stuck spending a lot more money on their cars because \nof determinations made by Federal bureaucrats in far-away cities who \nprobably have enough money to be able to afford to deal with these \nproblems anyway.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I will just reiterate the points I made \nbefore and urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n\n[[Page H4940]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Wisconsin \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Sanford\n\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n limitation on use of funds for oil and gas lease sale 260 in leasing \n                                program\n\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for oil and gas lease sale 260 included in the Draft \n     Proposed Outer Continental Shelf (OCS) Oil and Gas Leasing \n     Program for 2017-2022 (DPP), or in any subsequent proposed or \n     final iteration of such Program.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I rise in utter respect for my colleague from \nCalifornia and his colleagues and the Interior bill that they created \nand all the good that it does.\n  This is, in essence, just a very small refining amendment that, as \nwas described in the reading, would simply prohibit the Department of \nthe Interior from moving forward on sales within block 260. I think \nthat this is important for a number of different reasons that I will \nenumerate.\n  But I want to be clear. This is not an amendment about a belief in \nthere being dangers with regard to technology that is used and employed \noffshore. I have been quite impressed in all the studies I have done in \nthe technological advancements that have taken place.\n  Nor is it an amendment about the belief that we shouldn't be using \nfossil fuels. I think that fossil fuels are very important in the mix \nwith regard to energy independence in this country.\n  What this amendment is simply about is the age-old notion that \nWashington doesn't always know best, that the Founding Fathers were \nreally deliberate in their belief in this notion of Federalism; that \nthey divided power not only laterally, but vertically; that there was a \nFederal Government, but there was also a State and a local government; \nand those municipalities or those States should have a voice, too.\n  It is about recognizing that there is a difference between comment \nand control. And what municipalities, what people back home in South \nCarolina along the coast, are saying is: We want to have more than just \na comment. We want to have control over our destiny in the way that the \ncoast develops.\n  For that reason, nine communities in my district alone as well as 65 \ncommunities up and down the eastern seaboard have added comments, \nsaying: We want to push the pause button here.\n  And, indeed, that is all this amendment does. It says: Let's pause so \nthat we can do a cost-benefit analysis going forward. I think that this \nis important, given the large context.\n  You know, we are talking about 4 percent of the oil reserves within \nthe Continental U.S. We are talking about a 5-month supply. These \ncommunities are saying a 5-month supply versus a lifetime impact in a \nplace like Saint Helena Sound.\n  If you look at the ACE Basin, it has been nationally recognized as a \ntreasure. It is about 250,000 acres on the coast of South Carolina. The \nFederal Government put a lot of money into preserving it, as did State \nand private interests.\n  And what people are saying is: Given the amount of industrialization \nthat has to take place to support the offshore rigs, do you bring those \npipes and that supply in through a place like Saint Helena Sound?\n  Again, what people have said along the coast of South Carolina is: \nLet's pause and reflect on that. And that is what this amendment does.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I must rise in reluctant opposition to this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is the mirror opposite, as \nthe gentleman knows, of the Hudson amendment that is currently pending \nvia a rollcall vote.\n  The Hudson amendment would allow lease 260 to move forward under the \nDepartment of the Interior's next 5-year offshore leasing plan for 2017 \nthrough 2022.\n  The Sanford amendment would prevent lease 260 from moving forward \nunder the next 5-year plan. And given the competing amendments, I must \noppose this amendment, since we accepted the other amendment last \nnight.\n  So I would ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, again, I respect the Solomon's wisdom that \nwould be required by the chairman and others on the committee in \ndividing the different interests, and that is why I think the Founding \nFathers had it right.\n  They said that, ultimately, nobody in Washington can have Solomon's \nwisdom when you talk about local perspective and local interests, that \nthere was a real value to local voice, those nine communities.\n  If you think about Saint Helena Sound as the example that I just \ncited, the little town south of there, Beaufort, drew up a resolution, \nand the county and the city council moved forward, saying: We don't \nwant to move forward with this.\n  The little town to the east, Edisto Beach, moved forward with the \nresolution citing the same. The larger town to the north, Charleston, \ndid the same.\n  Those local inputs, those local people, have said: We have seen what \nmight or might not come here. We think it is worthy of a pause. Again, \nthat is all this amendment does.\n  It doesn't say: We will forever not have offshore drilling in sale \n260.\n  What it says is: For the next 5 years, why don't we allow for more \npublic input and more voice, given the fact that there are lifetime \nimpacts and really long-lasting impacts in certain pristine and/or \ndeveloped areas along the coast of South Carolina or other coastal \nareas along the block of 260.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I will just restate my opposition to this \namendment. And I would hope that the gentleman could work with his \ncolleagues in South Carolina and work all this out. But I must oppose \nthe amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SANFORD. I yield to the gentlewoman from Maine.\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Chair, I just wanted to rise in support of the \namendment offered by the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  I was here last night and had a chance to speak against the Hudson \namendment for the very reasons that he is articulating.\n  Coming from Maine and being from a State where people take very \nseriously our waterfronts, our fisheries, our livelihood that we make \non the water, there are deep concerns about the challenges that might \ncome up with oil and gas leases.\n  And I think everyone in many coastal States wants to just make sure \nwe go through the most thorough process possible. So I heartily support \nthe concerns that he is raising, and I support this amendment.\n  Mr. SANFORD. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from South \nCarolina will be postponed.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, there are many of us here in Congress who \nwant to build a better America, a stronger America, a healthier \nAmerica. And there are many of us here who are willing to work and \nfight to move our country in that direction forward,\n\n[[Page H4941]]\n\nwhich is the direction the American people want to go.\n  For most Americans, for families and communities all across this \ncountry, protecting the air we breathe and the water we drink is an \nessential role of government. The American people expect Congress to \nprotect the public's health from polluters who are all too willing to \nreap larger and larger profits as they pump poison into our air and \nwater.\n  We hear all too often the cries of ``burdensome regulation'' from \nthose who defend the polluters. But rarely do we hear the cries of \n``burdensome asthma'' or ``burdensome cancer'' from average Americans \nwho all too often suffer in silence when they are sick because the air, \nwater, or land they need has been poisoned.\n  My Republican colleagues are very content to cut funding and place \nriders on the enforcement of environmental standards to make life \neasier for the polluters.\n  But what about the families and the communities put at risk? What \nabout the children who are at risk because avoiding environmental \nregulations to pump up profits is more important than public health?\n  The role of the Environmental Protection Agency is to protect the \npublic, to protect our health, to protect our water, to protect our \nair, to protect our land from polluters who are all too willing to cut \ncorners, enabling them to reap larger profits.\n  Investing in environmental regulation to protect the American people \nis a government function that is not burdensome. It is essential.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  We should all want to protect the public's health and the vital role \nthat the Environmental Protection Agency plays on behalf of the \nAmerican people, but this bill fails to protect the American people. It \nfails to protect the public's health, and it fails to provide the tools \nnecessary to hold polluters accountable for poisoning our air, our \nwater, and our land. If this bill ever finds its way to the President's \ndesk, President Obama will veto it.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is an important bill, and the investments we make \ntogether in this Interior-Environmental Appropriations bill speak to \nour values as a nation. We are the stewards of a bounty of resources, \nthe inheritors of a nation of natural treasures; and there are 300 \nmillion Americans who depend on this Congress to ensure those \nresources, including our clean air and clean water, are protected.\n  Sadly, Mr. Chairman, very sadly, this bill lets them down. So I will \nurge my colleagues at the end of the day to vote against final passage, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Palmer\n\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n\n       Sec. __. (a) Limitation on Use of Funds.--None of the funds \n     made available by this Act may be used for grants under title \n     VII, subtitle G of the Energy Policy Act of 2005.\n       (b) Corresponding Reduction in Funds.--The aggregate amount \n     otherwise provided by this Act for ``Environmental Protection \n     Agency-State and Tribal Assistance Grants'', and the amount \n     provided under such heading for grants under title VII, \n     subtitle G of the Energy Policy Act of 2005, are each hereby \n     reduced by $50,000,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment limits the funding of the EPA's Diesel \nEmissions Reduction Program. The Diesel Emissions Reduction Program is \npart of the National Clean Diesel Campaign. This grant program was \ncreated in 2005 as a short-term effort to assist States and local \ngovernment to meet new diesel emissions standards for older diesel \nengines.\n  According to the Obama administration, the overall impact of the \nprogram has been marginal. Currently, there are 14 grant and loan \nprograms at the Department of Energy, the Department of Transportation, \nand the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, plus three tax activities \nthat have as a goal reducing mobile source diesel emissions. In \naddition, each of the 14 programs, according to the GAO, overlaps with \nat least one other program in the specific activities they fund, the \nprogram goals, or the eligible recipients of funding.\n  GAO also identified several instances of duplication where more than \none program provided grant funding to the same recipient for the same \ntype of activities. One example identified by GAO showed a nonprofit \norganization received $1.1 million from EPA's Diesel Emissions \nReduction Act program to install emission reduction and idle reduction \ntechnologies on 1,700 trucks, as well as $5.6 million from a State \ninfrastructure bank established under DOT's program to equip trucks and \ntruck fleets with emissions control and idle reduction devices--\nessentially the same thing.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Federal Government has become so large, it is \nimpossible to grasp its true size and scope to pay for its cost. With \nthe country facing unprecedented levels of debt, taxpayers expect the \nFederal Government to run more efficiently, guarding against careless \nwaste of precious resources. It is essential that Congress, the \nadministration, and Federal agencies do everything in their power to \ncut spending, reduce duplication, and rein in waste, fraud, and abuse. \nMy amendment does just that, and it would have an annual savings of $50 \nmillion.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I know a lot about the DERA program, obviously, from \nsouthern California, probably the most controlled air quality area in \nthe United States, and there are a lot of things in EPA that don't \nwork. There are a lot of things that EPA does to regulate, to create \npaperwork, and to create headaches for small- and large-business \npeople. We have included a great number of policy provisions to address \nthis EPA regulatory overreach in this bill. We have cut the EPA budget \ndramatically, as the gentlewoman just referred to. However, I believe \nthis specific amendment targets a program that actually yields great \nbenefits.\n  Many counties across the Nation are currently in nonattainment with \nEPA's existing standards for the particulate matter and ozone. We are \nnot talking about the standards that are being talked about. We are \ntalking about the standards that were put in place in 2008.\n  In many instances, these counties have been in nonattainment for \nyears, and those communities need help to improve their air quality. \nThe Diesel Emission Reduction Program, or DERA, is a proven, cost-\neffective program that provides grants to States to retrofit old diesel \nengines. So it is a program that supports manufacturing jobs while \nreducing pollution.\n  Another benefit is that these grants are highly leveraged, producing \n$13 of economic benefit for every Federal grant dollar. Today's newer \nengines produce 90 percent--let me say that again--90 percent less \ntoxic emissions than the older diesel engines. Remember, I have \nexperience with trucks, and these independent truck drivers, those who \nhave those trucks, get a lot of miles out of those trucks, sometimes \nwell over a million miles off a truck. However, only 30 percent of the \ntrucks and heavy-duty vehicles have transitioned to cleaner \ntechnologies, typically because especially these small truck companies \njust can't afford to get this new technology. We need to follow the \nscience and accelerate the replacement of older engines with these new, \nclean engines, which, by the way, get better mileage and, at the same \ntime, clean up the air considerably.\n  This is a program that is actually working. We have seen \nsignificant--I know the Obama administration doesn't like this program. \nThey don't like programs that actually work. They want to get rid of \nthe programs that work and have money be put into these esoteric \nclimate change studies and so forth and so on, and I can tell\n\n[[Page H4942]]\n\nthe gentleman, from experience, that this had significant impacts in \nthe South Coast Air Quality District where I live in, an area that has \nprobably been impacted with all the problems of air quality more than \nany other region in the United States of America.\n  Mr. Chairman, I strongly urge Members to vote ``no'' on the \ngentleman's amendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I thank my distinguished colleague from \nCalifornia for his remarks, and I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, since 1984, the EPA has lowered the amount of \npollutants from diesel engines by more than 98 percent. Since 1980, \ndespite the fact that the gross domestic product has grown by over 460 \npercent, vehicle miles have increased by 94 percent, the population has \ngrown 38 percent, energy production 32 percent, emissions have gone \ndown 50 percent. In regard to the impact of these programs, you have 14 \nprograms that the GAO has identified as overlapping. It will do little \nharm to the overall effort for air quality to eliminate one program \nthat is clearly a duplication in several instances identified by the \nGAO.\n  In addition, Mr. Chairman, in regard to air quality, while air \nquality has improved dramatically--emissions are down 50 percent since \n1980--respiratory illnesses such as asthma have gone up, and that is \nlargely a byproduct of income. So I would commend to you that we need \nto reduce the number of regulations, the cost of regulations, to allow \nmore economic activity and provide better job opportunities for people, \nwhich will have a direct impact on their overall welfare, including \ntheir health.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, I think this is a program that has worked, \ncontinues to work, and has had significant improvement in my area in \nCalifornia and, I know, throughout the United States, where we have a \nprogram that actually does work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Minnesota (Ms. McCollum), my ranking member, who has a couple of \ncomments.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the gentleman from \nCalifornia's opposition to this amendment.\n\n  It has been used in my State and States all over to improve air \nquality, and, yes, pollutants have been cut. But as I just pointed out, \nMr. Chairman, we still have a long way to go before we can turn to our \nchildren and say that we did everything we could to make sure that \nrespiratory illness is decreased and that the air quality in this \ncountry is better.\n  So I strongly oppose this amendment, and I thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia for his opposition to it as well.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have one point because asthma has been brought up.\n  When I was chairman of the Environment Committee a number of years \nago, we had done significant studies on the increase in asthma. The \ngentleman is correct on income levels.\n  The lower income folks are suffering from asthma at greater numbers \nprimarily because of indoor pollution. One of the reasons, if we can \nget into the specifics of why that has occurred, is because we have \ncarpets now and drapes and we don't use linoleum and so forth that we \nused to have, and so we have the growth of indoor air pollution, and \nkids don't get outside as much as they used to.\n  So I think we sometimes blame other factors for asthma, and sometimes \nthe other factors are more to blame. But this program, DERA, is a \nprogram that works, continues to work; and I know it has in my area, \nand I know it has in other areas throughout the United States.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, I oppose this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would just like to again point out that it was a \nstudy from the University of California, Los Angeles that pointed out \nthat children from low-income households suffer disproportionately from \nasthma, and as we continue to overregulate our economy and reduce the \neconomic opportunities for people, we are going to continue to see \nthese high rates of respiratory illnesses.\n  My final point is that we are not eliminating this clean diesel \nprogram. We are eliminating one program out of 14.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment, \nand I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Palmer\n\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Environmental Protection Agency to carry out \n     the powers granted under section 3063 of title 18, United \n     States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Environmental Protection Agency spends more than \n$45 million a year to fund a criminal enforcement division that employs \nalmost 200 armed Federal agents. These agents have been involved in a \nnumber of troubling raids in Alaska, Idaho, Wyoming, Montana, \nMassachusetts, North Carolina, and in my own State of Alabama.\n  In Alaska, EPA agents wearing flak jackets and carrying M-16s showed \nup to review paperwork at a family-owned mining operation. In North \nCarolina, armed EPA agents visited Larry Keller after he sent an email \nto the regional administrator. In my home State of Alabama, armed EPA \nagents took over two waste treatment facilities in Dothan, Alabama. \nThese agents were posted at each entrance to the plant and recorded \nidentification information of all those going in and going out.\n  Mr. Chairman, more than 70 Federal departments now employ armed \npersonnel, most of which most Americans would never associate with law \nenforcement. These agencies include the EPA, the National Oceanic and \nAtmospheric Administration, the Federal Reserve Board, and the National \nInstitutes of Health.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment would prohibit funding for these \nactivities at EPA. I urge my colleagues to support it, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I understand that we have taken a lot of shots at the \nEPA for their overreach, and I am one of them; however, this amendment \nreaches just a little too far. We may not always agree on where it is \nappropriate to draw the line on environmental laws and regulations. \nSome think standards are too stringent; others will say they are not \ntough enough. That is a fair policy debate, and we have it.\n  Back in 1968 when the Environmental Protection Agency was created, we \nhad rivers that would light on fire. We had air that was so thick, back \nwhen I played football, you couldn't see the other goalposts on the \nother end of the football field. So we have made a lot of gains.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  At the same time, as it has been discussed, I think the EPA has gone \nway too far. We get to the point where we start regulating smaller and \nsmaller\n\n[[Page H4943]]\n\nnumbers and making it very difficult; for instance, when we start \ntalking about 70 parts per billion versus 60 parts per billion, we have \ngone a long ways.\n  However, we do know that no matter where the line is ultimately \ndrawn, there are individuals out there that are willingly and knowingly \ntrying to find ways around the law. As such, EPA needs to have the \nability to look into criminal activity, whether it is illegal dumping \nof waste, which unfortunately happens; negligent dumping of toxics or \noil, which unfortunately happens; and the illegal transportation or \nimportation of products from other countries by those who would choose \nto ignore U.S. law.\n  We can debate the laws and what is appropriate, but we can't give \ncriminals a free pass to ignore the law or the laws that are on the \nbooks.\n  Again, I'm sorry. I must oppose the amendment and strongly urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, with all due respect to my colleague from \nCalifornia, no one is in favor of allowing criminals to commit crimes \nat any level of the Federal Government or any part of the country.\n  I do think it should be troubling to every Member of this body that \nwe have gone over the line in regard to becoming what could be viewed \nas a police state.\n  In regard to the raid on the Dothan wastewater treatment facility, \nthat is a city facility; that is the Federal Government sending armed \nagents in full body armor with weapons to a municipal facility. I would \nbeg the question: What was the threat assessment?\n  This is going on in other parts of the country as well, and I think \nwe have a responsibility to draw a line where law enforcement is \ninvolved. If there is a threat assessment that would indicate the need \nto have armed officers assist the EPA in an investigation or a raid, \nthere is ample law enforcement available to do that.\n  In that regard, I think this is an area where the EPA has overreached \nin respect to their responsibilities as regulators of the environment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, this is an important debate. I recognize \nthat we have had Federal agencies that have had overreach and have done \nthings that go beyond their training and possibly should be done by \nother agencies. I won't disagree with that; but doing this in an \nappropriation bill is not the right place to do this.\n  The authorizers should have this debate, and we shouldn't be making \nthese determinations with an appropriations bill which just broadly \nstates that we are going to get rid of a whole swath of law \nenforcement, whether they are good or bad. It doesn't determine that \nbecause we can't do that in this type of legislative process.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. \nMcCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, if I may inquire how much time is remaining \nso I don't consume all the gentleman's time?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California has 45 seconds \nremaining.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chairman, I will just be short and sweet. I support \nthe gentleman from California's strong objection to this amendment and \nwould encourage people not to vote for it.\n  Let me conclude with this: an EPA law enforcement official deserves \nthe right to come home to their families safe at night, and so they \nshould have the tools that they need in order to do that.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Alabama has 2\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentlewoman from \nMinnesota's response. I, too, agree that every Federal official \ndeserves to be able to go home safe and sound to their family.\n  That, though, does not address the specific issue here in regard to \nwhat is going on with the EPA. If there is a need for armed \nintervention with a business or, in this case, with a municipality, \nthere should be a clear threat assessment. There isn't any. There was \nno reason for anyone to think that they needed to go in, in full body \narmor, with weapons drawn.\n  I think that that is part of what is going on here that a lot of \nAmerican citizens are concerned about, is the overreach of the \ngovernment and particularly in regard to 70 Federal agencies having \narmed agents in their employment.\n  I agree with the gentleman from California; this needs to be a \nbroader discussion. In that regard, I think we should have that.\n  In respect to my amendment, I think we need to divert this funding \naway from this armed agency that the EPA is deploying, I think, without \nproper course.\n  In that regard, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nRodney Davis of Illinois) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, \nActing Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the \nUnion, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the \nbill (H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4943-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4943]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 6, 21ST \n                           CENTURY CURES ACT\n\n  Mr. BURGESS, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged \nreport (Rept.

When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \na request for a recorded vote on an amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Alabama (Mr. Palmer) had been postponed, and the bill had been \nread through page 132, line 24.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Rogers for his \nleadership and support. Under his guidance, the Appropriations \nCommittee is again setting the standard for getting things done in the \nHouse. This is the seventh of the appropriation bills that have come to \nthe floor that we, hopefully, will be able to pass tomorrow.\n  I also want to thank my good friend and Ranking Member McCollum for\n\n[[Page H4944]]\n\nher partnership and work on this bill. Finally, I want to thank each of \nour committee members for their efforts and their collegiality. It \ncontinues to be the hallmark of our subcommittee's deliberations.\n  Even though we may have differences of opinion within this bill, I \ngreatly appreciate the members' constructive contributions, and I mean \nthat sincerely. The committee has made some very difficult choices in \npreparing this bill.\n  As reported by the Appropriations Committee, the fiscal year 2016 \nInterior Appropriations bill is funded at $30.17 billion, which is $246 \nmillion below the fiscal year 2015 enacted level and $3 billion below \nthe budget request. We have made a sincere effort to prioritize the \nneeds within our 302(b) allocation.\n  I would like to point out some of the highlights of the bill. Again, \nthis year, the committee has provided robust wildland fire funding, \nfire suppression accounts. The Department of the Interior and Forest \nService are fully funded at the 10-year average level. The hazardous \nfuel program was increased by $75 million to $526 million in fiscal \nyear 2015 enacted, and that increase has been maintained in this bill.\n  The bill also continues critical investments in Indian Country, a \nnonpartisan priority of this committee. Building upon the bipartisan \nwork, former subcommittee chairman Mike Simpson, Jim Moran, Norm Dicks, \nand, certainly, my friend Ms. McCollum, the bill continues to make \ninvestments in education, public safety, and health programs in Indian \nCountry.\n  Overall funding for the Indian Health Service has increased by $145 \nmillion or 3 percent, while funding for the Bureau of Indian Affairs \nand Bureau of Indian Education is increased by $165 million or 6 \npercent from fiscal year 2015 levels, the largest percentage increase \nin this bill.\n  The bill provides full funding for fiscal year 2016 for payments in \nlieu of taxes, or the PILT program. PILT payments are made to 49 of the \n50 States, as well as the District of Columbia, Guam, the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, and the commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n  The bill provides $2.7 billion for the National Park Service, \nincluded more than $60 million in new funding relating to the \ncentennial of the National Park Service.\n  We have also addressed a number of priorities within the Fish and \nWildlife Service accounts. The bill funds popular cost-shared grant \nprograms above fiscal year 2015 enacted levels. It also provides for \nadditional funds to combat international wildlife trafficking, protects \nfish hatcheries from cuts and closures, continues funding to fight \ninvasive species, and reduces the backlog of species that are recovered \nbut not yet delisted.\n  The bill provides $248 million for the land and water conservation \nfund, programs that enjoy broad bipartisan support. Some Members would \nprefer more funding; others would prefer less funding for LWCF. We have \nattempted to forge a middle ground that begins to return an emphasis of \nthe LWCF to its original intent of recreation in the States and local \nacquisitions.\n  Overall, funding for EPA was reduced by $718 million or 9 percent \nfrom fiscal year 2015 enacted levels.\n  Members of the Great Lakes region will be pleased to know that the \nGreat Lakes restoration initiative is maintained at fiscal year 2015 \nenacted level of $300 million. Rural water technical assistance grants \nand many categorical grants, including radon grants, are level funded \nat the fiscal year 2015 enacted level.\n  Again, this year, there is a great deal of concern over a number of \nregulatory actions being pursued by EPA, which we have discussed over \nthe last day and the absence of legislation without clear congressional \ndirection.\n  For this reason, the bill includes a number of provisions to stop \nunnecessary and damaging regulatory overreach by the agency.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  I would like to address the Endangered Species Act. We have had a \nnumber of amendments over the last day about this subject. Certainly, \nthis committee has no interest in interfering with science or in \nletting any species go extinct, but we are concerned about Federal \nregulatory actions lacking in basic fairness and common sense. The \nprovisions in this bill address problems created by the ESA--not by \nscience but by court orders--that drain limited agency resources and \nforce departments to cut corners to meet arbitrary deadlines.\n  Nowhere is this more evident than with the sage-grouse. States are \nrightfully concerned that a listing or unnecessary restricted Federal \nland use plans will jeopardize existing conservation partnerships with \nStates and private landowners. These partnerships are necessary to save \nboth sagebrush ecosystems and local economies. So long as sage-grouse \nare not under imminent threat of extinction, cooperative conservation \nmust be given a chance to work.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, as I mentioned, so long as sage-grouse are \nnot under imminent threat of extinction, cooperative conservation must \nbe given a chance to work. That is why this bill maintains a 1-year \ndelay in any decision to list the sage-grouse along with full funding \nto implement conservation efforts.\n  House consideration of this bill is the next step in a long \nlegislative process. I hope, over the coming months, we will come \ntogether, as we do each year, to find common ground. In that spirit, I \nlook forward to continuing to work with Ms. McCollum and Members of the \nHouse on both sides of the aisle. As this bill moves forward, \nhopefully, the Senate will act on a bill soon, and we will be able to \nget back to regular order, which is, I think, the hope for both sides.\n  In closing, I want to thank the staffs on both sides for their hard \nwork on this bill. On the minority side, I would like to thank Rick \nHealy, Rita Culp, Joe Carlile, as well as Rebecca Taylor. They played \nan integral role in the process, and their efforts are very much \nappreciated. On the majority side, I would like to thank subcommittee \nstaff Kristin Richmond, Jackie Kilroy, Betsy Bina, Jason Gray, Darren \nBenjamin, and Dave LesStrang. On my personal staff, I would also like \nto thank Ian Foley, Rebecca Keightley, Alexandra Berenter, and Tricia \nEvans for their great work.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a good bill, and I have enjoyed the debate over \nthe last couple of days.\n  One thing I also want to talk about under my 5 minutes is on the \nwildfire and hazardous fuel management program. It was mentioned \nearlier in the debate that we are attempting to work out an agreement \non both sides so that we can move Mr. Simpson's language forward in his \nhazardous wildfire bill, H.R. 167. We are looking for cosponsors of the \nbill, and we hope to get more support for that bill as we move this \nprocess forward.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we did fund the bill to the 10-year average, \nbut this is still not going to be sufficient if we have the significant \nwildfire year that we expect. A catastrophic fire can literally burn \nthrough any amounts of money that we may have set aside, and it causes \ndisruptions within the Department of the Interior and the Department of \nForestry in how they manage those accounts, which we also discussed, \nwhich is not good management on our part. So I would hope we can move \nahead with Mr. Simpson's bill as quickly as possible.\n  We also discussed the Endangered Species Act, and we continue to talk \nabout the States and the difficulties that they are having in working \nwith the Fish and Wildlife Service and with other agencies in trying to \nwork out their State plans that deal with these significant issues. As \nwe look at our sage-grouse strategy, we have 11 States involved in this \nprogram. We are doing everything we can to have a cooperative program \nwith private landowners, the State land, and the Federal land to make \nsure that we continue to have sage-grouse. We want to make sure that \nthe sage-grouse persists, and that is why we funded both the BLM and \nthe Fish and Wildlife Service to the requested amounts in order to make \nsure that we have the resources available to do that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney \nDavis).\n\n[[Page H4945]]\n\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I want to congratulate \nthe chairman of the subcommittee, who has done a yeoman's job of \nshepherding this appropriations bill through this House.\n  I would like to thank the ranking member, Ms. McCollum, for her \nefforts.\n  I sat in that chair last night where you are, Mr. Chairman, and \npresided over many different amendments. There was much discussion on a \nwide variety of issues, but it is what we came here to do in this \ninstitution--to debate the issues and to work in a process that I call \nour constitutional appropriations process. If we are to regain the \npower of the purse here in the House, we ought to be able to work \nthrough the appropriations process that so many hard-working colleagues \nof mine, like Chairman Calvert, have put so much effort into.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney \nDavis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, this is an opportunity \nfor us to begin the process, once again, of prioritizing how Washington \nspends money, which I remember not too long ago was the way Washington \nspent money, Mr. Chairman, when Washington was not nearly as broken. We \nhave an opportunity to come here to the floor to debate the issues and \nto get an up-or-down vote. When our amendments may not pass, that \ndoesn't mean that we shouldn't regain the power that Congress has been \ngiven in our Constitution, and that is by supporting great bills like \nthis.\n  I congratulate the chairman. I look forward to supporting his bill. I \nhad a great time in presiding over the debate yesterday, and I look \nforward to continuing to work with the chairman in the future.\n  Mr. CALVERT. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, next week, we will be having other bills in front of \nus. We are looking forward to having the Financial Services bill on the \nfloor next week, and I believe we will have other appropriations bills \nfor the balance of the month. As we get back to regular order, we want \nto have all 12 bills brought to the floor and debated. The chairman has \ndone a great job of moving this committee back to its historic \nimportance in this institution, and we appreciate your continued \nsupport in that process.\n  As I mentioned on the Forest Service funding allocations, we are \ncontinuing to work to make sure that moneys are available to fund \nForest Service research and development and to make sure that the \nanalysis and inventory program continues to be funded. The forests, we \nrecognize, are a renewable resource. Domestically produced timber \nsupports local communities and the U.S. industry, especially in the \nWest. It also helps reduce fuel loads in our national forests. This is \ngreatly needed, especially now, because these fires are burning hotter, \nfire seasons are growing longer, and more communities are at risk.\n\n  Our forests need to be managed, Mr. Chairman. The Forest Service \nestimates that up to 2 million acres of land need to be actively \nmanaged. In the Rocky Mountains alone, 45 million acres have been \naffected by the bark beetle. We have seen results of the bark beetle \nback in my area of southern California where thousands of acres have \nbeen devastated by this beetle that attacks weakened trees, which \ncertainly exposes a problem to wildfire conditions. Once those \nwildfires start, then those fires quickly become catastrophic as we \nhave seen just recently in a fire in the San Bernardino National \nForest.\n  We were fortunate that the 2014 fire season was well below the normal \nwith just 87 percent of the 10-year average. We are praying that that \nis going to occur in the 2015 fire season, but we can't be sure. Most \npeople believe that that is not going to occur and that, because of the \ndrought, especially in the West, we could have catastrophic conditions \nand that we could have wildfires that can certainly grow out of \ncontrol.\n  Mr. Chairman, 2 percent of the wildfires cost more money than the \nother 98 percent, so that is why we need to continue to invest \nresources wisely and to make sure that we get rid of hazardous \nmaterials, that we manage our forests properly in order for us not to \nhave these catastrophic fires. These figures are combined with the fact \nthat California, my home State, suffers through this exceptional \ndrought. Other parts of the country, including Minnesota, have the \npotential for above normal wildfire activity in the next few months, \nand that is extremely, extremely worrisome.\n  I would like to talk a little bit about the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I know we would have liked to have appropriated more \nmoney for the Land and Water Conservation Fund, but we are acting under \nthese allocations, and we were just restricted on what we could do. Yet \nwhat we wanted to do was to focus back to the original intent of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund, which was recreation and State and \nlocal acquisitions. In this bill, the administration is directed to \nprioritize limited Federal acquisitions in which opportunities for \nrecreation and local and State congressional support are the strongest.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois). The gentleman from \nCalifornia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, we extend the authority of recreation fee \nprograms; we prohibit the Interior from administratively creating new \nwilderness areas; we provide the full funding of $452 million for \npayments in lieu of taxes, which is extremely important to almost every \nState in the Union; and we increase the forest products account by $16 \nmillion so that the Forest Service can increase timber harvests.\n  We lost a lot of the timber operations in the West after the issue \nwith the spotted owl. After that 20-year experiment that most people \nrealize was a failure, we now have forests that have become overgrown, \nespecially in the West, and we have poorly managed some of those \nforests. We need to go back and thin those forests out. There are two \nways to thin a forest, Mr. Chairman. Either God does it, or we allow \nfor good timbering operations that are done in a new scientific manner \nthat help clear out that forest in a healthy way, that bring back \nanimals that sometimes have abandoned the region because of \novergrowth--operations that make for a healthier forest in the long \nrun.\n  These are good goals. We want to work with the Department of Forestry \nto make sure that they continue to make progress on this, and we will \ncontinue to do that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Calvert\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.__. Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, \n     none of the funds made available by this Act may be used to \n     prohibit the display of the flag of the United States or the \n     POW/MIA flag, or the decoration of graves with flags in the \n     National Park Service national cemeteries as provided in \n     National Park Service Director's Order No. 61 or to \n     contravene the National Park Service memorandum dated June \n     24, 2015, with the subject line containing the words \n     ``Immediate Action Required, No Reply Needed'' with respect \n     to sales items.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 333, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. This amendment will codify existing National Park \nService policy and directives with regard to the declaration of \ncemeteries and concession sales. I urge adoption of my amendment.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n\n[[Page H4946]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to this \namendment. I am actually quite surprised that we find ourselves here \ntonight attempting to overturn the National Park Service recent policy \nchanges to stop allowing the Confederate flag to be displayed or sold \nin national parks.\n  Mr. Chair, just yesterday, this House passed amendment after \namendment supporting the removal of the symbol of racism from our \nnational parks, which are visited every day by Americans and foreign \nvisitors of every race.\n  We have read about the divisive tactics happening in the South \nCarolina statehouse as they debate the removal of the Confederate flag \nafter the murder of nine Black parishioners.\n  I never thought that the U.S. House of Representatives would join \nthose who would want to see this flag flown by passing an amendment to \nensure the continuing flying of the Confederate flag. I strongly urge \nevery Member to stand with the citizens of all races and to remove this \nsymbol of hatred from our National Park Service.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I want to restate: On June 25 when National \nPark Service Director Jon Jarvis requested that Confederate flag sales \nbe removed from national park bookstores and gift shops, he also \nfollowed a decision by several large national retailers--Walmart, \nAmazon, and Sears--to stop selling items with Confederate flags on \nthem, and I agreed with these decisions. I commend those for their \nprompt action.\n  While in certain and very limited circumstances, it might be \nappropriate in a national park to display the image of the Confederate \nflag in a historical context--and I say that as a social studies \nteacher--the general display or sale of Confederate flag items is \ninappropriate and divisive. I support limiting their use.\n  I strongly oppose this amendment, which is an attempt to negate \namendments which were approved yesterday without any opposition to \nlimit the displaying of the Confederate flag, and so we should make \nsure that we uphold what this House stood for yesterday, which is to \nsay no to racism, which is to say no to hate speech.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Calvert).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Minnesota is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, as we prepare to finish consideration of \nH.R. 2822, I want to take this opportunity to congratulate my \nsubcommittee chairman, Ken Calvert, for getting this bill to this \npoint.\n  It has not been an easy process, as we just realized a few moments \nago. We have had to consider nearly twice as many amendments as any \nother appropriations bill taken up in the House this year.\n  While I have not agreed with a considerable number of the amendments \nthat have been made to the bill, I do appreciate that the chairman and \nI have been able to disagree when necessary without ever being \ndisagreeable. My working relationship with Chairman Calvert has been \nfirst rate. I appreciate the hard work and effort he has put into the \nbill.\n  Let me also express my sincere thanks to the committee staff on both \nsides of the aisle, as well as the personal staff in both of our \nrespective offices for their work on the bill. They put in long hours \nto smooth a way for consideration of this bill, and I appreciate their \nefforts.\n  Once again, I want to say that we have had a good working \nrelationship, Mr. Chair, but I cannot hide my surprise and my outrage \nthat we find ourselves here tonight attempting to overturn the National \nPark Service recent policy change to stop allowing the Confederate flag \nto be displayed or sold at our national parks.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I just want to say that I enjoyed and \ncontinue to enjoy working with the gentlewoman as we move this process \nforward and appreciate her courtesy and kindness.\n  As I say, we will continue to work at this process as we move ahead.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Department of the Interior, \n     Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016''.\n\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nPoliquin) having assumed the chair, Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois, \nActing Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the \nUnion, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the \nbill (H.R. 2822) making appropriations for the Department of the \nInterior, environment, and related agencies for the fiscal year ending \nSeptember 30, 2016, and for other purposes, had come to no resolution \nthereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4946-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4946]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  AUTHORIZING THE CLERK TO MAKE CORRECTIONS IN ENGROSSMENT OF H.R. 5, \n                          STUDENT SUCCESS ACT\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida.

I ask unanimous consent, Mr. Speaker, that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of our Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank all of my \ncolleagues who are here tonight at this late hour to talk about the \nweak negotiations that are taking place in Vienna on the nuclear deal \nwith Iran.\n  We have a number of distinguished speakers tonight who will address \nthis looming topic that is of great urgency.\n  Let me begin by yielding to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Trusting that Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terrorism, \nhas suddenly had a change of heart in its decades-long quest to obtain \na nuclear weapon is just simply naive at best.\n  Legislation that was signed into law in May would allow Congress to \nreview and vote on any deal that the administration makes with Iran. \nThose I represent believe Congress should have the final say on any \ndeal, and I couldn't agree more.\n  America's national security, as well as global security, will be \njeopardized if the administration gets this wrong. We must ensure it \ndoesn't. The stakes are simply too high.\n  If Iran is actually serious about reengaging with the global \ncommunity,\n\n[[Page H4947]]\n\nthey cannot continue to hold American citizens as political prisoners \nor harass and provoke U.S. Navy ships in international waters.\n  Iran should stop provoking direct military confrontation, immediately \nrelease all detained U.S. citizens, and provide any information it \npossesses regarding any U.S. citizens that have disappeared within its \nborders.\n  The fact that the Iranian regime won't even do these basic actions \nindicates to me that counting on them to honor commitments they make \naround a negotiating table can't be taken seriously.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Johnson for his comments. I \nthink he highlighted the basic problems that we have in dealing with a \nrogue regime like Iran that cannot be trusted, that has not been \ndealing with us in a straight manner. I thank the gentleman very much \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Rodney Davis) to address this threat as well.\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my \nconcerns over the potential deal regarding Iran's nuclear program, and \nI stand here thanking my colleague from the great State of Florida for \nputting this Special Order together on such a very important and timely \nissue.\n  I want to read a quote:\n\n       They will freeze and then dismantle their nuclear program. \n     Our other allies will be better protected. The entire world \n     will be safer as we slow the spread of nuclear weapons. The \n     United States and international inspectors will carefully \n     monitor them to make sure it keeps its commitments.\n\n  Sound familiar, Mr. Speaker? That is what President Clinton told the \nAmerican people about the North Korean nuclear deal in 1994. Today, \nNorth Korea has anywhere from 10 to 20 nuclear weapons in their \narsenal, and that number is expected to grow to 50 in the next 5 years.\n  Now, we are hearing this same type of posturing from this \nadministration about the Iran negotiations. The United States seems \ndestined to repeat history, unwilling to hold their ground, and \ngranting Iran extension after extension and concession after \nconcession.\n  As a strong supporter of increasing sanctions against Iran, which \nbrought Iran to the negotiating table in the first place, it is common \nsense that additional sanctions could even put more pressure on them \nwhen they are already hurting from the low price of their most prized \ncommodity, oil.\n  Nobody believes Iran when they say their nuclear infrastructure is in \nplace for peaceful purposes. If that were the case, they would have no \nneed to enrich uranium past 3.5 percent. Iran has a record filled with \nlies, deceit, sponsored terrorism, human rights violations, and the \nlist goes on and on.\n  Just as North Korea couldn't be trusted two decades ago, neither \nshould Iran today. Mr. Speaker, a nuclear Iran is not only a grave \ndanger to American interests, but to Israel--our strongest ally in the \nMiddle East--and our many allies throughout the world.\n  Of course, the world would be a much safer place if Iran were to \nneutralize their nuclear production facilities, if they would allow \ninspections at anytime, if they would disclose all military \nimplications of their nuclear program, or if Iran were to demonstrate a \nbetter record on human rights.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Unfortunately, these are just what-ifs that have failed to happen \ntoday and I am afraid will never happen under this proposed deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a bad deal.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Davis, I quite agree with you.\n  The more we know about this deal, Mr. Speaker, the more we know it is \na weak, dangerous, bad deal.\n  Thank you, Mr. Davis, for sharing your insight with us.\n  I yield to Mr. Lance of New Jersey, who has long been speaking about \nthe dangers of a nuclear Iran.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate the distinguished gentlewoman \nfrom Florida for her magnificent service regarding the foreign policy \nof this country and her continued expertise that is of benefit to the \nentire Nation.\n  In the coming days, the American people and those of us in Congress \nwill be able to scrutinize an anticipated agreement between Iran and \nthe P5+1 countries and Iran's nuclear weapons program.\n  Congress will debate and consider the administration's proposal, and \nI will be looking to ensure that any agreement achieves the paramount \ngoal that Iran will never get nuclear weapons.\n  A nuclear Iran would fundamentally change the international dynamic \nand put the United States and our allies, including Israel, in extreme \nperil. The balance of power in the world would slip away from those who \nhave given blood and treasure in the fight for freedom and justice, \nwhile rewarding the perpetrators of some of the most heinous crimes \nagainst humanity.\n  The principle of peace through deterrence would be compromised and \nthe Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty would be a footnote in history as \nrival and regional powers race to acquire their own nuclear weapons. A \nnuclear arms race will be yet another element of unpredictability in \nthe world's most volatile region.\n  I do not oppose any agreement; I oppose a bad agreement. Sanctions \nbrought Iran to the table, and sanctions will keep Iran there. Any deal \nthat needlessly surrenders that valuable leverage in the name of taking \nIran's word is a bad agreement. There is simply not the trust that \nstate sponsors of terror will suddenly and uncharacteristically prove \nto be honest.\n  As Ronald Reagan famously said, ``Trust, but verify.'' That was true \nthen; it is as true now as then. It is certainly true regarding Iran.\n  A successful nuclear agreement must include tangible Iranian \nconcessions. Steps to dismantle its nuclear infrastructure, a \ncommitment to a robust inspections regime, and a cease to its dubious \nterror-related activities must be included in any agreement.\n  The entire world will be watching, not only the 315 million people of \nthis country, but certainly the people in the Middle East, which is \nextremely dangerous.\n  This matter of great consequence will have far-reaching \nramifications, and certainly, I hope that the President, the Secretary \nof State, and the administration will heed the bipartisan concerns that \nexist here in Congress.\n  The President reluctantly signed the legislation that reached his \ndesk. That was an expression of the will of the American people through \nelected Representatives here and in the other House of Congress, \noverwhelming in its nature; and certainly, I hope that the President \nand Secretary of State and the administration will recognize that the \nAmerican people are deeply concerned about what appears to be the \nparameters of an agreement.\n  There is still time to reach a better agreement. Let me repeat, no \nagreement is superior to a bad agreement, as Prime Minister Netanyahu \nstated in this Chamber this spring.\n  I hope that Iran will come meaningfully to the table. I hope that \nIran will cease its terrorist activities across the globe. I hope Iran \nwill recognize that, if it were to achieve nuclear weapons, it would be \nthe beginning of a situation with unintended consequences for the \nMiddle East, the most dangerous part of the world; terrible \nconsequences for our friend and ally, a country that believes in \ndemocracy, Israel; terrible consequences for other Arab nations, \nincluding Saudi Arabia, Egypt, and places beyond that; and that we want \nto live in peace with the Iranian people.\n  The Iranian people are a great people, a talented people, a well-\neducated people; and certainly, I hope that the people of Iran \nrecognize that it is not in their best interest that their leaders \ndevelop nuclear weapons.\n  Again, I commend with every breath I take the superb work of the \ngentlewoman from Florida. I am pleased to be able to join with her and \nwith others this evening to caution that we must ensure a strong \nagreement and, if that is not possible, then no agreement at all.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Lance. May it be so; from \nyour words to God's ears, may we get this strong deal that can truly be \nverified.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo), my \ncolleague, a man with whom I have had the honor of talking about this \nissue, the danger that a nuclear Iran imposes for the stability of the \nworld, not just\n\n[[Page H4948]]\n\nfor Israel, not just for the neighborhood, and not just for the United \nStates.\n  Thank you, Mr. Curbelo, for your leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want to begin by thanking my \ncolleague for her steadfast leadership on this issue, but really on all \nissues having to do with foreign relations in this Chamber for so many \nyears. She has set the example and a very high bar for all of us who \nserve in this Chamber.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start by reiterating just how serious the \nsecurity threat Iran is to the United States and to our allies.\n  As my colleagues have expressed here, Iran can never attain nuclear \ncapabilities. Any deal reached must ensure that the Iranian regime \ncompletely abandons its nuclear ambitions and dismantles its nuclear \ninfrastructure.\n  It is absolutely critical that the Obama administration be unyielding \nwhen dealing with Iran. Additional concessions are simply not an \noption. A weak deal that gives the regime an opening to obtain nuclear \nweapons down the road is not good for the United States or its allies, \nespecially Israel. It isn't good for the entire world.\n  Even while nuclear negotiations between the P5+1 and Iran took place, \nSupreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei openly supported the destruction of \nIsrael and supported Hamas' attacks against Israel from Gaza. He also \nboasted Iranian technology was being used by Hamas to attack Israel and \nopenly called for all Palestinians in the West Bank to join Hamas in \nGaza in an armed rebellion against Israel, promising to arm those who \nparticipated.\n  We cannot continue to view Iran's nuclear program as existing in a \nvacuum. It would be irresponsible to ignore the regime's continued \nsupport for terrorism, its pursuit of ballistic missiles, and its \nfailure to comply with the International Atomic Energy Agency.\n  Moving forward, several things must be present in an acceptable deal, \nincluding a robust inspection regime and the resolution of issues of \npast and present concern. Only then could a deal even begin to be \nconsidered as acceptable.\n  Snapback sanctions relief could be difficult to implement and is not \nin the best interests of the United States. We must protect the \nsanctions infrastructure that this body put in place rather than rely \non reactive tactics if the Iranian regime does not comply with the \nterms of the agreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to an agreement with Iran, we need to ask \nourselves: Does this agreement prevent Iran from achieving nuclear \ncapabilities and keep the United States and its allies safe? Anything \nother than that is totally unacceptable.\n  The central question here, Mr. Speaker, is: What kind of a world do \nwe want to live in? What kind of a world do we want for our children, \nfor our grandchildren, for our families?\n  A world in which the most radical terrorist regime acquires nuclear \nweapons--whether it is in 2 years, in 5 years, in 10 years, or in 15 \nyears--is totally unacceptable. This is a government that, again, has \npledged to annihilate the only democracy in the Middle East, our best \nally in the world, the country that stands with us no matter what, our \nfriends in Israel.\n  Some in this administration have unjustly criticized Prime Minister \nNetanyahu. For what? It is for simply wanting his country to survive \nand his people to live in peace and security.\n  This is the same government that when the Ayatollah sent their \nrepresentative--then Mr. Ahmadinejad--to Cuba in 2007, he pledged that, \ntogether with Cuba's dictators and the rest of their rogue allies \nthroughout the world, they would bring the United States to its knees. \nI know my colleague recalls that.\n  What kind of a world do we want to live in? It is still not too late \nto walk away from this table and to tell the mullahs that they will \nnever acquire nuclear weapons as long as the United States is the \ngreatest superpower in the world and a beacon for democracy, for peace, \nand for opportunity for all people.\n  I, once again, thank my colleague for this special opportunity to \nhighlight an issue that is of vital importance for the entire Nation \nand for the entire world.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Curbelo, you certainly have been a leader in \nthis fight.\n  It is interesting that you should bring up the dangerous clown, \nKhamenei, because he has been replaced by an equally murderous, \nsadistic thug, Rouhani; but now, the international community likes to \ncall him the ``moderate'' leader, where they have had more executions \nin Iran under the so-called moderate then ever.\n  The ``Death to America,'' ``Death to Israel'' chants continue, just \nas they continued during Ahmadinejad's time. Whether it is Ahmadinejad, \nwhether it is a moderate Rouhani, it is a Supreme Leader who calls the \nshots.\n  Nothing in Iran, sadly, has changed. They are calling for the \ndestruction of our ally, and they are calling for destruction of this \ngreat country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins).\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Ms. Ros-\nLehtinen, who was chairwoman when I was on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. She has stepped up and always been a voice, especially in \nthis area. I also want to thank Mr. Curbelo and also Mr. Davis.\n  For a moment, I want to just stop here, and let's put some things in \nperspective. It has been said over and over--but we are going to talk \nabout this--a bad deal is worse than no deal. I am going to say it \nagain. A bad deal is worse than no deal.\n  A deal the U.S. and the rest of the international community can \naccept should be one in which Iran is no longer a nuclear threat. At \nwhat point did we forget this, Mr. President? At what point did we lay \ndown and decide that a nuclear Iran, if it is 20 years from now, is \nbetter than what a nuclear Iran is now? Mr. President, you have got to \nlisten to what you are saying.\n  Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu explained to President Obama that \nthe Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action ``threatens the survival of the \nState of Israel.'' It threatens the survival of the State of Israel.\n  I believe that Congress should not be party to any agreement that \nfails to protect the vital interest of Israel and other allies in the \nregion. That is why I voted ``no'' on the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review \nAct.\n  I am not in disagreement with Congress providing oversight of a final \ncomprehensive deal, but a horrible deal isn't something Congress should \neven have to consider.\n  I have previously stated and will say again that I have always made \nthe security of our strongest ally in the Middle East a priority and \nwill not support any deal that allows Iran the opportunity to develop a \nnuclear weapon.\n  Though a final deal has not been yet announced, we know, based off \nthe details of the JCPOA announced in April, of the potential for a bad \ndeal. Under the framework announced in April, Iran will be able to \nmaintain over 6,000 centrifuges they possess. Of the 6,000 centrifuges, \n5,000 of those will continue to enrich uranium.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Five thousand, what part of not having a nuclear Iran are we kidding \nourselves here with?\n  And then his wonderful snap back provisions. I am one of those that \nsaid we shouldn't have a snap back. They should have never gone away in \nthe process.\n  Why are we talking about snap back provisions when this body has \nclearly spoken that the sanctions should stay and, if anything, they \nshould get tighter? But we are now talking about snap back provisions. \nWhat a world we live in.\n  If they don't fulfill their commitment, sanctions will magically snap \nback. When I read that, it just amazes me, Mr. Speaker, that if they \ndon't keep their commitments--why do we believe they are going to keep \nany commitments?\n  This is just an amazing thought to me. It took several years of U.S. \npressuring for our European allies before they started seriously \nenforcing the U.N. Security Council sanctions currently in place.\n  While a U.S. President can unilaterally reinstitute sanctions that \nwere previously waived, the European Union has to receive support from \nall 28 members for reimposition of former sanctions. Think about that. \nThat is something we ought to talk about.\n\n[[Page H4949]]\n\n  A similar scenario could be observed at the U.N. Security Council. A \nunanimous vote by all 15 U.S. Security Council members in the \naffirmative would be needed for sanctions to be put back in place.\n  How many of us in this room tonight, and how many of you who may be \nthinking about this, actually believe that will actually happen? Do you \nbelieve that would? I don't.\n  China and Russia, both permanent members of the U.N. Security \nCouncil, have the most to gain from having unfettered access to Iranian \nmarkets. It has been widely reported that Russia is moving forward with \nthe selling of S-300s, the antiaircraft weapon, to Iran. Such a weapon \nsystem makes the potential for Israeli or American airstrikes against \nIranian nukes just that much more difficult to carry out.\n  Russia, whose own economy is hurting as a result of the sanctions, is \nlooking to diversify its investments in other economies that show \nstrong potential for growth. China is always looking for new sources of \nenergy, and with the elimination of international sanctions, Iran will \nhave the ability to sell more oil on the international market.\n  Then there is the issue of possible military dimensions. To receive \nan accurate picture of Iran's nuclear capabilities, it is imperative to \nknow how close they got to developing or have gotten to developing a \nnuclear weapon. It is only after we can determine if Iran ever \ndeveloped a nuclear warhead or triggering mechanism that the \ninternational community can actually know Iran's breakout time. Iran's \nPMDs must be made known to the international community prior--prior--to \nany permanent sanction relief being instituted.\n  You know, this pending bad deal makes the region and the greater \nnational community worse off.\n  What I have heard in this Chamber tonight is very disturbing. What I \nhave heard from leaders in this administration is even more disturbing. \nThey have willingly determined, in my mind, to throw Israel under the \nbus and, I believe, maybe for a peace prize.\n  Mr. Kerry, maybe you didn't make a mark in the Senate. Mr. Kerry, \nmaybe you didn't make a mark as Secretary of State. Maybe you are \nlooking for a peace prize. Your peace prize should be come home now and \nwalk away from a bad deal. If you want to be recognized in the world \nfor standing up for what is right, then walk away from a bad deal.\n  No one wants Iran to have a nuclear weapon. They are not capable of \nhandling one. They are the biggest suppliers to terrorism around the \nworld. And yet we are talking about talking to a country that says just \nrecently, just in the last 2 days, their leader has said it is now time \nfor us to spout hatred at the Zionists.\n  And we are negotiating with them?\n  They don't want to say Israel has even a right to exist, and we are \nsitting at the table with them? We want to let 5,000 centrifuges keep \nspinning and keep spinning and keep spinning and keep spinning, and we \nare going to negotiate with them?\n  You do not negotiate with unstable people, Mr. Speaker. You negotiate \nwith people who want to live in the bonds of a civil society, in a \ncivil world, and Iran's leadership is not that person.\n  We are fooling ourselves. This administration has become just \ncompletely tunnel-visioned toward legacy. When you have a domestic \nagenda that has been as terrible as this administration, I don't blame \nyou for looking overseas. But your domestic agenda is no comparison to \nthe failure of a foreign policy, when world leaders ask what is \nAmerica's role because they don't even know.\n  Tonight I hope the crescendo of voices in this Chamber reaches across \nthe ocean to Vienna. The last words I would like Secretary Kerry to \nhear before he sits down with the Iranians are ``a bad deal is worse \nthan no deal.''\n  ``Death to America,'' not shouted on the streets here in Washington, \nnot shouted on the streets in New York City or San Francisco or \nAtlanta. It was shouted in the Parliament of Iran just recently, when \nthey said we are not going to allow inspections. And we are sitting \ndown to negotiate with them?\n  ``Death to America''? And we are sitting down negotiating with them \nas if they are reasonable people?\n  Have we lost our focus? Have we lost our vision of being the shining \nlight to the world for freedom and hope, and decided that it is much \nbetter off, maybe for our political world, or maybe our personal \nachievements, to sit down with a government that says Israel should not \neven have the right to exist, and if we could, we would annihilate them \ntomorrow?\n  We are going to continue funding those who have lobbed bombs on \ninnocent men and women in Israel and who will sit down at a negotiating \ntable and say: We are not going to allow you to inspect wherever you \nwant; we are going to keep what we want to keep.\n  And, by the way, even the administration's own belief is we are going \nto keep 5,000 spinning, centrifuges spinning, 5,000 spinning.\n  You know what? Some have said time is Iran's friend. I agree. As long \nas they can keep our Secretary of State at that table, those \ncentrifuges spin. As long as they keep us tied up debating this in this \nadministration, the centrifuges spin. As long as we keep doing this, \nthe centrifuges spin.\n  It is time to put sanctions back in place because they are spinning. \nIt is time to tighten the screws on Iran because those centrifuges are \nspinning. It is time for us not to let up because the centrifuges are \nspinning.\n  And I do not want to see a world in which my children grow up and the \npeople in Israel grow up knowing that Iran has a bomb when they are \nready to take them out in a certain notice.\n  Tonight is important. Tonight is important.\n  Mr. President, I pray that you listen. I don't think you will.\n  Mr. Secretary, maybe you are looking for a peace prize. How about \nwinning a prize in the hearts of the freedom-loving people all across \nthe world and walking away from a bad deal?\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to address their \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you very much, Mr. Collins. I think you laid \nit out in a thoughtful manner. No deal is better than a bad deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her \nleadership on this important issue, your leadership with America's \nforeign policy. I know that my constituents all the way up in New York \nare more secure and free due to your work through the years here in the \nHalls of Congress. I thank you for your leadership.\n  This past weekend we celebrated the Fourth of July, 239 years since \nAmerica declared its independence. What makes America great is what we \nstand for: freedom and liberty.\n  And then there is Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of terror, \na nation overthrowing foreign governments, unjustly imprisoning United \nStates citizens, including a United States Marine.\n  Iran blows up mock U.S. warships, develops ICBMs. They pledge to wipe \nIsrael off the map. And in their streets, in their halls, they are \nchanting, ``Death to America.''\n  And none of what I just described is even part of the negotiations. \nThink about that.\n  The President says the only alternative to whatever deal he presents \nus with is war. I reject that. The deal the President is finalizing may \nactually pave the path to more instability in the Middle East and a \nnuclear arms race triggered in the region.\n  Will the agreement be accurately translated between both languages?\n  If the President presents Americans with a version in English and the \nIranians are interpreting any different terms refuting our \ninterpretation of that agreement in English, then there is no \nagreement. There is no meeting of the minds.\n  Will Iran continue spinning centrifuges, enriching uranium and \nmaintaining any of their nuclear infrastructure?\n  Will weapons inspectors have unfettered access to Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure? Honestly, I doubt it.\n  I believe that we are propping up the wrong regime in Iran.\n  Six years ago, the Green Revolution, millions of Iranians took to the \nstreets protesting after an undemocratic election. The economy in Iran \nwas doing better at that time than it is today. Oil, twice the value as \ntoday.\n\n[[Page H4950]]\n\n  The President said that what was going on in Iran was none of our \nbusiness, and look where we are today.\n  I unapologetically love my country, and I am proud to be an American. \nAs elected officials who took an oath to protect and defend our \nConstitution, we have a responsibility to protect our country.\n  We must fight on behalf of our great Nation, which generations before \nus have fought and sacrificed so much to protect. And that is how we \ncelebrate another 239 years of American exceptionalism.\n  The President, when sitting down at the negotiating table, inherits \nthe goodwill of generations, centuries of men and women who have come \nbefore them that sacrificed so much to make America the greatest Nation \nin the world. When someone says they want to run to be President of the \nUnited States, with that, you inherit all of that goodwill, all of that \nAmerican exceptionalism.\n  And when sitting at the table, you have no business trying to \nequalize yourself with the person you are negotiating with. That isn't \nyour goodwill to expend.\n  It is important for American greatness to grow. And I am concerned \nthat we are on pace to enter into a bad deal with Iran.\n  Here, with the leadership of colleagues like the gentlewoman from \nFlorida, who I am very grateful for putting together this Special Order \ntonight, and other colleagues, like the gentleman from Florida, who \nwill be speaking right after me, there is so much passion amongst my \ncolleagues for wanting to do the right thing to protect our Nation, \nunderstanding that it is a fundamental basic that the United States \nstrengthens our relationships with our allies and treats our enemies \nfor exactly who they are.\n  I used the analogy a couple of weeks ago of playing Texas Hold'em, \nand the President inherits pocket aces every time he sits down at the \ntable. The Iranians may inherit the 7-2 off suit, the worst hand that \nyou could possibly have in poker.\n  The President, for whatever reason, as a negotiating style, will \noffer to switch hands. We saw it in Cuba, where dozens of good-faith \nconcessions were made asking for nothing in return. Why is that?\n  For one, the President isn't a very good negotiator. He still has a \nyear and a half left on his second term in office, and I want him to \nstrengthen his hand. He has it. He inherits it. That is what comes with \nbeing the President of the United States. That is what he signed up \nfor.\n  And what did we sign up for here in the Halls of Congress? To hold \nthis President's feet to the fire if he chooses to sign a bad deal with \nIran.\n  I thank, again, the gentlewoman from Florida for her leadership. I am \nlooking forward to hearing Mr. Yoho and his passionate words to follow.\n  And I would encourage the President and Secretary Kerry, the leaders \nof the Obama administration, to do the right thing. Take a walk, \nstrengthen your hand, and don't sell out America's goodwill.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Thank you so much to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Florida, Dr. Yoho.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my very dear colleague from \nFlorida for bringing this very important topic to light. This is \nsomething the American people need to weigh in on; and this is \nsomething, as you heard the passion tonight, the people talking about \nhow this is not a good deal. This is not a good deal for anybody but \nIran.\n  I would like to do a chronological anthology of Iran's nuclear \nweapons program. If you go back 30 years ago, they were working on \ngaining the technology and the material to develop nuclear weapons.\n  John Bolton, in his book ``Surrender is Not an Option,'' talked about \nthe cat-and-mouse game that Iran had played over the last 30 years of \nsaying, No, we are not developing nuclear weapons; and they wouldn't \nallow the inspectors in.\n  The U.N. had resolutions and sanctions, and eventually, the IAEA \ninspectors--the International Atomic Energy Agency--was allowed to come \nin. They caught Iran redhanded, developing nuclear weapons.\n  They apologized. They said: I am sorry. You are right. We were bad. \nWe are not going to do it again.\n  Then it started over again and then over again and over again. For 30 \nyears, we have been playing the cat-and-mouse game. It hasn't gone \naway. Their mission is to get nuclear weapons.\n  When I look at George Bush, when he put sanctions in the 2000s on \nIran to say enough is enough, the sanctions were in place, and they \nstarted. To President Obama's credit, he tightened them up, and it put \nmore pressure on Iran, and then it brought them to the negotiation \ntable.\n  When you negotiate on a deal--any deal--there should be mutual \nbenefits to both sides. At the end of this, you will see there is no \nbenefit to America, to the Middle East, and to world peace because, \nwhen those negotiations started, as my colleague from New York (Mr. \nZeldin) brought up, there was no negotiation to release our four \nAmerican hostages.\n  If you think that the sanctions were bad enough to put Iran in this \ngreat economic tragedy or pressure that was just crippling Iran and \nthey couldn't do anything and they came to the table to release the \nsanctions so that they could move on, but during that time period--this \nis what the American people need to know--during that time period, Iran \nwas extending their arm and their reach into the Western Hemisphere \nthrough Bolivia, through Venezuela; and they were funding their \nterrorist arm, Hezbollah, that caused two terrorist attacks in \nArgentina in the nineties that was responsible for over 100 deaths and \nover 300 injured people--Iran was doing this at the time when the \nsanctions were on them, and they were supposed to be under this great \neconomic stress--but they were doing that because they were funneling \nmoney through Venezuela and getting money for fuel plus armaments that \nthey were selling. During this time, when we think our sanctions are \nworking, Iran is working against us.\n  I have been here in the House for 2\\1/2\\ years, and I sit on the \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs. During those 2\\1/2\\ years, we have had \nexperts come in, over and over again, telling us about the threat of \nIran creating new clear weapons.\n  Over and over again, they said that Iran would have enough nuclear-\nenriched material to have enough material within 6 months to a year to \nhave five to six atomic bombs. That was over 2 years ago, so one could \nonly reasonably expect that Iran has enough material for five to six \nnuclear bombs.\n  This was backed up by Henry Kissinger and George Shultz in The Wall \nStreet Journal editorial about 3 months ago, that they claim that Iran \nwas about 2\\1/2\\ months to 3 months from having nuclear material.\n  Then we moved down to the negotiation. The negotiation was started--\nif people will go back and research the news--from the administration, \nfrom John Kerry. He said negotiations have started and that the whole \npurpose was Iran cannot and will not be permitted to have a nuclear \nweapon. Now, we are just going to delay them for 10 years.\n  As my colleague from Georgia (Mr. Collins) brought up, the snapback, \nif they break any part of this deal, there is going to be snapback. I \nmean, you have got to be from another planet to think that that is \ngoing to happen because we are going to rely on China and Russia to \nsay: Yes, we are with you.\n  Russia has already sold $800 million worth of antimissile defense \nsystems. In addition, during this period, when Iran had all these tough \nsanctions blocking their economy, Iran has been developing an ICBM \nprogram.\n  An ICBM program stands for an intercontinental ballistic missile \nsystem. That is not for their neighbors. That is for Europe. That is \nfor the United States. It is for people way outside of Iran. They have \ndone this with the economic sanctions.\n  In addition, there is evidence that they have detonated a trigger \ndevice for a nuclear weapon. They have gone through expensive \nremediation, covering up the site, covering up the soil, paving it, and \nnot allowing our inspectors to go in there and inspect that--the IAEA \ninspectors that we are supposed to depend on to prove that what they \nare doing is for peaceful purposes.\n\n[[Page H4951]]\n\n  Then I look at what Iran has done over the years, when we have been \nin the Middle East, with our brave young men and women in the Middle \nEast, fighting for security for this country and for the neighbors in \nthe Middle East. Seventy percent of the wounds to our soldiers have \ncome from IEDs. Ninety percent of those IEDs were created by Iran.\n  Then, as we talked about in this nuclear negotiation, Iran has got to \nbe limited to the amount of centrifuges for their peaceful nuclear \nprogram.\n  Now, get this, for a peaceful nuclear program, you need tens of \nthousands of centrifuges to produce nuclear material to run nuclear \nreactors; yet, in this deal, we are only limiting them to 5,000 \ncentrifuges. You only need a few thousand centrifuges to create nuclear \nweapons. It just doesn't match up.\n  As we talked about, in a negotiation, there should be a mutual \nbenefit. I see no benefit for America.\n  Again, talking to the experts in Foreign Affairs, I asked them this \nquestion: With our negotiation with Iran, where we have given into \neverything and we have got nothing--keep in mind, we are supposedly the \nlone superpower of the world--when you go into a negotiation like this \nand you are operating from a level of weakness and not strength, how \ndoes that affect us around the world community?\n  The experts told me that it has weakened America's standing in the \nworld. It has weakened our negotiation power in the world. It has \nweakened and threatened our security in the Western Hemisphere.\n  I agree with Mr. Collins. I hope the President is listening, but I am \nsure he is not; I hope Mr. Kerry is listening, but I am sure he is not, \nbut I hope this message gets to them--that, if they are going to \nnegotiate for America, they should negotiate from a point of strength, \na point for what is right, not just for our country, but for the Middle \nEast and for the rest of the world because, if America is not strong \nand if we do not stand strong, there is not a secure world.\n  I thank my colleague from Florida for bringing this up because this \nis a debate the American people need to hear. I hope they put pressure \non the people in charge of this and bring this negotiation--as they \nhave said over and over again, a bad deal they will not stand for--this \nis a bad deal, and this is something they need to walk away from.\n\n  We, in the House of Representatives, need to block this in any way \nthat we can. I will not, I shall not, and I cannot support this because \nwhat I see is we are trying to prevent that which we can't, instead of \npreparing for that which will be.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I thank you, Dr. Yoho, and I think you laid out the \nchronology of the long timetable of the deceit that Iran has been \ndealing with in terms of their nuclear program.\n  I thank all of my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, who joined tonight's \nSpecial Order to discuss Iran's nuclear negotiations that are going on \nin Vienna as we speak. After missing deadline after deadline and \nallowing for extension after extension, we are now hearing that these \nnegotiations may be open-ended.\n  It is our job in Congress to conduct proper oversight on any proposed \ndeal and to reject any deal that is not in the best interests of our \nnational security or the security and stability of the entire region.\n  As current law stipulates, if a deal is submitted for congressional \nreview before tomorrow, then Congress only has a 30-day review period. \nHowever, if this deal is submitted after tomorrow, we will have 60 days \nto review the terms of the agreement.\n  Why should the administration fear an additional 30 days of review? \nIf this deal is so good, as the administration keeps telling us, then \nit should be strong enough to stand up to congressional review and \ncongressional scrutiny; but the administration knows just how weak this \ndeal will be.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's review, as my colleagues have done, how far back \nwe have slid from conditions that we placed on Iran when we started and \nhow much the P5+1 countries have caved through its concessions to this \nrogue and dangerous regime.\n  Let's start with this: there are six United Nations Security Council \nresolutions against Iran and its nuclear program. Each one of those \nresolutions puts restrictions on Iran and calls for a complete stop on \nuranium enrichment, a complete stop.\n  The Supreme Leader argued that it had a right to enrich under the \nnonproliferation treaty, the NPT, to which it is a signatory, but of \ncourse, all of these alleged rights should have been forfeited once it \nwas discovered that Iran had been in violation of the nonproliferation \ntreaty and other international obligations for decades because it has \nbeen operating a covert nuclear program; yet the P5+1 countries \ninexplicably ceded the so-called right to Iran.\n  In fact, in 2009, the President clearly stated: ``Iran must comply \nwith U.N. Security Council resolutions and make clear it is willing to \nmeet its responsibilities as a member of the community of nations.''\n  That ended up not being true, as the President has caved on that \ncommitment. The President has repeatedly stated in the past that Iran \ndoesn't need to have a fortified underground facility in Fordo, a heavy \nwater reactor in Arak, or some of the other advanced centrifuges that \nthey currently possess in order to have a peaceful nuclear program; yet \nwhere are we now?\n  Well, Iran will maintain Fordo and its capacity to produce and store \nheavy water while continuing to not just operate advanced centrifuges, \nMr. Speaker, but to also test and conduct research and development on \nthem as well--how far we have moved those goalposts.\n  There is also a serious and dangerous issue of the possible military \ndimensions, PMD, and Iran's past nuclear activity.\n  Just 3 weeks ago, Secretary Kerry confirmed what we long suspected, \nthat disclosure of past nuclear activity is no longer a must-have for \nthis administration in this nuclear deal.\n  How would any agreement that doesn't demand that Iran at least come \nclean about the extent of its program going to be a good deal, Mr. \nSpeaker? Don't forget that the Supreme Leader has also repeatedly \nstated that Iran's military sites would not be accessible to \ninternational inspectors.\n  Let's not forget one of the most important things here, the ultimate \ngift we have given Iran. This deal will help legitimize this rogue \nregime that will not only allow Iran to be viewed as a responsible \nnation, but it is no longer going to be the pariah state. We are going \nto say it is a trusted member of the international community, and we \nhave done that. We have granted that legitimacy with these \nconversations.\n  Also, the reports indicate--and I don't hear any words to the \ncontrary--that Iran may receive a $50 billion signing bonus, as if this \nis the NFL draft, a signing bonus which it will then use to support \nterror, which it will use to foment instability, which it will use to \nstoke sectarian tensions, which it will use to continue to threaten \nIsrael, which it will continue to undermine U.S. national security \ninterests.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Mr. Speaker, that is what their signing bonus will do. That is what \nsanctions relief will do. If the United States is willing to overlook \nall of these transgressions, all of these crimes, and negotiate a deal \nwith Iran without pressing for changes in its actions, then it will be \nseen as an endorsement of those actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have every indication that we are not going to get \nwhat any of us would remotely consider to be even a halfway good deal. \nThe requirements for a good deal went out the window when the \nnegotiators allowed Iran to maintain its entire nuclear infrastructure \nand continue to enrich uranium.\n  It is our obligation, then, to conduct our proper oversight and \nreview and reject any nuclear deal that we feel is not in the best \ninterests of our U.S. national security. If we do that, we must move \nswiftly to reimpose any sanctions that have been suspended, any \nsanctions that have been waived against the regime, and to ensure that \nall sanctions are fully and vigorously enforced. Then we must move to \nenact additional sanctions on the regime until it meets its \ninternational obligations and abandons its pursuit of an illicit \nnuclear weapons program. Once upon a time, that was the goal.\n\n[[Page H4952]]\n\n  From the very beginning, Mr. Speaker, I have been saying that Iran is \nfollowing the North Korean playbook: offering to negotiate in return \nfor concessions but never delivering on anything tangible, only to \nbreak off when they no longer need what we have been giving them.\n  I wrote this op-ed on October 19, 2012, ``Ros-Lehtinen: Obama Still \nTrying to Sweet-Talk Iran Out of Building the Bomb,'' and I was talking \nabout the North Korea deal and how that dovetails with the Iranian \ndeal. I wrote of the dangers of the Obama administration's naive view \nthat if we keep talking, if we keep engaging with this rogue regime, \nthen Iran will stop its drive for nuclear capability.\n  I stated then, and I believe now, that this is what we are witnessing \ntoday, Mr. Speaker, that the Iranians will give the impression that a \ndeal will be likely only to then pull away, that Iran benefits from \ndragging out the negotiations as long as possible because, as Mr. \nCollins of Georgia said, the centrifuges are still spinning, and they \nwant to provide its nuclear program extra time in order to convince the \nworld that an agreement is possible, leaving the administration and the \nEU to quietly ease sanctions enough to revive the stagnant Iranian \neconomy that had been on the brink of collapse thanks to the sanctions \nthat Congress placed on them; because that was the intent and the \npurpose and the objective of the sanctions, not to get them to \nnegotiate, but to collapse their economy so that they could not pour \nmoney into their terrorist activities and their covert nuclear program.\n  But what we are seeing now is the administration and other P5+1 \ncountries will allow the terms of the JPOA and, thus, the easing of \nsanctions to continue to be in place despite having overextended \nseveral deadlines. Iran never had any intention of coming to a real \nagreement, and we would be foolhardy to believe that it does now, not \nwhen it is already getting everything it wants. Why should they concede \nanything now?\n  Mr. Speaker, the only way that Iran will say yes to a deal is if it \nis so bad and so weak that Iran would be stupid and silly to walk away \nfrom it. Yet that is precisely what we are looking at right now, Mr. \nSpeaker. Either Iran keeps dangling an agreement in front of the P5+1 \nand continues to get more sanctions relief, or the P5+1 completely and \nutterly capitulates to Iranian demands.\n  So it is incumbent upon us, Mr. Speaker, to reject any deal that we \nview to be weak, any deal that we perceive to be a bad deal, any deal \nthat is not in the interests of our U.S. national security interests.\n  We must also continue to push back on this false binary notion that \ntells you that it is either this deal--no matter how bad it is--or \ngoing to war. That has been a fundamental misunderstanding of the \npurpose of the Iranian sanctions themselves. The fact that some believe \nthat Iranian sanctions were designed only to get Iran to the \nnegotiation table could not be further from the truth. The Iranian \nsanctions were designed to force the region to abandon completely its \nnuclear weapons ambitions, to give up its enrichment, and to dismantle \nits nuclear program.\n  I should know, Mr. Speaker, because I am the author of several Iran \nsanctions bills, including the toughest set of sanctions against this \nterrible regime that are currently on the books right now. Sanctions, I \nmight remind my colleagues and the American people, that the Obama \nadministration fought us every step of the way or until it was clear \nthat the administration could not stop our sanctions from becoming law, \nand then they said, Okay, we will accept them. So there is an \nalternative to these misguided talks.\n  That is how I am going to conclude my Special Order tonight, Mr. \nSpeaker. We must abandon these talks that are just patently a farce. We \nimmediately reinstate all sanctions against Iran that have been eased, \nthat have been waived, that have been lifted, and that have been \nignored by the Obama administration and enact even tougher sanctions on \nthe regime.\n  We were on the brink until Iran received the lifeline that it needed. \nWe gave it to them, and now we are the ones dangling on it as Iran's \neconomy is being brought back to life because of sanctions relief, and \nthe regime has been gaining concession after concession while never \nonce making any change that would substantially and significantly set \nback its nuclear ambitions.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, in the end, I will conclude with this: Reinstating \nand strengthening these sanctions, coupled with the credible threat \nthat all options are on the table, including the military option, could \nact as the deterrent, but only if Iran recognizes that we are in a \nposition of strength. That is why it is important that this body speak \nup. That is why it is important that we reject any deal we find to be \ninsufficient, but we must also not let billions of dollars flow to the \nIranian regime. We must start passing legislation that would impose \ntougher sanctions.\n  This is a matter of utmost concern to our national security. I urge \nmy colleagues to remain engaged on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4952-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Culberson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for July 7 and today \non account of a family obligation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/08/house-section/article/H4952-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4952]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
