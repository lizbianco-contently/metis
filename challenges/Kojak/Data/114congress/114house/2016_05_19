Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of National Police \nWeek and the courageous law enforcement personnel who serve Tennessee \nday in and day out.\n  Police Week occurs every year, but this year demands special \nattention because recently we have seen some corners of society offer a \nnegative portrayal of our police. We have heard instances of strained \nrelationships between communities and the police officers that patrol \nthem, and we have seen activists and agitators who cast our police as \nvillains when they should be lifted up every day as heroes.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, let us in Congress speak clearly on this issue \ntoday: We honor and respect the brave men and women of our police \nforce. We pray for their safety and the safety of their families, and \nwe reject the angry voices who seek to tarnish the most noble of \nprofessions.\n  Mr. Speaker, on National Police Week and throughout the year, let us \nremember--police lives matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2847-7", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2847-H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          RECOGNIZING OFFICER CORAL WALKER OF OMAHA, NEBRASKA\n\n  (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an Omaha police \nofficer whose heroic actions, while putting his own life on the line, \nsaved the lives of countless innocent bystanders.\n  I am honored to note that Officer Coral Walker is the recipient of \nthe U.S. Justice Department's Public Safety Officer Medal of Valor.\n  On June 15, 2013, Officer Walker was on patrol when a 911 call \nalerted him that a gunman was randomly shooting people. Two died, and \ntwo others were critically wounded. When he pulled up on the scene, \nOfficer Walker ordered the shooter to stop and drop his weapon, a .45 \ncaliber handgun. Ignoring Officer Walker, the gunman opened fire on the \nbrave patrolman. As several shots were fired at Officer Walker, two \nhitting his police car, he fired back, killing the man and protecting \nthose nearby.\n  Officer Walker's selfless actions came as other innocent lives stood \nin the balance. The gunman, in the country illegally and carrying two \nadditional loaded magazines, was walking toward a busy business area \nwhen Officer\n\n[[Page H2848]]\n\nWalker stepped in. Only Officer Walker's exceptional courage, \ndisregarding his own safety, brought this deadly shooting spree to an \nend.\n  The Omaha community, the State of Nebraska, and our Nation are \ngrateful for the heroic actions of Officer Coral Walker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        REMEMBERING GLEN NELSON\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember a Minnesota \nlegend, Glen Nelson, who passed away last week.\n  Glen was a medical pioneer whose work has transformed the lives of \nmany thousands and thousands of people. From performing surgeries to \ncreating medical devices to leading several healthcare companies, Glen \ndid it all. Health care was his career, and that is because he \nrecognized the power of medicine and innovation and how it could be \nused to make a difference in the lives of his neighbors.\n  Glen put it best when he said: ``As a surgeon, you save one life at a \ntime, but with medical devices, you know you are saving so many more.''\n  Glen did what he did not to make money or gain fame. Glen was a \nleading doctor, inventor, philanthropist, and great family man because \nhe cared about people, and he valued giving back to others.\n  Mr. Speaker, the loss of Glen Nelson is something that all Minnesota \nis feeling. Our State, our country, and our medical community are \nbetter off because of the leadership and passionate spirit of Glen \nNelson.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           FLORIDA'S GUN LAWS\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, my home State of Florida has some of the \nabsolute worst gun laws in the country.\n  Much like Congress, Florida's Legislature has done nothing to prevent \nviolent criminals from getting guns. According to a report in the south \nFlorida Sun-Sentinel, in just 1 year, Florida granted permits to 1,400 \npeople who pled guilty or no contest to crimes including homicide, \nassaults, and child molestation.\n  There are Members of this Congress who want to burden the entire \ncountry with Florida's shamefully weak gun laws in a race to the bottom \nfor gun permit standards. Even the current reciprocity agreements \nbetween States are strained by how easy Florida makes it to get a \npermit.\n  In 2010, the Philadelphia Daily News found that 2,500 Pennsylvanians \napplied for gun permits in Florida. Nonresidents apply for Florida \npermits to take advantage of Florida's shocking failure to protect its \nown residents from gun violence.\n  This Congress must reject legislation that would force States across \nthe country to abide by Florida's or any other State's weak gun safety \nstandards. Passing this reckless legislation would, unfortunately, make \ngun violence Florida's most shameful export.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Mrs. WALORSKI asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the service and \nsacrifice of the brave police officers who put their lives on the line \neach day to keep our communities safe.\n  This week is National Police Week, and communities all across America \nare showing their appreciation for the law enforcement officers who \ndedicate themselves to serving and protecting the public and bringing \ncriminals to justice.\n  We also remember the heroes who gave their lives in the line of duty, \nand we think of the families they left behind. It is our duty to make \nsure that those who made the ultimate sacrifice in service to their \ncommunities will never be forgotten.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all Americans to take the time this week to \nsimply say ``thank you'' to a police officer in their city or town. We \nare grateful for their service, we are humbled by their courage, and we \nare indebted to them for their sacrifice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE WEEK\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise in recognition of National \nInfrastructure Week.\n  Our national infrastructure is in dire need of repair. The American \nSociety of Civil Engineers' most recent report card gave American \ninfrastructure a D-plus.\n  Many of us here are parents. If your child came home with a D-plus, \nyou would work with them on their homework, find a tutor, or maybe \npunish them. Yet our response to a near failing infrastructure grade is \nneglect.\n  In the short term, investments in our national infrastructure create \njobs. In the long term, they help communities grow and expand \nopportunity.\n  I recently met with Transportation Secretary Foxx to discuss the \nproposed South Suburban Airport. With the national spotlight on the \nlong lines at O'Hare and Midway, it is clear that the Chicago region \nneeds an investment in a new airport to expand the region's air traffic \ncapacity.\n  Investing in infrastructure is a win in both the short term and the \nlong term. So this week, I urge my colleagues to stand with me and work \ntogether to invest in our future by improving and strengthening our \nNation's infrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2848]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CALIFORNIA HIGH-SPEED RAIL AUTHORITY\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the California High-Speed Rail \nAuthority admitted that it needs an additional 4 years to build its \nfirst segment of track.\n  Despite claiming that the project was shovel ready back in 2010 in \norder to receive Federal funds, the Rail Authority has only recently \nstarted minor construction. Now the Obama administration has extended \nthe lifeline 4 more years to use up the so-called stimulus dollars.\n  The project's costs are now more than double what the Rail Authority \nhad claimed in the beginning. It has a funding gap of over $55 billion, \nhas changed its route repeatedly and still hasn't settled on a route, \nhas failed to attract a single private investment, and fails to comply \nwith State and Federal law on the prescription of its construction.\n  Mr. Speaker, the California High-Speed Rail Authority has broken \nevery promise it has made to the people of California. It is time to \npull the plug on a project that will not only never be completed, but \nis diverting billions of dollars from other infrastructure needs that \npeople actually want, such as for our highways and needed water storage \nfor California.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2848-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2848-H2849]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

Kondek who made the ultimate sacrifice on \nDecember 21, 2014, protecting the citizens of Tarpon Springs, Florida, \nand Hillsborough County Sheriff's Deputy John Kotfila, Jr., whom we \ntragically lost earlier this year.\n  Let us never forget the sacrifice of these local officers--they are \nterrific--and others who have fallen in the line of duty, and let us be \nthankful for those who keep our communities safe.

Upon the acceptance by the Secretary of Veterans \n     Affairs of the newly constructed holes 10 through 18 at the \n     golf course at American Lake Veterans Hospital on a portion \n     of Joint Base Lewis-McChord, which were designed by Jack \n     Nicklaus on a pro bono basis, the holes shall be designated \n     as the ``Nicklaus Nine''.\n\n  Mr. HECK of Washington (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask \nunanimous consent that the amendment be considered read.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will continue to read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nWashington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I actually plan on withdrawing \nmy amendment, but would like to make my colleagues aware of some \namazing work being done in my district on behalf of veterans and \nwounded warriors.\n  Mr. Chairman, millions--millions--of people watched the U.S. Open at \nChambers Bay in Washington's 10th Congressional District last June. It \nshowcased, frankly, the irreplaceable beauty of golf in the Pacific \nNorthwest. But just a 10-minute drive from Chambers Bay, you will also \nfind yourself at beautiful American Lake.\n  At American Lake, that is where veterans recover and heal from \ninjuries at the VA facility, which is located near Joint Base Lewis-\nMcChord. A big part of that recuperation includes a bit of TLC from \nanother golf course in addition to Chambers Bay.\n  Since 1955, 61 years, nine holes of golf at the American Lake \nVeterans Golf Course is where South Sound veterans could escape the \nstresses of their daily lives and engage in some healthy competition. \nAnd let's be honest, it is hard to look forward to a visit to the \ndoctor, but looking forward to a round of golf with your buddies is \nsomething entirely different. It has become a great way for older vets \nto connect with younger vets for more recent conflicts.\n  Currently, American Lake Veterans Golf Course--it is important that \nyou hear this--is the Nation's only golf course designed specifically \nfor the rehabilitation of wounded and disabled veterans. Almost all of \nthe dedicated volunteers there are veterans as well. Well, except one, \nand his name is Jack Nicklaus--yes, that Jack Nicklaus--the ``Golden \nBear,'' widely regarded, perhaps, as the greatest golfer of our time, \nwho now spends his time actually designing golf courses. He is the one \nwho helped design and expand the American Lake Veterans Golf Course to \ninclude a back nine. They went from nine holes to 18. The back nine is \nnow in place, and the course is waiting for VA Secretary McDonald to \nsign the necessary paperwork to formally accept the course \nimprovements.\n  The course exists because of the determination of hardworking \nvolunteers--really angels among us. And now it is time to honor one of \nthose committed volunteers for his commitment to our veterans and \nwounded warriors, and officially designate holes 10 through 18 as the \nNicklaus Nine.\n  With the Nicklaus Nine, we will now have an 18-hole, 100 percent ADA \naccessible golf course to accommodate returning troops and our local \ncombat veterans. With the Nicklaus Nine, we will have double the \naccessibility and green to offer our veterans who have given so much to \nall of us.\n  Now, I am going to tell you a story, and I guarantee it is going to \nstay with you, I guarantee that you are going to remember this story. \nThere is a program at American Lake Veterans Golf Course that teaches \nblind veterans how to play golf. One year, we had a local golfer--his \nname happens to be Ray Reed--who was sent to the National Blind Golf \nTournament in Iowa. Ray Reed, blind, wounded warrior.\n  And do you know what he did at that national golf tournament? He \nscored a hole in one. Yes, blind veterans can golf, and they learn how \nto do that at American Lake. It is incredible. They are an inspiration \nto all of us.\n  Mr. Chairman, to avoid a point of order on my amendment, I would like \nto withdraw it at this time. But I hope that I can work with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to find another vehicle, or a \nstandalone bill, to get this done. I strongly believe it to be \nappropriate to honor and bestow on he who has changed the name of golf, \nthe Golden Bear, this honor for changing the lives of wounded warriors. \nI hope this will encourage the design and development of more golf \ncourses around the U.S. devoted to our veterans and our wounded \nwarriors.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleagues.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nWashington?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson\n\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title) insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available for this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Veterans Affairs to preclude the \n     territorial seas of the Republic of Vietnam from inclusion in \n     the meaning of the Republic of Vietnam under the Agent Orange \n     Act of 1991 (Public Law 102-4) and the amendments made by \n     that Act.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New \nYork and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I reserve a point of order on the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I am here this morning to bring forward an \namendment that is for our sailors who fought in the Vietnam war. This \nis about ensuring they get the health care and the benefits that they \nhave earned through their service in Vietnam.\n  But in a broader sense, this is really about justice. This is about \nveterans who went forward and fought that war, a deeply unpopular war \nthat divided our Nation. They were never asked\n\n[[Page H2850]]\n\nabout their political leanings or what their views were on the war. \nThey simply did what they were ordered to do. They went forward and \nthey gave their very best effort to serve us.\n  In the process of that war, we used Agent Orange to defoliate. In the \ncase of these sailors, serving just offshore in Vietnam, we had ships \nthat were involved in resupply operations at the ports and at the \nharbor, and they were vulnerable. They were vulnerable because there \nwas vegetation near the ports and the harbors. As our countermeasure to \nthat, we defoliated to give standoff for those ships to protect them.\n  But what we have learned over time, Mr. Chairman, is that that was \npoisoning our sailors, and anyone that was in close proximity. Now, and \nin fact in 1991, this body, along with the Senate and the President of \nthe United States of America, enacted a law, the Agent Orange Act of \n1991, that ensured that our veterans who were exposed to Agent Orange \nhad access to the health care and the benefits that they had earned.\n  Regrettably, in 2002, executive overreach led to a rule that narrowed \nthe interpretation of our law. Now it is so that you have to have \nserved on the ground in Vietnam or in the Riverine Navy to get access \nto this law and to these benefits.\n  Mr. Chairman, the people's representatives never spoke on that. This \nis an issue we have dealt with time and again in this Chamber, both \nsides of the aisle, fighting back, fighting for our article I \nprerogatives. And this is very clear here. This body spoke. We said we \nhad to try to make right what was wrong.\n  So now we have about 90,000 sailors that don't have access to health \ncare. Mr. Chairman, be advised and be assured that Members of this body \nfight every day for these veterans in a case-by-case basis, and we do \nwin some of these, but we don't win all of them. It is just flatly \nwrong.\n  Mr. Chairman, what this amendment does is really ensure that our \narticle I prerogatives are secured. That we go back to the original \nlanguage that we passed and the President signed.\n  I would ask all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthis amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                             Point of Order\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I insist on my point of order.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman will state his point of order.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I make a point of order against this amendment. \nAlthough it is a very well-intended amendment, and I am very \nsympathetic to what he wants to do, I think there might be a way, if \nthe gentleman withdraws and tries to perfect that amendment, that it \nmight be made in order.\n  This amendment proposes to change existing law and constitutes \nlegislation in an appropriation bill and, therefore, violates clause 2 \nof rule XXI.\n  The rule states in pertinent part: ``An amendment to a general \nappropriation bill shall not be in order if changing existing law.''\n  The bill gives direction to that effect.\n  I ask for a ruling from the Chair.\n  Again, I would ask my colleague to consider withdrawing and see if he \ncan perfect that amendment so that it would be made in order.\n  The CHAIR. Does any other Member wish to be heard on the point of \norder?\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I just want to say, I have the deepest \nrespect for the chairman, a dear colleague and friend. But I have to \nsay that I am astounded that we would talk about a point of order here \nwhen we are talking about our language. This is what we passed.\n  What we saw is that the executive branch, with fiat, changed what it \nis that we passed. So I don't know how it is that we are legislating to \ntheir executive overreach. This is merely an amendment that goes back \nto our language.\n  And it is not just me standing here today; 320 of our colleagues in \nthe United States House of Representatives, on both sides of the aisle, \nbelieve that this needs to get done. And nearly half of the Senate, an \nexact companion, also believe that.\n  Now, because of our friendship and because of the way that we have \nworked together, I just want to enter into a colloquy and get \nclarification from the chairman.\n  What I think I heard him say moments ago is that, if I withdraw, he \nwill work with us so that we can reassert our Article I powers and \nensure that we have justice for these Vietnam veterans who deserve \nthese benefits.\n  Can I get that clarification from the chairman?\n  The CHAIR. The Chair will hear each Member individually on the point \nof order.\n  A point of order is pending.\n  The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized to be heard on the \npoint of order.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, on the point of order, the point I am trying to \nmake is this: if the amendment is withdrawn, it can be reworked so that \nit would be in order. We believe that there is a way to do that even \ntoday. That is the offer I am making to you. If the amendment is \nwithdrawn, there is a possibility that this amendment could be made in \norder, but it does have to be perfected.\n  I am a cosponsor of the actual underlying legislation, so I support \nit. But at the moment, in our view, it does constitute legislation in \nan appropriation bill, and, therefore, it violates clause 2 of rule \nXXI.\n  But I pledge to work to the best of our ability to try to make it in \norder, even today, if possible.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, given the pledge of my dear friend from \nPennsylvania to work to make sure that we have justice and that we can \nmove forward and help these veterans, I ask unanimous consent to \nwithdraw my amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nNew York?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. The amendment is withdrawn.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for the Veterans Experience Office.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nArizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer a simple amendment to \nprevent wasteful new administrative spending within the VA General \nAdministration Account, and to ensure that scarce resources are not \ndiverted away from the priorities that need them most.\n  My amendment will strengthen and support the position of this \ncommittee to ensure that none of the funds made available by this act \nmay be used by the administration's proposed bureaucracy quagmire \ncalled the Veterans Experience Office. While the name may make this \nproposed new nationwide office sound like a good idea, this proposal \nwould unleash a new cadre of Federal bureaucrats to stand between the \nveterans and their benefits, repeating those terrifying nine words, \n``I'm from the government and I'm here to help.''\n  We all share the goal of improving each and every veteran's \nexperience with the VA. However, it would be foolish to permit the \ncreation of a new general administration program that would siphon off \nmore than $72 million away from the programs and offices prioritized by \nthis committee as those most in need of support.\n  I commend the committee for identifying this wasteful proposal in \ntheir report, stating, ``While the committee supports the Secretary's \nefforts to improve the ways VA interacts with veterans, it has doubts \nabout the wisdom of establishing a large new office with regional \nstaffing at this late date in the administration.''\n  While the position of the committee is clear, my amendment is \nnecessary to ensure that the administration is prohibited from \ntransferring limited funds within the general administration account to \nfund this unwise and duplicitous proposal. This administration is \nnotorious for ignoring the will\n\n[[Page H2851]]\n\nof Congress and seeking out loopholes to advance the executive branch's \nagenda. This track record of rogue behavior is why this amendment is so \nnecessary in order to carry out the committee's recommendation and \nproperly care for our veterans.\n  The VA doesn't need more money to hire more people pushers to create \nan even larger bureaucracy between the veterans and their benefits. \nInstead, let's ensure resources are allocated where they have the most \neffective and efficient benefit for those who have given their country \nso much.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment. I thank \nChairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for their time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand the gentleman's concerns about \nstarting this large, new office at the VA. As you can see from our \nreport, we cut the request for General Administration by $81.3 million, \nlargely because of our concerns about funding this large office; so I \nthink we have already achieved what the gentleman is looking to \naccomplish. It is hard to imagine that the VA could find $81 million in \nanother account to backfill this office.\n  I will not oppose the gentleman's amendment. I will tell the \ngentleman, however, that this will inevitably become a conference issue \nbecause the Senate supports the creation of the office. I do not object \nto the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, the bulk of the request of the \nincrease for the General Administration was intended for the \nestablishment of the Veterans Experience Office. Up until now, the \nVeterans Experience Office's activities have been funded through the \nOffice of Enterprise Integration. However, the FY 2017 budget proposes \nto make the Veterans Experience Office a standalone office within the \nGeneral Administration and requests $72.6 million in funding and 204 \nfull-time equivalents via direct budget authority.\n  While we all support the Secretary's efforts to improve the way the \nVA interacts with the veterans, we had doubts about the wisdom of \nestablishing a large, new office with regional staffing at this late \ndate in the administration. It was decided not to include this funding. \nHowever, there is nothing in the bill that prevents the Secretary from \ncontinuing to fund the office in the way that he did in the previous \nfiscal year.\n  Conversely, the amendment before us will prevent this office from \nbeing funded, period. I believe that the amendment is a bridge too far. \nWhile I don't support making the Veterans Experience Office a free-\nstanding office, I also don't support taking the Secretary's \nflexibility away either. I believe that the bill is the right approach. \nI urge Members to oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I rebut.\n  This President and his agencies have shown time and time again that \nthey are eager to ignore the will of Congress and to implement his \nagenda wherever they can. This is a necessary reminder that the VA is \nhardly a vestibule of good behavior. I think we need to make them \nconcentrate on doing their procedures right that they currently cannot \ndo right. I urge Members to accept my amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to--\n       (1) carry out the memorandum from the Veterans Benefit \n     Administration known as Fast Letter 13-10, issued on May 20, \n     2013; or\n       (2) create or maintain any patient record-keeping system \n     other than those currently approved by the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Central Office in Washington, D.C.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nArizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I offer an amendment. I have offered similar \namendments in the last 2 years, and they have passed each time. I had \nhoped that it would not be necessary to offer this amendment again this \nyear.\n  Unfortunately, an investigation from the Government Accountability \nOffice that was released last month found that the VA schedulers are \nstill manipulating appointment wait times and are underestimating how \nlong veterans have to wait to get care at a VA facility. The GAO's most \nrecent audit found that schedulers changed dates and shortened wait \ntimes for 15 to 20 percent of the cases reviewed. To make matters \nworse, USA Today recently claimed to have studied more than 70 \ninvestigative reports, and it found that these manipulations were being \nperformed at the behest of the VA supervisors.\n  Last year, a different inspector general investigation uncovered an \nactual memo from the VA leadership that encouraged this type of \nbehavior. The memo I speak of is known as the Fast Letter 13-10, and it \nwas handed down directly from the Office of the Director of the \nVeterans Benefits Administration to the Philadelphia VA Regional \nBenefit Office. I was appalled--but not totally surprised--to learn of \nthis memo.\n  The need for my amendment first surfaced 2 years ago as a response to \nexplosive allegations about the Phoenix VA's keeping secondary, \nunofficial records of claims and appointment requests. My commonsense \namendment simply prohibits the VA from keeping unofficial recordkeeping \nsystems and manipulating wait times.\n  I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass \namendments to prevent this type of behavior. When government \nbureaucrats don't use good judgment or common sense, Congress must \naddress these issues. We must have one consistent patient recordkeeping \nsystem within the VA in order to provide accountability, uniformity, \nand to prevent employee manipulation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank Chairman Dent \nand Ranking Member Bishop for their time.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, this amendment is familiar to us since the \ngentleman offered it last year. I am not sure it is necessary to repeat \nthe language this year since we know the VA has rescinded the Fast \nLetter guidance. After all, with the IG investigation into the dual \nscheduling systems, it doesn't seem likely that the VA is maintaining \nrecordkeeping systems that are not approved by headquarters; but I am \nnot going to object to the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chair, we want to reward good behavior, and until they illustrate \ngood behavior, the amendment is going forward. I appreciate the \nchairman's support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Mica\n\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. (a) For an additional amount for ``Veterans Health \n     Administration--Medical Services'' for grants to States under \n     subchapter III of chapter 81 of title 38, United States Code, \n     to expand, remodel, or alter existing buildings for \n     furnishing nursing home\n\n[[Page H2852]]\n\n     care to veterans in State homes that are former nursing home \n     facilities of the Department of Veterans Affairs, as \n     authorized by section 8133 of such subchapter, there is \n     hereby appropriated, and the amount otherwise provided by \n     this Act for ``Departmental Administration--General \n     Administration'' is hereby reduced by, $10,000,000.\n       (b) None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     used to implement, administer, or enforce the prioritization \n     requirements in paragraphs (1)(C) or (2) through (5) of \n     section 8135(c) of title 38, United States Code, with respect \n     to the appropriation in subsection (a).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nFlorida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. MICA. Mr. Chair, this is a simple amendment.\n  I get to chair a subcommittee called Transportation and Public \nAssets. We get to oversee, in the public assets portion, all of the \nvarious properties around the United States that are public assets that \nare sitting idle. For example, in some States we have many VA \nproperties that are medical--some hospitals, some nursing homes--that \nare sitting idle. Some of them are vacant, and some of them are closed.\n  In order to put them into productive use for our veterans, I have \ntried to craft an amendment that, of course, doesn't apply to all of \nthe facilities. I would like to do that, but this is fairly limited. It \nsays that we have a nursing home that has been vacated or a nursing \nhome that is not being used, and some of them, for several years, have \nsat vacant. This allows the Secretary discretion, and it also sets \naside a small number of funds to help bring that property into a \ncondition so that it can be transferred to the State. You have these in \nPennsylvania, Mr. Chair. You have these across the Rust Belt. We have \nthem even in Florida. What we don't have is the authority for the VA to \nmove forward with these properties in their transferring and get the \nproperties into condition and make the little bits of changes in the \nproperties to transfer them to the States.\n  This will apply to 49 States. There are 49 States that have State \nVAs. Many of them run nursing homes. In my State, for example, we run \nseven nursing homes now. We do it more cost-effectively. We can do it \nfaster. We can take those idle assets and put them into use. In some \nplaces in the Rust Belt, you need to consolidate some of the \nfacilities, and this will allow us to do that, too, and to run them \ncheaper and give better services to our veterans, not spread out the \nlimited number of even staffers whom we have and administrators. Think \nof what you can save just on that.\n  This is an amendment to try to move that process forward. We are not \ntrying to get ahead of anybody who is in line for any kind of a VA \nfacility. What we are trying to do is, again, tell the VA Secretary \nthat he can move forward and put a little bit of money aside that will \nmake a big, big difference with these facilities that are sitting \nvacant or half empty across the country, and it does apply to 49 \nStates.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed to the gentleman's amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I understand there is a great demand throughout \nour Nation for State veterans' homes, and I wish we had the allocation \nto provide more for this program than we did.\n  I do want to raise a concern with the language that it might--I say \n``might.'' I am not saying ``definitely''--favor some States rather \nthan increase funding for the entire State HOME Program. I was pleased \nto hear the gentleman state that he is not trying to jump ahead of \nother States that may be in line, but this is an issue that we are \ngoing to have to discuss at the conference committee.\n  I am not going to object to the amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MICA. I appreciate that.\n  Mr. Chair, I think if there are differences in language, we have \ntried to work with the parliamentarian and the committee, and I know \nyou all are busy in trying to get a very important piece of legislation \nout, but this small amendment can make a big difference.\n  Again, this is in Rust Belt States, even in growing States like \nFlorida, and there is no more cost to the Federal taxpayer in the \noperation. In fact, we will save money in the operation because the \nStates take these over. And if the States take them over, it is one \nless burden on the VA. We have seen how difficult it is sometimes to \nget services from the VA, to have these facilities come on line.\n  To the nursing home folks, listen to this. This is to nursing homes: \nwe have a tremendously expanding, aging veterans' population, and we \ncan't keep up with it all, and the Federal Government sometimes does it \nthe least efficiently. This allows us to take those empty or half empty \nor partially used facilities and get them to the States, to sometimes \nconsolidate the operations and save money on administration, operation, \nand expedite and get that service to our veterans as soon as possible.\n  I urge the Members' support of this small amendment. I will be glad \nto work with the chairman, with the ranking member, and with others and \ncraft this in any way that they feel comfortable, but the objective is \nvery important at this stage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Mica).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of sections 575.106 or 575.206 of \n     title 5, Code of Federal Regulations.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nArizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, in a 2015 report from the VA Office of the \nInspector General, it was discovered and reported that two senior staff \nmembers used their positions of power to financially and personally \nbenefit from unethical behavior.\n  Diana Rubens and Kimberly Graves not only coerced two VA managers to \nleave their positions against their will, they then manufactured \ncircumstances that allowed for them to take the positions in question. \nTo make matters worse, these women then took advantage of the VA's \nrelocation expense program. Relocation bonuses may be given to current \nemployees if an open position will be difficult to fill without such an \nincentive. In both of these instances, this clearly was not the case. \nIn total, these women walked away with more than $400,000 in taxpayer \nfunds.\n  As if these actions weren't heinous enough, when the VA did attempt \nto hold Rubens and Graves accountable, the VA was subsequently \noverturned because they failed to discipline the other employees \ninvolved in this case. I am appalled--but ultimately, again, not \nsurprised--to hear of this story. The VA has been riddled with scandal \nand plagued with lawlessness for years now.\n  Chairman Miller said it best in the days that followed the reversal \nof the VA's decision, stating: ``Every objective observer knows that \nthe Federal civil service system coddles and protects misbehaving \nemployees instead of facilitating fair and efficient discipline; and \nuntil VA and Obama administration leaders acknowledge this problem and \nwork with Congress to solve it, it will never be fixed.''\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment is a commonsense approach that simply \nreaffirms the requirements in the Code of Federal Regulations for \nemployment incentives and relocation expenses.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Had the VA followed these regulations, Diana Rubens and Kimberly \nGraves wouldn't have been able to force two managers to leave and then \nget reimbursed for moving across the country to take their spots.\n  I have said this before, but it is sad that we have to pass \namendments to\n\n[[Page H2853]]\n\nprevent this type of behavior. When government bureaucrats fail to \nserve the American people through the use of common sense, Congress \nmust address these issues personally.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member for their help.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I claim the time to speak in opposition, but I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, no one shares the gentleman's concerns more than \nI do about the inappropriate relocation incentive payments the VA \ninitially paid to two executives at the Philadelphia regional office. \nThe VA has since reformed its policies, and I hope we will never ever \nhear again about such egregious staff misconduct and inappropriate \nreimbursements.\n  However, I do think that the relocation incentive can be an important \ntool in some circumstances. Although I have no objection to the \ngentleman's amendment, I think this may need to be refined a bit in \nconference to reflect the usefulness of the tool, when used \nappropriately.\n  As I said, there was egregious misconduct in Philadelphia, as the \ngentleman correctly points out. There is no question. In fact, many of \nus went and visited the Philadelphia regional office at about that time \nfor a hearing, both Republicans and Democrats, authorizers and \nappropriators, to discuss the challenges at that particular office.\n  That said, I have no objection to the amendment.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. DENT. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I have the deepest respect for the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania and for the gentleman who is offering the \namendment, but I think that we may be just going a little bit too far \nhere.\n  Mr. Chair, this amendment will restrict the ability of the VA and the \ndepartments and related agencies funded in this act to use incentives \nto get experienced, talented, and capable individuals to take on \ndifficult-to-fill positions. In other departments, they call these \nhardship posts. These are the jobs no one wants to do but are vital to \nthe function of government.\n  I think we can all agree that there are times when we need to provide \nincentives to those individuals whom we are asking to fill difficult \njobs. At times, we need to take action to make a job more appealing, \nand sometimes we need to provide incentives to compete with the \nsalaries that are typically paid outside of the Federal Government for \nsome of the positions.\n  I am concerned that this amendment will decrease the availability and \nquality of candidates possessing the competencies that are required for \nfilling the hard-to-fill posts. We would not run a Fortune 500 company \nthis way. Why are we limiting the ability of the U.S. Government to \nrecruit and hire the best and the brightest?\n  I respectfully urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, trust is a series of promises kept, and it is \nvery notable that the VA has lost the trust of Congress and the \nAmerican people and, more importantly, our veterans. So until we get \nthis right, until they can actually earn the respect and do the due \ndiligence that they are expected to do for our veterans, it is a \nrequirement of us to make sure, like a dog on a bone, to hold them \naccountable.\n  I hope that everybody will vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Gosar\n\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the exception in \n     clause (iii) of section 1.218(a)(8) of title 38, Code of \n     Federal Regulations.\n\n  Mr. GOSAR (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read.\n  The CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman from \nArizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nArizona and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, recently, a veteran receiving care from the VA \ncontacted my office to express his concern about pro-union fliers being \nposted in VA facilities. The veteran sent me a picture of one of these \nfliers, shown here for your reference. Right here.\n  As you can see, this flier is an attempt to recruit union activists. \nAnother flier, just above it, praises the agenda at the AFL-CIO. The \nveteran who contacted me was appalled that he was barraged by these \npro-union advertisements during his visits to the VA. I couldn't agree \nmore.\n  Our Nation's heros should not be subjected to blatantly partisan \nadvertisements while trying to receive medical care at VA facilities. \nMy staff investigated this issue and found that, while solicitations \nlike these are prohibited by law, union lobbyists were able to carve \nout a special exemption that allowed solicitation of labor organization \nmembership or dues in VA facilities. This is a blatant abuse of \ntaxpayer-funded facilities for the purpose of pushing a pro-union \nagenda. Given the obvious political nature of these groups, they should \nnot be allowed to advertise in the VA facilities.\n  Furthermore, the fact that VA employees are engaging in union \nactivities while on the clock is unacceptable, given the current state \nof the VA. Any time these employees spend time doing union activities \nis time they cannot spend treating our veterans. With a massive backlog \nof cases and the fact that veterans have literally died waiting for \ncare, this abuse of taxpayer money and our veterans must be put to an \nend.\n  For that reason, I introduced the amendment currently at the desk. My \namendment will prohibit the use of funds to implement, administer, or \nenforce the current union loophole. Defunding this exemption that \nallows unions to solicit members and dues at VA facilities would place \nunions under the same regulatory framework as other 501(c)'s.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I thank the \ndistinguished chair and ranking member.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, this is just another attack on \norganized labor and working people. The conduct that the gentleman \nwishes to prohibit is consistent with the National Labor Relations Act, \nand it is consistent with the traditions of this country. It is freedom \nof speech, and I think it ought to be allowed.\n  I certainly object to this. I think that the working people ought to \nhave an opportunity to express themselves and utilize fully the First \nAmendment, even in our VA facilities. I couldn't imagine that people \nwho support the Constitution would want to muzzle working people and \nlimit their ability to seek associations with like-minded people.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, once again, my amendment is critical to \nensuring that our veterans receive the care they deserve in a \nnonpoliticized environment. Again, this amendment idea came from a \nveteran who was outraged about the VA being littered with union \nrecruitment fliers.\n  No veteran should be forced to endure blatantly partisan union \nadvertisements in a taxpayer-funded building in order to receive the \nmedical care they earned defending our country.\n  We should all agree that the VA employees should be spending their \ntaxpayer-funded time treating veterans, not posting union fliers and \nnegotiating for higher wages, especially given the VA claims and the \nbacklog of appeals that exist.\n  I encourage adoption of the amendment.\n\n[[Page H2854]]\n\n  I also want to make sure that people understand that this amendment \nwould create that the unions be treated as any other 501(c).\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chair, well, once again, we want to make sure that \neverybody is treated fairly about this. As you can see, the blatant \nattempt here about recruitment to the unions within our VA is outright \ndisgusting.\n  We want to make sure that everybody is treated fairly and has the \nopportunity for fair speech, but this gives a hand up to the unions. I \nask all my colleagues to vote for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, again, this is another nasty rider. \nThis is a rider that is totally unnecessary and inappropriate on this \nbill. It violates the Constitution. It certainly limits the rights of \npeople in veterans facilities to be able to have freedom of speech and \nfreedom of association. It is a bad proposition. I urge my colleagues \nto oppose it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Arizona will be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Perry\n\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, add the \n     following new section:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement or enforce Executive Order 13502.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chair, in 2009, the President issued Executive Order \n13502, which strongly encourages Federal agencies to require project \nlabor agreements, or PLAs, on Federal construction projects exceeding \n$25 million in cost. This amendment simply states, as already read, \nthat none of the funds made available by this act may be used to \nimplement or enforce this executive order.\n  Now, project labor agreements, Mr. Chair, discourage what is called a \nmerit shop contractor from bidding on taxpayer-funded construction \ncontracts. Let me be clear. That means, if you don't have a union, you \ncan't even bid.\n  By the way, the vast majority of all work conducted in the United \nStates, private or government, is conducted by nonunion contractors. It \nis not meant to disparage unions. It is just saying that there should \nbe open competition for everybody.\n  Because it is a limited competition, it actually drives up the cost \nthat each of us pay for the construction, somewhere between 12 and 18 \npercent, needlessly. Even if it is only 12 percent, why pay it? It \nresults in fewer infrastructure improvements simply because there is \njust not as much money because we are paying more for the ones that we \nare doing.\n  It is a project-specific collective bargaining agreement with \nmultiple unions that is unique only to the construction industry. It is \ndone nowhere else, only in the construction industry.\n  Now, the NLRA permits construction employees to execute a PLA, a \nproject labor agreement, voluntarily. When the PLA is mandated by a \ngovernment agency, construction contracts can be awarded only to \ncontracts and subcontractors that agree to the terms and conditions of \nthe PLA, essentially making them a union organization.\n  Typically, the contractors have to recognize the union as the \nrepresentative of their employees. No longer is the private business \nthe representative, but only the union is the representative, and they \nhave to hire from the union hall.\n  Furthermore, if you ever pay prevailing wage or the Federal minimum \nwage for these kinds of projects, there is a thing called the fringe \nbenefits, which includes your medical, your dental, your retirement. \nThose all will be put into union-managed benefits and pension programs. \nSo even if you are a private employer that is not unionized, all that \nmoney, all those fringe benefits go to those programs.\n  You must obey the restrictive and sometimes inefficient rules of job \nclassification. So, for instance, if you are an electrician, you might \nwant to wire something up, but if you need some conduit, you can't go \nget it because you are not a laborer. You are an electrician, and you \nhave to wait for the laborer to go get it. That doesn't happen in \nnonunion environments. It is just inefficient.\n  Furthermore, PLAs force employees to pay union dues, whether they are \nin the union or not, and then accept unwanted union representation. \nThey also forfeit the benefits earned during the life of the project \nunless they join the union and become vested in union benefit plans. So \nthey lose all that.\n  Quite honestly, it is just simply a union recruiting plan at taxpayer \nexpense. I don't have problems with the union; I just don't think that \nwe should be paying for them.\n  The PLA requirements and preferences on taxpayer-funded contracts \nexpose procurement officials to intense political pressure because they \nare not negotiating normally. It is negotiated under the terms of the \nproject labor agreement, not just a regular contract where you agree to \ndo so much work and we would agree to pay so much. You agree to do it \nat this time, and we agree to accept that timeframe. It disrupts local \ncollective bargaining agreements already in place because it is \ncontract specific for the project at the time. Obviously, because of \nthat, it stifles competition.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  You stifle competition, it raises the cost. Who is paying the extra \ncost? The American taxpayer. It creates, or potentially creates, \ncontracting and construction delays. We don't need any more delays at \nthe VA. I think we have been through that plenty of times.\n  Now, we just want to get the best price. We want everybody involved. \nWe want everybody able to bid and able to participate. Let the \ngovernment, let the taxpayer get the best job for the best price.\n  Under this amendment, PLAs for military construction would not be \nforbidden. They are still not forbidden; they are just not mandated. \nAgain, this amendment simply allows none of the funds made by the \nexecutive order to be used to implement or enforce Executive Order \n13502.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The DOD does a lot of construction projects--this bill is certainly a \ntestament to that--and these are often complex projects. They build \nfacilities that are used to repair ships or store munitions, and \nusually when we read about large, complex construction projects, it is \noften in the context of delays or cost overruns or concerns on the \nworkforce front. Folks want to see local opportunities on local \nprojects.\n  Now, a project labor agreement allows Federal agencies to negotiate \nexclusively with the building trades to ensure both union and open shop \ncontractors are able to participate on the project. The agreement \nestablishes quality worksite conditions and works to ensure \nconstruction is finished on time and under budget.\n  When executed properly, PLAs are flexible, and they encourage \nparticipation from a wide variety of prime and subcontractors. In fact, \nPLAs are used on big, private projects. Look at every significant hotel \nproject, casino project, stadium project.\n  I worked professionally in economic development before I came here. \nThese project labor agreements were vital to seeing projects happen. \nWhy? Because they save money and because they keep projects on schedule \nand because they use local workers.\n  You have seen the first project labor agreement in Navy history in my \ndistrict--just one, mind you. What is the\n\n[[Page H2855]]\n\noutcome? Well, the project is going to be completed at a cost of $250 \nmillion below what was originally projected. With a contract that was \nworked out ahead of time, it meant that local workers were assigned on \nthe front end. They brought in quality workers, local workers, and that \nstrengthens our local communities. By partnering with local trades and \nusing apprenticeship programs, this is helping to grow the next \ngeneration of tradespeople, giving opportunities to veterans and to \nwomen and minority communities. So it means that we are not just \nbuilding a wharf in my district; it means we are building the next \ngeneration of workers. We are building the middle class.\n  When you compare this with similar large, complex projects, the \nproject that we just had with a project labor agreement had fewer \nproblems and will deliver more value for taxpayers. So I do not \nunderstand why we would take this valuable tool out of our toolbox. We \nshould be encouraging these efforts.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I just want to state I have no objection to \nthe gentleman's amendment. The Department of Defense has awarded one \nconstruction contract, that is the explosives-handling wharf in Kitsap, \nWashington--I believe, in the gentleman's district--where the \nsolicitation favored PLAs.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs has not awarded any contracts that \nhave used PLAs, and they currently have no solicitations that favor \nPLAs. That said, I am very sympathetic with the gentleman's amendment, \nand I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Georgia is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I am very disappointed that, \ninstead of seeking to pass the most bipartisan bill possible, my \ncolleagues would prefer to weigh down the bill that funds veterans and \nmilitary construction with a divisive rider.\n  PLAs can be an essential tool to allow large projects to be completed \non time and on budget. They are a benefit to both employers and \nemployees. A project labor agreement provides a single collective \nbargaining unit, which allows for easier management of a project. They \nprovide a reliable and uninterrupted supply of workers. They provide \nuniform wages, uniform benefits, overtime pay. A PLA sets the terms and \nconditions of employment for all workers onsite, including the work \nconditions and the rules. In addition, a PLA prohibits strikes and work \nstoppages.\n  It is insulting that some would seek to prevent the use of PLAs on \nthis bill when it is one of the best tools available to guarantee that \nveterans are hired as skilled construction workers. The use of a PLA \ndoes not prevent nonunion small businesses from participating. They \nhave to agree to the terms and to sign on to the PLA. In addition, the \nPLA does not make the project union only.\n  Simply put, project labor agreements help both the government and the \nprivate sector increase the efficiency and the quality of its project \nby promoting a business model that employs a highly skilled workforce. \nSuch a workforce ensures that construction projects are built correctly \nthe first time, on time and, as a result, on budget.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  I would note that this House has repeatedly refused to adopt similar \namendments on this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Pennsylvania has 30 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Chairman, I just want to reiterate that this does not \ntake this tool out of the toolbox. It just doesn't require it. With all \ndue respect to those who say, well, it stops strikes from happening and \nit makes sure it is on time and on budget, a simple contract that \nmillions of Americans sign every single day without a project labor \nagreement does that already.\n  If project labor agreements are necessary, why aren't we all doing it \nwith the work on our homes or the work on our businesses? The fact is \nit is not done everywhere because it is not necessary. The fact is it \ndiscourages participation, because you can participate if you want to \njoin the union, or at least de facto join the union because you are \ngoing to do everything by the union code, every single thing, all your \nemployees, all your representation.\n  I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Mr. Chair, let's start out by talking about some of the \nfacts, because I hear some talking points from those who are trying to \ndisturb and remove all workers' rights.\n  There is nothing that currently is in place that mandates project \nlabor agreements be used. If so, we would have thousands and thousands \nof them. It makes them permissible when a large and complex job would \nbenefit from a precontract agreement, because that is what we are \ntalking about. We are not talking about building a house or renovating \na bedroom. Large, complex projects, that is what we are talking about.\n  All it talks about is, before you sign a contract, make sure that you \nspell out very specifically the issues that could come up germane to \nthat job.\n  I have negotiated in my past life over 100 of these. Why? Because \nemployers understand that this is to their benefit. There is a better \ncost ratio balance when they do a project labor agreement. They are \npublic jobs, they are private jobs where nobody is mandating everything \nor anything.\n  What we are saying here is that entering into a project labor \nagreement does one very important thing that nobody quite remembers \nhere: Helmets to Hardhats, taking our veterans who served our country, \ngiving them an opportunity to come home, put their uniform away, and go \nto work on a construction project. That alone is worth its weight in \ngold, and that is what Helmets to Hardhats does under a project labor \nagreement. It creates and allows that next generation of construction \nworkers, those skilled craftsmen, to be part of that. Not one dime of \nthat apprenticeship program comes from the government.\n  This works. Why does it work? Because it saves money. The employer \nlikes it because there are less headaches on the job, and it is \nprobably the most important tool that could be in that worker's \ntoolbox, to make sure that they level the playing field for a quality \njob that comes in on time and under budget.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania will be \npostponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs in contravention \n     of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38, United States \n     Code.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentlewoman from \nTexas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer the Jackson Lee \namendment that clearly recognizes the importance of those who have \nserved and\n\n[[Page H2856]]\n\ntheir lives after. My amendment says none of the funds made available \nby this act for the Department of Veterans Affairs may be used in \ncontravention of subchapter III of chapter 20 of title 38 of the U.S. \nCode, which refers to the benefits for homeless veterans in training \nand outreach programs.\n  Texas and Florida and California happen to be some of the States that \nhave the highest number of homeless veterans. These are individuals who \nput on the uniform unselfishly. Now they are homeless for a variety of \nreasons. I hope that this amendment will reinforce and reemphasize the \nimportance of ensuring that the rate of homelessness among veterans in \nthe United States does not increase.\n  As well, my amendment will remind us of our obligation to provide our \nveterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes \nadequate funding for programs like the Veterans Administration \nSupportive Housing that provides case management services, adequate \nhousing facilities, mental health support, and addresses other issues \nthat contribute to veterans' homelessness.\n  I have, on my staff, a wounded warrior. We work a lot with homeless \nveterans. We visit their centers. We provide them with a sense that \ntheir commitment to this Nation will never be forgotten. Today in our \ncountry there are approximately 107,000 veterans, male and female, who \nare homeless on any given night, and perhaps twice as many, 200,000, \nexperience homelessness at some point during the course of a year.\n  I remember dealing with one of my nonprofits that was renting a space \njust to help three or four or five veterans. Unfortunately, the \nlandlord was not sensitive to the fact that he did not have all the \nmoneys to pay his rent. He was ultimately evicted. But it wasn't just \nhe who was evicted, who was trying to be the Good Samaritan, it was \nveterans who called that place home.\n  Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because \nof their poverty and lack of support from their family. In my hometown \nof Houston, for example, we have had large numbers of homeless \nveterans, but we have begun to work on it.\n  I hope that this amendment will remind people of supportive service \nprograms, residential rehabilitation programs, and HUD VA programs. I \nask support of my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I do not \noppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman has offered the amendment in \nprevious years, and we have accepted it. I have no objection to it \nbeing included again in the bill this year.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Bishop), the distinguished ranking member and a \nstrong supporter of veterans and leadership on the MILCON bill.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding.\n  I just want to let my voice be heard to congratulate the gentlewoman \non her amendment. It has been adopted previously by this House. I think \nit is a great amendment. We support our homeless veterans. I \ncongratulate the gentlewoman for offering the amendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, reclaiming my time, let me thank Mr. \nDent and Mr. Bishop for their leadership, and certainly the \nappropriators, the full committee chairman and ranking member, on the \ntasks that they have before them.\n  We are not going to end homelessness for veterans if we do not invest \nin programs that will help them. My amendment is to ensure that we are \nreminded that these veterans can be rehabilitated and can be provided a \nnew pathway in life. It is simply a continuing way to say thank you.\n  Whenever I speak before veterans, whenever I speak before the United \nStates military, I remind them--though they do not need to be \nreminded--that they unselfishly put on the uniform without question. \nThey put on the uniform without question, and they followed orders. \nThey followed the orders of the Commander in Chief. So now I hope that \nwe, as Members of Congress, will follow orders and increase investment \nin the HUD-VASH program allocated to communities with the highest \nnumbers of homeless veterans, support all council agencies to promote \nand give incentives to local coordination or plans and have our local \ncommunities own these plans so that they will bring down the cost of \nhomelessness or the size of homelessness to prevent or to provide, if \nyou will, for the homeownership that is so very important that our \nveterans desire.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  But the most important point is, why don't we stand and salute and \nstand at attention and say to our veterans: we hear you. Homelessness \nmust not exist among our veterans.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment. It reminds us of \nfunding for veterans who are homeless, as well as for programs for \nveterans who are homeless.\n  Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk. It is Jackson Lee \nAmendment No. 350.\n  Thank you for this opportunity to describe my amendment, which simply \nprovides that:\n  ``None of the funds made available by this Act for the Department of \nVeteran Affairs--Benefits for Homeless Veterans and Training and \nOutreach Programs may be used in contravention of the title 38, Part \nII, Chapter 20, Subchapter II and III of the U.S. Code\n  This amendment will help ensure that the rate of homelessness among \nveterans in the United States does not increase.\n  I thank Subcommittee Chairman Dent and Ranking Member Bishop for \ntheir hard work in shepherding this important legislation to the floor.\n  I offer the Jackson Lee Amendment because I believe reducing and \neliminating homelessness among veterans, those who risked their lives \nto protect our freedom, should also be one of the nation's highest \npriorities.\n  Homelessness among the American veteran population is on the rise in \nthe United States and we must be proactive in giving back to those who \nhave given so much to us.\n  My amendment will help remind us of our obligation to provide our \nveterans the assistance needed to avoid homelessness, which includes \nadequately funding for programs Veterans Administration Supportive \nHousing (VASH) that provide case-management services, adequate housing \nfacilities, mental health support, and address other areas that \ncontribute to veteran homelessness.\n  VASH is a jointly-administered permanent supportive housing program \nfor disabled Veterans experiencing homelessness in which VA medical \nCenters provide referrals and case management while Public Housing \nAgencies (PHAs) administer the Section 8 housing vouchers.\n  Mr. Chair, our veterans deserve the best services available, and I \nbelieve that we could be doing much more for them.\n  Today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 veterans (male \nand female) who are homeless on any given night.\n  And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some \npoint during the course of a year.\n  Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because \nof their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal \nliving conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard \nhousing.\n  While significant progress has been made, ending homelessness among \nveterans remains a big challenge.\n  In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and \n2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162.\n  We must remain vigilant and continue to fight for those who put on \nthe uniform and fought for us.\n  Providing a home for veterans to come home to every night is the very \nleast we can do.\n  Mr. Chair, programs like VASH have succeeded in changing lives.\n  In 2012 alone, 35,905 veterans lived in the public housing provided \nby VASH.\n  I have seen the impact of such grants in my home state of Texas, and \nwithin my congressional district in Houston, and I am sure that this \nfunding has positively impacted many communities across this country.\n  In Texas, there are committed groups in Houston, working to eradicate \nthe issue of homelessness.\n\n[[Page H2857]]\n\n  For example, the Michael E. DeBakey VA Medical Center has been \ninvolved in changing veterans' lives in a mighty way by providing \nVeterans and their families with access to affordable housing and \nmedical services that will help them get back on their feet.\n  Mr. Chair, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee Amendment and commit \nourselves to the hard but necessary work of ending veteran homelessness \nin America.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Gibson\n\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __. None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enforce VA Adjudication Procedure Manual M21-1, \n     Part IV, Subpart ii, Chapter 1, Section H, Topic 28.h related \n     to Developing Claims Based on Service Aboard Ships Offshore \n     the RVN.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New \nYork and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the Parliamentarian and the \nchairman and the ranking member. Earlier this morning, I offered this \namendment and it needed to be perfected. I greatly appreciate the staff \nand the work of the team here so that we could get this in a form to \nwhere it certainly meets muster. This is a very important amendment.\n  Half a century ago, our Nation was embroiled in a war in Vietnam. It \ndivided the Nation. But for our young men and women who went forward \nand fought on our behalf, their loyalties were never divided. They did \neverything that they could every day to serve our Nation in a very \ndifficult circumstance.\n  What developed over that time were soldiers, sailors, airmen, and \nmarines who became sick. They were exposed to Agent Orange. This was \npart of that war. Our Nation had chosen to defoliate as a means of \nprotecting troops with Agent Orange. But what we learned over time is \nthat there was a direct link between exposure to Agent Orange and nine \nmaladies, including cancer, diabetes and Parkinson's.\n  This body, in 1991, recognizing this, came together with the \nPresident of the United States and enacted the Agent Orange Act of \n1991. Unfortunately, in 2002, there was an overreach on the part of the \nexecutive that narrowed that interpretation. And since that time, \nMembers here on both sides of the aisle have been fighting to ensure \nthat our sailors who served just offshore in Vietnam got access to the \nhealth care that they desperately need.\n  Mr. Chairman, over half of these sailors who were exposed are already \nin Heaven. They are gone now. And for those that are left here, time is \nof the essence. It is an urgent matter that we get this passed. Three \nhundred twenty of my colleagues agree with this on both sides of the \naisle, and about half the Senate.\n  So today, we offer this amendment to reassert our article I \nprerogatives to ensure that, for every serviceman and woman that goes \nforward, that they know that, regardless of the difficulty of the fight \nand the difficulty of the proposition and what it may mean for the \npolitics here in America, we will never turn our back on our servicemen \nand -women.\n  Mr. Chair, I ask my colleagues to support this amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n\n\n                       Announcement by the Chair\n\n  The CHAIR. The Chair will remind Members to turn off cell phones when \nthey enter the House Chamber.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, but I am not \nopposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Pennsylvania is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, we support the amendment. We appreciate the \ngood work that my friend from New York (Mr. Gibson) has done to \nadvocate on behalf of all veterans, and particularly his commitment to \nhelping those who suffered from Agent Orange exposure, as well as many \nother issues.\n  So I support the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBSON. Mr. Chair, I deeply appreciate the support of the \nchairman and ranking member, and I respectfully request the support of \nthe House on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Gibson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n       Amendment Offered by Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York\n\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I have an \namendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec.__. None of the funds made available by this Act may be \n     used in contravention of Executive Order No. 13672 of July \n     21, 2014 (``Further Amendments to Executive Order 11478, \n     Equal Employment Opportunity in the Federal Government, and \n     Executive Order 11246, Equal Employment Opportunity'').\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 736, the gentleman from New \nYork and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last night, this \nHouse adopted a provision as part of the defense bill that rolls back \nantidiscrimination provisions contained in executive orders issued by \nthe President in recent years. This is one of the ugliest episodes I \nhave experienced in my 3-plus years as a Member of this House.\n  The inclusion of such hate-based language in a defense bill designed \nto support our military sends exactly the wrong message at a time when \nwe should all be unified in supporting the efforts of our \nservicemembers around the world.\n  My father was a veteran. He was nearly killed in the service of his \ncountry. I have never voted against a defense bill before. I never \nthought I would. Almost a quarter of the constituents I represent in \nthe Hudson Valley of New York come from families where a member is \nserving in the military or has served in the military. I represent the \nUnited States Military Academy at West Point. We have helped 800 \nveterans, one at a time, out of my district office in my 3 years in \nCongress, and we have passed legislation directly aimed at making their \nlives better.\n  So, it is not with an easy heart that I come to the House floor and \noppose the defense bill, but this legislation snuck into the bill--and \nwas kept in the bill--despite a bipartisan effort to remove it, sends \nexactly the wrong signal and it says that we are so concerned about \ndiscriminating against a group of LGBT Americans that we are willing to \ndestroy the bipartisan cooperation we should have on the defense bill.\n  So my amendment today gives us another chance. It gives us a chance \nto correct some of the damage done last night by some Members of this \nbody.\n  What it would say is quite simple: we shall not do anything in this \nbill that contravenes the antidiscrimination executive orders of the \nPresident. It is pretty simple.\n  We should not be spending taxpayer dollars to promote hate, and we \nshould not be justifying that by some religious exemption, when, in \nfact, the language in the defense bill simply rolls back the \nantidiscrimination provisions that the President put in an executive \norder to those contained in the original Civil Rights Act and the ADA.\n  It is specifically designed to exclude LGBT Americans. And in doing \nthat, it aligns itself with the parallel efforts we see happening in \nStates like North Carolina.\n  It is wrong and it doesn't have anything to do with our military; it \ndoesn't have anything to do with fighting ISIS; it doesn't have \nanything to do with religious protections. It is about bigotry, plain \nand simple.\n  Today, we have another chance to do the right thing and to send the \nright message and to stick up for our military.\n\n[[Page H2858]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. DENT. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. I yield to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania.\n  Mr. DENT. I support the amendment, and I certainly oppose \ndiscrimination in any way, shape, or form, particularly as, in this \ncase, it relates to Federal contracting. I do support the amendment.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Reclaiming my time, I want to \nthank the gentleman from Pennsylvania, and I want to acknowledge that \nit was the gentleman from Pennsylvania, together with Mr. Hanna from \nNew York, who courageously led the effort to roll back the \ndiscrimination in a bipartisan way in the Rules Committee. And that \neffort was thwarted.\n  So I am very honored by the gentleman's support, and I am honored by \nthe position you have taken in this House over the last couple of days.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Chairman, I do respect the gentleman for his right \nto come and offer under an open rule, in a different bill, his \nobjections to what occurred last night.\n  Last night, the House of Representatives passed the bill. And today, \nthe gentleman is offering a limiting amendment that would turn back \nthat agreement that we made.\n  Mr. Chairman, several days ago, the House Armed Services Committee \nhandled this issue. It was not sneaking something in. It was a \nstraight-up vote. It was a vote that was held in the Armed Services \nCommittee, it passed. The final vote was 60-2.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is a bipartisan vote. That is a vote from people \non the committee who viewed that they were not going to let one issue \nor another get in the way of supporting the men and women of our United \nStates military. They very clearly--all of them on the committee--\nunderstood during this long markup exactly the implications, and they \nlived with the decision.\n  I am here today to say that the gentleman is fully entitled to do as \nhe is doing, but the vote was held last night. The overwhelming \nviewpoint was let's support the United States military and let's get \nthis done, not the next day come on the floor with spilled milk on your \nface and say: I want to go back and I want to relitigate a decision \nthat we made last night with every Member here on the floor.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I yield to the gentleman. I admire the gentleman.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Well, I appreciate the \nadmiration.\n  Let me ask my colleague: Is it necessary to discriminate against gays \nand lesbians to support our military?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, that issue was handled--and the \ngentleman knows this--in committee.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. It was resolved last night. It \nwas resolved last night in the affirmative. In other words, this House \nsaid that it would include in a defense bill a provision that would \nroll back basic employment questions for gays and lesbians.\n  My question to my colleague is simply, Mr. Chairman, if that is \nnecessary for the promotion of national defense. Is it necessary to \ndiscriminate against gays and lesbians and transgender Americans to \nkeep our country safe?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Reclaiming my time, Mr. Chairman. I appreciate the \ngentleman. I am not without an understanding that there are people who \ndo have ideas which override other bigger ideas. I am simply saying to \nyou, Mr. Chairman, I stand in opposition to what the gentleman is \nattempting to do here, the next day, in a separate bill, to limit what \nwe did last night, when this body did understand that many people have \na strong viewpoint that supports the gentleman, and more people have a \nviewpoint that is against that.\n  That is not my point. My point is, we need to transcend that as a \nbody. And we did last night. We spoke very clearly. We need to support \nthe men and women of the United States military. And we do not believe \nthis is a stumbling block because we don't view what the gentleman is \nsaying is the critical and key issue. That is why I stand in opposition \nto what the gentleman is doing.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous \nconsent to reclaim my time.\n  The CHAIR. Is there an objection to the request of the gentleman from \nNew York?\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Objection.\n  The CHAIR. Objection is heard.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I move to strike the last word.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Sean Patrick Maloney).\n  Mr. SEAN PATRICK MALONEY of New York. Mr. Chair, I would like to \nagain express my thanks for my colleague's admiration. It is nice to \nhave admiration. It is better to have rights and it is better to be \ntreated equally and without condescension.\n  I would just note, Mr. Chairman, that the question remains unanswered \nof whether it is necessary to discriminate against gays and lesbians in \nFederal contracting to protect our country, to support our troops? Is \nit necessary to remove employment protections in employers covering 28 \nmillion Americans so that we can fight the war on ISIS? Is it necessary \nto protect ourselves in our houses of worship by discriminating in \nFederal contracting in businesses that are in the business of commerce \nand in private contracting?\n  It is a tired and old and false choice to suggest that we need to \ndiscriminate to keep ourselves safe, to keep ourselves free. And people \nin earlier times have made those arguments, and they have, one after \nanother, been reversed.\n  So the notion that because this House did it last night, it can't get \nit right today, is at odds with a lot of American history. This House \ngot a lot of things wrong for a lot of people for a lot of years. And \nthen finally, slowly, almost despite ourselves, we figured out that we \ncan be safe and free and equal. And in fact, becoming more equal in \nsome ways makes us safer because it is the promotion of our values \nthrough our actions and our ideas and our words, not just our weapons \nthat promote our values around the world.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for his \nkindness.\n  I want to briefly join in the gentleman's recounting of our history, \nand I want to remind people of the eloquent statement of the Attorney \nGeneral, Attorney General Lynch, who indicated that civil rights is a \nvery large tent, and it embraces all Americans.\n  Whether it is religious freedom or religious rights, or whether it is \ncivil rights issues dealing with the race and ethnicity of Americans, \nwe have always overcome.\n  I believe that the men and women of the United States military \ndeserve better than to have the kind of poisonous amendments that \nundermine the very reason that they put on the uniform, for us to be \nfree, to speak freely, to associate, and to stand as who we are.\n  I am saddened because my history is a reminder that I did not stand \nequal in this Nation, either as a woman or an African American, or even \nas an immigrant, which my grandparents were.\n  So I join in pleading with this House to not, in any way, strip us of \ncivil rights and tear up the Constitution, the 14th Amendment, the \nFifth Amendment of due process. That would be shame on us.\n  I join the gentleman in his amendment, and I ask that we consider \nthose who we like and who we dislike. They are Americans, and they \ndeserve the right to be respected under the law.\n  I would ask that the gentleman's amendment be accepted, voted on, \nrespected; and let us be the Americans that our Constitution dictates \nand our flag says we are.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The CHAIR.

The Clerk will report the last three lines of the bill.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Military Construction and \n     Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2017''.\n\n  Mr. DENT. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise and \nreport the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the \nrecommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as \namended, do pass.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nThompson of Pennsylvania) having assumed the chair, Mr. Collins of \nGeorgia, Chair of the Committee of the Whole House on the state of the \nUnion, reported that that Committee, having had under consideration the \nbill (H.R. 4974) making appropriations for military construction, the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies for the fiscal \nyear ending September 30, 2017, and for other purposes, directed him to \nreport the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the \nCommittee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be \nagreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  For what purpose does the gentleman from Maryland, the minority whip, \nseek recognition?\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HOYER. I want to raise a parliamentary inquiry, initially, with \nreference to the fact that Mr. Ryan, our Speaker, has told us that, if \npeople were in the well, the vote would be held open.\n  I was standing in the well. No one came or no one had the courage to \ncome into the well to change their vote. But notwithstanding that, the \nvote kept changing.\n  Mr. Speaker, from a parliamentary perspective, how is that possible?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request \nfor changes.\n  Mr. HOYER. I saw no one come to the desk to change their vote, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Does the gentleman have a parliamentary \ninquiry?\n  Mr. HOYER. The parliamentary inquiry is: How can the vote change when\n\n[[Page H2866]]\n\nno one comes to the well to change their vote?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair may not yet have made a request \nfor changes.\n  Mr. HOYER. I didn't hear the Chair request change. But I do know \nthat, from my own personal observation, not one of those Members who \napparently changed their vote--because it kept changing on the board--\ncame to this well and had the courage to change from green to red or \nred to green.\n  How is that possible, Mr. Speaker?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has not stated a parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The question is on the amendments.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n                         Parliamentary Inquiry\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I have a parliamentary inquiry.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman will state his parliamentary \ninquiry.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I did not hear and, therefore, was not able \nto ask for a recorded vote on the motion to rise. The Speaker did not \narticulate that so the House could hear it, and I request a vote on the \nmotion to rise.\n  Now, the Speaker may tell me we are past that point, but the fact of \nthe matter is, nobody on this House floor heard the Speaker articulate \nthe issue of whether the Committee ought to rise.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The House is definitely past that point.\n  Is the gentleman seeking a recorded vote?\n  Mr. HOYER. On the motion to rise, yes, sir.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the \nadoption of the amendments.\n  Mr. HOYER. I ask for a recorded vote on the adoption of the \namendment.\n  Which amendment is the Speaker talking about?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair has put the question on the \namendments reported from the Committee of the Whole.\n  Mr. HOYER. Yes, I do.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A recorded vote is requested.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my \nrequest for a recorded vote.\n  It is my understanding that because the amendment was defeated, \nmagically, without anybody coming to the well to change their vote, by \ngiving to the majority the right to have the ability, without coming to \nthe well and telling America that you were going to change a vote.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman's request is withdrawn.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 241, \nnoes 183, not voting 9, as follows:\n\n

Madam Speaker, I rise for the purpose of inquiring of the \nschedule for the week to come.\n  Madam Speaker, I thought I saw the whip. I am prepared to yield to \nsomeone to tell us the schedule for the week to come.\n  Pending someone telling me about the schedule for the week to come, \nlet me observe, as someone who has served, Madam Speaker, in this House \nfor a very extended period of time--some 36 years--I was here in the \nera not too long ago, but long ago--when, if we had done to the \nRepublicans what was done to us, what was done to switch votes so that \ndiscrimination could prevail, there would be outrage expressed long \ninto the night from our Republican colleagues who would accuse us of \nundermining democracy, undermining this House, and making the House \nless than it should be.\n  217 people stood up and said: We ought not discriminate. And then, \nvery frankly, Mr. Speaker, the leadership on the Republican side \nstarted its activity. And I have been the majority leader, I have been \nthe whip. I understand that process. And they reached out to people and \nsaid: No, let us be able to discriminate. Let contractors be able to \ndiscriminate.\n  Mr. Speaker, seven people who had voted not to allow discrimination \ndecided perhaps that principle was not as important as they thought \njust a minute or so before. I have a list of those names here--a \nlamentable list of people who did the right thing, who stood up for \nnondiscrimination, and then were opportuned to change their vote. And \nthe Record reflects, Mr. Speaker, sadly, that they changed their vote.\n  I won't characterize those votes, because that would not be in order \non this floor. And they will have themselves to look at tonight in the \nmirror and explain to themselves whether their first vote was a \nprincipled vote, or whether they had a Damascus Road experience in the \nfew minutes that transpired between their voting not to allow \ndiscrimination, until they later--just a few minutes later--at the \nopportuning of some of their leaders, voted to allow discrimination. A \nsad day, Mr. Speaker, in the history of the House.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  I still see no leader, unless Mr. Dent, who I have great respect for, \nwants to tell us what the schedule is for next week. I would be glad to \nyield to him for that purpose.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to say that the majority leader is not here. The \nmajority leader has a very happy day today, and I congratulate him. His \nson is graduating from Georgetown, and he obviously needs to be there.\n  I was hoping someone else could tell us the schedule.\n  At this point in time, I would be glad to yield to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Sessions), my friend, the chairman of the Rules Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to politely offer a \nviewpoint. I believe that we do not view that the issue was \ndiscrimination. We have the viewpoint that, earlier in the week, we\n\n[[Page H2868]]\n\nbrought forth a bill that passed 40-2 in the Committee on Armed \nServices, and that bill was brought forth to the Rules Committee, and \nwe held hours and hours and hours and hours of hearing that Republicans \nand Democrats were not only welcome to attend, but did attend. The \ndebate that we had on the issue was very full and was brought forth not \nonly at the Rules Committee, but also on this floor. A decision therein \nwas made. There was an opportunity for our Members to vote, and that is \nexactly what they did.\n  And I am sure the gentleman would want every single Member to vote \nand have time to think about that vote until the time that the vote \nclosed, and that is exactly what happened.\n  So a characterization that this was discrimination would not be, in \nmy opinion, fair or correct, from our perspective.\n  And I appreciate the gentleman allowing me a chance to amplify that \nevery Member of this body is entitled to their vote, and every Member \nof this body, without questioning, in my opinion, that vote, should be \nafforded that opportunity.\n  So I stand on behalf of Republicans to say that we followed \nprocesses; we are following procedures; and we are following the \nopportunity for a Member of Congress to vote as they choose, and try \nnot to impugn or to test that with applying the word \n``discrimination,'' which I feel is not accurate under our intent.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding me time.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments. And the gentleman \nwill observe, I have neither mentioned the names, nor did I impugn \ntheir integrity or their motivation.\n  What I said and what I will repeat is, initially they voted for an \namendment that said there shall not be discrimination by contractors \nwho get government money. That is what the amendment said. And they \nvoted against discrimination, and for that amendment.\n  But in a short period of time, they changed that vote, resulting in, \nnot becoming law yet, but this House saying to the administration: You \ncannot require contractors not to discriminate. That was the effect of \nit. And characterizing the effect of a vote is what our debate is \nabout, what our country's values are about, what our country's future \nis about, and the respect we have for every citizen in this country, \nendowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights. And we ought \nnot preclude those through discrimination.\n  That I can characterize without impugning motives. But the effect of \nthe vote, we had 217 people for nondiscrimination right up until the \nlast moment. And by the way, the last moment was far beyond what \nSpeaker Ryan has said ought to be the end of votes.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HOYER. If I could just finish my sentence, I will certainly do \nthat.\n  I talked to the Parliamentarians. Interestingly, the presiding \nofficer did not ask: Does any Member want to change his vote? Because \nonce that, as I understand it, is intoned, then the ability to change \none's vote, except to come forward and be seen in changing your vote, \nwas not stated, which I suggest to the chairman of the Rules Committee, \nwho knows the rules very well, is unusual--perhaps not against the \nrules--but unusual.\n  And the vote was an extended vote. The Speaker, Speaker Ryan, has \ntalked to us from the rostrum, saying that we want to keep votes to a \nlimited period of time. Particularly, I would suggest, we all want to \nkeep votes to a limited period of time when it is a so-called getaway \nday.\n  But in this instance, that did not occur. In this instance, to change \nfrom 217 to a lesser number that was a losing number--215-214, I \nbelieve, was the final vote--excuse me, 212-213, 212 ``ayes.'' So five \nvotes were switched, net. However, one person voted late. Again, seven \npeople changed their vote.\n  You are correct. They had a right to do that, but the consequences of \nthat vote are subject to debate. And I raise for you, for this House, \nand for the American people, that the changing of those seven votes \nresulted in this House saying to the President of the United States: \nYou cannot tell contractors that they cannot discriminate.\n  That, I think, was unfortunate.\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Thank you very much.\n  First of all, let me state this: I am a Republican. We do not \ndiscriminate. We attempt to follow the law, and the gentleman knows \nthat.\n  We make laws, and those laws can be subject to interpretations of \nwhat is and what is not, but we follow the law, and the gentleman knows \nthat. And we follow the law, and my party follows the law.\n  Secondly, the decision had previously been made the night before. We \nwere not trying to do that today. It was, once again, allowed under the \nrules because the gentleman accurately--whether it is appropriate or \nnot, that is up to him--brought forth, under an open rule, a limiting \namendment.\n  But we had decided this the night before. And when people recognized \nwhat had happened, that this was a vote that had happened the night \nbefore, off of a committee vote out of the Committee on Armed Services \nthat was 40-2, there were people who then recognized what they were \ndoing.\n  It is not unusual to have people vote and then change their vote. I \nhave done that also. But the rules were followed despite, perhaps, \ndifferent procedural ways in which a person is in the Chair.\n  So I will tell you, I respect the gentleman, and you know me well.\n  Mr. HOYER. I do.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would not stand up here if I were for fear of one \nsecond of not being able to understand you and you understand me. I \nunderstand you.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. And I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for his comments.\n  But let me make an observation. I wish the gentleman would stay in \nthe well because he might want to respond.\n  I did not accuse the Republican Party of discriminating. I will not, \nat this point in time, hazard an opinion on that fact.\n  However, I want to recall to the gentleman that, in the Armed \nServices Committee, after due consideration, the Armed Services \nCommittee voted not to discriminate, not to discriminate against women, \nnot to say to women: Yes, you can serve, but you don't have to sign up \nfor the draft.\n\n  Many of us felt that if you are going to ask young men to sign up for \nthe draft, young women ought to be treated equally. We felt not to do \nso was discrimination.\n  That amendment passed in the committee and came to the Rules \nCommittee--my understanding is--without a vote, without discussion. The \nrule that was issued from the Rules Committee said that, upon adoption \nof that rule, the adopted amendment in the Armed Services Committee, \nwithout a singular vote on this floor of the House, would be defeated.\n  That, I say to the gentleman, was neither regular order, nor was it \ngiving us an ability to make a decision on that issue. And I believe, I \npersonally believe, that it results in continuing discrimination \nagainst young men and young women, one of which has to sign up, the \nother whom does not; but they both have to serve, or can serve \nvoluntarily in the Armed Forces of the United States.\n  So we may have a difference of opinion on whether or not that was, in \nfact, discrimination. But I will tell the gentleman that I was not \nhappy, and I am still not happy that we did not have a vote on the \nfloor about what we perceive to be discrimination.\n  And I regret that the Rules Committee chose to hide in its rule the \nrepeal of what the Armed Services Committee adopted.\n  If the gentleman wants to respond, I will yield to him.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I will concur that I, in fact, did offer in the bill a \nself-executed portion. Not trying to take advantage of the gentleman, \nit had nothing to do with the draft. So I will agree that I did take a \npiece.\n  And to save this body, because a number of people who did vote for it \nin committee--which became a voice vote--did wish to change their \nopinion. But it had nothing to do with the draft, sir.\n  Mr. HOYER. Reclaiming my time, it seems what the gentleman is saying \nis that people vote not to discriminate, and then some time a little \nlater on, they have an epiphany that perhaps discrimination is okay. \nPerhaps that is what the gentleman said.\n\n[[Page H2869]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SESSIONS. I would ask an indulgence. It had nothing to do with \ndiscrimination. It had to do with a new policy.\n  And it is true that I did rule and put a self-executing rule in that \ndid answer the question about the desire of the committee to handle \nthis issue, and I did it accordingly. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, it appears that no one is going to be able to tell me \nwhat the schedule is for the week to come. I will tell you that that is \nunfortunate.\n  I hope there is a schedule for the week to come because there is a \nlot to be done. We haven't finalized Zika. We passed a bill here which \nwe think was inadequate.\n  We haven't dealt with Flint.\n  We need to pass Puerto Rico restructuring. I think they have made \nsome progress on that. I congratulate the Speaker and the leader for \nfacilitating that progress.\n  We don't have a voting rights bill scheduled. We need to do that.\n  There are a number of other serious pieces of legislation this House \nneeds to consider. We are going to go out next week, and we will have \nno colloquy next week, Mr. Speaker. There will be no opportunity to \ndiscuss the schedule for, obviously, the break, and we will have no \nschedule for June or the weeks thereafter to do some of the serious \nbusiness that confronts us and to help some of the people in this \ncountry who need help.\n  Having said that, Mr. Speaker, it is clear that nobody on the other \nside is going to have any response.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2869-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 2814.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commend \nseveral communities in Pennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District that \nare taking a stand in the battle against our Nation's opioid abuse and \nheroin epidemic.\n  Last evening I chaired a hearing here on Capitol Hill on this \nepidemic, and just this morning I learned of two townhall meetings, one \nheld last night in Titusville in Crawford County and the other held \nTuesday evening in Ridgway in Elk County.\n  These communities, like countless others across Pennsylvania and our \nNation, have witnessed firsthand the tragic impact of this epidemic. \nElk County is ranked ninth in Pennsylvania in overdose deaths per \npopulation of 100,000 people, while Crawford County has seen its \noverdose deaths double in the past 4 years.\n  I am proud to see these communities come together to see what can be \ndone to help turn the tide against the scourge of prescription drug \nabuse and heroin use.\n  I am also proud of the package passed last week--18 bills--here in \nthe House which will make grant funding available to State and local \ngovernments for the creation of opioid reduction programs, create a \ntask force to review prescribing practices, and care for babies who are \nborn opioid dependent.\n  In the future, I look forward to further partnerships with Federal, \nState, and local officials, along with these communities, in winning \nthis battle.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2869-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VA MEDICAL MARIJUANA\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, today the House did do one good thing, and \nthat was to take a major step forward with the historic passage of an \namendment that removes the barriers for our Veterans Administration \nhealth professionals to discuss alternative treatments--specifically, \nmedical marijuana--with their patients in States like Nevada, where it \nis legal.\n  This comes on the heels of action last week addressing the opioid \nepidemic that is plaguing our Nation, and it is especially \nheartbreaking in our veteran community where these drugs are being \noverprescribed for pain treatment and PTSD.\n  The amendment passed today, which I was pleased to offer and to \nsupport, will provide additional tools for our medical professionals in \nthe treatment of our veterans so they won't have to resort to opioids.\n  I am proud that this amendment did have bipartisan support; but \nmoving forward, we must continue to reform our outdated policies and \nlaws and bring Congress into step with the State legislatures in over \nhalf of the States in the country that have moved forward on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2869-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2869]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING GREG PARKER\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nGreg Parker, founder and president of Parker's Market and gas stations \nin coastal Georgia and South Carolina.\n  Mr. Parker found his way to an immensely successful business through \nhard work and dedication. Mr. Parker's father ran a gas station in \nMidway, Georgia, allowing Mr. Parker to learn the business through \npumping gas and cleaning customers' windshields.\n  After graduation from the University of Georgia, Mr. Parker began to \nwork relentlessly in his father's gas station. He managed a convenience \nstore, cooked food for customers, and also pumped gas and cleaned \nwindshields.\n  Now Parker's has 45 stores up and down the coast of Georgia and South \nCarolina, with a total of 600 employees. Furthermore, Parker's Market \nplans to build 17 new stores in the next 13 months.

Although he \nplanned to become a teacher, he ultimately followed his passion and \nbecame an award-winning singer, songwriter, and performer in both the \nU.S. and Mexico markets.\n  He started his career with Tejano band David Lee Garza y Los \nMusicales in the late 1980s, and was remembered for sharing the stage \nseveral times with another Tejano music legend, Selena.\n  Emilio, lovingly known as the Garth Brooks of Tejano, was widely \ncredited with introducing Tejano music into the mainstream that we know \nand love today.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor, and I also rise to \nchallenge.\n  My honoring is to acknowledge the National Law Enforcement Officers \nMemorial and to honor those who have fallen in battle, and to \nacknowledge the fact that an officer is killed somewhere in the United \nStates every 60 hours, and there are also 58,930 assaults and 15,404 \ninjuries.\n  So I salute those who have fallen and offer my sympathy to their \nfamilies, but I recognize that it is important to honor them, and we do \nhonor them.\n  That is why I rise today with sadness on what we did on the floor of \nthe House, where we actually said to the LGBT community that serve in \nthe United States military or by contracting work serve the United \nStates Government, that you are not equal. How sad that is. I am \nlooking forward to this House, next week, overturning that dastardly \nprovision that says that one American who comes under the Constitution \nis not equal.\n  Finally, let me say that we are suffering from the possibility of the \nZika virus, and this House must fully fund for the Zika virus epidemic \nthat is coming.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week the nation observes National Police Week, as \nwe have since President John F. Kennedy first proclaimed National Peace \nOfficers Memorial Day on May 15, 1962.\n  The National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial is the nation's \nmonument to law enforcement officers who have died in the line of duty.\n  Dedicated on October 15, 1991, the Memorial honors federal, state and \nlocal law enforcement officers who have made the ultimate sacrifice for \nthe safety and protection of our nation and its people.\n  Carved on its walls are the names of 20,789 officers who have been \nkilled in the line of duty throughout U.S. history, dating back to the \nfirst known death in 1791.\n  Added to the Wall this year will be the names of the 123 police \nofficers killed in the line of duty in 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, enshrined on the Memorial Wall of Honor also are the \nnames of 1,695 fallen peace officers from the state of Texas, the most \nof any state, including 114 members of the Houston Police Department \nwho gave their lives to keep their city safe.\n  I include a list of these fallen heroes from Houston, Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, today there are more than 900,000 law enforcement \npersonnel serving the people of our country, the highest amount ever.\n  About 12 percent of them are female. These brave men and women risk \ntheir lives to keep the peace and keep us safe but they are too often \ntaken by the violence they are working to prevent. Every year, a law \nenforcement officer is killed somewhere in the United States every 60 \nhours, and there are also 58,930 assaults against our law officers each \nyear, resulting in 15,404 injuries.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a member of the Law Enforcement Caucus I am proud to \nrepresent the people of the 18th Congressional District of Texas in \npaying tribute to the 123 fallen heroes who will be joining the 20,789 \ngallant men and women who gave the last full measure of devotion to the \ncommunities they took an oath to protect and serve.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, let me pay tribute to one of the finest \npublic servants America has produced, Lee Patrick Brown, who is perhaps \nbest known to the law enforcement community as the ``The Father of \nCommunity Policing.''\n  Lee Brown was appointed in 1982 as the first African-American Chief \nof Police of the Houston Police Department, where he pioneered \ntechniques in community policing to reduce crime that still used \nthroughout the country today.\n  Lee Brown enjoyed a long and distinguished career leading several of \nthe nation's most important and largest police departments, including \nthose of Atlanta, Georgia, and New York City, before becoming the first \nAfrican American Mayor of Houston, Texas in 1997.\n  Following Lee Brown as Chief of the Houston Police Department were \nthe following good and true public servants: Elizabeth Watson (1990-\n1992); Sam Nuchia (1992-1997); Clarence Bradford (1997-2004); Harold \nHunt (2004-2009); and Charles McClelland (2010-2016).\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for a moment of silence in memory of the officers \nwhose names will be added to the National Peace Officers Memorial Wall \nof Honor.\n\n   Houston Law Enforcement Officers Memorialized on the Wall of Honor\n\n       1.

Mr. Speaker, I rise this afternoon to \nrecognize the remarkable career of Lauren Morris Schulman. After more \nthan 13 years, Ms. Schulman is retiring as the Florida political \ndirector of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, AIPAC, the \nlargest pro-Israel advocacy organization in the country.\n  Lauren began her political career 26 years ago and served in a \nvariety of positions with the late Congressman Bill Lehman, E. Clay \nShaw, Jr., Florida State Senator Gwen Margolis, and Miami-Dade County \nCommissioner Sally Heyman.\n  Lauren has adroitly mobilized and engaged Florida's pro-Israel \ncommunity. She has led our citizen activists in building relationships \nwith Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle, key to the success \nof the pro-Israel movement.\n  Lauren has helped all Floridians understand how, against all odds, \nIsrael has become a prospering democracy whose groundbreaking \ncontributions in technology, medicine, and environmental innovation \nhave benefited the world.\n  Lauren's commitment to our community and the State of Israel is \nexemplary, and I am proud to call her my constituent and good friend. \nOur loss is her husband Cliff's and her family's gain. I wish a hearty \nmazel tov to Lauren and thank her for her invaluable work.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/19/house-section/article/H2871-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2871]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    ADJOURNMENT FROM THURSDAY, MAY 19, 2016, TO MONDAY, MAY 23, 2016\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is amazing sometimes the way, in the \nheat of dispute, argument--sometimes\n\n[[Page H2872]]\n\nany of us can have it happen to us--people don't think clearly.\n  I have been here for nearly 11\\1/2\\ years in Congress. It is a \ntremendous honor to get to be the servant for the people of east Texas. \nBut in that 11\\1/2\\ years, 4 of them the Democrats were in the \nmajority, and my friend from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) was the majority \nleader during those 4 years, and the rules never changed with regard to \nhow the electronic voting worked.\n  For the last 11\\1/2\\ years, it has always been the same. And that is, \nwe could take our voting card--and it has a little computer chip in it. \nIt doesn't matter which we way put our card in the box. If the blue \nlight on the box is lit, it means that box is open for voting. Most \nevery other row has a voting box on the back.\n  We take our card, and we put it in the slot whichever way. It \nrecognizes the one-of-a-kind computer chip that belongs to that 1 of \n435 Members, and then you can hit the green button for ``yea,'' the red \nbutton the ``nay,'' the yellow button for ``present.'' The blue light \nis on there. It is next in order on the box, but it can't be pushed. It \njust lets you know the box is open for voting.\n  Toward the end of a vote, particularly a 15-minute vote, the Speaker \nwill not have gaveled the vote dead, but oftentimes the box goes dead \nright before the gavel comes down. Even to that point, you can still \nchange your vote, but it is just when the blue light goes out, you \ncan't do it at the box. You have to come down to the well.\n  What I have noticed every year for the last 11\\1/2\\ years that I have \nbeen here, if we are voting on a 15-minute vote--and all of us have \nprobably done it at one time or another--if you need to change your \nvote, maybe you looked up and, for example, sometimes one person has \nmultiple amendments, and you see their name and it is their amendment, \nand you say, ``Oh, I was not going to vote for that,'' and you vote \n``no'' and you need to change your vote to ``yes,'' you can still \nchange your vote at the box.\n  On a 15-minute vote, once you get past 5 minutes, you normally have \nto come down to the well and get a green card for ``yea,'' a red card \nfor ``nay,'' or a yellow card for ``present'' or ``abstaining'' and \nchange your vote that way. But on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote, \nif you need to change your vote, you didn't understand the \nsignificance, it constantly happens that people change their vote.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  But to change their vote, if you have your voting card, you have been \nable to change it at the box on a 5-minute vote or a 2-minute vote. \nEvery now and then, before the gavel comes down, the blue light will go \noff on the box, so you can no longer change your vote or vote at that \nbox. That is when you hear someone yelling, ``One more, one more,'' and \nthey come rushing down the aisle to get the vote in before the gavel \ncomes down.\n  Now, in 11\\1/2\\ years, only one time has there been a massive and \ngross violation of the rules the way we have followed them in bringing \na vote to a conclusion. I can understand my friend from Maryland being \nsensitive, because this happened on his watch as majority leader. But \nRepublicans were in the minority, and yet there was a vote. I don't \neven remember if it was a bill or an amendment. I think it was an \namendment. But the Republicans voting against the amendment had enough \nDemocrats voting with us that we were bringing down a Democratic \namendment or bill, and it was left open for enough time that anybody \nthat wanted to change could have changed.\n  When the Democrat in the chair felt that enough time had passed, no \nother changes were being made, and the measure being voted on had \nfailed, then the gavel came down. The rule has always been that when \nthe gavel comes down, there can be no further changing of the vote.\n  Perhaps, the majority leader, at that time Hoyer, had forgotten. But \nthat was the time they violated their own rules. A subsequent \ninvestigation confirmed that. They violated the rules and allowed \nsomeone whose arm they were twisting to vote after the gavel came down \nto change the vote, change the outcome of the vote.\n  That didn't happen here today. And the vote wasn't held open very \nlong at all after the end of the time running out. Sometimes, whether \nit is Democrats or Republicans in the majority, it runs to zero. But \nif, in the opinion of the Chair or the Speaker, there is somebody \nwanting to change their vote or somebody that is making a good faith \neffort to get here to vote, they will leave the vote open.\n  Sometimes, like when Speaker Pelosi was meeting with President Obama \nat the White House and wasn't getting back in time, or Majority Leader \nHoyer, and they weren't getting back in time, well, that vote would be \nheld open to give them time well beyond the zero, zero, zero, so they \ncould cast that vote. Nobody objected because we knew they were making \na good faith effort to get here.\n  I understand sometimes we forget things that we have been doing for a \nnumber of years. And especially in the heat of debate and a verbal \nbattle here on the floor, people can forget what they have been doing \nfor many, many years. But that has been the way the voting and the \nrules on voting have worked and been interpreted for many years.\n  So I was greatly surprised to hear the former majority leader \nchallenging on the basis that people didn't come into the well to \nchange their vote on either a 5-minute or a 2-minute vote. Well, they \nhave always been able to change their vote. The voting boxes were open.\n  Anyway, we all have those mental lapses where we forget things that \nwe have been doing for years. I mean, it just happens, and especially \nhere on the floor. There is nothing to be taken from former Majority \nLeader Hoyer forgetting how the rules were when he was majority leader \nand forgetting how they have been all these years since, so no hard \nfeelings. He just had a mental lapse and forgot how the rules have been \never since he has been here the entire time.\n  There has been a great deal of to-do and a lot of wailing and \ngnashing of teeth about what I would term the ``Iranian crisis'' \nbecause it truly is a crisis that this administration has enabled Iran \nto go ahead and develop nuclear weapons to continue down that path. \nEven though they are supposed to be prohibited, they continued to \ndevelop missiles that eventually will be capable of delivering nuclear \nweapons onto the United States. They have got missiles to deliver them \non to Israel right now.\n  But as Prime Minister Netanyahu so ably has pointed out from this \nvery rostrum right up here, those missiles they are developing now are \nnot for Israel. They can already reach Israel. Those are for the Great \nSatan.\n  So it was deeply troubling to hear the confessions and admissions of \nthe White House adviser consultant mouthpiece, Ben Rhodes, reveal that \nthe administration--and I am being careful not to use any specific \nnames. I am addressing generally the administration--that the \nadministration had to lie to the American people and had to lie to the \nHouse and Senate about how evil Iran really was and had to talk about \nhow moderate they were when, actually, the fact is, apparently, under \nthe so-called moderate President Rouhani, there have been more people \nput to death than even under the former President Ahmadinejad. This man \nis no moderate.\n  Though the American people were fed lies about the negotiations, they \nwere having to negotiate, either directly or indirectly, with the \nAyatollah Khamenei. They don't make big decisions like a nuclear \nweapons deal, unless the religious leader, the Ayatollah Khamenei, \nactually agreed, just like his predecessor, the Ayatollah Khomeini.\n  So just like with the revelations about ObamaCare, now that we have \nhad someone working behind the scenes with the administration who \nrevealed, yes, the reason ObamaCare passed was because people are such \nfools, they were able to fool them into voting for a bill that was \nreally not anything like what was being represented. And yet along \ncomes Ben Rhodes, and he admits they did the same thing on ObamaCare \nthat they did on the Iranian treaty.\n  Now, I understand the administration has never called it a treaty, \nand there are people in the Senate who have not had the courage to call \nit a treaty, but it is a treaty. You can't change a nuclear \nproliferation treaty\n\n[[Page H2873]]\n\nwith an executive agreement or an executive order. It can't be done. It \nhas to be done with another treaty. So, clearly, there are a number of \nthings that made clear that the Iranian deal was a treaty.\n  It should have been brought to the floor of the Senate. It still \nshould be. It is time. You can do it any time this year. You could do \nit with 51 votes of the Senate setting aside cloture and saying, the \nIranian treaty is a treaty, it is going to allow Iran to have nuclear \nweapons that will allow them to devastate both the Little Satan, in \ntheir opinion Israel, and the Great Satan, the United States, and it \nneeds to be stopped.\n  So, hopefully, the courage will abound eventually in the Senate and \nwe will get that vote. And therefore, people with standing could go to \ncourt and stop the flood of millions of dollars to Iran, which has \nalready said that with the billions of dollars, $100 billion to $150 \nbillion in the first year this administration is going to make \navailable, they are going to commit so much more to terrorism than they \never had.\n  Then we get this story just a few days ago from the Washington Free \nBeacon entitled, Iran Shows Off Third Underground Missile Site. It \nsays:\n  ``Iran's military recently publicized a third underground missile \nfacility and showed the launch of a new ballistic missile through the \ntop of a mountain.\n  ``It was the third time since October that Tehran showed off an \nextensive network of underground missile facilities. The new video, \nhowever, for the first time, shows a missile launch from one of the \ncountry's underground launch facilities.\n  ``Disclosure of the new video comes as Iran this week conducted the \nthird launch of a ballistic missile since January, when the nuclear \ndeal aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear weapons development went into \neffect.''\n  And I would submit, that part of the story is inaccurate. It is being \nconsidered to have gone into effect, but it is a treaty that was never \nratified by the U.S. Senate, and it is an ineffective treaty. But the \nObama administration is choosing to act as if the Iranian agreement \nreally is an effective treaty. Iran has shown they have no intention of \nfollowing that agreement. They have violated it a number of times.\n  And the only reason Iran would have the gall to go forward and say, \nHey, look, we have got a third underground missile site, we are going \nto let you see a launch, we don't care that the world knows that we are \nviolating this last agreement with Obama and Kerry and Wendy Sherman \nthat helped give North Korea nuclear weapons in the Clinton \nadministration, we don't care that they know because we have now seen \nthat this administration will not stand up to us, they will let us push \nthem around, they will even let us take their soldiers or their naval \nofficers, their naval seamen captive, violate virtually every treaty on \nthe treatment of prisoners, humiliate the American sailors, force them \nto lie on camera, and after all that is said and done, we will get the \nSecretary of State to come back and thank us.\n  I mean, it is like from ``Animal House,'' Kevin Bacon being beaten \nsaying, Thank you, sir, may I have another? Iran has figured out they \nare the senior pledges, and this administration will take a beating and \nkeep asking, Thank you, sir, may I have another? And Iran is all that \nwilling to give them another and another.\n  The trouble is this isn't a comedy movie, this is real life. \nChristians and Jews are being targeted, persecuted, and killed in \ngreater numbers than at any time in the history of the world. The \nMiddle East is on fire, except Israel is a place of stability. But if \nthis administration has its will, it will become a powder keg before \nlong as well.\n  Libya had become more stable. And after the United States went into \nIraq, because Saddam Hussein continued to refuse to abide by the orders \nof the U.N. that were passed by huge majorities, requiring them to \ndisclose what they had, he wouldn't comply, most everybody was--\nincluding those who now say, I voted for it, I really wasn't for it--\nbut, at the time, people thought, look, this guy must have something to \nhide because he is certainly not letting us get in to see what weapons \nhe has. Other reports indicate that they had been taken from Iraq and \nwere no longer present.\n  But either way, it scared Qadhafi enough that, as some of the Israeli \nleaders have told me, we were shocked when you provided the firepower, \nthe planes, and the bombs that made it possible to eliminate Qadhafi \nbecause, yeah, he had blood on his hands before 2003, but after 2003, \nhe helped you more in fighting terrorism than anybody but us, and you \ntook him out, and look what happened as a result.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  It turned Egypt upside down. There are problems in Albania, problems \nall over North Africa, problems for the Middle East and North Africa \nboth, problems coming down now of radical Islamists in Nigeria and \nother, more central African countries. They have paid a heavy price for \nthe improper leadership of this administration here in the United \nStates. It is just tragic how many have lost their lives already.\n  Then we hear reports that in Nigeria--and I heard it when I was in \nNigeria and was trying to help the Nigerian families whose daughters \nhad been abducted--that this administration, behind the scenes, was \nsaying: Look, we will help you with Boko Haram, with the terrorism--\nalthough they don't like to use that word--with the radical extremism \nthat is occurring in Nigeria. If you will change your laws, violate \nyour religious beliefs, allow same-sex marriage, and pay for abortion, \nthen we will help you.\n  As one Nigerian Catholic bishop said: Our religious beliefs are not \nfor sale, not to the U.S. President, not to anybody.\n  I have an article that goes on about the situation with Iran. This is \nalso from May 12: ``Kerry's Peculiar Message About Iran for European \nBanks.''\n  It reads:\n  ``U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry met Thursday in London with a \ngroup of European financial institutions for a discussion about \n`Iranian banking matters.' The meeting, which followed repeated \ncomplaints by Iranian officials that they aren't getting the benefit of \nthe bargain under the nuclear deal, was an effort by the State \nDepartment to persuade major non-U.S. banks that doing Iran-related \nbusiness is not only permitted following the relaxation of Iran \nsanctions, but is actually encouraged.\n  ``The irony will not be lost on these financial institutions. Most of \nthem were similarly gathered almost 10 years ago by U.S. Treasury Henry \nPaulson to discuss Iranian banking matters, but that discussion focused \non protecting the integrity of the global financial system against the \nrisk posed by Iran.\n  ``In the decade that followed, the George W. Bush and Obama \nadministrations, as well as the U.K. and other governments, the \nEuropean Union, and the United Nations, all imposed extensive sanctions \ntargeting Iran's illicit and deceptive conduct. Banks were briefed \nextensively and repeatedly by the U.S. Treasury Department on the \ndetails of Iran's conduct. The Financial Action Task Force, the global \nstandard-setting body for anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist \nfinancing, warned about the financial crime risks posed by Iran as a \njurisdiction. The result: Iran became a financial pariah.\n  ``No one has claimed that Iran has ceased to engage in much of the \nsame conduct for which it was sanctioned, including actively supporting \nterrorism and building and testing ballistic missiles; but now \nWashington is pushing non-U.S. banks to do what is still illegal for \nAmerican banks to do.\n  ``This is a very odd position for the U.S. Government to be taking.''\n  It is shocking that this administration continues to be complicit \nwith the largest supporter of terrorism in the world.\n  How many lives will be lost because of this complicity?\n  There was a time when America would not tolerate the kind of \ntreatment of Americans that occurred to our seamen when they were taken \ncaptive. Not only did we not come to their defense, we praised Iran and \nthanked them for being so gracious for the manner in which they abused \nour sailors.\n  This article goes on. It reads:\n  ``On the one hand, Washington is continuing to prohibit American \nbanks and companies from doing Iran-related business. In February, the \nFATF''--that is the Financial Action Task\n\n[[Page H2874]]\n\nForce--``reaffirmed its prior concerns about the 'serious threat' Iran \nposes to the international financial system, urging countries to apply \neffective countermeasures. The U.S. Treasury Department's designation \nof Iran, including its central bank and financial institutions, as a \nprimary money laundering concern also still stands. As part of that \ndesignation, Treasury determined that `the international financial \nsystem is increasingly vulnerable to the risk that otherwise \nresponsible financial institutions will, unwittingly, participate in \nIran's illicit activities.'\n  ``On the other hand, Mr. Kerry wants non-U.S. banks to do business \nwith Iran without a U.S. repudiation of its prior statements about the \nassociated financial crime risks. There are no assurances as to how \nsuch activity would subsequently be viewed by U.S. regulatory and law \nenforcement authorities, which might seek to take enforcement action \nagainst banks that enter the Iranian market and run afoul of \ncomplicated U.S. restrictions. The State Department neither controls \nnor plays any meaningful role in the enforcement decisions of these \nauthorities.\n  ``Washington has warned repeatedly that the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuard Corps controls broad swaths of the Iranian economy. The IRGC \nremains sanctioned by both the United States and the European Union \nbecause of the central role it plays in Iran's illicit conduct. When \nthe U.S., EU, and U.N. removed sanctions from several hundred Iranian \nbanks and companies, there were no assurances that the conduct of those \nbanks and companies had changed.\n  ``This will present a challenge for European banks. HSBC is \nendeavoring to implement consistent and high standards across its \nglobal operations, designed to combat financial crime and prevent abuse \nby illicit actors. We have more work to do, but achieving that \nobjective is one of our highest priorities. This approach is rightly \nexpected by our regulators, including in the U.K. and the U.S.\n  ``Our decisions will be driven by the financial crime risks and the \nunderlying conduct. For these reasons, HSBC has no intention of doing \nany new business involving Iran. Governments can lift sanctions, but \nthe private sector is still responsible for managing its own risk and, \nno doubt, will be held accountable if it falls short.''\n  That was from May 12, and it appears to be somebody who certainly \nknows the banking business.\n  I would like to comment a bit about, again, our illegal immigration \nproblems and our porous borders because the administration continues to \nact as if all is well--all is well--when it is not well.\n  An article from May 19: ``Previously Deported Illegal Alien Allegedly \nKilled Prom Teen.''\n  ``The man that Houston police say was driving drunk and evading \narrest when he crashed into a car, killing a young woman on her way \nhome from the prom, is listed by Federal officials as a previously \ndeported illegal alien.''\n  ``Edin Palacios-Rodas, a 27-year-old previously deported illegal \nalien from Guatemala, has now had an immigration detainer placed on him \nafter being processed into the Harris County Jail on one count of \nfelony murder and one count of felony evading resulting in death and \nserious bodily injury.''\n  It is still going on. With that going on, this administration \ncontinues to push for and has allies in Congress pushing for what they \nare calling sentencing reform when, actually, it won't be reform as \nmuch as it will be rather devastating. The pendulum on criminal justice \nswings back and forth. Most history shows that it has always been and \nprobably will always be, whether a totalitarian government or a \ndemocratic republic such as ours.\n\n  My friend in the Senate, Senator Jeff Sessions, has an article, \nagain, from May 19 that reads:\n  ``Senator Jeff Sessions warns that Congress must be careful to ensure \nthe sentencing reductions bills pending before Congress did not boost \nalready rising crime rates and `sign death warrants' for innocent \nvictims.''\n  ``The Sentencing Reform and Correction Act, which the Alabama \nRepublican opposes, hews to Obama's anti-law enforcement agenda and \ncould cost an enormous human toll, Senator Sessions said. `Frankly, \nthis is Obama's policy and the Attorney General who he's appointed, \nLoretta Lynch's policy, and Eric Holder's before her, to basically cut \npeople's sentences that have been lawfully imposed throughout this \ncountry, and it's impacting public safety and will continue to do so in \nthe future.'\n  ``The Senator also highlighted many high-profile cop killings as the \nObama administration makes police work more difficult.\n  ``He said, `In the last year, we've lost 123 police officers, 35 in \nthe first 4 months of 2016. Violent crimes and murders have increased \nacross the country at alarming rates. Let me just share with my \ncolleagues some of the things we're seeing in violent crime. Recently, \nthe Major Cities Chiefs of Police Association, a long-established \ngroup, called an emergency meeting to deal with the numbers I'm going \nto share with you today.'\n  ``The numbers I will quote represent the percentage increase in total \nmurders in the first quarter of this year, 2016, over the first quarter \n. . . of 2015. Las Vegas: 82 percent increase.''\n  This is the murder increase.\n  ``Dallas, Texas: 73 percent increase. Chicago: 70 percent. \nJacksonville, Florida: 67 percent. Newark, New Jersey: 60 percent \nincrease. Miami-Dade: 38 percent. Los Angeles: 33 percent.''\n  And on and on.\n  ``These are substantial increases in crime. According to FBI \nstatistics released just this year, the number of violent crimes \ncommitted across the country was up in the first half of 2015 compared \nwith the same period of 2014.''\n  So, actually, we are going up and up, and the percentage increase in \nthese cities of 82 percent, 73 percent, and a 70 percent increase is \neven more dramatic than that when you go back 2 years.\n  Sessions also quoted FBI Director James Comey's concerns about the \nrising tide of crime.\n  `` `I was very worried about it last fall, and I am, in many ways, \nmore worried because the numbers are not only going up, they're \ncontinuing to go up in most of those cities faster than they were going \nup last year. Something is happening. I don't know what the answer is, \nbut, holy cow, do we have a problem.'''\n  Yes, we do have a problem. One of the answers is mentioned in this \narticle, again, from May 19, entitled: ``Obama doesn't think rapists, \narmed robbers, drug dealers are criminals.'' I think I found the \neuphemism of the year.\n  ``According to Team Obama, criminals should now be declared `justice-\ninvolved individuals.'\n  ``The neo-Orwellianism comes to us from the bizarre flurry of last-\nminute dictates, regulations, and bone-chilling threats, collectively \nknown to fanboys as Obama's Gorgeous Good-bye.\n  ``In another of those smiley faced but deeply sinister `dear \ncolleague' letters sent to universities and colleges this week, Obama's \nEducation Secretary, John King, discouraged colleges from asking \napplicants whether they were convicted criminals.''\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  It used to be a matter of common sense. Most Americans wanted to \nknow.\n  Especially in dormitories that have now become co-ed, where you have \nmen and women living in and with and around each other, it was \nconsidered valuable information to know if your daughter was going to \nbe living in, around, or with a convicted rapist. That was thought to \nbe good information, but apparently that is no longer considered by \nthis administration as good information.\n  People all across America have shown an interest in knowing whether \nthere are child molesters in their neighborhood where their children \nare growing up and children are playing around the area. They want to \nknow if their child is at risk because they know there is a significant \nrecidivism rate, particularly among child molesters.\n  Yet, this administration says it is time to stop calling criminals \ncriminals. Again, that is in keeping with the unwillingness to call \nradical Islamist, as the Muslim leader of Egypt, our friend, President \nel-Sisi, calls it--I mean, it is radical Islamists. He has had the \ncourage to tell imams themselves that we have to get control again of \nIslam and wrestle it back away from the radical Islamists.\n\n[[Page H2875]]\n\n  As my friend, Carolyn Glick, pointed out in The Jerusalem Post, by \nthis administration's refusal to call radical Islam radical Islam, it \nbetrays our allies who are Muslim--like President el-Sisi in Egypt--who \nare wanting Muslims to stand up and say that these Islamists should not \nbe allowed to represent our religion because they know that they do.\n  When you have a man with multiple degrees in Islamic studies saying \nthat, yes, radical Islam is the ultimate Islam and, on the other hand, \nyou have a President who did go to school in Indonesia in Muslim \nschools and elementary school but does not have any degrees in Islamic \nstudies, like the world expert in Islamic studies, al-Qaradawi, well, \none is President of the United States with no degrees in Islamic \nstudies, and he says it is not Islam. But a man who has studied Islam \nhis whole life and has multiple degrees, including a Ph.D., says not \nonly is it Islam, as the head of ISIS as he is, this is Islam the way \nit should be.\n  We should be giving assistance to our allies, giving them cover by \nnot going on with this facade where this administration refuses to call \nradical Islam radical Islam. They call radical Islamic terrorism \nexactly what it is. They are not helping our friends around the world \nthat are trying to stand up and do the right thing.\n  You could go back to Libya, the attack of Benghazi. We now know from \nwhat has been gathered from emails and information that Secretary \nClinton basically told the President of Libya: We know that this \nBenghazi attack was not on a video, in essence, and that it was a \nplanned attack. She told her daughter.\n  Yet, she went out, as did Susan Rice, representing this \nadministration and told us all, oh, it was all about the video; telling \nvictims families that we are going to get the guy who did the video. \nVictims families from Benghazi have told me personally, when Secretary \nClinton said we are going to get the guys that did the videos, which \nshe now says she didn't say--how tragic is that?\n  So basically calling these victims' families liars. But the families \nsay, when she said we will get the guy that did the video, they were \ninfuriated. They said: We didn't care about the guy that did some \nvideo. We wanted our government to get the guys that killed our loved \none, and that was not the message.\n  You have to understand that there were a lot of things to do, there \nwere promises to keep, and miles to go before they slept. But we don't \nknow if they just went to bed and slept.\n  When they found out the personal ambassador of the Secretary of State \nwas missing, Clinton and President Obama, did they just go to bed?\n  They won't tell us.\n  We know President Obama had a very important engagement the next day. \nHe had to fly out early to Las Vegas for a big campaign speech. We \nknow. We understand. Hey, that was more pressing. We got that. We \nunderstand. To him, that was more pressing.\n  What do you do? Do you go to sleep when you get word that your \npersonal ambassador is missing?\n  For the first time since 1979, an ambassador ends up being killed. He \nwasn't given adequate protection.\n  Now, we are hearing more and more reports from people that the assets \nwere there to go help. They could have saved at least two, maybe more \nof the four, but they were not allowed go and save the American heroes.\n  Well, there is an article from Conservative Review entitled ``Busted: \nThe 10 Most Dangerous Myths About Criminal Justice Reform'' that is \nbeing pushed especially by this administration. And we do have some \ncolleagues here in the House and Senate that are as well.\n  ``Myth number one: The prison population keeps growing, even though \ncrime is declining.''\n  ``Fact: The D.C. intelligentsia argues our criminal justice system is \nin dire need of reform. But ask anyone outside the beltway, and they'll \ngive you a different definition of `broken.' Many Americans would agree \nthat current laws are too lenient on criminals and disregard the victim \nall too often. It was the tough reforms put into place during the \nReagan years and in the '90s that produced the sharpest decline in \nviolent crime on record. Those reforms, coupled with more aggressive \npolicing, led to the only positive social trend in public policy in \nrecent memory. That trend is now being reversed precisely as \nincarceration rates decline and Obama and his allies ratchet up the war \nagainst law enforcement. While correlation doesn't necessarily prove \ncausation, the correlation is indeed striking and in conjunction with \nthe defanging of local police departments, the release of tens of \nthousands of Federal prisoners can only result in exacerbating this \nnegative trajectory.''\n  From the information that the FBI provided to Senator Sessions, we \nknow about maybe less than 1 percent of Federal inmates in Federal \nprison are there for possession of a controlled substance; that most \nare there for more. Ninety-nine percent or so are there for more than \nthat.\n  But those that have been involved in the criminal justice system, \nboth in the State side, as I was, and on the Federal side--I mean, we \nwork with each other. And we know the Federal Government never had \ninterest, that I ever saw, in simple possession cases.\n  Where the Federal Government had interest is if a real bad guy--maybe \nhe had been involved in a shooting, a killing, a robbing, a \npossession--but they wanted him to turn on his boss so they could get \nthe bigger fish. They had to offer something to get him to turn, and \nthey would offer--I have seen it many times--okay, we can't have a plea \nagreement where we set a certain sentence, as they do in State court, \nbut what we can do is agree to drop all the charges, except this one \npossession.\n  So the sentence is not that great. Whatever the judge does won't be \nthat great. It won't have the weapons charge in there, even though he \nused a weapon and engaged in violent activity, if he will help us get \nMr. Big. That happens. I have seen it happened.\n  Back in the early '80s, when I was court appointed in Federal court, \nI had approaches like that with regard to my clients: What can you help \nus with, and here are the charges we are willing to drop, even though \nwe know we can prove them.\n\n  Yet, this administration acts like that never happens and that, \nobviously, all these people in prison because of drug charges are \nreally nonviolent. That is garbage. That is why the crime rate keeps \ngoing up as this administration forces the release of more and more \npeople.\n  This article points out another myth:\n  ``There are millions of people incarcerated in American prisons for \nno good reason.''\n  ``Fact: While there are approximately 1.5 million people incarcerated \nin American jails, prisons, and other institutions, only 195,900 are \nFederal inmates (a 10-year low). And only 159,000 in the Federal system \nare housed in actual prisons. The rest are in privately managed \nfacilities, home confinement, short-term detention, long-term boarders, \nresidential reentry centers, pretrial/presentence holding, et cetera. \nAt least 25 percent of the Federal prison population is comprised of \nillegal aliens and possibly more who are noncitizens. We should save \nmoney by releasing those criminals and deporting them.''\n  What good does it do to deport somebody now when the border is so \nwide open?\n  ``Myth number 3: Incarceration costs so much money and criminal \njustice reform will save billions.''\n  Well, without reading through the whole article, I can tell you that \nis garbage as well.\n  Myth number 4: ``This bill will only release low level, nonviolent \ndrug offenders.''\n  As I pointed out, that is simply not the case. It is a good article.\n  Myth number 5: ``We have a big government culture of \novercriminalization that threatens liberty.''\n  Well, the biggest problem of overcriminalization is when Congress has \npassed a law that says you can go to prison for violating any of the \nregulations regarding this subject, and then bureaucrats in some \ncubicle somewhere put some regulations in place under this \nadministration--sometimes 80,000 pages of new regulations a year--and \npeople, as the Heritage Foundation has said before in one of their \nbooks, are probably all violating three or four Federal laws a day.\n  One other thing I wanted to touch on because it has been debated and \na lot of\n\n[[Page H2876]]\n\nallegations made, people are trying to assert that Republicans somehow \nare supportive of the old ways of slavery.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to read from the Democratic Party Platform \nof 1856. This is a part of the platform. This is the belief of the \nDemocratic Party, the national party:\n  ``That Congress has no power under the Constitution, to interfere \nwith or control the domestic institutions of the several States, and \nthat such States are the sole and proper judges of everything \nappertaining to their own affairs, not prohibited by the Constitution; \nthat all efforts of the abolitionists''--that is those who wanted to \nend slavery--``or others, made to induce Congress to interfere with \nquestions of slavery . . . are calculated to lead to the most alarming \nand dangerous consequences; and that all such efforts''--talking about \nthe end of slavery--``have an inevitable tendency to diminish the \nhappiness of the people and endanger the stability and permanency of \nthe Union, and ought not to be countenanced by any friend of our \npolitical institutions.''\n  The Democratic Party Platform of 1856 also declares that ``new \nStates'' to the Union should be admitted ``with or without domestic \nslavery, as the State may elect.''\n  The Platform that year also says that ``we recognize the right of the \npeople of all the Territories . . . to form a Constitution, with or \nwithout domestic slavery.''\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The platform of 1860 of the national Democratic Party, in seeking to \nuphold the Fugitive Slave Act, states: ``The enactments of the State \nlegislatures to defeat the faithful execution of the Fugitive Slave Act \nare hostile in character, subversive of the Constitution, and \nrevolutionary in their effect.''\n  The 14th Amendment, giving full citizenship to freed slaves, passed \nin 1868 with 94 percent Republican support and zero percent Democratic \nsupport in Congress. The 15th Amendment, giving freed slaves the right \nto vote, passed in 1870 with 100 percent Republican support and zero \npercent Democratic support in Congress.\n  The Constitution of 1902 in the State of Virginia disenfranchised \nabout 90 percent of the Black men who still voted at the beginning of \nthe 20th century and nearly half of the White men. The number of \neligible African American voters fell from about 147,000 in 1901 to \nabout 10,000 by 1905. The measure was supported almost entirely by \nVirginia State Democrats.\n  In 1924, the Democratic National Convention convened in New York at \nMadison Square Garden. The convention is commonly known as the Klanbake \ndue to the overwhelming influence of the Ku Klux Klan in the party.\n  In 1964, the Democratic Party led a 75-day filibuster against the \n1964 Civil Rights Act. Leading the Democrats in their opposition to \ncivil rights for African Americans was a member of the Democratic \nParty, Senator Robert Byrd from West Virginia, who was known to be a \nrecruiter for the Ku Klux Klan. Senator Byrd spoke directly about the \nCivil Rights Act in a 14-hour filibuster, proclaiming: ``Men are not \nequal today, and they were not created equal in 1776, when the \nDeclaration of Independence was written. Men and races of men differ in \nappearance, ways, physical power, mental capacity, creativity, and \nvision.''\n  The Democratic Party identified itself as the ``White man's party'' \nand demonized the Republican Party as being dominated by African \nAmericans.\n  So it is interesting to hear these rewritten parts of our history. \nWhen you know the hearts and minds of the people on the Republican side \nof the aisle, you find out there is nobody who wants slavery. We wish \nthat slavery that held this Nation back--because as Daniel Webster used \nto preach and John Quincy Adams used to preach, how was a good God \ngoing to keep blessing America when we were treating brothers and \nsisters in Christ this way, putting them in chains and bondage? America \nwas harmed. It was devastating to African American lives to be placed \nin slavery--the degradation, the humiliation. I am grateful to be part \nof the party that stood up and made the change.\n  But more than the Republican Party, the Judeo-Christian beliefs, \nespecially in the 1700s after the Great Awakening, the First Great \nAwakening in America, revival in America where people turned to God, \nbecame Christians, they understood travesties better by understanding \nthe Bible. They stood up, and they demanded equal rights for people, \nand it led to a revolution.\n  In the 1800s, there was a lot of debauchery, but during the Second \nGreat Awakening, churches were really the core behind the abolitionist \nmovement. We should never be putting brothers and sisters in chains. \nThat is an abomination. It held America back. It helped greatly prevent \nAmerica from reaching the heights that it would once slavery was gone.\n  But then even after slavery was gone, as a result of the great \nRepublican father of our party, Abraham Lincoln, as he is sometimes \nreferred to, people were not treated equally. As I just read, even in \nVirginia, this great State of Virginia, Democrats were determined to \nprevent African Americans from voting, and they were successful in \nlarge degree.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think a good way to finish today is to go back to the \nfinal argument. We have the entire final argument from John Quincy \nAdams. He was elected President in 1824. He was defeated by Andrew \nJackson in 1828. But in 1830 he did an incredible thing that no one has \never done since. After being President, he ran for Congress, for the \nHouse of Representatives. He didn't even run for Senate. He ran for the \nHouse of Representatives. He believed God was calling him. As William \nWilberforce believed God had called him to bring an end to slavery in \nGreat Britain, Adams believed God was calling him back into government \nafter being defeated as President, that he would lower himself to run \nfor the House of Representatives. He got elected in 1830.\n  Speech after speech was against slavery. How can we expect God to \nbless America when we are treating brothers and sisters with chains and \nbondage? Sermons were so powerful that those sermons given against \nslavery, as he filed bills to end slavery, to free specific slaves over \nand over, those sermons he preached on the floor of the House right \ndown the hall had a powerful impact on a homely-looking guy with an \nunpleasant sounding voice named Abraham Lincoln. He overlapped briefly \nbefore the massive stroke that took John Quincy Adams out.\n  Adams knew when he died back in the Speaker's suite that he had not \ndone what he thought God had called him to do--end slavery. It was \n1848. But we now know, and Lincoln knew and said as much, as Steve \nMansfield was telling me. He wrote a great book on Lincoln's struggle \nwith God. He knew that those speeches on the House floor down the hall, \nthey didn't end slavery, but they materially changed the attitude and \naffected that man named Abraham Lincoln that, 13 years after Adams \nwould die, he would see to slavery's end.\n  At the end of his argument, he was afraid he had not prevailed on \nbehalf of Africans who were taken as captives by another African tribe, \nsold into slavery, and taken to the African coast. They were put on a \nship and taken to the Caribbean, where they were put on a smaller ship \ncalled the Amistad.\n  ``Amistad'' is a great movie. Longview, Texas, native Matthew \nMcConaughey plays the trial lawyer representing the Africans. Their \nposition was: We are not anybody's property. When the Africans took \nover the ship, landed accidentally in America, the Spanish said: These \npeople are our property, and this ship is ours. Let us go. The \nAfricans' version: Hey, we are not anybody's property. We want to go \nhome.\n  That case was argued downstairs in the old Supreme Court Chamber. \nAdams knew if he didn't do an adequate job, those Africans would leave \nin chains, their children would wear chains; and he was scared to death \nthat he would not have been up to the job, and, as a result, there \nwould be more suffering.\n  We have his exact argument. He finished like this. This is after he \nhad been President.\n  He said: ``Little did I imagine that I should ever again be required \nto claim the right of appearing in the capacity of an officer of this \nCourt; yet such has been the dictate of my destiny--and I\n\n[[Page H2877]]\n\nappear again to plead the cause of justice, and now of liberty and \nlife, in behalf of many of my fellow men, before that same Court, which \nin a former age I had addressed in support of rights of property I \nstand again, I trust for the last time, before the same Court.''\n  He goes on to say: ``I stand before the same Court, but not before \nthe same judges--nor aided by the same associates--nor resisted by the \nsame opponents. As I cast my eyes--`` he stood looking at the judges--\n``along those seats of honor and of public trust, now occupied by you, \nthey seek in vain for one of those honored and honorable persons whose \nindulgence listened then to my voice. Marshall--Cushing--Chase--\nWashington--Johnson--Livingston--Todd--where are they? Where is that \neloquent statesman and learned lawyer who was my associate counsel in \nthe management of that cause, Robert Goodloe Harper? Where is that \nbrilliant luminary, so long the pride of Maryland and of the American \nbar, then my opposing counsel, Luther Martin? Where is the excellent \nclerk of that day, whose name has been inscribed on the shores of \nAfrica, as a monument of his abhorrence of the African slave-trade, \nElias B. Caldwell? Where is the marshal--where are the criers of the \nCourt? Alas. Where is one of the very judges of the Court, arbiters of \nlife and death, before whom I commenced this anxious argument, even now \nprematurely closed? Where are they all? Gone. Gone. All gone--gone from \nthe services which, in their day and generation, they faithfully \nrendered to their country. From the excellent characters which they \nsustained in life, so far as I have had the means of knowing, I humbly \nhope, and fondly trust, that they have gone to receive the rewards of \nblessedness on high.
