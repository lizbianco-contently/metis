Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April as National \nDonate Life Month.\n  As the co-chair of the Congressional Organ and Tissue Donation \nAwareness Caucus, I believe it is important to help people understand \nthat, while organ and tissue donation is serious, just like any other \nmedical or surgical procedure, there are many misconceptions and myths \nsurrounding the donor process, and it is important that we educate the \npublic about them.\n  Technology today allows us to do amazing things in the donation of \norgans and tissues, and new drugs have advanced the opportunity to \nensure that these organs, these tissues, are not rejected.\n  My hope today, as a member of the caucus, is to encourage Americans \nto get educated and understand the dire need for tissue and organ \ndonations. This is an opportunity to save lives.\n  Sadly, there are over 120,000 men, women, and children who are on \nwaiting lists for lifesaving organ donations around the country. For \nthese patients, an organ donation simply is a matter of life and death.\n  I would like to commend the organizations that raise awareness and \nthat are on the front lines about these important issues every single \nday throughout our country.\n  I would like to thank the National Kidney Foundation and the American \nLiver Foundation for their efforts to raise awareness, support \npatients, and support funding for advancements in this field. They are \nalways trying to advance the opportunities for lifesaving organs that \nwill make a difference in our communities throughout the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2069-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2069-H2070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SUPPORTING HOLOCAUST SURVIVORS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I recently introduced House Concurrent \nResolution 129 along with my south Florida colleague and friend, \nCongressman Ted Deutch, urging Germany to honor its commitments and \nmoral obligations to Holocaust survivors by providing for their unmet \nneeds.\n  There are an estimated half-million survivors worldwide, about a \nquarter of whom live here in the United States. Nearly 15,000 survivors \ncall the great State of Florida home, and I am proud to represent so \nmany of them in my south Florida district.\n  But the sad reality and, really, humanity's great shame is that about \nhalf of all Holocaust survivors live at or below the poverty line. Tens \nof thousands of survivors, if not more, are suffering without basic, \nlife-sustaining services and care that they need in their advanced \nyears.\n  Many live alone or without family support and lack the funds for home \ncare, from medicine to hearing aids, to food, to utilities, to rent.\n  What a tragedy, Mr. Speaker, that so many Holocaust survivors are \nunable to maintain even a modest and dignified standard of living.\n  These individuals have suffered for nearly three-quarters of a \ncentury from the physical and emotional scars that they have endured \nand carry with them to this very day. They have lived through the \ntorture, the experiments, the labor camps, the loss of loved ones, and \neven the murder of their entire families.\n  Because of all of this, Holocaust survivors' needs are unique. They \nare more extensive and more complex than the needs of other elderly \nindividuals.\n  The time for justice, Mr. Speaker, is now. The time for action is now \nbecause there may not be a next year or even a next month for many of \nthese Holocaust survivors.\n  That is why the German Government must honor Chancellor Adenauer's \npledge from 1951, that Germany would take care of all of the needs of \nevery survivor. That is why this resolution is so important, because \ntime is of the essence.\n  But it is not as though our friends in Germany have done nothing to \nfulfill this pledge. The German Government has over the years provided \nsome support through income assistance programs and has sought ways to \nimprove and address the needs of the survivors.\n\n[[Page H2070]]\n\n  Germany has even doubled its funding for home care services in the \npast 5 years, but that, unfortunately, does not match the reality of \nwhat is required.\n  The German Ministry of Finance itself has admitted that the level of \ncare financed by its government has been vastly insufficient to date, \nespecially for those who are in dire need of intensive, long-term care.\n  The real issue of concern, one that is exacerbating the severe lack \nof funding and one where I think we can press the German Government and \nwork with it to find a fair solution, is the inconsistent manner in \nwhich existing funding and care is being disbursed.\n  The current system places an undue burden on the Holocaust survivors \nand their families, forcing them to jump through bureaucratic red tape, \ncausing harmful delays and waste.\n  This resolution is a simple one. It is straightforward. It is \nnoncontroversial. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Congress is in a unique position to work for and fight on behalf of \nHolocaust survivors, many of whom are our constituents. We have a long \nhistory of working on behalf of Holocaust survivors and seeking out \ntheir long-overdue justice.\n  Next Wednesday, May 4, is Yom HaShoah, Holocaust Remembrance Day. As \nwe remember and honor the victims and survivors of the Holocaust, we \nare all compelled to do everything in our power to help those who have \nlived through those unconscionable atrocities.\n  These survivors, Mr. Speaker, have seen the worst that humanity has \nto offer. Let us show them now the best of humanity by ensuring that \nthey can, indeed, live out their days in dignity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2070-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2070]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          FLOOD INSURANCE MARKET PARITY AND MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2901, the \nFlood Insurance Market Parity and Modernization Act. I am a proud \ncosponsor of this bipartisan bill, which represents a positive step \ntowards much-needed flood insurance reform.\n  This legislation provides clarity to States and private insurers and, \nin doing so, clears the way for competitive firms to play a much \ngreater role in the flood insurance market.\n  For my constituents back home, the 705,000 western Pennsylvanians who \nsent me to Washington to look out for their interests, this means more \nchoices, more competitive rates, and more innovation. Passing this \nlegislation would be a win for western Pennsylvanians eager for change.\n  Although some tend to think of flood insurance as a concern for \ncoastal States like Florida, Louisiana, and Texas, many Pennsylvanians \nare closely monitoring the ongoing debate about the future of flood \ninsurance.\n  Many of my constituents live alongside rivers and streams and in \nvalleys with a history of flooding. My district is also home to many \nolder cities and towns like Johnstown that are filled with properties \nthat predate the National Flood Insurance Program. People have lived in \nthese places for generations and have a deep sense of community.\n  Rightly, my constituents who live in these flood-prone areas worry \nabout the future availability of affordable flood insurance options in \nthe marketplace. They want to remain in their homes, in the places \nwhere multiple generations of their families have lived and worked and \nbuilt lasting connections with their neighbors.\n  My constituents need access to affordable flood insurance. As this \ndebate continues over the next year, I will make sure that their \nconcerns are addressed.\n  H.R. 2901 is a strong step in the right direction as we seek to \nreform Federal flood insurance policy.\n  I hope that H.R. 2901 will receive the same broad, bipartisan support \nit received in the Financial Services Committee when it comes up for a \nvote later today.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues at the committee and on \nboth sides of the aisle as work continues on flood insurance reform.\n\n\n                  Honoring the Life of Norman F. Kyle\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and thank Norman \nKyle, an Aliquippa native who passed away at the age of 95 this past \nSunday, for his brave service to our Nation.\n  Norman served as a U.S. Army infantryman during World War II and, \nafter being captured by the Nazis, was a POW for over 700 days.\n  He was born on August 24, 1920, in Aliquippa and was retired from J \nSteel Corp., where he worked for more than 40 years. Norman was a John \nWayne fan, and he collected more than 100 trains.\n  In addition to his parents, Norman and Sadie Kyle, he was preceded in \ndeath by his wife, Ruth Kyle, two sons, Robert and Kenneth Kyle, and a \ngrandson, John Scheeler, Jr.\n  Norman is survived by his 3 daughters, 9 grandchildren, 16 great-\ngrandchildren, and 5 great-great-grandchildren.\n  It was men like Norman Kyle who made their generation great and who \nwere a big part of making this country the leader of the world. His \nlife, legacy, and service will not be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2070-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2070-H2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ``I AM JAZZ''\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, all across the country today, teachers, \nlibrarians, and parents will be reading the book ``I Am Jazz,'' a \nchildren's book about transgender youth, co-written by Jazz Jennings, \npictured here, and Jessica Herthel.\n  Last year, legal threats from the anti-LGBTQ hate group forced a \nschool in Wisconsin to cancel plans to read this book to support a \ntransgender student. The local community rallied, holding a reading at \nthe library that drew more than 600 attendees in support of the \nstudent.\n  Now this is a movement, with readings across the country to increase \nunderstanding and to show young people that they are welcomed and \nloved.\n  I am proud to join these readers today from the House floor. Now I am \ngoing to read this book, ``I Am Jazz.''\n\n       I am Jazz. For as long as I can remember, my favorite color \n     has been pink. My second favorite color is silver, and my \n     third favorite color is green.\n       Here are some of my other favorite things: dancing, \n     singing, back flips, drawing, soccer, swimming, makeup, and \n     pretending I'm a pop star.\n       Most of all, I love mermaids. Sometimes I even wear a \n     mermaid tail into the pool.\n       My best friends are Samantha and Casey. We always have fun \n     together. We like high heels and princess gowns or cartwheels \n     and trampolines.\n       But I am not exactly like Samantha and Casey. I have a \n     girl's brain, but a boy body. This is called transgender. I \n     was born this way.\n       When I was very little and my mom would say, ``You're such \n     a good boy,'' I would say, ``No, mama. Good girl.''\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n       At first, my family was confused. They always thought of me \n     as a boy. As I got a little older, I hardly ever played with \n     trucks or tools or superheroes, only princesses and mermaid \n     costumes. My brothers told me that that was girl stuff. I \n     kept right on playing.\n       My sister says I was always talking to her about my girl \n     thoughts and my girl dreams and how one day I would be a \n     beautiful lady. She would giggle and say, ``You are a funny \n     kid.''\n       Sometimes my parents let me wear my sister's dresses around \n     the house, but whenever we went out, I had to put on my boy \n     clothes again. That made me mad. Still, I never gave up \n     trying to convince them. Pretending I was a boy felt like \n     telling a lie.\n       Then one amazing day, everything changed. Mom and dad took \n     me to meet a new doctor who asked me lots and lots of \n     questions. Afterwards, the doctor spoke to my parents, and I \n     heard the word ``transgender'' for the very first time. That \n     night at bedtime, my parents both hugged me and said, ``We \n     understand now. Be who you are. We love you no matter what.''\n       That made me smile and smile and smile. Mom and dad told me \n     I could start wearing girl clothes to school and growing my \n     hair long. They even let me change my name to Jazz. Being \n     Jazz felt much more like being me. Mom said that being Jazz \n     would make me different from the other kids in school, but \n     that being different is okay. ``What is important,'' she \n     said, ``is that I am happy with who I am.''\n       Being Jazz caused some other people to be confused, too, \n     like the teachers at school. At the beginning of school, they \n     wanted me to use the boys' bathroom and play in the boys' gym \n     class, but that didn't make me feel normal at all.\n       I was so happy when the teachers changed their minds. I \n     can't imagine not playing on\n\n[[Page H2071]]\n\n     the same team with Casey and Samantha. Even today there are \n     kids who tease me or call me by a boy's name or ignore me \n     altogether. This makes me feel crummy. Then I remember that \n     the kids who get to know me usually want to be my friend. \n     They say that I am one of the nicest girls in school.\n       I don't mind being different. Different is special. I think \n     what matters most is what a person is like inside. And \n     inside, I am happy. I am having fun. I am proud. I am Jazz.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2071-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2071]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PENN STATE'S CONTRIBUTION TO CYBER AND DIGITAL MANUFACTURING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am very excited to be on \nthe floor this morning to talk about digital manufacturing and how that \nimpacts the things that we make. This is a quantum leap in \nmanufacturing: allowing objects to be rapidly printed and, in the case \nof cyber manufacturing, printed remotely.\n  Since 2009, I have proudly represented Pennsylvania's Fifth \nCongressional District, which is the largest geographically in the \nCommonwealth. It is also the home to Penn State University's main \ncampus in State College, Pennsylvania, as well as to the Behrend campus \nin Erie County, and the DuBois campus in Clearfield County.\n  Over my time in Congress, I have had the opportunity to see firsthand \nhow the university is leading in the field of digital manufacturing in \nareas that range from 3D bioprinting to cyber manufacturing--robotics \nand automation.\n  Portions of the Fifth Congressional District have a long history in \nthe powdered metal industry. In fact, St. Mary's in Elk County, as well \nas in Cameron County, an adjoining county, have been known for years as \nthe powdered metal capital of the world. A few months ago, I visited \nPenn State to take a look at their work in the field of additive metal \nmanufacturing, which takes place in the university's applied research \nlaboratory CIMP-3D lab. It was amazing to watch metal parts be created \nusing what amounts to a 3D printer, and it is easy to see how this new \ntechnology will revolutionize careers in the powdered metal industry, \nwhich has meant so much to our region.\n  In the same vein, I have been so impressed with the university's \nefforts in hosting an additive manufacturing challenge for small \nbusinesses. The challenge will award five companies $40,000 to work \nwith faculty and staff at Penn State CIMP-3D on projects to demonstrate \nthis amazing technology.\n  Mr. Speaker, beyond the dividends that these new innovations are \npaying for the industries which drive America's economy, this research \nis also benefiting our national defense. Penn State is currently \nworking with the United States Naval Air Systems Command to 3D-print, -\nqualify, and -certify a critical safety item--in other words, an \nimportant part of a Department of Defense vehicle--in titanium. This \npart will be flown in an aircraft next month and will be the first 3D-\nprinted part to have gone through the entire process to become flight \ncertified and tested in the military.\n  Now, I commend the pioneers of this exciting new technology from \nuniversities such as my alma mater, Penn State, but also universities \nsuch as Georgia Tech and Virginia Tech, along with companies such as \nthe aircraft engine manufacturer, Pratt & Whitney, in helping students \nprepare for what are certainly the careers of the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, as co-chairman of the Congressional Career and Technical \nEducation Caucus, I spend a lot of time visiting schools, visiting our \nhigh schools, secondary schools, and post-secondary schools that are \nproviding training to greater opportunity. It is exciting to go into \nspecifically high schools and see where this digital manufacturing--\nthis additive manufacturing using the 3D printers and various types of \nmaterials--is now present in our high schools.\n  I appreciate the partnership that Penn State has had working with not \njust business and industry, but the collaborative work with our high \nschools to begin to introduce and to grow this new innovation in \nmanufacturing and to introduce this to young learners, many of whom, I \nbelieve, are going to go on and will find great family-sustaining jobs \nthrough that type of career and technical education training, being \nexposed to the very newest form of innovation for manufacturing.\n  Some of them will go on to work for businesses and industries. Who \nknows? Some of them will become entrepreneurs and return to a day of \ncottage industries. Some of our most amazing discoveries have happened \nin basements, garages, and spare bedrooms where entrepreneurs have \ndeveloped and invented. With the use of digital manufacturing, a return \nto cottage industries is, quite frankly, something that I think is \ngoing to happen in an overwhelming way as often entrepreneurs take that \ninnovation and are able to do some very specific product development \nand manufacturing targeting, maybe some specific niche markets.\n  So I am very excited in how technology relating to career and \neducational training and information technology, as it relates to \ndigital manufacturing or additive manufacturing, is going to have a \nvery positive impact on our citizens, our families, our businesses, \nand, quite frankly, the competitiveness of our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2071-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2071-H2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SOLUTION TO FLOODING IN HOUSTON, TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there is a common refrain that \nyou, I, and many others are quite familiar with. It is: but for the \ngrace of God, there go I.\n  This refrain has significant meaning to all of us. I have used this \nrefrain myself. I used it when it came to the East Coast and Sandy, the \nhurricane. I used it when it came to Flint and lead in the water. I \nhave used it when we had the hurricane visit New Orleans--I am talking \nabout Katrina. And I am using it as it relates to Puerto Rico. But for \nthe grace of God, there go I.\n  But I will tell you, it takes on an even greater meaning when you \nbecome the subject of the refrain.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise now because in Houston, Texas, over the last 2 \nyears, we have had significant flooding. Over the last 2 years, in \nHouston, Texas, we had the Memorial Day flood. That flood created about \n$3 billion worth of damage. This year, we have had the tax day flood, \nwhich created about $5 billion. Combined, the two floods totaled $8 \nbillion in damages.\n  We have had lives lost in Houston, Texas: four lives estimated for \nthe Memorial Day flood; eight lives for the tax day flood. Lives have \nbeen lost.\n  But for the grace of God, there go I. And I have a greater \nunderstanding of what it means because of the way this has impacted the \npeople in my city and in my State.\n  Mr. Speaker, they are citizens of this country. I come to the floor \ntoday with a hue and cry, an appeal that we do something about these \ncircumstances because this will not be the last flood that will take \nplace in Houston, Texas.\n  There is a possible solution to some of the problems. I don't know \nthat we could ever eliminate all of the flooding problems in Houston, \nTexas. But I do know that the Corps of Engineers has projects that are \nalready on their docket, on their agenda; and if these projects are \nproperly addressed, we can mitigate a good deal of this flooding.\n  These projects that the Corps has would cost us about $311 million to \ncomplete. One such project is the Brays project. We authorized this in \n1990, and we are projected to finish it in 2021.\n  Mr. Speaker, it didn't take that long to create the Erie Canal. It \ntook us 4 years to complete the Golden Gate Bridge; the Hoover Dam was \n5 years; the Erie Canal was 8 years. And it only took us about 8 \nyears--maybe 10, by some estimates--to put a person on the Moon. \nSurely, we could have completed these projects sooner.\n  This bill, H.R. 5025, will accord us $311 million to finish these \nprojects so that we can save lives, so that we can save money; and the \nbill, if properly implemented with the creation of these projects and \nthe completion of them, will also create jobs. More than 6,000 jobs are \nestimated to be created.\n  So I come before my colleagues today asking that you kindly sign on \nto H.R. 5025. It is an opportunity for us to do something to help \nsomebody, to help\n\n[[Page H2072]]\n\nthose who are in harm's way and will continue to be in harm's way as \nlong as they live in Houston, Texas, one of the great American cities. \nBut I do believe that we can do this.\n  And while it may not be enough to eliminate all flooding, I live by \nthe basic premise that when there are times in your life when you \ncannot do enough, when no matter how much you do, you will not do \nenough, I live by the premise that you do all that you can.\n  We can do more. We can do something to prevent a good deal of this \nflooding, save some lives, and create some jobs.\n  Finally this: I would remind my colleagues that Dr. King was \nimminently correct when he called to our attention that the truest \nmeasure of the person is not where you stand in times of comfort and \nconvenience, but where do you stand in times of challenge and \ncontroversy?

This bipartisan legislation strengthens our \nmilitary and protects American families from new and emerging threats.\n  Additionally, this legislation fully resources our servicemembers, \nprioritizes cyber initiatives, and reforms our military healthcare \nsystem. The NDAA also stands up for South Carolina by continuing \nconstruction for the Mixed Oxide Fuel Fabrication facility, MOX, at the \nSavannah River Site and prohibits the transfer of terrorists from \nGuantanamo to American soil.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member Adam Smith, my \ncolleagues on the Committee on Armed Services, and dedicated staff \nmembers, especially Kevin Gates, Pete Villano, Neve Schadler, Katherine \nSutton, and Lindsay Kavanaugh.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2072-8", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2072]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise in \nrecognition of Sexual Assault Awareness Month and in strong support of \nthe Campus Accountability and Safety Act, bipartisan legislation that I \nauthored with Congressman Meehan.\n  Sexual assault is truly a crisis on our college campuses, where a \nsurvey last year indicated that 23 percent of female students are \nvictims.\n  In 2013, we passed the Campus SaVE Act, which I authored. It ensures \ncampuses adopt clear, comprehensive procedures to investigate and \nreport accurate statistics on sexual assault.\n  But this is not enough. One person becomes a victim of assault every \n107 seconds in America. That is over 300,000 a year. Our bill would \nrequire a national survey of students to identify key risk factors for \nsexual assault and evaluate best practices to reduce sexual violence. \nThe bill would also provide resources for victims of sexual assault, \nincluding confidential advisers.\n  These are commonsense reforms that will make a world of difference by \nkeeping our students safer on our college campuses.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2072-9", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2072-H2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    FARMERS AIDED BY CROP INSURANCE\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, just last month, prune growers in the \nSacramento Valley of California were pretty optimistic about 2016. For \nthe first time in a while, they saw some relief from the drought, and \nthough crop prices were down, the little prunes on the trees gave hope \nfor a healthy harvest with an estimated value of up to $120 million for \nthe year.\n  Now, just a few weeks later, these same farmers are questioning \nwhether there will even be a harvest following\n\n[[Page H2073]]\n\nvery rough weather during the critical bloom period. Yet, this is the \nnatural reality of the risks faced by farmers and ranchers.\n  Before blindly attacking sound agriculture policy, such as crop \ninsurance, I ask my colleagues here to take a close look at what it \ntakes to feed our Nation, especially in a year like this one where farm \nincome is down over 50 percent.\n  These policies are not meant for the good crop years or in a good \nharvest. They exist for the terrible crop years.\n  Mr. Speaker, weather is unpredictable, as are natural disasters and \nfickle markets. However, we can make sure farmers have access to tools \nthat manage these risks in an efficient and cost-effective manner. \nLet's not jeopardize this successful and vital program.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2073-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ADHERING TO OPEN SKIES AGREEMENT\n\n  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, so-called flags of convenience have \ndecimated the U.S. maritime industry to a tiny fraction of its former \nsize. It is a system where owners chase the cheapest, most exploitable \nlabor, and the least regulation around the world.\n  Now the Department of Transportation under the Obama administration, \nin its infinite wisdom, wants to bring that system to aviation. Won't \nthat be great when we are all flying in planes with crews coming out of \nIndonesia or India or somewhere else where they can be exploited, paid \nless, and maybe have kind of questionable credentials.\n  Actually, they are issuing pilot certificates in India to people who \nhave never ever flown a plane. That will just be dandy. But, hey, the \ntickets will be cheap. You might not get there, but you paid less to \nget on.\n  This is absolutely absurd. We have the safest and best system of \naviation in the world with our proud domestic airlines. Their employees \nget decent wages, we fly safe, and we want to now go to flags of \nconvenience?\n  They are ignoring the clear language of the Open Skies Agreement in \nmaking this decision.

They were the first \nkilled in what would eventually become a genocide resulting in the \ndeaths of 1.5 million innocent men, women, and children.\n  Over a century later, the Armenian people have vowed to never forget \nthese atrocities. The children and grandchildren of the genocide's \nvictims have worked hard to remember and honor those who suffered. For \ntoo long, this crime has gone unrecognized and unpunished.\n  This weekend in Los Angeles, California, 60,000 people came together \noutside of the Turkish consulate to rally for long overdue \nacknowledgment of their ancestors' murders.\n  I am proud to be a member of the Congressional Armenian Caucus, and I \nstand by the Armenian American community in Los Angeles and throughout \nthis country in their call for recognition and justice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2073-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2073]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING THE LIFE OF JIMMY HAYLEY\n\n  (Mr. WEBER of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas.

This year, Congress budgeted just $906 million for \nthe safe drinking water fund. That is a cut of 34 percent compared to \n2010, and far below the $334 billion that is needed over the next 20 \nyears.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of hardworking \nAmericans trying to save money for their retirement without government \nintrusion.\n  This week, I join a majority of House Members in voting to disapprove \nof the Department of Labor's new fiduciary rule that will make it \nharder for low- and middle-income families to save for their \nretirement.\n  This extreme, partisan rule, if it is allowed to be implemented, will \nhave a far-reaching negative impact on all Americans currently saving \nfor their retirement. It is yet another attempted power grab by \nadministration bureaucrats to impose more regulations that Americans do \nnot need and are not asking for. It will narrow the options for \nretirees and drive up costs preventing smart investment.\n  Estimates show retirement planners would have to spend up to $4.7 \nbillion complying with the rule in the first year alone and another \n$1.1 billion annually thereafter. We all know who will pay for these \ncosts: the consumer, the saver, the man and woman who are simply trying \nto invest in their future for their families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all of my colleagues to reject this new fiduciary \nrule and help all Americans retire with the financial security and \npeace of mind that they deserve.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2074-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     SEXUAL ASSAULT AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize April as Sexual \nAssault Awareness Month. As a father of two daughters, this issue is \ndeeply personal for me.\n  When I think of my daughters' future, few things terrify me more than \nknowing that one in five women have experienced sexual assault on \ncollege campuses. That is why we need to pass the Campus Accountability \nand Safety Act. This is a commonsense, bipartisan solution to protect \nstudents and boost accountability and transparency at colleges and \nuniversities. Every day that goes by without passing this bill, more \nstudents are put at risk; and for me, that is simply unacceptable.\n  This issue obviously isn't just limited to college campuses, so I \nwant to take a few moments to commend some of the amazing organizations \nthat are working to keep families safe in our community.\n  The Zacharias Sexual Abuse Center and A Safe Place have both done \nincredible work in Illinois' 10th Congressional District. Not only have \nthey worked tirelessly to provide resources and shelter for the \nsurvivors of sexual assault and domestic abuse, but they have also \ndemonstrated a strong commitment to fighting the root cause of these \ntragedies.\n  We must provide these incredible organizations with the resources \nthey need, so together we can prevent sexual assault and keep families \nsafe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2074-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2074-H2075]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    RECOGNIZING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN ATTENDING UNITED STATES SERVICE \n                               ACADEMIES\n\n  (Mr. COLLINS of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize \nSaturday, April 30, as National Prescription Drug Take-Back Day.\n  In the 30 years I served as a community pharmacist before my election \nto Congress, I saw prescription medications save lives. However, at the \nsame time, I watched people's addiction to those same medications ruin \ncareers, families, and lives.\n  Today, 44 people in the U.S. die every day from prescription \npainkillers and overdoses. Overdoses are now the leading cause of \naccidental death in the U.S., exceeding even car accidents.\n  Prescription medications have become the target of theft and abuse. \nIt is critical we are all playing our part in combating the \nprescription drug abuse epidemic by safely disposing of unused \nmedications.\n  On Saturday, across the country, the DEA will host collection sites \nwhere Americans can drop off their pills and other solid, unused \nprescription drugs.

It is the worst performance in 2 years and dismal news \nfor the U.S. economy.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 706 provides a closed rule \nfor the consideration of H.R. 4901, the Scholarships for Opportunity \nand Results Reauthorization Act, as it is the product of careful \nbipartisan and bicameral negotiations.\n  It also provides a closed rule for the consideration of H.J. Res. 88, \ndisapproving the rule submitted by the Department of Labor relating to \nthe definition of the term ``fiduciary,'' which is traditional for \nCongressional Review Act resolutions.\n  The underlying bill and resolution we will consider today are \nimportant steps forward on two issues of great concern to Americans: \neducation and retirement savings.\n  H.R. 4901, the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nReauthorization Act, also known as the SOAR Reauthorization Act, would \ncontinue important funding provided to help young students here in \nWashington, D.C., reach their full potential.\n  This legislation would provide $60 million annually for 5 years, \nsplit equally among the District's public schools, charter schools, and \nthe District of Columbia Opportunity Scholarship Program, which enables \nlow-income students to attend a private school that would otherwise be \nout of their reach.\n  I have great confidence that the SOAR Reauthorization Act is a \npositive step for students in the District of Columbia and that, \nthrough its example, it will provide a model for success that could be \nadopted by States across the country.\n  With the adoption of this rule, the House will also provide for the \nconsideration of H.J. Res. 88, a Congressional Review Act resolution \ndisapproving of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule, a rule that \nwill otherwise soon take effect and limit the ability of Americans to \nreceive adequate advice on how to allocate their retirement savings.\n  If enacted, this resolution will prevent the red tape and other \nburdensome mandates that threaten to cut off access to trusted \nfinancial advisers and may result in lower savings rates and returns on \ninvestment.\n  As Americans are clamoring for more assistance with retirement \nsavings and financial decisions, we must ensure that they are \nencouraged to continue saving and are able to receive helpful guidance. \nStopping the harmful fiduciary rule is an important step in that \ndirection.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend this rule and both the underlying bill and \nresolution. I ask my colleagues for their support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today the majority intends to pass a resolution of disapproval under \nthe Congressional Review Act to overturn the Department of Labor's \nrecent rulemaking requiring financial advisers who provide retirement \ninvestment advice to abide by a fiduciary standard, meaning that they \nmust act in the best interests of their clients, which seems perfectly \nlegitimate to me. That is right. The House majority is disapproving of \nfinancial advisers acting in the best interests of their clients.\n  Despite the growing importance of individual workers and retirees to \nobtain sound investment advice, many financial advisers are still not \nlegally required to meet the fiduciary standard of acting in their \nclients' best interests but, instead, are required only to meet a lower \n``suitability'' standard.\n  This creates a conflict of interest where advisers are permitted to \npromote investments that maximized their own returns rather than their \nclients' returns as long as the investments were still ``suitable'' for \ntheir clients.\n  That means a small few--and a very small few--unscrupulous financial \nadvisers have been legally permitted to steer clients towards financial \nproducts that maximize the advisers' profits through higher fees and \ncommissions even if investments that would produce greater returns for \nthe clients are available.\n  Few financial advisers, I am sure, are taking advantage of their \nclients in their saving for retirement. Some experts, however, feel \nthat this rule is necessary. In fact, the White House Council of \nEconomic Advisers estimates that the cost to American retirees is $17 \nbillion annually. That is no small sum, and I think it does cry out for \nattention.\n  It is absurd that, due to loopholes in the current system, retirees \ndo not have a legal right to expect that their financial advisers will \nact in their best interests.\n  When you visit your doctor, you have the legal right to expect that \nhe or she will prescribe whatever treatment is in your best interest. \nYou shouldn't have to guess whether or not your financial adviser is \nfollowing the same fiduciary standard.\n  The Labor Department's final rule will close these loopholes, protect \nworkers' savings, and ensure that financial advisers act in their \nclients' best interests.\n  The final rule is the result of a thoughtful, thorough, and \ntransparent\n\n[[Page H2077]]\n\nmultiyear process that stands in stark contrast to the majority's \ndecision to rush to judgment and to overturn this rule at a record, \nunheard-of pace.\n  The majority marked up the resolution, H.J. Res. 88, only 13 days \nafter the final rule had been published. So, in 13 days, it understood \nthat it was totally unnecessary despite the $17 billion lost to \nclients.\n  This is far shorter than the 55 days that other committees wait, on \naverage, to ensure that there is ample time to fully understand the \nimpact of a final rule.\n  In its rush to judgment, the majority has been blinded by its \nideological opposition to any action taken by the Obama administration \nand has missed the many changes that have left industry leaders \noptimistic, including many of the major financial houses and many of \nthe people whose livelihoods are in this kind of advising.\n  The majority is ignoring the two important protections that this rule \nwill provide to American workers who are trying to save for their \nretirements. The first is peace of mind, and the second is to make sure \nthat everything is done in their interests.\n  Mr. Speaker, all of us are sent here to work in the best interests of \nthe American people, not to shield financial companies. So I urge my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this disapproval resolution.\n  What is more, in yet another grab bag rule that joins two unrelated \nmeasures under a single rule, the Republicans are proposing another \nmisguided bill to meddle in the District of Columbia's local affairs.\n  The majority has already tried to overturn the District's marijuana, \ngun, and abortion laws, and now it intends to rewrite D.C.'s education \nlaws in an attack on the District of Columbia's right to home rule.\n  The D.C. voucher program exempts students from the protection of \nFederal civil rights laws that apply to public schools--why in the \nworld would we want to do that to them?--and federally funded programs \nthat go with those civil rights laws protections.\n  Under the voucher program, the Federal funding is considered \nassistance to the voucher student and not to the school; therefore, the \nvoucher program is not considered a federally funded program.\n  The program is exempt from titles IV and VI of the Civil Rights Act \nof 1964; from title IX of the Education Amendments Act of 1972; from \nthe Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974; from the Individuals \nwith Disabilities Education Act; from the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; \nand from titles II and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of \n1990.\n  I appreciate that we are not doing anything here that is really going \nto affect the government in any way. Undoubtedly, again, this will be a \none-House bill, and we have wasted a week's worth of money--about $24 \nmillion--that it takes to run the House. I urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Scholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act is a \nprogram that makes students the priority.\n  First authorized in 2004, this program has provided significant, \nlife-changing benefits to students for over a decade. It is no secret \nthat many students in the District of Columbia have not received the \neducation they deserve.\n  Fourth graders in the District scored below all 50 States in average \nmath and reading scores in 2013, and eighth graders had the lowest \naverage math and reading scores in the country.\n  The SOAR Reauthorization Act continues a three-sector strategy to \nimprove education in the District of Columbia.\n  First, it provides additional resources to the public school system \nfor its use in improving student achievement.\n  An equal amount is provided to the innovative charter schools that \nare opening across the District, which provide a valuable alternative \nfor students who seek a different experience.\n  Finally, through the Opportunity Scholarship Program, students \nreceive potentially life-changing scholarships to attend private \nschools that offer opportunities that are rarely seen by low-income \nstudents.\n  We often speak of the States as laboratories of democracy. But, in \nthis instance, it is the District of Columbia that is providing an \ninstructive example of the value of trying different approaches, of \nstudying them, and then of replicating the solutions that work, not the \nsolutions that benefit entrenched interests.\n  That is why I am so pleased to see that this legislation includes \nimportant reforms to the program to ensure it performs at the highest \nstandards and is fully assessed for its effectiveness. It is my hope \nthat these assessment standards will be applied to many other programs \nat the Department of Education and across the Federal Government.\n  Parents have also expressed a higher satisfaction rate with their \nchildren's schools and have reported that they believe those schools \nare safer for their children. Both parents and the community support \nthe Opportunity Scholarship Program, with 74 percent supporting a \ncontinuation of the program.\n  It is not hard to understand why that program has that level of \nsupport when you consider that 90 percent of students who are \nparticipating in the program graduate compared to only 64 percent of \nstudents in the schools they left behind.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me repeat that. Ninety percent of students who are \nparticipating in the program graduate compared to only 64 percent of \nstudents in the schools they left behind.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  How could our colleagues possibly oppose this opportunity for \nstudents in the District of Columbia? And that 90 percent graduation \nrate is even better than the national rate of 82 percent.\n  It is important to recognize that this legislation has support from \nacross the aisle at the local level. In March 2016, a majority of the \nD.C. Council and Mayor Muriel Bowser wrote in a letter that ``these \nfunds are critical to the gains that the District's public education \nsystem has seen in recent years.''\n  I commend the SOAR Reauthorization Act to my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, the colleagues who have requested time \nhave not shown up. I am prepared to close if Ms. Foxx is.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is not the first time Congress and the public have debated a \nfiduciary rule conceived by the Department of Labor.\n  The Department first proposed a rule in 2010, but was later forced to \nwithdraw it due to significant bipartisan opposition. A wide array of \nstakeholders, both those saving for retirement and those providing \nassistance to savers, raised legitimate concerns that the Department \nwould be limiting available advice and raising costs.\n  Unfortunately, the Department chose to ignore the lessons of that \ndebacle and embarked again in 2015 on a misguided effort to create a \nnew fiduciary rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, it may be helpful to explain exactly why the Department \nis promulgating rules governing retirement advice whatsoever.\n  Under the provisions of the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \nof 1974, also known as ERISA, Federal law establishes ground rules for \ndefined contribution pension plans, which may be 401(k)s, IRAs, or \nother tax-preferred savings vehicles.\n  Anyone who exercises discretionary authority over those plans or \nprovides investment advice for a fee to those plans is considered a \nfiduciary and triggers certain regulatory restrictions that govern \ntheir actions. Since 1975, the Department of Labor has used a five-part \ntest to determine when a provider of investment advice is a fiduciary.\n  As I mentioned earlier, the Obama administration first proposed in \n2010 and then in 2015 to expand significantly the definition of \nfiduciary, which would subject a significant number of new individuals \nand firms to fiduciary status and have a chilling effect on the \nwillingness of them to provide advice whatsoever to those saving for \nretirement.\n  On April 6, the Department finalized its regulation, which will \nsignificantly\n\n[[Page H2078]]\n\nimpact the ability of Americans to receive advice on how to save for \nretirement and make it more difficult for businesses, in particular \nsmall businesses, to establish retirement plans.\n  At a time when Americans want to save significantly more for \nretirement, the Department of Labor wants to make it cost prohibitive \nto offer advice or services to low- and middle-income Americans by \nincreasing compliance costs and the risk of litigation.\n  Many of the Department's compliance requirements will be \ncounterproductive, as those saving for retirement will be forced to \nreview and sign a number of government-mandated documents instead of \nfocusing on identifying the best options for their retirement savings.\n  There are also issues related to specific savings vehicles for \nretirement, such as variable and fixed-indexed annuities, which must \ncomply with the new requirements.\n  There are also potential class action lawsuits under state law that \ncould prevent good actors in the industry from taking clients and \nimpose an additional cost on savers.\n  Beyond its impact on individuals saving for retirement and those \nassisting them, the fiduciary rule will have a negative impact on the \nbusinesses that attempt to offer pension plans that benefit their \nemployees.\n  The rule holds large and small businesses to different standards, \nwith negative implications for those most in need of assistance, which \nare small businesses with less than $50 million in assets in their \nretirement plan. As with so many other provisions of the fiduciary \nrule, that will raise costs and reduce the choices available to small \nbusinesses.\n  These concerns have been echoed by the National Federation of \nIndependent Businesses and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Even the Small \nBusiness Administration's Office of Advocacy submitted a comment letter \nstating that ``The proposed rule would increase the costs and burdens \nassociated with serving smaller plans . . . and could limit financial \nadvisers' ability to offer savings and investment advice to clients.''\n  In order to stop the Department of Labor's misguided efforts, \nRepresentatives Roe, Boustany, and Wagner introduced this Congressional \nReview Act resolution to disapprove of the fiduciary regulation.\n  The Congressional Review Act provides a special process for \nconsideration of joint resolutions disapproving of a regulation. Should \na resolution, such as the one we will consider today, be enacted into \nlaw, it will prevent the rule from taking effect or being reissued.\n  Clearly, if the fiduciary rule comes into effect, millions of \nAmericans and the businesses employing them will be provided with fewer \ninvestment opportunities and higher costs, limiting their return on \ninvestments and the amount they are one day able to retire with.\n  That is why I cosponsored H.J. Res. 88 to disapprove of this harmful \nrule and enable Americans to continue working with the adviser of their \nchoice and save for retirement in a prudent and cost-effective way.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Hardworking Americans deserve solid advice about how to save for \nretirement, not conflicted guidance from financial counselors.\n  The Department of Labor's fiduciary rule is the product of \nthoughtful, long-term planning and research because the estimate is \nthat $17 billion a year is lost to this industry.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule by voting ``no'' on this \nrule we have before us.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule to bring up a bill that would provide desperately \nneeded funding to combat the Zika virus. We can't put off when the Zika \nvirus is going to arrive. We make no appointments with it. It shows up, \nand the devastation it produces is well known.\n  We must not in the Congress of the United States turn our backs on \nthis impending problem facing the United States. It is already here, \nand I heard just this morning that this summer they are expecting quite \na lot of infection to spread. The administration requested this funding \nmore than 2 months ago, and it is reckless to delay the response to \nthis crisis any longer.\n  I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the amendment in the \nRecord along with extraneous material immediately prior to vote on the \nprevious question.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' to \ndefeat the previous question and vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to say a few additional things on the benefit of the \nSOAR Reauthorization Act.\n  When the Opportunity Scholarship Program, OSP, was first designed, \nD.C. public school students had the lowest test scores in the Nation. \nD.C. schools have improved since then, but D.C. public school students \ncontinue to test well below national averages. D.C. OSP students are \nseeing improved achievement against non-OSP students in reading and in \ngraduation rates.\n  In addition, the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program does not take \naway money from the D.C. public and charter schools nor does it \nreallocate D.C. education money. In fact, H.R. 4901 directs additional \nFederal resources to the D.C. education system that would not otherwise \nbe available if not for the OSP.\n  Finally, there are thousands of families on charter school waiting \nlists who aren't able to access the schools their children need. OSP \nallows income-eligible families to get into high-quality district or \ncharter schools who would not otherwise have access to education \nalternatives.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to spend a few minutes here talking about \nprecisely what has been going on in this Congress.\n  Well, 3 or 4 weeks ago the Rules Committee passed out to the House of \nRepresentatives three measures. One was to stop all class action \nlawsuits. One was to damage the Clean Water Act. The third one was that \nno Federal agency would any longer be allowed to do regulations. It \nwould be done by a group of people set up to do that. I use that \nillustration a lot because it shows what we are doing here in the \nHouse.\n  Anybody who is familiar with sheet music--and that does go back a \nlong time--when you are playing the piano, do you remember it used to \nsaid ``vamp till ready'' and you would continue playing until the \nsinger would start to sing?\n  We have been waiting here for a very long time for the singer to \nstart to sing. We have no budget. We don't exactly know where we are \ngoing here. The Zika virus is bearing down on us. We have crumbling \ninfrastructure that everybody is worried about. Kids are still drinking \nlead in Flint, Michigan.\n  But that is not the only place. In almost every city of the old \ncities in the Northeast, they still have brick water conduits and wood. \nBelieve that. The city that I represent has some very, very old pipes \nas well.\n  So the schools in my district--and I am sure in all the rest of your \ndistricts--are finding out that there is lead in the water in their \nschools as well.\n  Well, we are going to mess around here with things that happen. And \nthen, when Zika comes and we are not ready, I hope that we will--that \nwe are sitting in this room with people who could do something about \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  We are considering crucial legislation today impacting two important \nissues, ensuring Americans are able to save for retirement and enabling \nthe education of our next generation.\n  As any parent knows, the education of our children is one of our \nhighest priorities. For far too long, children in Washington, D.C., \nhave not received the education they deserve, and have suffered from \nunacceptable achievement levels and graduation rates.\n  The SOAR Reauthorization Act, which this rule provides for \nconsideration of, continues a successful three-\n\n[[Page H2079]]\n\nsector approach to improving the lives and educational outcomes of low-\nincome students in the District.\n  It provides $60 million in funding for students, split equally among \nD.C.'s public schools, charter schools, and scholarships for students \nto attend private schools that would otherwise be out of reach.\n  Students receiving private school educations have demonstrated higher \ntest scores and significantly higher graduation rates, showcasing the \nimportance of continuing students' access to these institutions.\n  Students participating in the Opportunity Scholarship Program \nreauthorized in this legislation have graduated at a rate of 90 \npercent, besting both other schools in D.C. where only 64 percent of \nstudents graduate and the national graduation rate of 82 percent.\n  These programs are an important example of the need for innovation \nand experimentation in how to best reform our education system to \nbenefit students, not entrenched interests.\n  It has been an honor for me personally to witness some of the \nstudents who benefited from the programs included in the SOAR \nReauthorization Act. After seeing the hope for the future those \nstudents have in their eyes, I cannot fathom preventing other students \nfrom receiving their own second chances.\n  It has also been my pleasure over the past several decades to join my \nhusband in working with a number of financial advisers on how best to \nsave for retirement and our other financial goals. Those advisers have \nalways acted in the best interest of our family and provided useful \nadvice that has enabled us to meet our goals.\n  Unfortunately, I believe that not everyone in Washington believes \nfinancial advisers are well-intentioned and skilled. It is my fear \nthat, as private sector actors, not government employees, they are \nsuspected by some of being motivated by greed and taking any \nopportunity available to take their clients' money for their own.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  That is a disturbing viewpoint that has no place in reality. These \nadvisers work with their friends and neighbors in their home \ncommunities. The larger companies are brands that have been well \nestablished for decades and are subject to significant regulation and \npublic scrutiny from customers and the marketplace. If there were \nwidespread fleecing of those saving for retirement, we would all \nrightly hear about it.\n  The reality is that the vast majority of financial advisers, large \nand small, have been and will continue to act in their clients' best \ninterests. There are laws and regulations in place to ensure bad actors \nare identified and punished, and I support those enforcement efforts \nwholeheartedly.\n  What I and other Members cannot support is another effort by the \nDepartment of Labor to vilify an industry with real consequences for \nthe ability of Americans to save affordably for retirement. We must \nstrengthen our focus on stopping and punishing bad actors instead of \nincreasing rules and regulations that hinder the countless good actors \nin this industry.\n  We have a retirement savings crisis in this Nation, Mr. Speaker, and \nit is vital that every American has access to high-quality advice and \nan array of financial products available at a low cost.\n  We can continue to trust Americans to make the right choice. The \nfiduciary rule takes that right away, and therefore, I am pleased to \nhave an opportunity today to vote on H.J. Res. 88, disapproving the \nfiduciary rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe both the underlying bill and resolution are \nnecessary steps on issues of great import to our Nation, and I commend \nthem and this rule, providing for their consideration, to all of my \ncolleagues for their support.\n  The material previously referred to by Ms. Slaughter is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 706 Offered by Ms. Slaughter\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 6. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     5044) making supplemental appropriations for fiscal year 2016 \n     to respond to Zika virus. The first reading of the bill shall \n     be dispensed with. All points of order against consideration \n     of the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to \n     the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among \n     and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of \n     the Committee on Appropriations and the chair and ranking \n     minority member of the Committee on the Budget. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 7. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 5044.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Poe of Texas). The question is on \nordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on ordering the previous question will be \nfollowed by 5-\n\n[[Page H2080]]\n\nminute votes on adoption of House Resolution 706, if ordered, and the \nmotion to suspend the rules and pass H.R. 5019.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 231, \nnays 182, not voting 20, as follows:\n\n

Pursuant to House Resolution 706, the joint \nresolution is considered read.\n  The text of the joint resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H.J. Res. 88\n\n       Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \n     United States of America in Congress assembled, ThatCongress \n     disapproves the rule submitted by the Department of Labor \n     relating to ``Definition of the Term `Fiduciary'; Conflict of \n     Interest Rule--Retirement Investment Advice'' (published at \n     81 Fed.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.J. Res. 88.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Tennessee?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.J. Res. 88. I was \nproud to introduce this resolution, along with Representatives Boustany \nand Wagner, to ensure that all Americans have access to affordable \nretirement advice.\n  Today, there are far too many men and women in this country who don't \nhave the retirement security that they need and deserve.\n  In 2015, the GAO found that 29 percent of Americans 55 years and \nolder have no retirement savings and no traditional pension. In fact, \ntoday, nearly 40 million working families haven't saved a dime for \nretirement.\n  This is a serious problem, and we need to make it easier for \nfamilies, particularly low-income and middle-income families, to save \nfor their retirement years. That means making sure that every American, \nregardless of income, is able to access the tools they need to plan for \nthe future. It also means ensuring financial advisers act in their \nclients' best interests.\n  Let me say that again. It also means ensuring financial advisers act \nin their clients' best interests, a priority we all share.\n  Since the Department began its efforts more than 5 years ago, we made \nit clear that we believe retirement savers need greater protections. \nThat is why we held numerous hearings, sent letters, and engaged in \nother oversight activities to advance a responsible solution to help \nthose saving for retirement; and it is why our committee put forward a \nlegislative alternative requiring high standards for retirement advice, \nwhile also ensuring access and affordability.\n  Rather than engaging with Members advancing a thoughtful alternative, \nhowever, the Department opposed our bipartisan proposal outright. \nInstead, the Department of Labor rushed a finalized, misguided rule \nthat will hurt the very people they intended to help.\n  Does anyone think that a 1,000-page rule that I hold in my hand here \nwill make it more likely for Americans to save for retirement?\n  In my left hand here, I hold a Webster's dictionary, which defines \nevery word in the English language, and it only has a few more pages \nthan this 1,000-page rule that defines one word, Mr. Speaker, \n``fiduciary.'' The last thing Washington should be doing is making it \nharder for working families to save and invest, but because they took \ntheir my-way-or-the-highway approach, we now have a rule that will do \nexactly that.\n  The fiduciary rule will make it harder for working families to save \nfor retirement. It will restrict access to some of the most basic \nfinancial advice, and it will create new hurdles for small businesses \nwho want to offer their employees retirement options.\n  These are consequences many Americans cannot afford, and they are \nconsequences we will not accept. That is why this resolution is so \nimportant: to put a stop to this fundamentally flawed rule and protect \nthe men and women working to retire with the financial security and \npeace of mind they deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on H.J. Res. 88.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 88. This Congressional \nReview Act resolution of disapproval would undo the Department of \nLabor's final rule that simply ensures financial advisers act in the \nbest interests of their clients with retirement funds.\n  Now, this is a Department of Labor rule that only applies to workers' \nretirement funds. In times past, people would retire and receive a \ndefined benefit. They would just retire and get their promised income. \nBut now, we have what are called defined contribution plans, where the \nmoney is invested and, over the years, if someone, even a modest-income \nperson, invests over his 40-year career, he could easily amass a fund \nof hundreds of thousands of dollars, even $1 million if they start \nearly and invest consistently.\n  So we are talking about people who may not have bought a single share \nof stock or a bond or mutual fund in their life, who walks into an \ninvestment adviser's office with all of the savings that could amount \nto as much as $1 million.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  For far too long, certain financial advisers have been able to \nexploit loopholes in the decades-old regulation that governs investment \nadvice for retirement savers. Right now, financial advisers can easily \nsteer retirement clients towards financial products that may yield the \nadviser a big commission but may not be in their clients' best \ninterest. Of course, not every financial adviser does this, but some \ndo.\n  This unscrupulous practice of providing what is called conflicted \nadvice insidiously erodes workers' retirement nest eggs. According to \nthe White House Council of Economic Advisers, retirement savers lose \n$17 billion a year as a result of receiving conflicted advice about \ntheir retirement savings.\n  The Department of Labor recognizes the magnitude of this problem, and \nthe department took action to protect workers' retirement savings. All \ntold, they have been working on this issue for nearly 6 years. Over the \npast year alone, they conducted hundreds of meetings and provided the \nAmerican public and industry representatives with nearly 6 months to \nweigh in on their proposal to fix the problem.\n  Secretary Perez and his colleagues listened to and repeatedly assured \nindustry officials, Members of Congress, and other stakeholders that \nthe final proposal would reflect the input that the department received \nand that the department would get the rule right. I believe the \ndepartment did just that. The final rule addresses the legitimate \nconcerns raised by Members of Congress, industry, and other \nstakeholders without compromising the main goal: ensuring that \nretirement clients receive investment advice that is in their best \ninterest.\n  I am not alone in believing this. The broad and diverse coalition of \nstakeholders, including AARP, AFL-CIO, NAACP, National Council of La \nRaza, and many others have registered strong support for the rule.\n  But let's be clear: support for the final rule is not limited to \nthose who represent and advocate for consumers and workers. Initial \nreactions to the final rule from Merrill Lynch Wealth Management, TIAA, \nMorgan Stanley, and others in the financial services sector have been \npositive and encouraging. Other companies appear to be reserving \njudgment on the rule until they better understand its full \nimplications, and that is understandable.\n  But House Republicans have not reserved judgment. They have rushed to \njudgment in their opposition to the final rule. That is unfortunate \nbecause the final rule is a responsible solution to a real problem. The \nrule will help workers enjoy a dignified retirement, and this \nresolution would reject the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution should be rejected for what it is: an \neffort to perpetuate an unacceptable status quo that allows some \nadvisers to operate under a business model that puts their\n\n[[Page H2083]]\n\ninterests and their financial interests ahead of their clients' \ninterests. We should protect workers' hard-earned retirement funds and \nreject this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Louisiana, Dr. Charles Boustany, a member \nof the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, planning for retirement can be a difficult \nand often bewildering task. Consumers have to choose from a complex web \nof plans, including traditional IRAs, Roth IRAs, SIMPLE IRAs, Qualified \nPlans, 403(b) accounts, or 529 plans.\n  Let's face it, the average American oftentimes has a difficult time \nunderstanding what these types of plans do, which is why it is \nnecessary to have licensed, professional retirement advisers and \nfinancial advisers to help navigate the system.\n  Today, baby boomers are retiring at a rate of 10,000 a day. In 2014, \nan estimated $325 billion was withdrawn from 401(k) plans in the United \nStates for retirement purposes. This is a big deal. But the Obama \nadministration is now proposing new rules that will make it so costly \nto use a retirement adviser, most low- and medium-income families will \nbe locked out. This is just not right.\n  The heavy burdens imposed by the administration's fiduciary rule \ncould result in fewer Americans saving for retirement using private-\nsector vehicles such as 401(k)s or IRAs. Don't take it just from me. \nTake it from a licensed financial adviser from my hometown of \nLafayette, Louisiana, who said the following in comments to the \nDepartment of Labor: ``This proposed regulation could force some \ninvestors into a fee-based account arrangement which could actually be \nto their detriment. Just as in most things in life, a one-size-fits-all \nsolution would most certainly not be best for all.''\n  Ultimately, this will stifle individual choice and empower government \nbureaucrats to make decisions on behalf of those saving for retirement \ninstead of professional retirement advisers with the knowledge and \nqualifications to provide advice for their clients.\n  I ask this question: How can a regulation that could disqualify up to \n7 million IRA holders from investment advice and potentially reduce the \nnumber of IRAs opened annually between 300,000 and 400,000 be a good \nidea?\n  That just defies common sense. I believe policymakers should do \neverything they can to help Americans prepare for retirement and not \ncreate red tape that makes saving for retirement more difficult. That \nis why I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters), the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Financial Services.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong \nopposition to H.J. Res. 88, which would invalidate the Department of \nLabor's recently finalized fiduciary duty rule and threaten our \nseniors' retirement savings to the tune of $17 billion per year.\n  The rule closes loopholes and gaps in our laws so that all financial \nadvisers act in their clients' best interest when providing advice on \nretirement investments. This is an essential reform that will protect \nour seniors and ensure our retirees are financially secure.\n  Not only is this rule a commonsense update, but the Department of \nLabor worked diligently to address all legitimate stockholder concerns. \nSecretary Perez should be commended for his exemplary leadership on \nthis issue.\n  The Department of Labor spent countless hours reviewing comments, \nmeeting with industry and other interested stakeholders, and responding \nto lawmakers' concerns. That effort has resulted in a strong, workable \nrule that takes into account different business models across the \nindustry.\n  For example, the final rule specifically allows firms to recommend \nproprietary products as long as they make certain disclosures and act \nin the clients' best interest. It streamlines those required \ndisclosures to make it easier for firms to comply. It provides \nflexibility in the timing of a contract between a client and an \nadviser, and it establishes clear distinctions between what is \nconsidered education and advice.\n  Overall, the final rule is carefully crafted to protect investors \nwhile creating a workable process for financial advisers. What is more, \nthe rule is supported by hundreds of stakeholders who represent the \nfinancial services industry, the public interest, civil rights, \nconsumers, labor unions, and many investment advisers who are already \nproviding advice to savers under a fiduciary standard, yet my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle are so intent on dismantling \nthis crucial rule.\n\n  This resolution is not their first attempt. H.R. 1090, which went \nthrough my committee and passed the House largely along party lines, \nwould have imposed unacceptable delays on the Department of Labor's \nrulemaking effort. Different measures were considered in other \ncommittees that would have replaced the rule with a harmful \nalternative, and riders were attempted on appropriations bills to \nprevent the department from working on this rule altogether.\n  Now, Republicans may have the votes to pass the disapproval \nresolution on a simple majority, but the President will veto this bill, \nand Democrats will stand strong to ensure that they cannot override \nthat veto. We will ensure that the laws protecting our seniors' savings \nare as robust as possible in a fair market. We will ensure that \nhardworking Americans can trust their financial advisers and make sound \ninvestments, and we will ensure that everyone has a right to retire \nwith dignity and security.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I want to put one thing to rest \nnow. This $17 billion you are going to hear over and over again, what \nthey simply did with this formula was take the amount of money in \nretirement savings and assume that if you used any other adviser other \nthan a fiduciary through the life of the investment, you would get 1 \npercent less earnings. That is how you get to $17 billion. It has been \nrefuted by numerous people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner), who serves on the Committee on Financial \nServices.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. I thank the chairman for his leadership and for yielding \nme the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of a resolution to stop the \nDepartment of Labor from attacking Americans' savings.\n  Mr. Speaker, investing in the future and saving for retirement can be \nsome of the most personal and consequential decisions that families \nmake. With three children to raise, my husband and I worked tirelessly \nto put food on the table each day while squeezing what we could into a \nretirement account.\n  For those families today living paycheck to paycheck, we must provide \nmore opportunities to save for the future, not limit them. Mr. Speaker, \nthis is about Main Street, not Wall Street.\n  The DOL's fiduciary rule is simply ObamaCare for retirement savings. \nIt is clear that this top-down, Washington-knows-best power grab will \nonly hurt those it claims it will protect: low- and middle-income \nfamilies that are looking for sound investment advice in the midst of a \nsavings crisis.\n  Today, sadly, 45 percent of working-age families do not have any \nretirement savings. Nearly half of our workforce is not saving for \nretirement. For those who are saving, the average retirement balance is \nonly $3,000 for working-age families and $12,000 for families nearing \nretirement.\n  Every American should have access to sound investment advice, but the \nDepartment of Labor is going too far, increasing costs for advice and \nultimately putting low- and middle-income, hardworking families at a \nsevere disadvantage. Congress must act to stop this intrusion on \nAmericans seeking to do the right thing regarding their savings \nresponsibility.\n  Rarely in Washington do Democrats and Republicans find common ground \non issues, but with the Department of Labor forcing more than 1,000 \npages of investment regulations on American families, we have joined \ntogether with bipartisan concern.\n  Mr. Speaker, the choice is simple: either you stand with low- and \nmiddle-income families saving for the future or you stand with yet \nanother Big Government takeover by this administration.\n\n[[Page H2084]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the resolution that we will vote on today will stop this \nrule and give Americans the freedom--the freedom--to choose how they \nplan for and invest in their future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to pass this \nresolution.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), the ranking member of the \nCommittee on Ways and Means.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished ranking member for \nyielding. The gentleman has worked so hard on this with so many others.\n  Mr. Speaker, this fiduciary rule has had a long, dedicated and \ndeliberative journey. The administration first issued proposed \nregulations on this issue in 2010. They received many comments from \nconsumer and industry groups, and they decided to redraft the proposal. \nThat new proposal, issued last year, prompted more than 3,000 comment \nletters. The administration and the Department of Labor actively took \nthese comments and the numerous consultations on all sides of this \nissue into account when they prepared the final draft of the rule. It \nis the way government should act.\n  What the Department of Labor rule does is strengthen the trust \nbetween a financial adviser and their client. It says that a fiduciary \nor financial adviser must act in their clients' best interest. The \nRepublicans oppose this rule guided by their ideological blinders.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  This rule is important because when the Employee Retirement Income \nSecurity Act, ERISA, was first passed in 1974, 401(k) plans did not yet \nexist and IRAs had just been created. Today, more Americans have 401(k) \nplans than pension plans and must manage their own investments.\n  Republicans today continue their claim that this rule will make it \nmore difficult for small businesses and low- and middle-income \nAmericans to get financial advice because it will cost them more. The \nfact is that conflicted investment advice costs American families \nbillions of dollars every year.\n  As the White House said: ``some firms have incentivized advisers to \nsteer clients into products that have higher fees and lower returns--\ncosting American families an estimated $17 billion a year.'' It \ncontinues: ``If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 88, he \nwould veto the bill.''\n  This rule-making process isn't top down; this is from the bottom up. \nListening to people, listening to everybody--to everybody--and coming \nout with a rule that is responsive to the needs of the American people, \nthat is really what this is about. Instead, we have Republicans coming \nforth again, essentially, as I said, with their blinders on, opposing \nthis rule, when they know that if it ever passed the Senate--and I \ndon't think it will--it would be vetoed by the President.\n  I strongly urge that my colleagues vote against this resolution.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, here is what we do know. We do know that the \nnegative impact of this rule on consumers is not hypothetical. The \nreason we know it is because the United Kingdom has already lived \nthrough an effectually identical rule. The result in the UK was an \nadvice gap that locked out nearly half a million middle-and low-income \nsavers.\n  Just last week, the head of the SEC's Division of Economic and Risk \nAnalysis admitted that the Labor Department knew of the disastrous \nimpact of what he termed the experiment in the UK that locked out these \nmiddle-income and low-income savers from advice, yet it moved forward \nto put us on that same path.\n  Mr. Speaker, we live in a country that ranks 19th in the world for \nretirement security. Half of Americans cannot find $400 in savings if \nhit with an emergency. We should be doing more to encourage Americans \nto save. This rule, obviously, does exactly the opposite.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Oregon (Ms. Bonamici), a leader on the House Education \nand the Workforce Committee.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, too many families and individuals across \nOregon and across our country are struggling to get ahead. I know the \nsacrifice that is involved in each and every dollar they set aside to \ncontribute to their retirement. Building a stable base for retirement \nsecurity should be within reach for everyone. That is why I will vote \n``no'' on H.J. Res. 88.\n  Consumer protection is one of the reasons I am standing on the House \nfloor today. Throughout my career, I have advocated for families who, \ndespite their best efforts, have found their financial and retirement \nsecurity at risk. At Legal Aid, I helped families who were on the brink \nof losing everything; as a consumer protection attorney at the Federal \nTrade Commission, I took on mortgage brokers who had defrauded people \nout of their homes; and in private practice, I represented people who \nlost their life savings when they relied on misrepresentations by \npeople selling securities and franchises.\n  I pay close attention to the fiduciary rule because I know that \nconsumer protection laws can keep Americans financially secure and \nlevel the playing field. A thriving marketplace without deceptive \npractices can restore consumer confidence and grow the economy.\n  For too long, people saving for retirement have had few tools to know \nif their financial adviser was directing them to a product that was in \ntheir best interest and most appropriate for their specific needs and \ngoals. Seeking to fix this uncertainty and put the interest of future \nretirees first, the Department of Labor took great care when crafting a \nfinal rule to remove conflicts of interest and restore confidence to \nsavers. They heard from people around the country, including consumer \nprotection groups and leaders in the investment industry. They heard \nfrom people who had lost their life savings because of financial advice \nthat was not in their best interest.\n  Saving for retirement is crucial for our country's economic security, \nbut too many Americans are uncertain about how they can stretch their \nhard-earned dollars to provide for themselves and their families. \nProducts and choices are complex. The Department of Labor sought to \nprotect these Americans from conflicted advice so they can be prepared \nfor retirement while allowing financial advisers to continue to play an \nimportant role in this process. Stakeholders from all sides of the \nissue were involved in the rulemaking. The Department took time, \nlistened to them, and made multiple changes to make sure this rule is \nworkable.\n  I applaud the Department of Labor for their thoughtful and thorough \nrulemaking process. I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided \nlegislation that seeks to block this important fiduciary rule.\n  I thank Ranking Member Scott for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, a title does not make you honest. \nBernie Madoff was a fiduciary, I might add.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. \nKline), the distinguished chairman of the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KLINE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  For several years now--about 7--we have heard from Americans, we have \nheard from employers, and we have heard from families that the American \neconomy, the American people, and employers are under an assault from a \nblizzard of regulations. In the last year, as we near the closing \nmonths of this administration, the blizzard is almost a whiteout. You \ncan hardly see, they are coming so fast.\n  This is one such regulation, and it is everywhere in industries \nacross America. It is choking us. We have got to stop it. Please, \nplease, let's start here today and support this bill.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney), a Member who, before coming to \nCongress, had a long career in the financial services industry.\n  Mr. DELANEY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\n[[Page H2085]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we have a looming retirement crisis in this country. \nPeople are living longer, the cost of retirement is greater than it has \never been, Americans haven't been able to save for retirement because \nwages have not gone up, and across the last several decades we have \nshifted the risk of retirement from institutions to individuals.\n  In that context, the notion that we would allow, perhaps, upwards of \n20 percent of hardworking Americans' savings to be eroded because of \nconflicted investment advice is preposterous. It is for that reason I \nam a strong supporter of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule and \nstand here in opposition, against any efforts to undermine it.\n  The notion that average Americans, low-income Americans, and middle \nclass Americans won't receive service in the context of this new rule \nis also invalid. One of the greatest expenses financial institutions \nhave is customer acquisition, in other words, the amount of money they \ninvest to acquire customers. The idea that they would somehow get rid \nof millions and millions of customers that they have already invested \nhuge amounts of money in acquiring I find to be not only a bad business \ndecision, but not logical in the context of the private market, the way \nwe understand it.\n  Also, to the extent that they would do that, I believe right now, as \nwe speak, there are entrepreneurs and investors sitting in conference \nrooms all over this country with whiteboards figuring out new business \nmodels that will deliver high-quality, fiduciary-level, nonconflicted \nfinancial advice to average Americans in an efficient manner that meet \nthe standards of this fiduciary rule.\n  For all these reasons, I support the rule. I stand in opposition \nagainst any efforts to undermine it. This is an important step in \ndealing with our looming retirement crisis, and it is the proper role \nof government to level the playing field and then to allow the private \nmarket to solve the problem.\n\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I will point out what has happened \nin England. We have a playbook by which to look at, where a very \nsimilar rule was implemented in England, about how many investors lost \nadvice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nScalise), the distinguished whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank my friend from Tennessee for bringing this \nlegislation forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, what we are trying to do here is help people and \nencourage more savings. 401(k) plans were so good at making it easy for \npeople to save money for their retirement. Frankly, we should be doing \nas much as we can here in Washington to make it even easier to \nencourage more people to save for their retirement.\n  But here comes the Department of Labor and, literally, with this \nmassive document to define one word--what the term ``fiduciary'' \nmeans--is going to make it dramatically harder for Americans to save \nmoney for their retirement. Anybody who thinks that this massive \ndocument, defining the ability for people to save money, is going to \nmake it easier or make it less costly to save money doesn't understand \njust how many teams of lawyers will be employed to go and try to figure \nout what this means.\n  What it will mean, Mr. Speaker, is that the cost for hardworking \ntaxpayers to go and put more money in their retirement is going to go \nup dramatically. It also means--and you want to talk about a perverse \nincentive--the rule, this massive rule, actually imposes even more \nburdens on small businesses than it does on large businesses. So the \nvery engine of our economy--small businesses--will literally have to \nface the question of whether or not they can even afford to provide \n401(k) services to their employees. Employees love the ability to have \na 401(k).\n  Employees also move around a lot from job to job and enjoy the \nability to roll over their 401(k), and this massive rule actually makes \nit nearly impossible for people to roll over their 401(k), dramatically \nincreasing the cost. Why would you want to do that?\n  What we are trying to do here is say: Go back to the drawing board. \nThis rule makes no sense. This rule actually hurts the ability for \nhardworking taxpayers to save money for their retirement, the exact \nopposite thing the Federal Government should be doing.\n  I applaud my friend from Tennessee for bringing this forward, and I \nurge adoption.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the ranking member of the \nAppropriations subcommittee with jurisdiction over the Department of \nLabor.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this resolution, \nwhich would block the implementation of the Department of Labor's \nconflict of interest rule.\n  I strongly support what the Department of Labor is trying to do with \nthis rule: simply to ensure that financial advisers act in the best \ninterest of the consumer.\n  Unfortunately, the rule is necessary because some financial advisers \nare recommending financial instruments that offer rewards or \ncommissions to the adviser for steering the client to those particular \ninstruments instead of recommending retirement options that are in the \nbest interest of the customer. This is about safeguarding worker \nretirement savings.\n  The White House Council of Economic Advisers estimates that conflicts \nof interest cost about $17 billion per year in lost savings for \nAmericans who are trying to save for retirement. This is unacceptable.\n  When hardworking Americans seek advice on how to invest for \nretirement, they should not have to worry about being led to make \ndecisions that are not in their best interest. By establishing this \nfiduciary duty that would require advisers to act in the interest of \nthe customer, we could end this predatory practice.\n  The rule requires brokers to disclose their fees and financial \nincentives when offering a financial product, introducing much-needed \ntransparency to the process. Right now, advisers are under no \nobligation to disclose this information.\n  When it comes to retirement, every penny counts. It is unconscionable \nthat we would allow self-interested advisers to rob hardworking \nAmerican families of their hard-earned retirement savings.\n  The bottom line is that we must pursue policy solutions that benefit \nworking families and that help them to adequately prepare for \nretirement. Please oppose the resolution.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, there we go again. No matter how \nmany times you say ``$17 billion,'' it doesn't mean it is a fact.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), my good \nfriend. He has two very special guests today, his children, who are on \nthe House floor with him.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I have Hudson and Ava with me. That is \nright. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 88, and I commend my \ncolleague from Tennessee for bringing this important measure forward.\n  In life and in public service, we are not just responsible for our \nintentions, we are responsible for the results, the true consequences \nof our actions. Unfortunately, the Obama administration often seems to \nignore this simple life wisdom.\n  My colleagues across the aisle have spent a lot of time today talking \nabout their good intentions with this 1,000-page rule.\n  Do you know what?\n  It may be true that the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule was \nintended to protect consumers. The problem is the rule will, in fact, \nhave the opposite result.\n  We need more families saving for retirement, and those families need \nsound financial advice. Instead of increasing access to financial \nadvice for those who need it the most, this rule will cut off access to \naffordable retirement counsel for many lower- and middle-income \nAmericans. That is the true result of the so-called fiduciary rule.\n  Dr. Roe's legislation, H.J. Res. 88, would stop this rule from taking \neffect, stand up to the Federal bureaucrats, and protect American \nfamilies who are struggling to save for their futures.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman\n\n[[Page H2086]]\n\nfrom California (Mr. Becerra), the chair of the Democratic Caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, just as we expect our doctors to act in our best \ninterests, so should the financial advisers, whom we pay to help us \nmake those very important investment decisions for retirement. There is \nnothing strange about this rule. It is just trying to bring us up to \nspeed with the times. This rule says that the saver's best interest \ncomes first before the financial adviser's commission can be taken into \nconsideration or before that financial adviser can make decisions based \non his or her association to a particular type of investment.\n  Thirty years ago maybe this was not such a big issue because, 30 \nyears ago, folks, like my parents, used to get their retirement savings \nthrough their pensions. You paid into it through your work, and you \nknew how much you would get out. It was fixed. It is what we called \ndefined benefit plans. Your benefit was defined because you kept \ncontributing while you worked. Those are pretty much gone.\n  Today it is all about 401(k)s and IRAs, and all of a sudden, you, the \nworker, have to make decisions on your investment because you do not \nknow how much it will return once you retire. It is all based on what \nthe market does; so now you have to make sure that your money that is \nin this 401(k) goes to the right investment vehicles.\n  The best thing to do is to go to someone who can give you advice. Too \noften, some of these advisers are advising you not based on what is in \nyour best interest, but on where they can get extra commissions or if \nthey have associations with particular investments.\n  This rule simply says to make your decision in the best interest of \nthe saver, not in your best interest as the financial adviser. That is \nall it says. It is a big rule.\n  Why?\n  Because the financial services industry said: Wait a minute. You just \ncan't say that. You have to say it in ways that don't affect the way we \nhave a relationship with that saver.\n  So all of those accommodations were made to try to deal with it so we \nwould always have investment advisers who would want to deal with \nAmerican savers.\n  Remember, the problem here is that a lot of Americans don't have a \nlot to save, and a lot of investment advisers say: You are not worth my \ntime.\n  What we don't want to do is restrict those investment advisers from \ntalking to the average American who doesn't have all that much to save \nfor retirement; but, by God, we don't want to say to that investment \nadviser to go ahead and take advantage of that saver.\n  This is a best interest rule for the saver. We should vote against \nthis rule which rejects the Department of Labor's rule.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I inquire as to the time \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Tennessee has 15\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Virginia has 10 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Committee on \nEducation and the Workforce.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman Phil Roe for yielding, \nand I appreciate his leadership on this issue for American families.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am in strong support of the resolution to disapprove \nof the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule. This 1,000-page rule is \nyet another one of the President's burdensome, expensive regulations. \nInstead of helping American families by expanding access to financial \nadvice, the Department of Labor has overly restricted the definition of \na fiduciary and has created new obstacles for small business owners.\n  In just reading the rule of 1,000 pages, much less picking it up, it \nis going to cost consumers. This administration's misguided fiduciary \nrule will make it harder for small businesses to assist their employees \nin preparing for retirement; it will increase costs; and it will limit \nchoices for those who need the advice most: American families.\n  In the past months, I have met with business leaders and financial \nadvisers of the highest integrity across the Second Congressional \nDistrict who share my concerns about the negative impacts of this \nunworkable regulation, which limits freedom.\n  Again, I appreciate Chairman Phil Roe's leadership in sponsoring the \nresolution, and I urge my colleagues to vote in support.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney), who has worked \nhard on this issue.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose \nthis resolution.\n  The Department of Labor's fiduciary rule is President Obama's top \nremaining domestic priority, and I think we owe the American consumer, \nthe American people, and our seniors our support.\n  This rule advances a very simple principle: if you are giving \ninvestment advice to someone and if you are being paid for this advice, \nthen you must put the interest of the consumer first. You must think \nabout the consumer before you think about yourself or about making a \nfee or making your firm a fee or about helping someone else besides the \nconsumer.\n\n  It merely says to think about the consumer and protect his interests. \nThis is not just common sense--it is the fair, honest thing. We \nshouldn't have to legislate this. We are legislating this because there \nare abuses in this area. We are trying to stop these abuses and give \ngood investment advice to good American citizens.\n  Let's not forget that most investors think it is already the law. \nThey think that their advisers are giving them their best advice. This \nmerely says that you have to think about the seniors and the American \npeople. This should be like having a glass of water.\n  On this, there should not be a vote. The fact that we are coming to \nthe floor to try to roll back a rule that helps Americans have fair and \njust savings is absolutely outrageous. If you have a problem, go to the \nDepartment of Labor. I have been there six times and I have raised \nconcerns. They have incorporated every single change in the rule. They \nhave given advanced time. They have bent over backwards to everyone who \nhas raised an issue in this Congress and to every member of industry. \nThat is why it is so long.\n  This protects the interests, the finances, of the American people. It \nputs money--saves money--in their pockets instead of forcing them to \nspend it on fees that are unnecessary and on products they don't need. \nA vote for this is a vote against the American family. Please vote \nagainst it. I believe that anyone who votes against this does not have \nthe interests of America in his heart.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Just to clear this up a little bit--and we all agree, everybody on \nboth sides of the aisle, and Mr. Scott and I have agreed on this \nrepetitively--if only best interests were the case, why isn't it just \none sentence on one page and not 1,000 pages?\n  Number two, this is about small investors.\n  Mr. Speaker, a higher-income investor, like myself, this bill doesn't \naffect one bit--it will not affect me at all, and it affects nobody on \nWall Street because most of us pay a percent of our assets in a fee. \nThat is what we do and that is exactly what this joint resolution is \ndoing. We are worried about small- and low-income investors. We have \nseen exactly this in England, and it is going to be repeated here once \nagain.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. \nCarter), my good friend and fellow member of the Committee on Education \nand the Workforce.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to express my support for H.J. Res. 88, a \nresolution disapproving of the Department of Labor's final rule that \nchanges the definition of fiduciary.\n  This new definition hits low- and middle-income savers the hardest \nand would leave many unable to save for retirement at all. \nAdditionally, it would make it significantly more difficult for small \nbusinesses to seek the investment advice they need to provide for their \nemployees in order for them to plan and save for retirement.\n  In having owned and operated community pharmacies for nearly 30 \nyears,\n\n[[Page H2087]]\n\nI take pride in having provided my employees with the tools they have \nneeded to achieve financial independence, and retirement investment \nplans are one of the most important tools in this effort. Like many \nsmall business owners, I consider my employees to be part of my family. \nThat is why H.J. Res. 88 is so important.\n  The new rule is a classic case of the Federal Government's stepping \nin the way of the Main Street success story with a ``Washington \nbureaucrats know best'' mentality, and it must be stopped. Americans \nhave the right to choose how they save and what to save for, and this \nfinal rule from the DOL will only increase burdens on Americans and \nsmall businesses, limit opportunities, and ultimately hurt their \nchances to plan for their futures.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), a strong consumer advocate.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank the gentleman from Virginia for yielding to \nme and for his commitment to improving the lives of working Americans \nand retirees.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a very dangerous bill as 86 percent of Americans \nbelieve that we are facing a retirement crisis in this country and as \n75 percent are concerned about their own abilities to have secure \nretirements. More Americans fear outliving their money more than they \nfear death, and 8 in 10 want us to help them have guaranteed streams of \nincome in retirement.\n  That is why I am just amazed that my Republican colleagues are \npushing this resolution of disapproval on a carefully crafted, \nthoughtfully designed rule to improve retirement security, especially \nfor people who need the help.\n  We have moved to an era when most workers, if they are offered any \npensions at all, are given defined contribution options, like self-\ndirected IRAs and 401(k)s. This means that their retirement security \nrelies on the individual decisions they make, and many turn to \nfinancial advisers for guidance. They believe that when they pay for \nadvice, that the advice that will be given will be in their best \ninterests.\n  Why shouldn't they believe that?\n  The rule that my Republican colleagues want to overturn would ensure \ntheir best interests.\n  What happens when retirement investment advice isn't in the client's \nbest interest?\n  Hard-earned retirement dollars are lost. It is estimated that \nAmericans lose $17 billion a year because of conflicted advice, and \nindividuals could lose nearly 25 percent of their assets over a 35-year \nperiod. Working women and men in this country and retirees are \nstruggling, and the ``best interest'' standard is one step to help \nthem.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to stand up for retirement security and \nreject this dangerous resolution. The ``best interest'' standard \nshouldn't just apply to financial advisers, it should apply to us here \nin Congress. Let's vote to protect the best interests of our \nconstituents.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Georgia (Mr. Allen), my good friend and fellow member of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce.\n  Mr. ALLEN. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.J. Res. 88, legislation that \nwould disapprove of the Department of Labor's fiduciary rule.\n  This new DOL fiduciary rule definition will impose costly new \nmandates and burdensome regulations on retirement advisers. This will \nnegatively affect and disproportionately hurt low- and middle-income \nfamilies who seek retirement advice but who do not have enough in \nsavings to afford an ongoing fee-for-service approach.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  In other words, it is just another Washington one-size-fits-all \nsolution that hurts those who may need financial advice the most.\n  Five years ago the Obama administration introduced a similar rule \nthat was met with much opposition. Well, not much has changed in those \n5 years. This rule will do more harm than good to the very people it is \nclaiming to protect.\n  The majority of my time in Washington is spent fighting executive and \nagency overreach, and this rule is just another example of the failed \nObama administration's attempt at Federal Government monopolization of \nretirement advice.\n  Everyone deserves accessible advice when planning and saving for \nretirement. The people in my district are sick and tired of these \nunelected bureaucrats in these departments and agencies imposing these \nrules.\n  I am proud to cosponsor H.J. Res. 88, and I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in support.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), a hardworking advocate for workers.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his \nhard work.\n  We know that, when people leave their jobs, they may get a call from \nan adviser offering to help the worker roll over their 401(k) or 403(b) \ninto an IRA.\n  What the worker does not know is that the adviser oftentimes is \nreally a salesperson. That salesperson has no responsibility to put the \nworker's best interest first. The law did not require a best-interest \nstandard.\n  So some advisers steer people to high-cost products with hidden fees \nand hidden commissions. This practice by some, but not all, financial \nadvisers strips wealth from families trying to save for retirement.\n  For 15 years consumer and investor advocates have fought to protect \nsavers from these conflicts of interest. Finally, the Obama \nadministration and Democrats worked with industry for a workable, best-\ninterest standard.\n  Today's vote is clear: Do you support rules that protect savers' \nability to build wealth? Do you want to protect investors from \nconflicts of interest?\n  I do. That is why I oppose today's effort by Republicans to put the \nprofits of the financial advisers ahead of future retirees. Best \ninterest of the saver and the worker, not the best interest of the \nindustry, is how you should vote today. Vote ``no.''\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, the average Social Security \nrecipient in this country gets $1,300. We have 29 percent of the \npeople, millions of people over the age of 55, with no savings.\n  I don't believe for 1 minute anybody in this Chamber actually \nbelieves a 1,000-page bill is going to make that easier to do and less \nexpensive to do. I have never seen that in the history of the world.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in strong support of H.J. Res. \n88, disapproving the harmful rule submitted by the Department of Labor.\n  It is 1,000 pages to define one word. No wonder the American people \nare angry and frustrated with Washington, D.C. They should be. I think \npeople are a little bit smarter, and understand the term ``fiduciary.''\n  This rule threatens small businesses and individual savers by \nreplacing current regulations dealing with investment advice.\n  But we want to make sure, of course, that consumers are being \nprotected and given the best advice possible when it comes to their \nfinancial security, but the DOL rule is not the way to do it.\n  I am concerned that the Department proposal would be particularly \nharmful to low- and middle-income working American families looking for \noptions to save, to invest, and to plan for their future.\n  Compliance with this rule would limit educational opportunities for \nindividual retirement accounts and retirement savings plans, since \ndistribution of materials about these services would be considered \nproviding recommendations. That just doesn't make sense to me.\n  The proposal would actually make it much more difficult for people in \nmy district and people across the country to save for their future.\n  The cost of compliance is significant. I urge my colleagues to vote \nfor this joint resolution.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we possibly have two more \nspeakers.\n  Will the gentleman from Tennessee advise me how many more speakers he \nhas remaining.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, we have six remaining.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished\n\n[[Page H2088]]\n\ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Duffy).\n  Mr. DUFFY. Mr. Speaker, it is interesting listening to this debate. \nMy friends across the aisle are telling me that this is going to help \nAmericans.\n  Well, being creative, I can think of a few Americans that this will \nhelp: the loggers in north Wisconsin who are cutting wood and the \npapermakers in Wisconsin. It will help them for all the copies of this \n1,000-page bill. Also, it will help the trial bar. If you look at a \n1,000-page rule, how does anybody comply with that?\n  The Department of Labor doesn't understand this rule. No one across \nthe aisle understands this rule. So when a small-town investment \nadviser breaks this 1,000-page rule, in comes the trial bar and sues. \nIt is a giveaway to the trial bar.\n  Listen, we have had this conversation all afternoon. This is going to \nhurt middle-income, low-income individuals, low-income savers.\n  Listen, if you are a millionaire or a billionaire, don't worry. You \nare going to be fine. You are still going to get that personalized \nfinancial advice.\n  But if you are someone in my district, guess what they are going to \nsay. Your financial adviser will say: I am sorry, sir. I can't service \nyou anymore. I can't give you advice.\n  So what are my friends across the aisle going to ask my constituents \nto do? They will be asked to sign up online for a robo-adviser where \nthey will answer 8 to 10 questions and the computer will spit out \nadvice for them. They get computer advice, not personal advice.\n  So when people make erratic decisions, bad decisions, when markets \nmove, you get your computer advising you. Instead of calling a person, \nan adviser who says, ``Listen, you are not going to retire for 10, 15, \nor 25 years, don't sell right now. Now is not the time to sell. Hold \non,'' you don't get that advice because you have a computer.\n  I think we have to look at the real intent of this law. Less people \nare going to save, and more people are going to save even less.\n  So, at the end of the day, you are going to see Americans enter into \ntheir retirement years without having a little nest egg for their \nretirement, which means more Americans are going to be more reliant and \nmore dependent on the government, which is what this has all been \nabout: more government reliance.\n  Let's make sure we empower our citizens, our people, to get financial \nadvice and be treated fairly and honorably by the men and women who \nserve our communities and our constituents.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this joint resolution. \nWhile this rule may be well intended, its effects will lead to higher \nfees, lack of diversity and choice, limiting access to professional \nretirement planning and guidance for those who need it the most, low \nbalance, smaller investors trying to save every month for their \nretirement.\n  I have long believed that the Securities and Exchange Commission is \nthe governing agency most expert and should have been taking the lead \non this project of the fiduciary rule. The administration should have \ninsisted on it.\n  Instead, they have been off track for 5 years. We are left with a \n1,000-page rule that creates a confusing, bifurcated set of standards \nthat will confuse investment advisers and their clients trying to save \nfor retirement. Americans need more affordable retirement choices, not \nless.\n  I thank the gentleman from Tennessee and Mrs. Wagner for their work \non this effort.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey (Mr. Lance), a fellow classmate of mine.\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I commend Dr. Roe for his significant effort \nin this regard.\n  I oppose the Department of Labor's recently finalized fiduciary rule. \nThe new regulations will generate nearly 57,000 paperwork hours per \nyear and cost Americans billions of dollars in duplicative fees.\n  It will hurt hardworking, middle-class American families as a similar \nrule hurt hardworking, middle-class British families. We have proof of \nthis based upon what has happened in England.\n  Bipartisan legislation already advancing in the House protects access \nto affordable retirement advice, and that is the appropriate way to \nimplement changes in the law.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 88 and oppose this most \nrecent effort by the executive branch to bypass Congress and the \nAmerican people and enact controversial policy by fiat.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, the Department of \nLabor's fiduciary rule serves no purpose other than to make it more \nchallenging for hardworking Americans to plan for retirement. This ill-\nadvised rule will limit choice and access for those who seek financial \nadvice to prepare for their future.\n  It will be especially damaging to middle-class families who will lose \naccess to affordable retirement advice, and it will discourage small \nbusinesses from helping their employees save for retirement.\n  Saving for the future is difficult enough, and now this out-of-touch \nadministration is stepping in to make it even more challenging. We can \nand we must get Washington out of the way.\n  Americans cannot afford to have the Federal Government interfering in \ntheir retirement planning. Under the Congressional Review Act, we can \nprevent implementation of this harmful rule. Congress should do \neverything it can to empower Americans to secure their future.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.J. Res. 88 to stop this misguided \ngovernment intervention and allow the American people to achieve their \nretirement dreams.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the \nStatement of Administration Policy. It notes that ``The outdated \nregulations in place before this rulemaking did not ensure that \nfinancial advisers act in their clients' best interest when giving \nretirement investment advice. Instead, some firms have incentivized \nadvisers to steer clients into products that have higher fees and lower \nreturns . . .''\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n  H.J. Res. 88--Disapproval of Department of Labor Rule on Fiduciary \nResponsibility of Financial Advisers--Rep. Roe, R-TN, and 30 cosponsors\n\n       The Administration strongly opposes H.J. Res. 88 because \n     the bill would overturn an important Department of Labor \n     final rule critical to protecting Americans' hard-earned \n     savings and preserving their retirement security.\n       The outdated regulations in place before this rulemaking \n     did not ensure that financial advisers act in their clients' \n     best interest when giving retirement investment advice. \n     Instead, some firms have incentivized advisers to steer \n     clients into products that have higher fees and lower \n     returns--costing American families an estimated $17 billion a \n     year.\n       The Department's final rule will ensure that American \n     workers and retirees receive retirement advice in their best \n     interest, better enabling them to protect and grow their \n     savings The final rule reflects extensive feedback from \n     industry, advocates, and Members of Congress, and has been \n     streamlined to reduce the compliance burden and ensure \n     continued access to advice, while maintaining an enforceable \n     best-interest standard that protects consumers. It is \n     essential that these critical protections go into effect.\n       If the President were presented with H.J. Res. 88, he would \n     veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, we have two additional speakers, \nbut they are not here yet.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the H.J. Res. 88.\n  The Department of Labor's fiduciary rule would significantly affect \nconstituents in my district. State Farm insurance in Bloomington, \nIllinois, is headquartered in my district.\n  State Farm and its agents all across this country offer services and \nproducts to help low- and moderate-income investors make the best \ndecisions about their finances.\n\n[[Page H2089]]\n\n  However, this rule by the Obama administration targets those service \nproviders and its agents. It would raise compliance costs, limit the \nadvice that companies can provide to their own employees, and penalizes \nsmall businesses that want to provide their employees with a 401(k) \nplan.\n  The bottom line is that this rule would drastically narrow the access \nthat hardworking Americans have to retirement advice, hurting middle \nand working class families.\n  More bureaucratic burdens from the Obama administration in the form \nof a 1,000-page regulation is not a recipe for economic growth in this \ncountry. Stop choking the U.S. economy. Support this resolution.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of \nH.J. Res. 88.\n  I have been here now for 5 years, and it always seems to be the same \ntheme: You poor, poor, stupid people. Only the government can help you \ndecide how you should get ready for your retirement. I don't think \nthere are any more 10 chilling words than: ``I'm from the government, \nand I'm here to help you.''\n  We are looking at the dismantling of people who help everyday people \ndecide on retirement decisions. It is a very difficult thing to \nnavigate, but, yet, we think we can do it better here because we do \nsuch a fantastic job.\n  My gosh, we are only $20 trillion in the red. Why wouldn't we advise \nhardworking American taxpayers how they should prepare for their \nretirement? We have already ruined their retirement for them.\n  It gets to the point of being a little bit stupefying to stand here \nin the people's House and think that somehow the administration and the \nDepartment of Labor came up with an 1,100-page definition of what the \nfiduciary responsibility should be. Stunning. Stunning.\n  The real fiduciary responsibility remains with the House. It is our \nresponsibility to protect our hardworking American taxpayers. It is our \nresponsibility to make sure that hardworking American taxpayers who \nadvise people on their retirement should be allowed to exist. This is \ngoing to put them out of business. Why? Because we know so much better \nthan they do.\n  This is misguided. This is misthought. This is about a bigger \ngovernment, a more intrusive government, a government that taxes you \nmore and serves you less. It is that simple.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I include in the Record a letter in opposition to the resolution, in \nsupport of the rule, from a long list of consumer organizations, as \nwell as five pages of quotes from industry officials in support of the \nrule.\n\n                                          Save Our Retirement,\n\n                                                   April 26, 2016.\n     Re Oppose the Resolution to block DOL's final conflict of \n         interest rule.\n\n       Dear Representative: As organizations that support the \n     Department of Labor's (DoL) rule to update and strengthen \n     protections for retirement savers, we are writing to urge you \n     to oppose H.J. Res 88, the Resolution of Disapproval that \n     would block its implementation. This rule is a tremendous \n     accomplishment in the fight to improve our nation's \n     retirement income security and should be supported.\n       The rule will at long last require all financial \n     professionals who provide retirement investment advice to put \n     their clients' best interests ahead of their own financial \n     interests. By taking this essential step, the rule will help \n     all Americans--many of whom are responsible for making their \n     own decisions about how best to invest their retirement \n     savings--keep more of their hard-earned savings so they can \n     enjoy a more financially secure and independent retirement.\n       In promulgating this rule, the DoL engaged in an open and \n     inclusive process, and the final rule is better as a result. \n     Specifically, the DoL responded to congressional and industry \n     feedback by making significant revisions designed to \n     facilitate implementation and compliance, while minimizing \n     the harmful impact of conflicts of interest on the quality of \n     retirement investment advice.\n       Small account holders and moderate-income retirement savers \n     stand to benefit most from this rule. The academic literature \n     makes clear that it is the less wealthy, frequently \n     financially unsophisticated retirement savers who are most at \n     risk when it comes to investment recommendations that are not \n     in their best interests. Often, those recommendations promote \n     investment products with high costs, substandard features, \n     elevated risks or poor returns. While the financial adviser \n     may make a substantial profit off these recommendations, the \n     retirement saver pays a heavy price for investment advice \n     that is not in his or her best interest, amounting to tens or \n     even hundreds of thousands of dollars in lost retirement \n     income.\n       Strengthening the protections for hard-working Americans \n     who try to save for a secure and independent retirement is a \n     key priority for our organizations, and to its credit, the \n     DoL has worked diligently to make important and needed \n     changes to an outdated rule. We urge all Members of Congress \n     to join us in supporting this common sense and long overdue \n     initiative and to reject this effort to block its \n     implementation. Your hardworking constituents deserve no \n     less.\n           Sincerely,\n       AARP, AFL-CIO, Alliance for Retired Americans, American \n     Association for Justice, American Association of University \n     Women (AAUW), American Federation of Government Employees, \n     American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees \n     (AFSCME), Americans for Financial Reform, Association of \n     University Centers on Disabilities, Better Markets, B'nai \n     B'rith International, Center for Economic Justice, Center for \n     Responsible Lending, Committee for the Fiduciary Standard;\n       Consumer Action, Consumer Federation of America, Consumers \n     Union, Demos, International Association of Machinists and \n     Aerospace Workers, International Brotherhood of Boilermakers, \n     International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers, \n     International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace, & \n     Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW), Justice in \n     Aging, Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, Main \n     Street Alliance, Metal Trades Department, AFL-CIO, National \n     Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE), \n     National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare, \n     National Consumers League;\n       National Council of La Raza, National Women's Law Center, \n     OWL--The Voice of Women 40+, NAACP, National Education \n     Association, Pension Rights Center, Public Citizen, Public \n     Investors Arbitration Bar Association, Rebalance IRA, SAFER \n     UMass Amherst (SAFER: A Committee of Economists and other \n     Experts for Stable, Accountable, Fair and Efficient Financial \n     Reform), Service Employees International Union (SEIU), Social \n     Security Works, United Food and Commercial Workers, United \n     Steel, Paper and Forestry, Rubber, Manufacturing, Energy, \n     Allied Industrial and Service Workers International Union \n     (USW), U.S. PIRG, Woodstock Institute, Young Invincibles.\n       FINRA: The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, the \n     self-regulatory agency overseeing brokerage firms, was one of \n     the most vigorous critics of the Labor Department's proposed \n     fiduciary rule. The group ``filed one of the most pointed \n     comment letters last summer about the proposed rule, which \n     would require advisers to 401(k) and individual retirement \n     accounts to act in the best interests of their clients,'' \n     Investment News' Mark Schoeff Jr. reports. But the final rule \n     gave big concessions to brokers, leading Finra's leader to \n     effectively bless the new rule Friday. The organization's \n     chair and chief executive Richard G. Ketchum told an audience \n     at the Brookings Institution that the final rule is a ``big \n     improvement.'' (Politico)\n       John Thiel, Head of Merrill Lynch Wealth Management: ``We \n     are pleased that Secretary Perez and the Department of Labor \n     staff have worked to address many of the practical concerns \n     raised during the comment period. Most important, we support \n     a consistent, higher standard for all professionals who \n     advise the American people on their investments. As we study \n     the details of the final rule, we hope to continue what has \n     been a constructive dialogue with the Department about how to \n     implement a best interest standard effectively and \n     efficiently for the benefit of our clients, advisors and \n     shareholders.'' (WSJ)\n       TIAA: ``Putting the customer first is a core TIAA value, \n     and we believe adhering to a best interest standard under the \n     Department's new regulation is an important way to help more \n     people build financial well-being. IRAs are a key part of \n     creating retirement security, so we agree with the \n     requirement that distribution advice be subject to the same \n     fiduciary standard as all other investment advice. This will \n     ensure that rollover discussions, including whether to roll \n     over from an employer-sponsored plan to an IRA, are always in \n     employees' and retirees' best interest. Based on our \n     preliminary analysis, it appears the Department has gone a \n     long way toward making the best interest standard the \n     industry standard. TIAA supports this direction, and we look \n     forward to reviewing the full rule.'' (Statement)\n       LPL Financial Holdings Inc., which provides brokerage \n     services to more than 14,000 independent advisers, said it \n     was pleased with the Labor Department's changes to the \n     fiduciary rule. ``In particular, we are encouraged by the \n     increased time frame for implementation, the ability to \n     easily enter into the best interest contract with our \n     existing clients, and the freedom to recommend any assets \n     that are appropriate to help investors save for retirement''. \n     (WSJ)\n       Ray Ferrara, Chairman and CEO, ProVise Management Group: \n     ``It's quite workable,''\n\n[[Page H2090]]\n\n     says Ferrara, whose practice serves many small businesses and \n     mid-level investors in the retirement space. ``Under the best \n     interest contract exemption, firms and advisors can continue \n     to receive commissions for the sales of financial products \n     and for the advice and services they provide--they just have \n     to make sure that the commissions are reasonable and that \n     their advice is not influenced by the level of compensation \n     they receive.'' (www.provise.com)\n       Jim Weddle, Managing Partner, Edward Jones: ``We've been \n     adapting to new rules forever. The difference this time is \n     that our compliance with the new rule will also grow the \n     public's trust and confidence.'' (Statement)\n       Morgan Stanley: ``Putting clients' interests first is a \n     core value of Morgan Stanley. While it will take some time to \n     analyze all of the rule's details, we have been planning for \n     it since it was initially proposed and have been making \n     investments in the systems and technology that will enable us \n     to offer compliant solutions to clients whose retirement \n     accounts are affected.'' (Investment News)\n       Financial Planning Coalition: ``The Financial Planning \n     Coalition opposes any effort by Congress to thwart the \n     Department of Labor's final fiduciary rule, which reflects \n     extensive public comment and articulates common-sense \n     standards for ensuring financial advice in consumers' best \n     interest. Initial reactions from many financial services \n     firms and professionals--across business models--have been \n     largely supportive and focused on implementation rather than \n     opposition. We strongly urge Congress to step back, respect \n     the comprehensive feedback process, and not to interfere with \n     final implementation of this important rule to benefit \n     millions of American retirement savers.'' (Statement)\n       Financial Engines: ``The new conflict of interest rule is \n     an important step forward in our nation's retirement security \n     and has the potential to positively impact retirement \n     investors, regardless of their wealth or investing \n     experience,'' said Larry Raffone, president and chief \n     executive officer of Financial Engines. ``Financial Engines \n     has always believed that it is not only possible, but \n     absolutely necessary, for retirement advisors to provide un-\n     conflicted advice and guidance to their clients. That's why \n     we've made a point of operating as a fiduciary for our \n     clients since founding 20 years ago.'' (Statement)\n       National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors: \n     ``NAIFA members and others within the insurance and financial \n     services industry worked diligently with the Department of \n     Labor to address many concerns we had with the DOL's draft \n     rule,'' said Jules Gaudreau, president of the National \n     Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors. ``We \n     appreciate that DOL has accepted many of NAIFA's suggestions \n     and reworked some portions of the rule to address concerns \n     raised during the review process.'' (Statement)\n       The Rebalance IRA Investment Committee (Dr. Charles D. \n     Ellis, Dr. Burton G. Malkiel, Scott Puritz, Managing \n     Director, Mitch Tuchman, Managing Director, and Jay Vivian): \n     As members of the financial advisor community, we are writing \n     to express our appreciation for the leadership and hard work \n     that you have devoted to the fiduciary duty rule just \n     released by the U.S. Department of Labor. This \n     extraordinarily important reform will protect millions of \n     hard working Americans from the conflicts of interest that \n     annually siphon away billions of dollars of hard-earned \n     retirement savings due to inflated commissions and poor \n     returns. (Letter)\n       Karen Barr, CEO, Investment Adviser Association: ``The IAA \n     is pleased to see that the Department of Labor clearly \n     recognizes that many advisers already commit to providing \n     high-quality advice that always puts their client's best \n     interest first. We have long believed that the fiduciary \n     standard should be applied to all financial professionals \n     giving investment advice. Our members, SEC-registered \n     investment advisers, are already held to that standard. The \n     IAA is also pleased to see that--based on preliminary \n     information--the DOL appears to have taken many of our most \n     significant concerns with the proposal into account. For \n     example, the IAA and others commented that the proposal \n     appeared to favor low-fee and low-cost--typically passively \n     managed--investments over all else, ignoring returns, \n     quality, and other factors that may be important to \n     investors. The DOL expressly acknowledges that it did not \n     adopt the low-fee streamlined option considered in the \n     proposal because of that concern, and further clarified that \n     the adviser is not required to recommend the lowest fee \n     option if another investment is better for the client. These \n     are welcome changes. We also welcome the DOL's clarifications \n     on the timing of fiduciary status, as it appears that the \n     final rule makes it clear that ``hire me'' discussions that \n     do not include investment recommendations are not fiduciary \n     recommendations.'' (Statement)\n       Jon Stein, CEO, Betterment: ``We support this rule for a \n     lot of reasons. We've actually been engaged and involved with \n     the Department of Labor and the OMB for a while supporting \n     this rule,'' Stein told CNBC's ``Closing Bell.'' ``It's an \n     unambiguous public good. This is one of the most exciting \n     things to happen for investors in 40 years.'' (Business \n     Insider)\n       Triad Advisors: ``We're in the process of reviewing the \n     details of this recently finalized rule, but one thing is \n     clear: Delivering maximum choice and flexibility in business \n     and compensation models to independent advisors is more \n     crucial than ever before. We're confident that our firm's \n     focus since we were founded on supporting hybrid advisors \n     uniquely positions Triad Advisors to best serve the evolving \n     needs of independent advisors in this new regulatory \n     landscape. We're also encouraged on a preliminary basis with \n     modifications from previous versions of the rule in its final \n     version, which seem to reflect the willingness of the DOL to \n     listen to our industry and the investing public on a range of \n     key issues.'' (Statement)\n       Legg Mason: Jeff Masom, co-head of sales for asset manager \n     Legg Mason Inc. said the Labor Department had ``certainly \n     made a lot of concessions'' including giving firms more time \n     to comply and grandfathering in existing investments. While \n     the rule is likely to require ``a lot of time and expense'' \n     from intermediaries, Mr. Masom said Legg Mason is optimistic \n     about the impact of the rule on its business. He said the \n     firm benefits from not offering retirement plan record-\n     keeping services and being a ``pure'' investment manager with \n     a mix of products, some of which are low-cost. ``Competing \n     with passive has always been on the table. Active managers \n     always has to justify their fees. Nothing has changed on that \n     front,'' Mr. Masom said. (WSJ)\n       Cetera Financial Group: ``Cetera has been aware of the \n     broad brush strokes of the DOL rule for some time now, and we \n     have been actively positioning our advisors to transition \n     this situation from an obstacle to an opportunity. We have \n     been utilizing our industry-leading scale and resources to \n     develop multiple new tools and platforms to prepare our \n     advisors for how to best operate their businesses and enjoy \n     continued success in this new regulatory environment. \n     Preliminarily, it appears the rule includes modifications \n     that indicate the DOL has considered some of the industry's \n     concerns. However, we will be studying the newly released \n     details of the final rule in the coming days, and from there, \n     we will announce a number of our initiatives to support \n     advisors in this area in the coming weeks.'' (Statement)\n       Jason C. Roberts, CEO, Pension Resource Institute, and \n     Partner, Retirement Law Group: ``Based upon our initial \n     review, we believe that many of the challenges in the \n     proposal have been modified to be more workable. We are \n     sifting through the details but are generally encouraged--\n     particularly with the lower bar for fee-based IRA rollovers \n     and the extended timeline for implementation. We will be \n     begin updating PRI's member firms next week and start \n     developing the required forms, agreements, disclosures, \n     policies and training in the coming months.'' (Investment \n     News)\n       Morningstar: Scott Cooley, direct of policy research at \n     investment-research and investment-management firm \n     Morningstar Inc., said: ``One of my fears was that people who \n     had already had paid a commission on their retirement \n     accounts would be moved into fee-based accounts and then have \n     to pay 1% of assets a year after they had already paid a \n     commission.'' But the DOL has ``indicated that it would have \n     to be in the best interest of the client to shift them to a \n     fee-based account from a commission-based account. That's \n     unambiguously pro-consumer.'' Mr. Cooley also said that \n     because the final rule incorporates the financial-services \n     industry's comments, ``It will be harder for people in the \n     industry to argue that the DOL didn't take their feedback \n     into account. I suspect the DOL drafted this with an eye \n     towards potential court challenges.'' (WSJ)\n       Evensky & Katz: Harold Evensky, chairman of financial-\n     advisory firm Evensky & Katz who champions the fee-only, \n     fiduciary approach to financial advice and planning and who \n     has long supported the rule, said: ``The DOL has indeed taken \n     a major step toward a more secure and dignified retirement \n     for millions of Americans. In addition, the DOL has obviously \n     carefully listened and responded to the concerns raised by \n     many financial service participants regarding the original \n     proposal including easing the compliance process but \n     maintaining a strong, legally enforceable best interest \n     standard.'' He added: ``At this stage it seems that the \n     Department of Labor's years of effort will be a major win for \n     investors.'' (WSJ)\n       RBC Capital Markets: In an unexpected positive change for \n     the industry, RBC Capital Markets said in a research note, \n     the requirement that financial advisers enter into a separate \n     fiduciary contract with customers when dealing in the \n     retirement area got scrapped. Another positive: The Labor \n     Department expanded the universe of 401(k) and other \n     retirement plans that would be exempt from the new rule. The \n     draft proposal would have covered plans under $100 million in \n     assets, while the final rule drops that threshold to $50 \n     million. RBC said annuity companies including Lincoln, \n     MetLife and Prudential ``would still see a negative hit to \n     variable annuity sales--although the impact would likely be \n     slightly less than if the draft had been left unchanged.'' \n     (WSJ)\n       UBS Group: Scaling back aspects of the rule will likely \n     boost the stocks of the very firms most affected by the \n     tighter restrictions, a team of researchers at UBS Group AG \n     said in a research note. ``While the thrust of the rule \n     remains unchanged and we still see longer-term headwinds, we \n     believe the rule's softening could provide a relief rally in \n     many of the most impacted stocks including asset managers, \n     life insurers and [independent broker-dealers],'' the UBS \n     researchers wrote.

Mr. Siman added the new rule \n     would give retirement savers a boost by putting their \n     interests ahead of advisers, while also empowering them to \n     ask for more information around costs and conflicts of \n     interest. ``The consumer ultimately will benefit, it's just \n     going to be first and foremost the responsible consumers who \n     know'' to ask their advisers for that additional \n     information,'' said Mr. Siman.

But the new \n     fiduciary role from the Department of Labor is a big step in \n     the right direction. The financial industry is one of the \n     least trusted in America--for some very good reasons.

Mr. Speaker, there are two points that I would \nlike to make. One is that when all you can complain about is the size \nof the bill, you know you have a very weak argument.\n  Second, they mentioned the United Kingdom. As I understand the United \nKingdom plan, they banned commissions, so it is not the same thing. \nThis rule will allow commissions if those commissions are in the best \ninterests of the consumer.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week the Committee on Education and the Workforce \nhastily marked up this joint resolution only 48 hours after it was \nintroduced. This week the House majority has rushed it to the floor for \na vote, only 21 days after the rule was published. According to the \nCongressional Research Service, that is one-fifth of the average time \nbetween the time a final rule is issued or published and when the CRA \nvote occurs.\n  If anyone has concerns about the rule, those concerns can be \naddressed to the Department of Labor, and the Department can issue \nclarifications and guidance. But instead of reserving judgment and \nseeking clarification, this resolution is offered and would have the \neffect of not only rejecting this rule, but any similar rule in the \nforeseeable future.\n  This joint resolution may pass the House today and may pass the \nSenate next month, but the President will veto it. There are not the \nvotes to override the veto, so that is simple arithmetic. We are just \nwasting our time.\n  Instead of wasting time on this sure-to-be-vetoed joint resolution, \nthe House should be helping working people make ends meet and better \nprovide a future for their children and grandchildren. We should be \ntaking up legislation that would boost workers' wages, help workers \nachieve a better balance between work and family, level the playing \nfield by strengthening protections from discrimination so everyone has \na fair shot, and strengthening workers' ability to have a safe and \nsecure retirement. All of that will be the focus of House Democrats.\n  For now, I urge my colleagues to protect workers' hard-earned \nretirement funds by voting ``no'' on this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Scott) for the \ncivility of this debate.\n  In closing, I want to remind my colleagues that a ``yes'' vote on \nthis resolution will protect access to affordable retirement advice and \nallow us to get back to delivering real solutions that will empower \nevery American to save for the future.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't think it is wasting time to help and protect \nworking families and small businesses from this onerous rule that may \nactually prevent them from saving for the future. As we have said here \non the House floor, almost a third of all Americans--and it distresses \nme every day--do not have any retirement savings or pension plan. They \nare looking at $1,300 a month in Social Security to live a very long \ntime. Our life expectancies are going up, so we should be doing \neverything we can to help people and make it easier for them to save \nfor retirement.\n  I started a small medical practice--joined four other doctors--almost \n40 years ago now. We started out with a very small pension plan for all \nof our employees. It was a broker-dealer investment situation. We have \nnow grown that to 450 employees, and we have a totally different \narrangement because we have a different business model now.\n  Higher income and higher earning people, like myself, don't have to \nworry about this rule. It will not affect us. It will affect small \nbusinesses that are trying to get started and individuals like my \nchildren who are out there starting their pension plans.\n  If you believe, as I do, that the American people deserve better than \na flawed rule that will wreak havoc on workers and retirees, I urge you \nto support this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a 1,000-page bill to define one word. This is a \nWebster's dictionary that defines every word in the English language, \nwhich is only slightly bigger than that 1,000-page bill right there. I \ndon't think anybody believes that is going to make it easier for people \nto retire in this country.\n  On behalf of every American family, I urge you to stand up for \naffordable retirement advice and support H.J. Res. 88.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.-\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.J. Res. 88, a \njoint resolution disapproving the rule promulgated by the United States \nDepartment of Labor relating to the definition of the term \n``fiduciary.''\n  I oppose this resolution because it seeks to nullify a rule that was \nyears in the making and which provides common sense protections for \nconsumers by simply requiring retirement advisors to put the best \ninterests of their clients above their own financial interests.\n  Currently, these retirement advisors are only required to recommend \n``suitable'' investments, which means they can recommend investments \nthat offer them a higher commission even where an otherwise identical \ninvestment with a lower commission is available.\n  Under current rules and regulations, this is all perfectly legal--but \nhighly unfair, especially middle-class seniors dependent upon the \ninvestment income from the hard-earned money they saved during their \nworking years and entrusted to a financial advisor.\n  Because those outdated regulations did not ensure that financial \nadvisers act in their clients' best interest when giving retirement \ninvestment advice, some firms have found it profitable to incentivize \ntheir advisers to steer clients into products that have higher fees and \nlower returns at a cost to American families of approximately $17 \nbillion a year.\n  The Fiduciary Rule issued and published by the Department of Labor \n(DOL) on April 8,\n\n[[Page H2092]]\n\n2016, bans these practices and removes the incentive for financial \nadvisors to put their pecuniary interest ahead of their client's \nproprietary interest.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is worth noting that DOL's Fiduciary Rules was \nthoughtfully, responsibly, and transparently crafted over several years \nin conjunction with hundreds of meetings on the rule with industry \nprofessionals and the public and after considering more than 3,000 \npublic comments over a six-month period from the American people.\n  In comparison, House Republicans quickly convened a markup only two \ndays after H.J. Res. 88 was introduced and only thirteen days after the \nrule was finalized and published.\n  This clearly shows that Republicans in Congress are more interested \nin attacking the Obama Administration than acting to safeguard the \nhard-earned retirement savings of the American people and working to \nensure those savings are protected.\n  The DOL's fiduciary rule simply guarantees that those entrusted with \nthe savings of millions of Americans act in the best interests of their \nclients.\n  The Department of Labor has done right by the American people.\n  Now it is time for this House to do right by the American people by \nrejecting H.J. Res. 88 and leaving the DOL Fiduciary Rule in place.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO, Mr. Speaker, investment advisors in my district have \ncontacted me expressing concern that the Department of Labor's \nfiduciary rule as currently written would make it difficult to continue \nserving clients with smaller portfolios. However, every investor \ndeserves to be protected from bad actors who sell them products that do \nnot fit their needs. The Department of Labor should continue to work \nwith all stakeholders to craft a fair rule. The bill before us would do \nnothing to correct the rule, tying the Department's hands from \nestablishing safeguards that work for everyone. It's unlikely the \nSenate will act on the bill. If they do, the President has indicated he \nwill veto it. Our time would be better spent improving the rule to make \ncertain investors are protected without diminishing advisors' ability \nto serve their clients.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to \nH.J. Res. 88.\n  One of the biggest concerns I hear from my constituents in Houston \nand Harris County, Texas is having enough money for retirement. For \ndecades, we have seen the private sector moving their employees from \ndefined benefit to defined contribution retirement plans. Now we're \nseeing growing pressure to move public sector workers onto defined \ncontribution plans as well.\n  Even more concerning is the current effort by multiemployer pension \nfunds, like Central States, to pull the rug from under retirees and \nslash their pensions by hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n  This pattern has troubled me for years and I hope Congress will take \naction to ensure workers in Houston and Harris County and throughout \nour great country who have worked for decades get the secure retirement \nthey deserve.\n  If American families are going to be required to secure their \nretirement in the private market, at the very least, they ought to have \npeace of mind that they are getting the best advice from financial \nprofessionals.\n  The Labor Department and Secretary Tom Perez worked for years to put \ntogether a fair and balanced rule that will ensure that when it comes \nto saving for retirement, customers--in other words, the American \npeople--come first by holding advisers and brokers to a fiduciary \nstandard.\n  The Council of Economic Advisers has reported that due to loopholes \nthat had been on the books for 40 years, conflicted advice and hidden \nfees have cost American families $17 billion a year in lost retirement \nsavings. These conflicts of interest can cost a retiree almost one-\nfifth of their savings by age 65.\n  I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today to stand with \nour nation's retirees and working families and vote down this \nirresponsible resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nAppalachian Service Project, the Bristol Motor Speedway, Food City, and \nscores of volunteers for their generosity in building a home for Colene \nand Steve Tredway and their family in Bristol, Tennessee.\n  The Tredway family first applied to ASP's home repair program to help \nmake room in their small mobile home for their newly adopted children, \nAlexis and Kadin. When ASP heard the Tredways' story, they decided to \ndo more than just renovations.\n  ASP, the Bristol Motor Speedway, and Food City partnered to build a \nbrand new home for the Tredways in only 60 hours, all at no cost to the \nfamily.

Mr. Speaker, today I join the \nVietnamese American community across this Nation and actually around \nthe world to commemorate the 41st anniversary of the fall of Saigon.\n  We must remember our fallen soldiers, American veterans, and our \nSouth Vietnamese allies who fought and died in the name of freedom and \ndemocracy.\n  Unfortunately, the Government of Vietnam continues to crack down on \nits citizens by using article 79 of the Vietnamese penal code, which \nprohibits political pluralism or prohibits associating with pro-\ndemocracy parties.\n  Last week I met with Ms. Vu Minh Khanh, the wife of prominent \nVietnamese political prisoner, Mr. Nguyen Van Dai. Mr. Nguyen is \ncurrently being detained by the Vietnamese Government after being \nseverely beaten for peacefully expressing his views on democracy.\n  As President Obama prepares to visit Vietnam, I urge the President to \nmake human rights a key priority, and I strongly urge the President to \ncall for the release of human rights activist Mr. Nguyen Van Dai and \nFather Thadeus Nguyen Van Ly.\n  It is time--it is time for the United States to take a strong and \nprincipled stand against Vietnam's ongoing human rights violations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2094-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2094]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             ROTARY CLUB OF LANSING'S 100 YEARS OF SERVICE\n\n  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan.

Mr. Speaker, 100 years ago, the world was in a war \nso big that it was called the war to end all wars. World War I started \nin 1914 and involved 32 nations. It pitted the Allies against the \ncentral powers and stretched across five continents.\n  The United States was isolationist at that time and was not in the \nwar. But in 1917, the British intercepted a telegram called the \nZimmerman Telegram from the German Government to Mexico, encouraging \nMexico to join Germany. In return, Germany would help Mexico take and \nconquer Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona.\n  So after the sinking of seven U.S. merchant ships by submarines, the \nsinking of the Lusitania, and the publication of the Zimmerman \nTelegram, the United States Congress declared war in April of 1917.\n\n[[Page H2095]]\n\n  Four-and-a-half million Americans signed up to fight, including a \nfriend that I later got to know by the name of Frank Buckles, who was \n16 when he joined the war in World War I. He lived to the age of 110 \nand died in 2011. American doughboys like him proved the decisive \ndifference.\n  Just a year after the U.S. was in the war, the war was over on the \n11th day of the 11th month at the 11th hour. In all, there were 30 \nmillion casualties worldwide, civilian and military.\n  Mr. Speaker, after the war, the United States became an international \npower. So 114,000 doughboys died over there in the great World War I. \nWhen they got home, an equal number died from the Spanish flu that they \nhad contracted when they were in Europe.\n  Mr. Speaker, we remember them all 100 years ago this year, for the \nworst casualty of war is to be forgotten.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2095-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              LEAD POISONING IN DRINKING WATER IN SCHOOLS\n\n  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, we have a situation that is getting very \nserious in this Nation, and it is the issue of drinking water in \nschools.\n  I hail from the 10th Congressional District of the State of New \nJersey, and after traveling to Flint, Michigan, on March 4 to listen to \nthe people of that community talk about what had happened in their \ncommunity around their drinking water and how their children have been \npoisoned--a potential of 9,000 children having issues with lead--I came \nback to Newark, New Jersey, my home, knowing that Newark is the third \noldest city in the Nation.\n  I took action. I spoke to several mayors in my community, and I said: \n``You need to pay attention to what is going on with drinking water. \nThere is a problem.''\n  Lo and behold, 3 days later, in 30 schools in Newark, New Jersey, \nelevated levels of lead were found. So I took action, and I have \nintroduced the TEST for Lead Act in schools. This will help States that \nget Federal dollars from the Federal Government test the water in \nschools for lead.\n  This is not only a cities issue. In several communities around \nNewark, this issue has also been found in the suburbs. It is coming to \na community near you. So I ask my colleagues to support the TEST for \nLead Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2095-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2095]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1545\n                 CHANGES TO THE WHITE COLLAR EXEMPTION\n\n  (Mr. YOHO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOHO.

This \nis lawmaking by executive fiat and it is unconstitutional.\n  It is time for Congress to revive the legislative veto and hold an \nunaccountable executive branch accountable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2095-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2095-H2102]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              MINIMUM WAGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Walker).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Raise the \nWage Act that was introduced almost exactly 1 year ago today.\n  Raising the minimum wage is critical to addressing income inequality \nin the United States, one of the most pressing issues facing our \nNation. But the majority has not even called a hearing on this issue.\n  Yesterday, the Committee on Education and the Workforce Democrats \nheld our own forum on this issue, during which we considered the \nevidence in support of raising the minimum wage. We heard from business \nleaders and economists that raising the wage will reduce workforce \nturnover, stimulate consumer spending, and grow jobs.\n  The evidence is absolutely clear that raising the minimum wage will \ngive 35 million workers a raise and lift 4.5 million Americans out of \npoverty. It is also abundantly clear that raising the minimum wage will \nbenefit businesses in the U.S. economy. That may be why in a recent \npoll from Republican pollster Frank Luntz, 80 percent of business \nexecutives supported raising the minimum wage.\n  The record could not be more clear: raising the minimum wage is good \nfor workers, businesses, and the American economy. That is why today I \ninclude in the Record testimony from yesterday's Member forum on the \nBusiness Case for Raising the Federal Minimum Wage, presented by David \nCooper of the Economic Policy Institute; Sherry Deutschmann of \nLetterLogic, Inc.; Scott Nash of MOM's Organic; and Carmen Ortiz Larsen \nof AQUAS, Inc.\n\n Written Remarks from Carmen Ortiz Larsen, President of AQUAS Inc. and \n  Chair of the Board of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, Montgomery \n                               County, MD\n\n Submitted to the House Education & the Workforce Committee--Minority \n Panel on the Business and Economic Case for Raising the Minimum Wage, \n                             April 27, 2016\n\n       My name is Carmen Ortiz Larsen, and I support an increase \n     in the Federal minimum wage to at least $12 by 2020; I \n     support the Raise the Wage Act. I am the owner and President \n     of an Engineering and Information Technology firm called \n     AQUAS Incorporated. I am also the Chair of the Board of the \n     Hispanic Chamber of Commerce of Montgomery County, Maryland.\n       AQUAS Inc. staff includes professionals, administrative \n     personnel, and field technicians. Our lowest wage is $14 an \n     hour. Our plan is to have the minimum wage in our workplace \n     at $16/hour within the next 18 months.\n       Being a small business owner is hard work. Small business \n     owners have to be frugal, prudent, smart and alert to \n     opportunities, navigating cash flow ups and downs, and \n     managing cost increases and price competitiveness. \n     Controlling costs is essential to ensure sufficient margins \n     for funding growth, long-term success and customer \n     satisfaction. If I don't control costs wisely, though, the \n     dollars I save in one area of the business could cost me more \n     in other areas.\n       Some years ago we sought to keep costs down by using the \n     lowest legal minimum wage as compensation for clerical and \n     field staff. We found that these workers had a greater \n     incidence of health issues, absenteeism and turnover. The \n     cost of replacing and retraining staff outweighed any savings \n     in keeping their pay rate low.\n       We found that it was a smarter business policy to raise the \n     hourly rate for the lower paid jobs. The results were better \n     staff morale, increased loyalty and better service to the \n     customer. We gained a more stable workforce and improved \n     performance.\n       Markets are competitive, and every year costs go up. We \n     have to face yearly increases in cost of insurance, supplies, \n     advertising, facilities, services. We take this for granted \n     as the cost of doing business. It should be no different to \n     expect wage increases, especially for the lowest paid \n     workers. All employees deserve a wage that is sufficient to \n     live without the anxiety of being left without food or \n     shelter.\n       AQUAS does not believe that the answer to cost management \n     or competitive challenges lies in paying our staff poverty \n     wages; this simply diminishes the quality and ongoing success \n     of our enterprise. Instead, we remain competitive through \n     efficiencies and quality improvements, through innovative \n     ways to maintain reasonable profitability and improve the \n     customer's experience. Our staff is part of who we are as a \n     company, and they deserve to make ends meet.\n       We look to you as elected officials to set boundaries that \n     cut across special interest areas, to make those tough \n     decisions that create a delicate balance between an \n     unrestrained commercial interest and a level\n\n[[Page H2096]]\n\n     playing field for businesses and acceptable conditions for \n     individual sustainability. The current minimum wage adjusted \n     for inflation is lower than it was in 1950. This is simply \n     untenable and should be unacceptable in our country.\n       The current $7.25 an hour does not provide minimum wage \n     workers with a wage with which they can live with dignity, \n     have a decent home, nutritious food, and a reliable way to \n     get back and forth from work, without worrying about whether \n     or not they will lose their job or their family if they \n     can't. The minimum wage is so low that workers have to seek a \n     second job or public assistance of one kind or another. I \n     want to contribute to my community--not burden it by paying \n     wages my employees can't live on. Raising the federal minimum \n     wage is long overdue.\n       In my community engagement as a business owner and as the \n     Chair of the Board of the Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, I see \n     an awful lot of the consequences of poverty wages in the \n     community; I see families that fall apart and struggle to \n     stay healthy, with each adult working more than one job, and \n     still having a hard time making ends meet. These people are \n     our consumer base, they are our neighbors, they buy from us, \n     they vote for you. I don't want my government supporting \n     policies like an inadequate minimum wage that promote \n     poverty, weaken consumer demand, and ultimately hurt my \n     business and other businesses. We have to set a reasonable \n     wage floor.\n       I am here today to testify on behalf of a decent minimum \n     wage that will reinforce employee productivity and ensure \n     that when an employee goes home after work, they have the \n     time, energy and enthusiasm to give to their families and \n     community without fear, without anxiety and without hunger.\n       Thank you.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n      Written Remarks from Scott Nash, Owner, MOM's Organic Market\n\n Submitted to the House Education & the Workforce Committee--Minority \nPanel on Business and Economic Case for Raising the Minimum Wage April \n                                27, 2016\n\n       My name is Scott Nash. I am the founder and CEO of a \n     grocery chain called MOM's Organic Market. With an investment \n     of $100, I started MOM's in 1987 out of my mother's garage in \n     Beltsville, MD. We currently have 15 locations in Virginia, \n     Maryland, Pennsylvania and the District of Columbia. By the \n     end of this year as we expand into New Jersey and elsewhere, \n     we will have 18 stores and more than 1,000 employees. Our \n     annual sales are more than $200 million. We support raising \n     the federal minimum wage to at least $12 by 2020.\n       In 1980, just as I turned 15, I took my first part-time \n     job. I ran the fry station at Burger King for $3.10 per hour. \n     That's actually more than today's minimum wage adjusted for \n     the cost of living. I was surrounded by full time adult co-\n     workers--some with children--and they relied on their \n     paychecks to survive. Most of my coworkers had good \n     attitudes, even though every day their lives were permeated \n     with struggle and stress.\n       A minimum wage that is too low puts millions of people \n     between a rock and hard place. Over the years, we at MOM's \n     have gradually increased our hourly minimum wage from $8.00 \n     to $11. I'm happy to report that after multiple raises to $9, \n     $10, and $11, MOM's is the most profitable we've ever been.\n       All good businessmen know that their most important asset \n     is their employees. At MOM's, we consider paying a higher \n     wage not a burden, but rather a high-return strategic \n     investment. Our workforce is more productive, engaged and \n     dedicated. They are happier, have less stress in their \n     overall lives, and feel appreciated and secure.\n       With this higher employee morale and strengthening of our \n     corporate culture, our retention rates have skyrocketed over \n     the years, which has driven down our training and hiring \n     costs. Studies show that the costs of hiring and training are \n     substantial--thousands of dollars per employee. An employee \n     generally doesn't operate at full efficiency until he or she \n     has been working for at least 5 months. Longer term employees \n     also offer more expertise and better customer service, which \n     helps increase revenues. Customers love shopping at places \n     with engaged employees.\n       Raising the minimum wage is smart business strategy. I \n     can't hire anyone unless people buy our products. People like \n     me start companies to fulfill the needs and desires of \n     consumers. These needs and desires are not created by \n     entrepreneurs; rather they are fulfilled by entrepreneurs. \n     When workers' purses and wallets have more money in them, \n     they spend more at local businesses. Increased consumer \n     spending means more entrepreneurs start companies, the \n     economy grows, and more wealth is created at all levels. One \n     of the best quotes I've heard on job creation was, ``For a \n     CEO to take credit for job creation is like a squirrel taking \n     credit for evolution.'' Contrary to what some CEOs claim, \n     raising the minimum wage will actually create jobs, not cut \n     them.\n       Many full-time hourly workers who are paid the minimum wage \n     are also dependent on government subsidies, as the current \n     minimum wage is not a living wage. A low minimum wage \n     essentially amounts to a tax-payer subsidy for incredibly \n     profitable large corporations and industries. Want to see \n     unnecessary government spending go down, raise the minimum \n     wage!\n       As a member of Business for a Fair Minimum Wage, I can \n     share that raising the minimum wage has strong support from \n     the business community. To summarize, raising the minimum \n     wage will increase American productivity, decrease the number \n     of full-time workers on government entitlement programs, grow \n     consumer spending and the economy, increase wealth, and \n     improve the lives of hard working people. It's time we raise \n     the minimum wage to $12 by 2020.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n   WRITTEN REMARKS FROM SHERRY STEWART DEUTSCHMANN, FOUNDER AND CEO, \nLETTERLOGIC, INC. AND COUNCIL MEMBER, NATIONAL WOMEN'S BUSINESS COUNCIL\n\n  Submitted to the House Education & the Workforce Committee Minority \nPanel on the Business and Economic--Case for Raising the Minimum Wage, \n                             April 27, 2016\n\n       Representative Scott, thank you for inviting me to speak \n     today. It is an honor.\n       My name is Sherry Stewart Deutschmann and I am the founder \n     and CEO of LetterLogic, a small business in Nashville, TN. I \n     am also a member of the National Women's Business Council, a \n     small group of female business leaders whose role is to \n     advise the Small Business Administration, the President, and \n     Congress on issues related to female entrepreneurship.\n       Please allow me to share some basic background information \n     on myself and my business. In 2002, as a single mom with only \n     a high-school education, I cashed in my 401k and had a week-\n     long yard sale to raise the capital needed to start my own \n     company, LetterLogic, in the basement of my home. That bet on \n     me turned out to be a good one because my company quickly \n     outgrew my basement and is now a $36 Million company. Indeed, \n     our growth has enabled us to be recognized by INC Magazine as \n     an INC 5000 company for nine consecutive years, an honor \n     bestowed upon the fastest growing privately held companies in \n     the US.\n       My company processes and delivers patient billing \n     statements for hospitals nationwide, doing so in both \n     traditional print/mail formats and also electronically. \n     Though our business has a high-tech component, most of our \n     jobs are in the factory, where our employees operate \n     machinery that prints, folds, inserts, and then sorts over \n     235,000 bills each day. These positions could easily be \n     filled at the minimum wage, which is $7.25 an hour in \n     Tennessee. However, our entire business model was built on my \n     belief that I could build a better company if I took \n     extraordinary care of the employees. I believed that well-\n     cared for employees could better focus on turning out a high \n     quality product and impeccable service, and their loyalty and \n     dedication would create a corresponding loyalty among our \n     clients. And, I believed that a loyal client base would \n     happily pay a higher price for the best service.\n       Though we've always paid the highest wages in our industry, \n     until a few years ago our entry-level pay was $12 an hour. At \n     that time, we began looking at our employees and trying to \n     understand the kind of life we were enabling them to create, \n     and as our ``litmus test'' we used the following baseline: \n     ``If the two lowest-paid employees of LetterLogic got \n     married, what kind of housing could they afford? Could they \n     afford to start a family? What schools would their children \n     attend? How much of their income could they save?'' And, at \n     that point, we raised our starting wage to $14 an hour, and \n     then just a few months later, we raised it to $16.\n       In the months since we increased our minimum starting wage \n     from $12 an hour to where it is now at $16 an hour, my \n     company has grown from annual revenues of $27.5 Million to \n     $36 Million, 25% growth over a 27-month period. But what \n     happened to the bottom line is even more striking. In that \n     same time frame, our net profit increased 300%. Yes, when we \n     increased our minimum starting wage from $12 an hour to $16 \n     an hour, our revenue increased by 25% and our profit margin \n     tripled. Yes, we made other smart business decisions that \n     helped us achieve those results, but we believe that putting \n     the needs of the employees above all else was a major \n     contributor.\n       Moreover, my fast-growth company has zero debt--also a \n     factor we attribute to the financial results of paying our \n     employees fairly.\n       We are confident that our results are duplicable, that \n     putting the needs of the employees first is a great business \n     model. During the last three years, we've polled our clients \n     bi-annually and they express their happiness and loyalty when \n     100% of the respondents say they'd recommend us, and 99% say \n     they rank our service as Excellent or Good. But they \n     DEMONSTRATE their loyalty by staying with us. Indeed, over \n     the last three years, our revenue churn rate has been only \n     3.2%.\n       I'd also like to touch briefly on how a higher minimum wage \n     affects the local economy by sharing the story of Kim, a \n     woman we hired a few years ago. She says this is the first \n     workplace in her life that she is making enough money that \n     she has to work only one job. She is now able to fully commit \n     her energy and attention to her job at LetterLogic, taking \n     great care of our customers and better care of her family. \n     And, she left an open position for someone else to fill.\n       From my experience operating a small business, I can attest \n     to the value of paying a living wage. When employees are paid \n     a wage they can live on, they are better able to focus on the \n     demands of their jobs. The\n\n[[Page H2097]]\n\n     quality of the goods and services they create are much better \n     and build customer loyalty to the point where the company can \n     be more profitable and sustainable.\n       When I pay a starting wage of $16 plus benefits my \n     employees have more money to spend at other businesses. The \n     very least other businesses can do is pay a wage that allows \n     their employees to afford the basics.\n       My business can set a good example, but I can't do it \n     alone. The businesses with me in Business for a Fair Minimum \n     Wage can't do it alone. The federal minimum wage, which \n     Tennessee follows, has not been raised since 2009.\n       Increasing the minimum wage to $12 by 2020, as called for \n     in the Raise the Wage Act, is an overdue step in raising the \n     floor for businesses, communities and our economy. Raising \n     the minimum wage will increase productivity and reduce the \n     costly turnover that plagues so many short-sighted low-wage \n     businesses. It will boost sales by putting more money in the \n     pockets of workers who most need to spend it.\n       Raising the minimum wage is good for business!\n                                  ____\n\n\n   The Impact of Raising the Federal Minimum Wage to $12 by 2020 on \n                  Workers, Businesses, and the Economy\n\n\n    Testimony before the U.S. House Committee on Education and the \n                         Workforce Member Forum\n\n (By David Cooper, Senior Economic Analyst, Economic Policy Institute, \n                            April 27, 2016)\n\n       Ranking Member Scott, members of the committee, and Members \n     of the Democratic Caucus, thank you for inviting me to speak \n     with you today. My name is David Cooper. I am the Senior \n     Economic Analyst at the Economic Policy Institute (EPI), a \n     nonpartisan, nonprofit research organization that focuses on \n     improving the economic conditions of low- and middle-income \n     workers and their families.\n       I am going to speak today about the appropriateness of a \n     $12 federal minimum wage in 2020, and what the research tells \n     us about the effect of raising the minimum wage on workers, \n     businesses, and the economy.\n       First, it cannot be emphasized enough that the current \n     federal minimum wage of $7.25 is incredibly low by every \n     relevant benchmark. In 1968, the high point of the federal \n     minimum wage in inflation-adjusted terms, the minimum wage \n     was equal to roughly $10 an hour in today's dollars. (Using \n     the Bureau of Labor Statistic's longest-running measure of \n     inflation, it was worth $10.95 in today's dollars; using the \n     Bureau's current method for measuring inflation, it was worth \n     about $9.60.) This means that minimum wage workers today are \n     paid between a quarter and a third less than what similar \n     jobs paid almost 50 years ago, depending on how you measure \n     inflation.\n       As a consequence, the majority of low-wage workers in \n     America today must rely on federal and state public \n     assistance programs in order to afford their basic needs: 53 \n     percent of workers earning less than $12 an hour rely on some \n     form of means-tested government assistance--such as food \n     stamps, Medicaid, refundable tax credits, and housing and \n     energy subsidies. The federal government spends over $78 \n     billion dollars each year to support the families of workers \n     earning less than $12 an hour, and this is undoubtedly an \n     underestimate because it does not include the value of \n     Medicaid or premium subsidies in healthcare exchanges. To be \n     clear, these dollars are going to workers and families who \n     desperately need this support and if anything, our anti-\n     poverty programs need to be strengthened and expanded. Yet \n     there is considerable savings to be had in these programs if \n     businesses were simply held to the same standard to which \n     they were held in the 1960s. In a paper EPI released last \n     year, we estimated that federal antipoverty programs would \n     save $17 billion annually if the minimum wage were raised to \n     $12 by 2020. That very savings could be used to strengthen \n     government's antipoverty tools.\n       The current minimum wage is also exceptionally low relative \n     to the pay of typical workers. In the 1960s, the minimum wage \n     was equal to just over half of the median full-time wage in \n     the United States (between 52 and 55 percent of the median, \n     depending upon how one measures wages). Today, the federal \n     minimum wage is equal to roughly 36 percent of the median \n     wage. This means that someone working at or near the minimum \n     wage is much farther away from a middle class job than \n     similar workers a generation ago. Sometimes it is said that \n     minimum wage jobs are just starter jobs for young people \n     entering the labor force. First of all, we know that is not \n     true--the average age of workers that would get a raise from \n     a minimum wage increase to $12 is 35 years old and the vast \n     majority (90 percent) are 20 or older. Yet even in cases \n     where it is true, those young people are starting off their \n     careers much further from the middle class than young people \n     of previous generations.\n       Raising the federal minimum wage to $12 by 2020, as the \n     Raise the Wage Act would do, would restore the national wage \n     floor to the same relative position that it had in the late \n     1960s. Under conservative assumptions for wage growth at the \n     median, $12 in 2020 would be equal to roughly 54 percent of \n     the full-time median wage, bringing low-wage workers closer \n     to the pay of a middle-class job, and helping undo some of \n     the growth in wage inequality that has taken place since \n     1968.\n       Whenever increasing the minimum wage is discussed, there is \n     always concern that doing so might hurt job growth or imperil \n     businesses that employ low-wage workers. In the 22 times the \n     federal minimum wage has been raised, and the over 300 times \n     that states or localities have raised their minimum wages \n     just since the 1980, these concerns have never materialized. \n     The effect of increasing the minimum wage on employment is \n     probably the most studied topic in labor economics, and the \n     consensus of the literature is that moderate increases in the \n     minimum wage have little to no effect on employment. In fact, \n     this was the conclusion of a letter signed by over 600 PhD \n     economists--including 8 winners of the Nobel Prize--sent to \n     the leaders of both houses of Congress in 2014. The letter \n     stated, ``In recent years there have been important \n     developments in the academic literature on the effect of \n     increases in the minimum wage on employment, with the weight \n     of evidence now showing that increases in the minimum wage \n     have had little or no negative effect on the employment of \n     minimum-wage workers, even during times of weakness in the \n     labor market.\n       The most detailed study in recent years of the minimum \n     wage's effects was published in a 2014 book by economists \n     Dale Belman and Paul Wolfson. Belman and Wolfson conducted a \n     meta-analysis (a study of studies) of over 200 scholarly \n     papers on the minimum wage published since 1991. They \n     conclude that ``modest minimum wage increases raise wages for \n     the working poor without substantially affecting employment \n     or work hours, providing solid benefits with small costs.'' \n     (p.401) Belman and Wolfson's book was subsequently awarded \n     Princeton University's Bowen award for the book making the \n     most important contribution toward understanding public \n     policy related to the operation of labor markets.\n       In recent years, research has found not only that have \n     minimum wage increases have had no measurable negative \n     effects, but they have often produced positive effects on the \n     functioning of the low-wage labor market. Higher minimum \n     wages tend to reduce turnover and increase job tenure among \n     low-wage workers--leading to productivity improvements and \n     lower turnover costs at affected businesses.\n       Most importantly, research has consistently shown that \n     raising the minimum wage boosts the pay of low-wage workers \n     who typically come from low- and moderate-income households. \n     Because these households typically spend a larger portion of \n     their income than wealthier households, the rising wage floor \n     can provide a modest boost to consumer spending, generating \n     new business activity, particularly in lower-income areas \n     where consumer demand is more depressed. And this is true \n     even if some firms have to enact small price increases as a \n     result of the higher minimum wage. Pay raises for low-wage \n     workers resulting from higher minimum wages are vastly larger \n     than any resulting price increases--typically by a factor of \n     more than 10 to 1. This is because labor costs are only one \n     piece of businesses' overall operating costs, and as \n     previously noted, raising pay simultaneously generates \n     savings from higher productivity and lower turnover.\n       In summary, raising the minimum wage to $12 by 2020 would \n     boost the wages of tens of millions of American workers, \n     increase low-income households' buying power, reduce reliance \n     on federal assistance programs, and bring the wage floor back \n     up to the same relative value it had in the 1960s. The \n     research indicates that such an increase would not be overly \n     burdensome on businesses or hamper job growth, and could, in \n     fact, strengthen the consumer demand that drives the U.S. \n     economy. I strongly encourage Congress to pass the Raise the \n     Wage Act.\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, it is past time for Congress to raise \nthe Federal minimum wage. We learned yesterday that, of the people who \nwould most be impacted by raising the minimum wage, only 10 percent are \nteens, as opposed to a popular misconception. In fact, the average age \naffected is 35, and 56 percent are women. In addition, nearly one-third \nof all Hispanics and one-third of all African Americans would get a \nraise by enacting this act, and 30 percent of working mothers would get \na raise.\n  It is time that we stand up for hardworking people all across America \nand give them a well-deserved and long-overdue raise.\n  I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from the State of \nCalifornia, my home State of California, for yielding.\n  I am glad to stand here today in support of the Raise the Wage Act. I \nwant to thank my colleagues for standing with me today to promote the \nbenefits of increasing the minimum wage.\n  While critics warn of mass layoffs and economic calamity, studies \nconsistently show that a higher minimum wage will stimulate the economy \nand lift workers out of poverty.\n  We cannot allow ideology and partisanship to stop millions of workers \nfrom earning a living wage. A report on poverty in my own community, \nwhich my office produced last year, revealed\n\n[[Page H2098]]\n\nthe urgency of this issue. Here is what we found:\n  Last year, a single parent of two kids working full time at the \nminimum wage in Riverside, California, was likely to fall $600 short of \nwhat they need to get by every month. Not only does this situation \nviolate the premise of the American Dream that working hard and playing \nby the rules will land you in the middle class, it also damages our \neconomy.\n  A University of California, Berkeley study found that low wages cost \nAmerican taxpayers $152 billion each year on social welfare programs \nfor working families. We are effectively subsidizing companies that do \nnot pay their workers a living wage.\n  Now, there is a myth--a myth--that the typical minimum wage earner is \na high school student, a high school student living at home working \npart time. But young people make up just a tiny fraction of the minimum \nwage workforce. Eighty-nine percent of workers who would benefit from a \nFederal minimum wage increase to $12 per hour are actually age 20 or \nolder. Nearly 40 percent of this workforce is older than 40.\n  These are not kids on a summer job. These are parents who are seeking \nto provide for their children. With more money in their pockets, these \nworkers could take a few extra trips to the grocery store, buy new \nschool supplies for their children, or save up to buy a home, all of \nwhich would help stimulate our economy.\n  All of us have expressed serious concerns about rising income \ninequality in our communities. We all understand that the economy has \nbeen thrown out of balance because the rules that protect workers from \nexploitation have atrophied over time. The minimum wage is a clear \nexample of that trend.\n  The real value of the Federal minimum wage has declined 24 percent \nsince 1968. Workers are not worth 24 percent less than they were 50 \nyears ago, and families cannot get by with 24 percent less than they \ndid 50 years ago.\n  Raising the minimum wage is not only good policy, it is popular \npolicy. Paying workers a living wage reduces turnover, improves worker \nmorale, and increases productivity. For those reasons, a poll by the \nAmerican Sustainable Business Council found that 60 percent of small-\nbusiness owners support raising the minimum wage to $12 an hour by \n2020. And most revealing, the Republican pollster Frank Luntz found \nthat 80 percent of business executives support raising the minimum \nwage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record an article from The Washington \nPost describing this secret poll done by Frank Luntz of these business \nexecutives--the very one I mentioned in my remarks--that found that 80 \npercent of business executives support increasing the minimum wage.\n\n                [From the Washington Post, Apr. 4, 2016]\n\n Leaked Documents Show Strong Business Support for Raising the Minimum \n                                  Wage\n\n\n          So why do most chambers of commerce still oppose it?\n\n                          (By Lydia DePillis)\n\n       Whenever minimum wage increases are proposed on the state \n     or federal level, business groups tend to fight them tooth \n     and nail. But actual opposition may not be as united as the \n     groups' rhetoric might make it appear, according to internal \n     research conducted by a leading consultant for state chambers \n     of commerce.\n       The survey of 1,000 business executives across the country \n     was conducted by LuntzGlobal, the firm run by Republican \n     pollster Frank Luntz, and obtained by a liberal watchdog \n     group called the Center for Media and Democracy. (The slide \n     deck is here, and the full questionnaire is here.) Among the \n     most interesting findings: 80 percent of respondents said \n     they supported raising their state's minimum wage, while only \n     eight percent opposed it.\n       ``That's where it's undeniable that they support the \n     increase,'' LuntzGlobal managing director David Merritt told \n     state chamber executives in a webinar describing the results, \n     noting that it squares with other polling they've done. ``And \n     this is universal. If you're fighting against a minimum wage \n     increase, you're fighting an uphill battle, because most \n     Americans, even most Republicans, are okay with raising the \n     minimum wage.''\n       Merritt then provided some tips on how to defuse that \n     support, such as suggesting other poverty-reduction methods \n     like the Earned Income Tax Credit. ``Where you might find \n     some comfort if you are opposing it in your state is, `how \n     big of a priority is it against other priorities?' '' he \n     said. ``Most folks think there are bigger priorities. \n     Creating more jobs rather than raising the minimum wage is a \n     priority that most everyone agrees with. So when you put it \n     up against other issues, you can find other alternatives and \n     other things to focus on. But in isolation, and you ask about \n     the minimum wage, it's definitely a winner.''\n       Sixty-three percent of respondents said they belong to a \n     chamber of commerce, whether on the local, state, or federal \n     level--suggesting that the groups' public statements might be \n     out of step with their members' beliefs. The materials shed \n     light on how some business trade associations operate, and \n     why they've continued to oppose minimum wage increases even \n     as the rest of the public thaws towards them.\n       The research had been commissioned by the Council of State \n     Chambers, a small, non-political umbrella organization that \n     coordinates messaging across the dozens of groups that make \n     up its membership. The main purpose of the survey, says \n     Council director Joe Crosby, had been to assess what the \n     broader business community thinks about state chambers, and \n     what kind of language they respond to best. (Under the terms \n     of its contract, Crosby says, LuntzGlobal was forbidden from \n     discussing the survey publicly.)\n       So why do state chambers, which are usually the largest and \n     most powerful business organizations represented in state \n     capitols, seem so far apart from the broader business \n     community when it comes to the minimum wage?\n       Crosby argued that modest minimum wage hikes don't impact \n     the majority of chamber members, and so they actually tend to \n     leave the issue to trade groups for retailers, hotels and \n     restaurants, which employ most low-wage workers.\n       ``In chambers, historically, it's more successful \n     businesses that are in manufacturing and other higher wage \n     industries,'' Crosby says. ``They tend to see themselves as \n     the voice of business, but there are other groups that are \n     focused on sectors that are focused on different wage \n     mandates.''\n       In the more liberal areas where minimum wage increases have \n     succeeded, that's often true: Broad-based business groups \n     have hesitated to speak out too strongly against the popular \n     measures, leaving those industries that are most affected out \n     in the cold.\n       In some instances, advocates have even targeted low-wage \n     service industries first--a hotel wage ordinance passed in \n     Los Angeles before the across-the-board increase, for \n     example, and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo raised wages for fast \n     food workers before launching a campaign to do so for all \n     workers (which New York City-based chambers of commerce \n     actually supported).\n       But in most states, chambers of commerce haven't been as \n     shy in their opposition to minimum wage hikes. Pennsylvania \n     Chamber of Business and Industry president Gene Barr says he \n     canvasses his members regularly on lots of issues, and they \n     are against raising the state's minimum wage above where it \n     still sits at the federal floor of $7.25--even the big, high-\n     tech industries that already pay well above it.\n       ``Our larger businesses get that,'' said Barr, who sat \n     through the LuntzGlobal presentation. ``We don't get pushback \n     saying that `you really need to get behind a minimum wage \n     increase,' because they understand that it's really not \n     appropriate.''\n       Minnesota Chamber of Commerce president Doug Loon says his \n     members' opinions don't match those of the LuntzGlobal \n     survey--including those regarding requirements that \n     businesses offer benefits like paid paternity leave, which 82 \n     percent of respondents supported, or more paid sick leave, \n     which 73 percent supported. The Minnesota Chamber has found \n     that even those of its members who are offering those \n     benefits would rather have the choice of whether to do so, \n     and how.\n       ``It's what most employers are moving to,'' Loon says. ``Do \n     we need to pass a one-size-fits-all on sick leave? We would \n     argue that we do not.''\n       So Loon and Barr say they're just following their members' \n     wishes. Some business groups have a different perspective--\n     but don't necessarily have the power to combat a state \n     chamber when it puts its mind to something.\n       The South Carolina Small Business Chamber of Commerce has \n     supported a higher minimum wage, but its president Frank \n     Knapp says his members simply don't have the bandwidth to \n     push for it, with so many other issues on their plate. ``When \n     you actually talk to those people one on one, you find that \n     yeah they're fine with raising the minimum wage,'' Knapp \n     says. ``But they're not going to crusade for the minimum \n     wage.''\n       That might be true of traditional chamber members too, \n     Knapp thinks, many of whom mostly join for the networking \n     benefits rather than the political advocacy aspect anyway. \n     But within those groups, the industries that care most about \n     a given policy matter--hotels and restaurants, in the case of \n     the minimum wage--drive the organization's agenda. ``Usually \n     the most vocal members of the state chambers dominate on that \n     particular issue, and everybody else stays quiet,'' Knapp \n     says.\n       When that happens, it's easy for politicians and the public \n     to get the idea that the private sector stands united against \n     raising the minimum wage, when opinions are actually much \n     more diverse.\n       Holly Sklar is CEO of a national group called Business for \n     a Fair Minimum Wage that favors raising the wage floor in \n     states and nationwide, and she points to a number\n\n[[Page H2099]]\n\n     of surveys by reputable pollsters--from CareerBuilder, Small \n     Business Majority, and the American Sustainable Business \n     Council--that found most businesses agree Many of those \n     businesses don't join state chambers, which means their \n     opinions don't filter up to the organization's leadership, so \n     its positions don't change--and that's what gets conveyed to \n     politicians.\n       ``Sometimes you end up confused by the fact that someone \n     has enough money to be in the halls of the state senate, day \n     after day after day, funded by some of the bigger \n     corporations that have more of an investment in the status \n     quo,'' Sklar says. ``It has an impact on how it's perceived--\n     you start thinking that's what business thinks.''\n\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to listen to their \nconstituents, listen to these businessowners, and raise the minimum \nwage. It is past time that we took this action to improve the lives of \nmillions of working Americans and strengthen our economy.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from California.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague. I am proud to join \nwith him this afternoon to talk about an issue of critical importance \nto the people of this Nation.\n  Obviously, I want to be very, very clear about the issue of a rise in \nour minimum wage. For the length of time that I have served in this \nbody, which is for 25 years, I have been a strong supporter of \nincreasing the minimum wage. I believe that it has sustained America's \nworking families and it is justified, which is why I strongly support \nthe Raise the Wage Act.\n  We need to index the minimum wage. It needs to keep up with \ninflation. It is long past time that this gets done. Time goes on, \ncosts increase, and the minimum wage ought to increase. We can't afford \nto settle for the status quo.\n  Full-time, year-round work at the current minimum wage of $7.25 \nleaves a family of three below the Federal poverty line. This \ndisproportionately, by the way, hurts women, who make up nearly two out \nof three workers making the minimum wage. This means low-wage workers \nhave to work longer hours just to achieve the standard of living that \nwas considered the bare minimum almost a half century ago.\n  The greatest economic challenge that faces our Nation today is that \ntoo many Americans are in jobs that do not pay them enough to live on. \nRaising the minimum wage would directly or indirectly lift wages for \nmore than 35 million workers--or more than one in four in the United \nStates. The Raise the Wage Act would lift 4.5 million Americans out of \npoverty and reduce income inequality.\n  The low minimum wage, by the way, is not just bad for workers. It is \nbad for business, and it is bad for the entire economy. Low wages limit \nconsumer demand, which stalls our country's economic growth. That hurts \neveryone.\n  A raise is long overdue for hardworking Americans if you realize, \nbetween 1948 and 1973, productivity and compensation grew at nearly \nequal rates; but from 1973 to 2014, American workers' productivity grew \nby 72 percent--they were producing more--while hourly worker \ncompensation grew by just 9 percent.\n  Wages for the top 1 percent have grown 138 percent since 1979, while \nwages for the bottom 90 percent have only grown 15 percent. We have an \nopportunity to make a real step toward closing this gap.\n  There is a broad and growing consensus on a need to raise the wage. \nIn a poll--and my colleagues have referenced this poll. This is a poll \nof business executives, and I think they were trying to hide it. I \ndon't think that they wanted to get it out. But business executives--\nand this is a poll conducted by Frank Luntz, who is a Republican \npollster, and he found that 80 percent supported raising the Federal \nminimum wage.\n  If our colleagues across the aisle want to make a real impact on \npoverty in the United States, they would support legislation that helps \nworking families cope with rising costs like the Raise the Wage Act. \nThe American people have waited long enough. It is time to make sure \nthat all of our workers can make decent pay for a hard day's work, get \na decent day's pay.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this legislation.\n  Also, if I can, Mr. Speaker, Republicans contend that they can't \nraise the wage because doing so would kill jobs. So I include in the \nRecord a paper from the National Employment Law Project describing, \namong other research, two meta-studies on the effect of the minimum \nwage on employment.\n\n       Employment and Business Effects of Minimum Wage Increases\n\n\n                              Introduction\n\n       While the U.S. economy continues to see steady growth, \n     wages have been flat or falling for much of the labor force. \n     This dynamic has spurred the most significant wave of action \n     to raise the minimum wage in fifty years, with momentum for \n     significant increases at the federal, state and local levels. \n     The growing momentum for raising the minimum wage has focused \n     attention on the impact of higher minimum wages on employment \n     levels. Supporters argue that higher minimum wages help \n     workers and the economy, and that research shows any adverse \n     effect on jobs is minimal. Opponents, by contrast, generally \n     contend that higher wages will reduce employment or slow job \n     growth.\n       The fact that many states and cities in the U.S. have \n     raised their minimum wages in recent years while others have \n     not has created a rich store of data for research and \n     analysis and has made the minimum wage one of the most \n     studied questions in economics.\n       This brief reviews the extensive body of research on the \n     impact of higher minimum wages in the U.S. over the past \n     twenty years and draws these key findings:\n       The bulk of rigorous research examining hundreds of case \n     studies of minimum wage increases at the state and local \n     levels finds that raising the minimum wage boosts incomes for \n     low-paid workers without reducing overall employment job \n     growth to any significant degree.\n       The minority of researchers reaching different conclusions \n     rely on less precise or flawed methodologies that fail to \n     take advantage of the most recent advancements in economic \n     research.\n       Businesses are able to absorb the cost of paying higher \n     wages without reducing employment through a range of \n     channels, including savings from increased employee \n     productivity and reductions in employee turnover that \n     consistently result from minimum wage increases.\n       The minimum wage is one of the most studied subjects in the \n     field of economics. Since the early 1990s, economists--armed \n     with richer data than previously available and the \n     computational power to analyze it--have conducted scores of \n     studies in an effort to better understand the employment \n     effects of raising the minimum wage. Many of these studies, \n     often referred to as the ``new minimum wage research,'' have \n     used sophisticated methodologies that control for variables \n     unrelated to the minimum wage--such as regional employment \n     trends not driven by minimum wage changes--that otherwise may \n     bias a study's findings. The results overwhelmingly suggest \n     that raising the minimum wage has very little effect on \n     employment.\n       Most prominently, two leading ``meta-studies'' survey and \n     pool the data from over four decades of research. The meta-\n     studies represent the most reliable and sophisticated \n     approaches to studying the employment impact of raising the \n     minimum wage, as they aggregate data from dozens of studies \n     containing thousands of different estimates of the employment \n     impacts of minimum wage increases.\n       The first meta-study, by Hristos Doucouliagos and T.D. \n     Stanley (2009), shows that there is ``little or no \n     significant impact of minimum wage increases on employment,'' \n     as noted by the Center for Economic and Policy Research in \n     its review of the minimum wage literature. This is \n     illustrated in Figure 1, which arrays 1,492 different \n     findings from 64 different studies, mapping their conclusions \n     on employment impacts against the statistical precision of \n     the findings. As economist Jared Bernstein summarizes, ``the \n     strong clumping around zero [impact on jobs] provides a \n     useful summary of decades of research on this question [of \n     whether minimum wage increases cost jobs].\n       Drawing on the methodological insights of Doucouliagos and \n     Stanley, the second meta-study by Dale Belman and Paul \n     Wolfson (2014) reviews more than 70 studies and 439 distinct \n     estimates to come to a very similar conclusion: ``[i]t \n     appears that if negative effects on employment are present, \n     they are too small to be statistically detectable. Such \n     effects would be too modest to have meaningful consequences \n     in the dynamically changing labor markets of the United \n     States,'' and too small to merit policy or political \n     controversy.\n       In addition to these meta-studies, state-of-the-art \n     individual studies have developed new research methods to \n     enable economists to better isolate and analyze the actual \n     impact of minimum wage increases--and have confirmed that \n     raising the minimum wage does not reduce employment. Two of \n     these leading individual studies are:\n       ``Minimum Wage Effects Across State Borders,'' in which \n     economists Arindrajit Dube, T. William Lester and Michael \n     Reich (2010) apply innovative new research methods to examine \n     the real-world impact of state minimum wage increases on \n     employment. In order to completely isolate other factors \n     influencing state job growth trends, the study compares \n     employment trends in neighboring\n\n[[Page H2100]]\n\n     counties that are economically similar except for having \n     different minimum wages (by virtue of being on different \n     sides of a state border). The study looks at employment \n     levels among every pair of neighboring U.S. counties that had \n     differing minimum wage levels at any time between 1990 and \n     2006--and finds that higher minimum wages did not lead \n     business in those states to reduce their hiring or shift \n     their hiring to neighboring counties with lower minimum wage \n     rates.\n       ``Do Minimum Wages Really Reduce Teen Employment?,'' in \n     which economists Sylvia Allegretto, Arindrajit Dube and \n     Michael Reich (2011) demonstrate that neglecting to control \n     for regional employment trends leads observers to erroneously \n     attribute reductions in employment in certain states to an \n     increase in the minimum wage. They find that, after \n     controlling for regional trends, the negative effects on teen \n     employment in regions with higher minimum wages not only \n     disappeared, but turned slightly positive, and that these \n     observations hold true whether the economy is growing or in a \n     downturn. The fact that there is no evidence that past U.S. \n     minimum wage increases have reduced teen employment is \n     significant since, if there were any adverse effects \n     associated with minimum wage increases, one might expect to \n     see them among teens who are new entrants to the labor \n     market.\n       The innovative approach used by Dube, Lester and Reich in \n     the 2010 study has won praise from leading labor economists \n     at top universities, such as Harvard economist Lawrence Katz \n     and Massachusetts Institute of Technology economists David \n     Autor and Michael Greenstone. As Autor explained, ``The paper \n     presents a fairly irrefutable case that state minimum wage \n     laws do raise earnings in low wage jobs but do not reduce \n     employment to any meaningful degree. Beyond this substantive \n     contribution, the paper presents careful and compelling \n     reanalysis of earlier work in this literature, showing that \n     it appears biased by spatial correlation in employment \n     trends.''\n       The new body of research has led to a shift in the views of \n     mainstream economists on the employment impact of minimum \n     wage increases. Indicative is a February 2013 poll of leading \n     economists by the University of Chicago's Booth School of \n     Business, in which economists by a more than 3 to 1 margin \n     believe that the benefits of raising the minimum wage and \n     indexing it for inflation outweigh any costs. Similarly, \n     centrist economists, including Larry Summers and Robert \n     Rubin, have called for raising the minimum wage and \n     empowering workers as part of a strategy to help grow the \n     middle class and move the economy forward; and Goldman Sachs \n     released an analysis of minimum wage increases, which did not \n     mention disemployment at all--neither as an immediate effect, \n     nor as a forecast.\n       The shrinking body of economic research that continues to \n     argue that increases in the minimum wage cost jobs emanates \n     in large part from a single source: University of California-\n     Irvine economist David Neumark. Neumark is the author of both \n     a survey that claims that the weight of minimum wage research \n     points towards evidence of job losses, and of several studies \n     that claim to show the same. However, both Neumark's survey \n     and the methodology he uses in his individual studies have \n     been shown to be skewed and inaccurate.\n       Neumark's 2006 survey (coauthored with William Wascher), \n     ``Minimum Wages and Employment: A Review of Evidence from the \n     New Minimum Wage Research,'' maintains that 85 percent of the \n     ``most credible'' research on the impact of raising the \n     minimum wage finds job losses as a result. However, other \n     economists have pointed out that this survey--which is not a \n     true meta-study--was conducted in a highly subjective manner, \n     generating its unrepresentative conclusions. Specifically, \n     Neumark's survey:\n       1. Fails to comprehensively review the economic research on \n     the impact of raising the minimum wage, and instead selects \n     just 33 studies that the author subjectively designates as \n     the ``most credible;''\n       2. Omits several of the most important recent studies on \n     the impact of minimum wage increases in the United States, \n     with the result that half of the studies analyzed by Neumark \n     focus on foreign labor markets, rendering their conclusions \n     less relevant to the U.S.; and\n       3. Is skewed towards Neumark's own research, which makes up \n     a full 26 percent of the U.S.-based studies that he elects to \n     include.\n       Neumark's research, as well as the few other studies which \n     continue to maintain that minimum wage increases cost jobs, \n     have used variants on a single approach: comparing job growth \n     in states with higher minimum wages against job growth in \n     states with lower minimum wages.\n       However, as demonstrated by Dube, Lester and Reich (2010) \n     and Allegretto, Dube and Reich (2011), Neumark's simplistic \n     approach cannot accurately assess the impact of a higher \n     minimum wage since It does not adequately control for the \n     wide range of varying local economic conditions--such as \n     regional trends in manufacturing jobs losses, population \n     shifts to the sun belt, and the local severity of economic \n     shocks such as the housing bubble collapse--that affect job \n     growth in state labor markets. As a result of these \n     inadequate controls, Neumark and other conservative \n     economists erroneously attribute differences in regional job \n     growth levels to minimum wage differences.\n       More recent and sophisticated research does a better job of \n     controlling for those regional economic differences. The 2010 \n     study by Dube, Lester and Reich, for example, uses a \n     methodology similar to Neumark's. But rather than comparing \n     job growth rates among all states nationwide, it focuses on \n     comparisons among states in the same region of the country \n     that have differing minimum wages. Dube, Lester and Reich \n     show that when one uses a regional focus to control for \n     extraneous economic trends, any evidence of job losses \n     disappear.\n       The strength of the new research has led major business \n     publications to endorse its findings and methodologies--and \n     to reject opposition research as faulty and inaccurate. In \n     2012, Bloomberg News, for example, called for increasing the \n     minimum wage and indexing it for inflation, writing that, \n     ``[a] wave of new economic research is disproving those \n     arguments about job losses and youth employment. Previous \n     studies tended not to control for regional economic trends \n     that were already affecting employment levels, such as a \n     manufacturing-dependent state that was shedding jobs. The new \n     research looks at micro-level employment patterns for a more \n     accurate employment picture. The studies find minimum-wage \n     increases even provide an economic boost, albeit a small one, \n     as strapped workers immediately spend their raises.''\n       Despite the advances made in new research on the minimum \n     wage, in 2014 the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) published \n     a report, based partially on older research, suggesting that \n     an increase in the minimum wage would reduce total U.S. \n     employment by about 500,000 workers--though it acknowledged \n     the possibility of an impact ranging from near-zero to one \n     million jobs lost. Economists who have studied the minimum \n     wage, however, have criticized the report for a major flaw in \n     its analysis: Despite acknowledging the greater accuracy of \n     newer methodologies, in its synthesis of minimum wage studies \n     the CBO gave equal weight to older methodologies as to new, \n     without explaining its reason for doing so.\n       Michael Reich--one of the critics of the report and \n     coauthor of two of the studies discussed above--notes the CBO \n     erred when it took the findings of research by Neumark/ \n     Wascher and Reich/Dube and averaged them, as if those studies \n     were similar enough in methodology, time and data sets used \n     to justify doing so. He writes, ``We conclude, and many other \n     labor economists agree, that our studies invalidate the \n     previous approach used in many studies by Neumark and Wascher \n     and others. It makes no sense to take an average between a \n     rigorous study and one that has been shown to be flawed.'' \n     Giving equal weight to these studies likely biased the CBO's \n     conclusions.\n       Goldman Sachs analysts also reviewed the CBO report and \n     concluded that its job loss estimates are overstated. The \n     analysts cite the findings of the new minimum wage research, \n     which find little to no effects on employment (see the first \n     section of this brief); a boost in demand from higher \n     earnings; a concentration of employment impacts on only two \n     industries (retail and leisure & hospitality); and the fact \n     that states and localities have taken the lead in increasing \n     the minimum wage in the face of congressional inaction, as \n     reasons the CBO estimates are likely too high.\n       Even with its flawed analysis, taken as a whole the CBO \n     report nonetheless demonstrates that the benefits of raising \n     the minimum wage far outweigh any drawbacks. Among its \n     positive findings, the report concluded that 24.5 million \n     workers would benefit from a wage increase to $10.10, and \n     nearly one million would be lifted out of poverty.\n       In January 2014, House of Representatives Speaker John \n     Boehner made the following claim in explaining his opposition \n     to raising the minimum wage: ``When you raise the cost of \n     something, you get less of it.'' This idea seems intuitive to \n     many who learned about supply and demand in an introductory \n     economics class. But in fact, both research and real life \n     experiences show that, rather than automatically raising \n     costs and forcing layoffs, higher wages can lead to \n     significant savings for businesses, offsetting a large \n     portion of the higher payroll costs. Among the leading \n     factors explaining this seemingly counter-intuitive \n     observation are two related concepts: employee turnover and \n     productivity.\n       Low wages are associated with high levels of employee \n     turnover. Workers earning low wages tend to be less committed \n     to their jobs than better paid workers and are less likely to \n     stay at their jobs for long. Unsurprisingly, the \n     accommodations and food services sector--one of the lowest-\n     paying sectors--has an annual turnover rate of nearly 63 \n     percent, while ``limited service restaurants''--a subsector \n     which includes fast food restaurants like McDonald's and \n     Burger King--have a turnover rate of well over 100 percent \n     each year. The retail trade, which employs cashiers, customer \n     service representatives, stock clerks and other low-wage \n     workers, has a turnover rate of nearly 50 percent.\n       Employee turnover forces businesses to constantly find and \n     train new workers, costing firms significant amounts of money \n     and time. In the fast food industry, the cost of turnover is \n     approximately $4,700 each time a worker leaves his or her \n     job. Studies show that higher wages can substantially reduce \n     turnover and the costs associated with replacing lost \n     workers. In the fast food industry, increasing the minimum \n     wage could lead to as much as $5.2 billion in cost savings to \n     businesses and as many as 1.1 million\n\n[[Page H2101]]\n\n     fewer separations. Overall, savings from reduced turnover \n     alone can offset as much as 30 percent of the cost of a \n     minimum wage increase--even to $15 per hour.\n       Low pay also impacts productivity. While experienced \n     workers tend to be more productive, new workers may not be as \n     optimally efficient during their training period, and this \n     can incur indirect costs to businesses from lost sales and \n     imperfect customer service as new workers learn on the job. \n     While the savings from greater productivity and lower \n     turnover may not fully pay for a minimum wage increase, these \n     savings can nonetheless substantially offset the higher labor \n     costs associated with an increase.\n       The benefits from higher productivity and lower turnover \n     helps explain why large companies as well as many small \n     businesses have chosen to invest in higher wages as part of a \n     highly competitive business strategy. As MIT business school \n     professor Zeynep Ton explains, ``Highly successful retail \n     chains--such as QuikTrip convenience stores, Mercadona and \n     Trader Joe's supermarkets, and Costco wholesale clubs--not \n     only invest heavily in store employees but also have the \n     lowest prices in their industries, solid financial \n     performance, and better customer service than their \n     competitors. They have demonstrated that, even in the lowest-\n     price segment of retail, bad jobs are not a cost-driven \n     necessity but a choice. And they have proven that the key to \n     breaking the trade-off is a combination of investment in the \n     workforce and operational practices that benefit employees, \n     customers, and the company.''\n       Many employers can afford to pay better wages. The vast \n     majority of small businesses (89 percent) already pay their \n     employees more than the federal minimum wage, a strong \n     majority (60 percent) support raising the minimum wage to $12 \n     and adjusting it for inflation each year, and a growing \n     number of employers see $15 as a fair minimum wage. Many also \n     believe that higher wages level the playing field by \n     preventing larger or less scrupulous firms from gaining a \n     competitive advantage through very low labor costs. Large \n     businesses, in particular, are in the position to improve \n     their wages. Corporations like Walmart, T.J. Maxx, Gap and \n     Ikea, which employ the majority of low-wage workers, have \n     been enjoying record profits for years. According to the St. \n     Louis Federal Reserve Bank, in the second quarter of 2015, \n     corporate profits amounted to $1.8 trillion--the highest \n     since the late 1940s.\n\n\n                               Conclusion\n\n       ``When employers stop thinking about employees as costs to \n     cut, but instead as customers, they see it is in their self-\n     interest to raise the minimum wage. We need to change their \n     concept of self-interest.''--Nick Hanauer, entrepreneur and \n     venture capitalist.\n       The most recent and sophisticated research--as well as the \n     experiences of leading employers like Trader Joe's, Costco \n     and thousands of small businesses--strongly suggest that \n     higher wages increase incomes for low-wage workers without \n     reducing overall employment or hurting businesses. Not only \n     do employers benefit from the savings they accrue from lower \n     turnover and higher productivity; they also benefit from an \n     increase in demand for the goods and services they offer. As \n     observers from Nick Hanauer to Larry Summers point out, \n     workers are customers--and the better a worker's ability to \n     participate in the economy as a consumer, the better off will \n     be both individual businesses and the economy as a whole.\n\n  Ms. DeLAURO. This document examined 64 minimum wage studies measuring \nthe effect of minimum wages on teenage employment in the United States \npublished between 1972 and 2007. While these studies estimated a range \nof employment effects, Mr. Stanley and Mr. Doucouliagos found the most \nprecise estimates in the studies were around zero or near zero \nemployment effects.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  The second is from Paul Wolfson and Dale Belman. It examined studies \npublished since 2007 on the employment effect on minimum wage \nincreases. This meta-analysis also found that the best estimates in the \ncompiled studies revealed no statistically significant negative \nemployment effects.\n  We all have listened over many years that any increase in the minimum \nwage would, my gosh, send the U.S. economy into a tailspin, and every \ntime it has proven false. It was false then; it is false now. Let us \nraise the minimum wage, and let us support the Raise the Wage Act.\n  I thank my colleague from California for including me in this Special \nOrder.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. My pleasure. I thank my colleague from Connecticut \nfor her passionate advocacy on this issue and on others around wage \ninequality.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter sent to President Obama \nand signed by over 600 economists, including seven Nobel Prize winners, \nstating that the most recent economic research shows that increases in \nthe minimum wage have little or no negative effect on the employment of \nminimum wage workers. In fact, the letter goes on to read that a \nminimum wage increase could have a stimulative effect on the economy as \nlow-wage workers spend their additional earnings, thus increasing \nconsumer demand and leading companies to hire additional workers.\n\n  Over 600 Economists Sign Letter In Support of $10.10 Minimum Wage: \n            Economist Statement on the Federal Minimum Wage\n\n       Dear Mr. President, Speaker Boehner, Majority Leader Reid, \n     Congressman Cantor, Senator McConnell, and Congresswoman \n     Pelosi: July will mark five years since the federal minimum \n     wage was last raised. We urge you to act now and enact a \n     three-step raise of 95 cents a year for three years--which \n     would mean a minimum wage of $10.10 by 2016--and then index \n     it to protect against inflation. Senator Tom Harkin and \n     Representative George Miller have introduced legislation to \n     accomplish this. The increase to $10.10 would mean that \n     minimum-wage workers who work full time, full year would see \n     a raise from their current salary of roughly $15,000 to \n     roughly $21,000. These proposals also usefully raise the \n     tipped minimum wage to 70% of the regular minimum.\n       This policy would directly provide higher wages for close \n     to 17 million workers by 2016. Furthermore, another 11 \n     million workers whose wages are just above the new minimum \n     would likely see a wage increase through ``spillover'' \n     effects, as employers adjust their internal wage ladders. The \n     vast majority of employees who would benefit are adults in \n     working families, disproportionately women, who work at least \n     20 hours a week and depend on these earnings to make ends \n     meet. At a time when persistent high unemployment is putting \n     enormous downward pressure on wages, such a minimum-wage \n     increase would provide a much-needed boost to the earnings of \n     low-wage workers.\n       In recent years there have been important developments in \n     the academic literature on the effect of increases in the \n     minimum wage on employment, with the weight of evidence now \n     showing that increases in the minimum wage have had little or \n     no negative effect on the employment of minimum-wage workers, \n     even during times of weakness in the labor market. Research \n     suggests that a minimum-wage increase could have a small \n     stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend \n     their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth, and \n     providing some help on the jobs front.\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I stand here as a fervent believer in \nwhat we have advocated for and as someone who has spent 35 years owning \nand managing restaurants in an area of the country in which the economy \nis growing more rapidly than anywhere else in the country right now, \nwhich is the San Francisco Bay Area.\n  With that background, I also speak to this as somebody who has a good \ndeal of empathy for small-business owners, particularly restaurant \nowners, who are looking at monthly and quarterly business reports and \nare wondering how they would accommodate the increase in the minimum \nwage. In California, of course, we are much higher than in the U.S., \nand many cities, including San Francisco, have gone to $15 with an \nindexed minimum wage.\n  I believe firmly in the research that shows that one of the biggest \nchallenges to small businesses, particularly in the restaurant field, \nis not the challenge of minimum wage workers, but the fact that there \nis less disposable income in middle-income households to be able to \nhave the discretion to go out and spend that disposable income in \nrestaurants and on hospitality events. While I understand the angst, \nthese are the kinds of things, once we take that step--from my \nexperience and the experience in California and in high-cost areas like \nNew York and San Francisco, which have gone ahead with raising the \nminimum wage--that would indicate the overall benefit to the economy \nand to everyone.\n  Lastly, I think the challenge of this time for us domestically is, as \nI said, the inequality in the country. In a country in which the \neconomy is based on 70 percent consumer investments, having more \ndisposable income is a good thing. As President Lincoln once famously \nsaid: In order for this democracy to thrive, there must always be a \nbalance between capital and labor; and if there is ever an imbalance \ntowards capital, we have, in effect, lost democracy.\n  There is no question that, at this point in time, capital investment \nis doing many great things, including in the bay area and in our \nventure capital community and in our innovation community. In having \nsaid that, one does not have to read Thomas Piketty to\n\n[[Page H2102]]\n\nunderstand that we have a huge imbalance between wages and labor and \ncapital, which Lincoln warned about.\n  I ask the majority party to work with us to raise the minimum wage in \norder to help the economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2102-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2102-H2104]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 1-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE HBCU CAUCUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Byrne) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, it is my great privilege and honor today to \nbe a part of a Special Order on the 1-year anniversary of the \nbipartisan HBCU Caucus. For those who are listening or who are \nwatching, let me make sure you understand that HBCU stands for \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities. That is what we will be \ntalking about today.\n  I am the co-chair of this caucus, along with a Member of this body \nwho came up with this idea and who has spearheaded this effort from the \nvery beginning--she is the spirit behind it--Congresswoman Alma Adams \nfrom the great State of North Carolina.\n  I yield to Congresswoman Adams so that she may speak to this House \nand to the Nation about the importance of this topic and about the \nimportance of HBCUs to the United States of America.\n  Ms. ADAMS. I thank Congressman Byrne. I appreciate the gentleman's \nyielding to me and his work with this caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, today marks the first anniversary of the bipartisan \nCongressional Historically Black Colleges and Universities Caucus, \nknown by many as the HBCU Caucus.\n  As a retired 40-year educator from Bennett College in Greensboro, \nNorth Carolina, I have always believed that every young person who \ndesires a college education should get that opportunity. Like many of \nthe young people I taught at Bennett College for those four decades of \nmy academic career, my story is one of perseverance.\n  I was a first-generation college student at North Carolina A I \ncame to school like so many students today--not fully prepared to do \ncollege work. A gave me a chance because it believed in opportunity \nand the fundamental importance of education that W.E.B. Du Bois spoke \nabout when he said: ``Of all the civil rights for which the world has \nstruggled and fought for 5,000 years, the right to learn is undoubtedly \nthe most fundamental.'' That is why I advocate for HBCUs, for they \nadvocated for me, and they invested in my success.\n  There are more than 100 HBCUs in the United States that enroll more \nthan 300,000 students per year. HBCUs are taking our students in--\nstudents like me and like you--from diverse backgrounds and are giving \nthem a chance, a chance that other schools might not have given them. \nMany HBCU students are often like I was--first generation from low-\nincome families--so we must ensure that all students, including those \nfrom economically strained backgrounds, have access to a high-quality \neducation and are equipped with the knowledge and the 21st century \nskills that they need to succeed. HBCUs do just that for so many \nstudents. HBCUs represent 3 percent of colleges and universities; yet \nwe graduate 20 percent of African Americans with undergraduate degrees \nand 50 percent of African American educators. Despite these facts, \nHBCUs have historically been underfunded.\n  There are many unique challenges that HBCUs and the students they \nserve face. Many students don't have the luxury of being supported \nthrough school. Some have to work their way through, taking breaks \nalong the way. It is imperative then that we work together to ensure \nthat these institutions not only have the resources that are necessary \nto encourage enrollment and increase the graduation rates among these \nstudents, but also that they are capable of preparing these young \npeople for the workforce. That is why I launched the first bipartisan \nCongressional HBCU Caucus with my Republican co-chair and former \nAlabama Community College System Chancellor, Congressman Bradley Byrne \nfrom Alabama.\n  Representative Byrne, I thank you for being my co-chair. It is a \npleasure to serve our HBCUs alongside of you.\n  The purpose of the caucus is to create a national dialogue so as to \neducate other Members of Congress and their staffs about the issues \nthat impact HBCUs as well as to address the needs of HBCUs and to \nsupport the students and graduates of these institutions by increasing \naccess and career opportunities. With the help of Representative Byrne, \nwe have grown the caucus to 56 members now, from both sides of the \naisle, over the course of this year. I am proud to announce that the \ncaucus is now bicameral and has the support of my home State Senator, \nRichard Burr of North Carolina.\n  Those of us in Congress have more to learn from our HBCU institutions \nand from the students who attend them. That is why, when we first \nlaunched the caucus, our first goal was to listen, and we did just \nthat--we listened. We have held several staff briefings on various \ntopics that impact HBCUs. I hosted a roundtable in my district with \npresidents and representatives from 10 HBCUs in the 12th District of \nNorth Carolina. I hosted a roundtable in my district, as well, with the \nformer Secretary of Education Arne Duncan as well as with presidents \nand representatives from HBCUs in the 12th District to make sure that \ntheir needs were heard. We hosted a diversity in the workforce event \nwith Fortune 500 companies to discuss the role HBCUs play in graduating \na skilled and diverse workforce while learning more about the programs \nthat are currently available to improve diversity at these companies. \nWe surveyed members of the caucus and Members of Congress to find out \nwhat their priorities are for the reauthorization of the Higher \nEducation Act, and we hosted conference calls with chancellors and \npresidents for their input. At the start of this year, we held a caucus \nmeeting with the new Secretary of Education, Dr. John King, Jr., in \norder to share those priorities with him.\n  Caucus members have been steadfast in crafting legislation to \npositively impact our HBCUs, which I am proud to support, from the \nAmerica's College Promise Act, which would grant any first-time student \naccess to community college for free and sets aside special funding for \nHBCUs and other institutions that serve many low-income, first-\ngeneration college students, to the HBCU Historic Preservation Program, \nwhich would reauthorize funds for the preservation and restoration of \nhistoric buildings on these campuses.\n  Recently, I introduced the HBCU Innovation Fund Act, which would \nprovide $250 million in competitive grants to these schools across the \ncountry in order to develop critical solutions to meet current and \nemerging needs, like student retention and improving graduation rates; \nbut this is just the start, and it is, clearly, not the end of our work \nto support HBCUs.\n  Many of the members of this bipartisan HBCU Caucus have long been \nchampions for education and for our schools. This bipartisan caucus is \njust another step in the right direction as we join forces across the \naisle so that we can truly make a difference and deliver for our HBCUs: \nfrom Assistant Democratic Leader Clyburn, who works to protect \ninstitutions like South Carolina State and who has helped start Centers \nof Excellence, which have had a tremendous impact on students in his \nState; to my ranking member on Education and the Workforce, \nRepresentative Bobby Scott, who has used his leadership position to be \na national voice for all HBCUs and institutions of higher learning; to \nRepresentative Eddie Bernice Johnson, a leader in STEM education and a \nsteadfast voice for our students--and HBCUs in particular.\n\n  To Congressional Black Caucus chair and my colleague from North \nCarolina, Representative G.K. Butterfield, I thank him for making HBCUs \na priority for our Congressional Black Caucus and for Congress.\n  To our Democrat vice chairs--Representative Bennie Thompson and \nRepresentative Terri Sewell--and our Republican vice chairs--\nRepresentatives Bruce Westerman and Randy Forbes--who have all been \nfierce advocates for HBCUs in their districts, and to my colleagues--\nRepresentatives Cedric Richmond and Corrine Brown--\n\n[[Page H2103]]\n\nwho are co-chairs of the CBC's HBCUs task force, they have all put \nHBCUs first and have brought Members and the administration to the \ntable to highlight the issues of concern.\n  Thank you to all of these Members for doing this good work and for \nbringing their expertise to the HBCU Caucus, because we couldn't do it \nwithout strong leaders in our communities who represent these \ninstitutions.\n  The Thurgood Marshall College Fund, an organization that supports the \n47 publicly supported HBCUs, and the Thurgood Marshall Foundation \nplayed a critical role in the caucus' inception, and their very own \npresident, Johnny Taylor, was the host for the caucus launch.\n  Thank you as well to the United Negro College Fund, which works to \nsupport the 37-member private Historically Black Colleges and \nUniversities. The UNCF has been instrumental in widening the caucus' \nreach and has helped provide more than $4.5 billion to help more than \n400,000 students get college degrees. So we thank Dr. Lomax and all of \nthose who work with him.\n  To the National Association for Equal Opportunity in Higher \nEducation, NAFEO, which has also remained a key advocate for our HBCUs \nand our students, thank you to that organization and, also, to Lezli \nBaskerville.\n  I also congratulate the 1890 land grant institutions on their 125th \nanniversary last year. I was honored to participate in the House \nAgriculture Committee's hearing, in July, with the presidents and \nleaders of those universities, and I look forward to continuing to work \nwith these organizations.\n  We have come a long way this year, but with this crisis still \nexisting in education and with those facing our HBCUs, we still have a \nlong road ahead of us; so I look forward to growing this partnership \nwith Representative Byrne and with more Members from both Chambers and \nfrom both sides of the aisle. We can continue to collectively work \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to make a difference for our HBCUs and \nto protect and advance the students they serve.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I can't say enough about the leadership on \nthis issue that Congresswoman Adams has provided. She just did a \nterrific job of explaining to us all not just the progress that we have \nmade over the last year, but the promise we have in the years to come \nto take this area and continue to move forward on it.\n  What a rich tradition we have in this country with Historically Black \nColleges and Universities. I come from the State of Alabama. We are \njustifiably proud of the great institutions in our State. I can only \ntell you about a few, but let's start with probably our flagship, which \nis Tuskegee University, worldwide famous and well known for so many \ndifferent things.\n  It is not just what its history is, although it is a rich and storied \nindustry. It is also what it continues to do today and what Tuskegee \nwill do in the future to enrich the lives of hundreds, yet tens of \nthousands, of people who have gone on in their lives and will go on in \ntheir lives to do great things for our State of Alabama and for the \nUnited States of America.\n  I am blessed in my district to have Bishop State Community College. \nBishop State is one of the public community colleges in the State of \nAlabama. It was under my jurisdiction when I was the chancellor of \npost-secondary education. It is rich in its own history with an \nincredibly important mission in our rapidly growing economy in the \nMobile area of providing the trained workforce for all of the business \nand industry that have been coming and is already there in our \ndistrict.\n  So Bishop State stands as a great symbol to me not just of what we \nare, but of what we can be as we work with these institutions \nthroughout my State of Alabama, throughout the South, and throughout \nthe Nation.\n  I stand here not as a Black person, not as a Democrat, because this \nis not a White or Black issue. This is not a Democratic or a Republican \nissue. This is an American issue. This is about providing opportunity \nfor everyone in America.\n  So often we talk about opportunity. Here is an example of where we \nare doing something about opportunity. We can open all the doors we \nwant in America, but if the people of America or a small portion of the \npeople of America can't walk through those doors, then we don't have \nreal opportunity.\n  This Congress has few opportunities to really do the things that need \nto be done to help people. Here is one. Here is one where we can really \ndo something that will make a tremendous difference.\n  Congresswoman Adams really put her finger on it. There are many \npeople that go to HBCUs who didn't get there with the sort of support \nthat they needed, who didn't get there with the sort of academic \npreparation that they needed.\n  Now, we can say: Oh, well. That is their problem and they just have \nto find some way to deal with it. Or we can understand that that is not \njust a problem for them, but that is a problem for all of us.\n  If we can work with them and help them with those problems through \nthe programs that we have at these HBCUs, not only have we given that \nindividual an opportunity to lift themselves up, but as they lift \nthemselves up, they lift up our communities and they lift up our \nNation.\n  So I was very honored when Congresswoman Adams came to me to ask me \nto participate in this very, very worthy endeavor with her. I know we \nhave done some great things over the last year, but that is just a \nforetaste of what we can do in the years to come with her inspiration \nand with her leadership.\n  We have a number of great members in this caucus. One of our most \nsteadfast members is one of the great leaders from the State of \nFlorida, Representative Gwen Graham.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Graham) for her to come \nforward and present to us her own background and her own feelings about \nHBCUs.\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Byrne and Congresswoman \nAdams for hosting today's Special Order and for all you do to support \nour Nation's Historically Black Colleges and Universities.\n  It was such an honor for me to join this caucus as a founding member \nwith you a year ago. It is hard to believe it has already been a year. \nI am proud of the bipartisan work we have done on behalf of our HBCUs.\n  There are more than 100 HBCUs in the United States that enroll more \nthan 300,000 students per year. HBCUs represent 3 percent of colleges \nand universities, yet graduate 20 percent of African Americans with \nundergraduate degrees and 25 percent of African American degrees in \nscience, technology, engineering, and math fields.\n  In my district, I am so proud to represent Florida Agricultural and \nMechanical University, one of our State's most historic and important \nuniversities. Florida A FAMU, as it is more affectionately known \nin north Florida--was founded in 1887 with just 15 students and 2 \ninstructors. Let me just say: Go Rattlers.\n  Today the university has grown to enroll nearly 10,000 students, and \nit was named by the U.S. News & World Report as the top public \nHistorically Black College and Universities in the entire Nation for \n2015.\n  It is also listed among The Princeton Review's Best in the Southeast \nColleges and is one of the top picks for providing a high-quality \neducation at an affordable price in Florida, according to The College \nDatabase. And FAMU is the Nation's top producer of African Americans at \nthe bachelor degree level.\n  It is such an honor for me to represent FAMU and to join the HBCU \ncaucus in supporting all of our Nation's Historically Black Colleges \nand Universities and the wonderful students who attend them.\n  Again, I thank Congressman Byrne and Congresswoman Adams for hosting \nthis Special Order.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Florida for her \nleadership on this issue and so many issues. It is so important that we \nhave the understanding, each of us, of the institutions in our own \ndistrict. She talked about Florida A, a great institution of higher \neducation in her district.\n  Part of what we hope to do in the caucus is to educate every Member \nin\n\n[[Page H2104]]\n\nthis body about the institutions in their districts and--perhaps they \ndon't have any institutions in their district--about institutions \nacross America that are HBCUs and what they have done for their \ncommunities and what they have done for the United States of America \nand continue to do every day.\n  I am very blessed to have been able to work with a number of HBCUs in \nAlabama in my prior positions in the State school board and as a \nchancellor of post-secondary education. I must admit I didn't know very \nmuch about them before I was in those positions.\n  But as I learned about them, as I got to know the administration and \nthe faculty, but, most importantly, the students at those institutions, \nI realized what a rich resource that is for those students and for the \ncommunities that they are founded in.\n  You look around the country at some of the great graduates of these \ninstitutions and you realize where would we have been without the \nHBCUs, particularly during a period of time when African Americans were \ndenied access to regular institutions of higher education because of \ndiscrimination in American society.\n\n  Just because we have made progress in that regard doesn't mean that \nwe have ended the need for HBCUs. In many ways, the need has never been \ngreater, because what we need in our society from the people in our \nsociety--in order to perform at the levels that our economy requires, \nit requires ever greater levels of education, training, and expertise. \nWhat might have been enough to know 50 years ago, we need to know far \nmore now and we need to know it at every level of education.\n  We are here today to talk about colleges and universities. Some of \nthe great colleges and universities in America have understood the \nimportance of this and have rallied around our cause. I will never \nforget our kickoff day when we had the chancellor of the University of \nNorth Carolina system here, one of the great university statewide \nsystems that we have in this country, as a recognition of those \nuniversities and the role that HBCUs play along with them in providing \nhigher education to people throughout the United States of America.\n  The United Negro College Fund says that a mind is a terrible thing to \nwaste. A great country cannot waste any mind. We need every mind in \nAmerica to get whatever they need to become the person that they want \nto become, to realize their dreams, as I said earlier, not only to lift \nthemselves up, but to lift the rest of us up with them. That is what we \nare talking about when we talk about HBCUs.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina again for her leadership, \nfor her inspiration, for her continuing to be somebody out there to \ntell us that we need to keep pushing, we need to keep pushing. As long \nas she is willing to continue to do that, I am willing to continue to \ndo that with her.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "28"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/28/house-section/article/H2104-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2104-H2106]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   THE DISPARATE IMPLEMENTATION OF AMAZON.COM'S PRIME FREE SAME-DAY \n                                DELIVERY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nRush) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because, despite our best \nefforts, racial redlining is still alive and well today. I come to this \nChamber because racial redlining has once again reared its ugly, evil \nhead across our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, on April 21, Bloomberg published an analysis entitled \n``Amazon Doesn't Consider the Race of Its Customers. Should It?''\n  Bloomberg explains how amazon.com discriminates against mostly \nAfrican American communities nationwide by shutting them out, shutting \nthem off from receiving its Prime free same-day delivery service.\n  Mr. Speaker, it must be understood that mostly predominantly African \nAmerican ZIP Codes in this Nation have been excluded from receiving \nAmazon's Prime free same-day delivery service. It must be understood, \nMr. Speaker, that this is absolutely unacceptable.\n  Amazon's vice president for global communications, Mr. Craig Berman, \nfeebly attempted to justify this by saying that ``demographics play no \nrole'' in the determination by which neighborhoods have access to Prime \nfree same-day service.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  He goes on to state that distance matters and that in terms of \ndetermining factors, close proximity to a warehouse is certainly one of \nthe factors that they consider.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, on the face of it, that seemingly appears to be \nboth logical and understandable. However, when viewed through a sharper \nlens, there are some glaring, flagrant inconsistencies.\n  In my hometown of Chicago, Illinois, just for example, same-day \nservice is available to a majority of the city and its surrounding \nsuburbs. This free, same-day delivery service is not available to my \nconstituents in predominantly African American ZIP Codes.\n  Mr. Berman, the article explains, again, feebly blames this on the \ndistance of these ZIP Codes from a distribution center that is located \nin Kenosha, Wisconsin. That would be understandable if not for the fact \nthat this free, same-day Amazon delivery service is available to \nresidents in Oak Lawn, Illinois, which is a community that is also in \nthe district that I represent, but Oak Lawn is even farther south, \nfarther away from Kenosha, Wisconsin, a greater distance from the \ndistribution center in Kenosha, Wisconsin, than all these African \nAmerican-predominant ZIP Codes.\n  Mr. Speaker, because I live in a predominantly African American ZIP \nCode, I cannot be served by the Amazon Prime free, same-day delivery \nservice, but my White constituents can be served by Amazon with their \nPrime free, same-day delivery service.\n  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, despite amazon.com's assertions of \nimpartiality and a strictly numbers-based approach to the availability \nof this Prime free, same-day delivery services, Amazon's implementation \nof this service has been disparate, disappointing, disgusting, and \napparently discriminatory.\n  Mr. Speaker, not only does this occur in the city of Chicago, but \nalso Bloomberg found similar situations existing in five other cities. \nNot just Chicago, but Atlanta, Boston, Dallas, New York City, and \nWashington, D.C., all across our great Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, historically and unfortunately, the situation with \namazon.com is not a unique experience for people of color. Today, in \nthe year 2016, too many Americans still are denied services and access \nto goods based off the color of their skin and where they reside or the \nlocation of their ZIP Code. This is redlining. This practice is known \nas redlining. This redlining has been a major, significant obstacle to \ncommunities of color to gain access to the fullness of their American \nDream, to the fullness of their American ideal.\n  For decades now, despite efforts during the civil rights era of our \nNation, during similar efforts, not only before, but even after the \ncivil rights era of our Nation, despite many multiple legislative \nattempts to stamp redlining out, this very injustice continues to \nspread, even among some of my corporate citizens who, on the face of \nit, would never accept the fact that they engage in discriminatory \nbusiness practices.\n  But when you look at it from my perspective, look at it from my \nvantage point, look at it from the experience of my constituents who \nare African American, Amazon fails to meet the acid test. Its Prime \nsame-day delivery service is far less than prime for too many of my \nconstituents and too many American citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, Members of this body of the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives, we cannot allow businesses in this country to \ndiscriminate against any particular group of Americans. We cannot allow \nbusinesses in this country to discriminate against neighborhoods, \nagainst communities based on their business's race-based perceptions.\n  Mr. Speaker, this body, this U.S. House of Representatives cannot \nallow the Amazons of the world, amazon.com to violate laws of our \nNation, laws like the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Amazon cannot violate \nthe laws of our Nation with impunity and without accountability.\n  Mr. Speaker, I must call upon amazon.com and its CEO, Jeff Bezos, to \ncome and do what is right, to come and\n\n[[Page H2105]]\n\nright this wrong. Make Amazon's Prime same-day delivery service a prime \nservice that is available to all the citizens of this Nation and not \njust to the White citizens of this Nation.\n  People all across this Nation like amazon.com. I am a customer of \namazon.com, and amazon.com benefits from Black Americans' dollars \nbecause Black Americans' dollars are just as green as any other \nAmericans' dollars. White Americans' dollars are not more powerful, \naren't colder or hotter. These are Americans' dollars, greenbacks, and \nAmazon must respect the buying power, the consumer right of African \nAmerican consumers just as it does all other American consumers.\n  Mr. Bezos, again, I appeal to you, do what is right and right this \nwrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, I must call upon our colleagues in the executive branch \nto ensure that the laws of our Nation passed by this U.S. Congress are \nfaithfully and equally executed so that communities of color get equal \nand fair treatment by its corporate citizens all across this country.\n  Redlining is an evil that has ripped apart the dreams and the \naspirations of African American citizens and other minorities.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  It is high time now. The hour has passed. It is time now to put \nredlining and all the vestiges of it aside, buried deep. Take it out of \nthe consciousness of the corporate decisionmakers in this Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, our economy is a service economy. Our economics are \nbased on service. Our social contract means that all Americans should \nhave access and a level playing field when it comes to getting service \nand being serviced in this service economy.\n  Now, amazon.com's Prime same-day delivery service stands as a stark \nexample of how much still needs to be changed in our society. No matter \nhow much things change, so much remains the same. Let us rise up to the \ncall. Amazon, do what is right, and right this wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do no less than our best for all American \ncitizens. This is an extraordinary violation of not only the civil \nrights laws of our Nation, but it stands as a significant barrier to \ngreater economic opportunities, to a greater sense of being treated \nequally and fairly. There is something called justice in our society, \nand any injustice must be courageously confronted. Any injustice.\n  Amazon.com, your Prime same-day delivery service is not so prime \nuntil all your customers are treated fairly and equitably in your \nbusiness model. No excuses.\n  This is shameful. It must be corrected. Make the Amazon Prime same-\nday delivery service available for all Americans because we live in a \nsociety where being prime really should mean something--this America \nthat we live in.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I call upon Mr. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's CEO, to do \nwhat is right and right this less than prime wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the article: ``Amazon Doesn't \nConsider the Race of Its Customers. Should It?''\n\n                [From www.bloomberg.com, Apr. 21, 2016]\n\n     Amazon Doesn't Consider the Race of Its Customers. Should It?\n\n                  (By David Ingold and Spencer Soper)\n\n       For residents of minority urban neighborhoods, access to \n     Amazon.com's vast array of products--from Dawn dish soap and \n     Huggies diapers to Samsung flatscreen TVs--can be a godsend. \n     Unlike whiter ZIP codes, these parts of town often lack well-\n     stocked stores and quality supermarkets. White areas get \n     organic grocers and designer boutiques. Black ones get \n     minimarts and dollar stores. People in neighborhoods that \n     retailers avoid must travel farther and sometimes pay more to \n     obtain household necessities. ``I don't have a car, so I love \n     to have stuff delivered,'' says Tamara Rasberry, a human \n     resources professional in Washington, D.C., who spends about \n     $2,000 a year on Amazon Prime, the online retailer's premium \n     service that guarantees two-day delivery of tens of millions \n     of items (along with digital music, e-books, streaming \n     movies, and TV shows) for a yearly $99 membership fee. \n     Rasberry, whose neighborhood of Congress Heights is more than \n     90 percent black, says shopping on Amazon lets her bypass the \n     poor selection and high prices of nearby shops.\n       As Amazon has expanded rapidly to become ``the everything \n     store,'' it's offered the promise of an egalitarian shopping \n     experience. On Amazon and other online retailers, a black \n     customer isn't viewed with suspicion, much less followed \n     around by store security. Most of Amazon's services are \n     available to almost every address in the U.S. ``We don't know \n     what you look like when you come into our store, which is \n     vastly different than physical retail,'' says Craig Berman, \n     Amazon's vice president for global communications. ``We are \n     ridiculously prideful about that. We offer every customer the \n     same price. It doesn't matter where you live.''\n       Yet as Amazon rolls out its upgrade to the Prime service, \n     Prime Free Same-Day Delivery, that promise is proving harder \n     to deliver on. The ambitious goal of Prime Free Same-Day is \n     to eliminate one of the last advantages local retailers have \n     over the e-commerce giant: instant gratification. In cities \n     where the service is available, Amazon offers Prime members \n     same-day delivery of more than a million products for no \n     extra fee on orders over $35. Eleven months after it started, \n     the service includes 27 metropolitan areas. In most of them, \n     it provides broad coverage within the city limits. Take \n     Amazon's home town of Seattle, where every ZIP code within \n     the city limits is eligible for same-day delivery and \n     coverage extends well into the surrounding suburbs.\n       In six major same-day delivery cities, however, the service \n     area excludes predominantly black ZIP codes to varying \n     degrees, according to a Bloomberg analysis that compared \n     Amazon same-day delivery areas with U.S. Census Bureau data.\n       In Atlanta, Chicago, Dallas, and Washington, cities still \n     struggling to overcome generations of racial segregation and \n     economic inequality, black citizens are about half as likely \n     to live in neighborhoods with access to Amazon same-day \n     delivery as white residents.\n       The disparity in two other big cities is significant, too. \n     In New York City, same-day delivery is available throughout \n     Manhattan, Staten Island, and Brooklyn, but not in the Bronx \n     and some majority-black neighborhoods in Queens. In some \n     cities, Amazon same-day delivery extends many miles into the \n     surrounding suburbs but isn't available in some ZIP codes \n     within the city limits.\n       The most striking gap in Amazon's same-day service is in \n     Boston, where three ZIP codes encompassing the primarily \n     black neighborhood of Roxbury are excluded from same-day \n     service, while the neighborhoods that surround it on all \n     sides are eligible. ``Being singled out like that and not \n     getting those same services as they do in a 15-minute walk \n     from here is very frustrating,'' says Roxbury resident JD \n     Nelson, who's been an Amazon Prime member for three years. \n     ``It's not a good thing, and it definitely doesn't make me \n     happy.'' Rasberry was excited when Amazon announced Prime \n     Free Same-Day was coming to Washington. But when she entered \n     her ZIP code on the retailer's website, she was disappointed \n     to find her neighborhood was left out. ``I still get two-day \n     shipping, but none of the superfast, convenient delivery \n     services come here,'' she says. Rasberry pays the same $99 \n     Prime membership fee as people who live in the city's \n     majority-white neighborhoods, but she doesn't get the same \n     benefits. ``If you bring that service to the city,'' she \n     says, ``you should offer it to the whole city.''\n       There's no evidence that Amazon makes decisions on where to \n     deliver based on race. Berman says the ethnic composition of \n     neighborhoods isn't part of the data Amazon examines when \n     drawing up its maps. ``When it comes to same-day delivery, \n     our goal is to serve as many people as we can, which we've \n     proven in places like Los Angeles, Seattle, San Francisco, \n     and Philadelphia.'' Amazon, he says, has a ``radical \n     sensitivity'' to any suggestion that neighborhoods are being \n     singled out by race. ``Demographics play no role in it. \n     Zero.''\n       Amazon says its plan is to focus its same-day service on \n     ZIP codes where there's a high concentration of Prime \n     members, and then expand the offering to fill in the gaps \n     over time. ``If you ever look at a map of service for Amazon, \n     it will start out small and end up getting big,'' he says.\n       This is a logical approach from a cost and efficiency \n     perspective: Give areas with the most existing paying members \n     priority access to a new product. Yet in cities where most of \n     those paying members are concentrated in predominantly white \n     parts of town, a solely data-driven calculation that looks at \n     numbers instead of people can reinforce long-entrenched \n     inequality in access to retail services. For people who live \n     in black neighborhoods not served by Amazon, the fact that \n     it's not deliberate doesn't make much practical difference. \n     ``They are offering different services to other people who \n     don't look like you but live in the same city,'' says \n     Rasberry.\n       Amazon cites several reasons a ZIP code within a city may \n     be excluded: too few Prime members to justify the expense of \n     sending out trucks and drivers, or the area is too far from \n     the closest Amazon warehouse. ``Distance matters,'' Berman \n     says. ``At some point, with the math involved, we can't make \n     it work--in time or in cost for the carrier. There is a \n     diminishing return on orders.'' In some cases, Amazon says, \n     it's difficult to find delivery partners willing to serve the \n     area. ``We deliver same day up till 9 p.m.'' says Amazon \n     spokesman Scott Stanzel. ``There are a lot of carrier \n     partners. A lot of variables.''\n       Amazon won't reveal specifics about how it decides its \n     same-day delivery areas--the competition would kill for that \n     info, says Berman. Broadly speaking, it comes down to cost. \n     Same-day delivery is expensive to provide, in part because \n     Amazon can't rely on\n\n[[Page H2106]]\n\n     the built-in infrastructure and low negotiated rates of \n     United Parcel Service and the U.S. Postal Service, which \n     shoulder the retailer's standard and two-day Prime \n     deliveries. To get packages out within hours, Amazon uses a \n     mix of its own drivers, local couriers, and independent \n     contractors making deliveries in their own vehicles through \n     an Uberlike service called Amazon Flex.\n       Cities where Amazon offers broad one-day coverage appear to \n     have something in common: close proximity to product \n     warehouses, making it less expensive to reach all areas. \n     ``It's not the only variable. It's certainly one of them,'' \n     says Berman. ``It definitely has an impact if we have a \n     fulfillment center that's outside a city, or we have a \n     fulfillment center that happens to be on one side of it'' \n     Amazon declined to reveal the locations of its same-day hubs, \n     so it's difficult to tell how that works. In same-day cities \n     Amazon hasn't yet surrounded with warehouses, the company \n     must decide which neighborhoods are worth the cost of service \n     and which aren't. That's where things get complicated.\n\n\n                                atlanta\n\n       Amazon's Prime Free Same-Day Delivery closely mirrors the \n     city's historical racial divide. The largely white northern \n     half is covered, while the largely black southern half isn't. \n     The company extends the service 35 miles north of downtown \n     but excludes Norcross, a less distant eastern suburb where \n     blacks and Hispanics outnumber whites, and Redan, with a \n     black population of 94 percent.\n\n\n                                 boston\n\n       Although Amazon's same-day service is available to most \n     addresses in Boston and reaches almost to New Hampshire, the \n     centrally located neighborhood of Roxbury, with a population \n     that's about 59 percent black and 15 percent white, is \n     excluded. The residents of the ZIP codes that border Roxbury \n     on all sides are eligible for the service. Amazon's Berman \n     calls Roxbury ``an anomaly.''\n\n\n                                chicago\n\n       Amazon's same-day service area includes about 2.2 million \n     people in the city but excludes about 472,000 people in \n     Chicago's predominantly black South Side. Berman says the \n     South Side ZIP codes are beyond the reach of the company's \n     distribution center in Kenosha, Wisconsin, about two hours \n     north of the city. Yet same-day service is available to Prime \n     members in Oak Lawn, which is eight miles farther south than \n     the excluded portions of Chicago and has a white population \n     of about 85 percent. The company does offer the service in \n     largely black neighborhoods in the city's center, including \n     Austin.\n\n\n                                 dallas\n\n       Amazon's same-day service area includes suburbs between \n     Dallas and Fort Worth, but about 590,000 residents of eastern \n     and southern Dallas, where a majority are black or Hispanic--\n     such as Oak Cliff--are just outside the delivery area. Amazon \n     cited distance from the company's warehouses and a low \n     concentration of Prime members as reasons those areas were \n     left out.\n\n\n                             new york city\n\n       Amazon's same-day coverage area extends, unbroken, from New \n     York City all the way south to Philadelphia, with one notable \n     exception: The largely black and Hispanic borough of the \n     Bronx, which is excluded from the service. The Bronx has the \n     lowest percentage of white residents of the five boroughs at \n     about 33 percent. Berman says the Bronx is difficult to reach \n     because the warehouses that serve the area are in New Jersey.\n\n\n                            washington, d.c.\n\n       One of Amazon's largest same-day service coverage areas \n     extends from Washington, D.C., north to Baltimore and \n     encompasses much of the Maryland and Virginia suburbs. Yet \n     all neighborhoods in the capital's predominantly black \n     southeast quadrant are excluded, along with several largely \n     black Maryland suburbs to the southeast--notably Suitland and \n     Silver Hill, which have average income levels comparable to \n     those in some ZIP codes between Washington and Baltimore that \n     do have same-day coverage.\n       Some excluded ZIP codes correspond with higher crime rates. \n     Amazon won't say whether concerns about stolen packages or \n     the safety of drivers figure into its decisions about where \n     to deliver, saying only ``the safety of our employees is a \n     top priority.''\n       Income inequality may also play a part. Many excluded areas \n     have average household incomes below the national average. \n     And households with Prime memberships skew wealthier--not \n     surprising given the $99 membership fee. An April study of \n     families with teenagers by investment bank Piper Jaffray \n     estimates 70 percent of such U.S. households with incomes of \n     $112,000 per year or more now have a Prime membership, \n     compared with 43 percent for households with incomes of \n     $21,000 to $41,000. Income differences alone don't explain \n     the gaps in service, however. In Chicago, New York, Boston, \n     Atlanta, and other cities, some areas that are excluded have \n     household incomes as high or higher than ZIP codes Amazon \n     does cover.\n       Berman points to cities where some black ZIP codes get \n     same-day service and some white ones don't. In Los Angeles, \n     black and Hispanic communities south of downtown have same-\n     day service, but mostly white Malibu, on the far side of the \n     traffic-clogged Route 27 and Pacific Coast Highway, doesn't. \n     In several cities where the same-day service area encompasses \n     the vast majority of all residents, including Los Angeles, \n     San Jose, and Tampa, a higher percentage of blacks live in \n     ZIP codes eligible for same-day delivery than whites. \n     Overall, though, in cities where same-day service doesn't \n     extend to most residents, those left out are \n     disproportionately black. (In the six cities with \n     disparities, Asians, on average, are as likely as whites to \n     live in an area with coverage; Hispanics are less likely than \n     whites to live in same-day ZIP codes, but more likely than \n     blacks.)\n       ``As soon as you try to represent something as complex as a \n     neighborhood with a spreadsheet based on a few variables, \n     you've made some generalizations and assumptions that may not \n     be true, and they may not affect all people equally,'' says \n     Sorelle Friedler, a computer science professor at Haverford \n     College who studies data bias. ``There is so much systemic \n     bias with respect to race. If you aren't purposefully trying \n     to identify it and correct it, this bias is likely to creep \n     into your outcomes.''\n       Amazon says it's misleading to scrutinize its current \n     delivery areas so closely, because the service is new and \n     evolving. Eventually, coverage will extend to every ZIP code \n     in same-day cities, says Berman. The service is indeed \n     expanding. Since Bloomberg first contacted Amazon for this \n     article in February, the company announced 12 new same-day \n     cities. As it adds locations, however, Amazon has yet to \n     extend coverage to excluded majority-black ZIP codes in the \n     existing cities with gaps in service. How long will those \n     customers have to wait to get the full benefits of their \n     Prime membership? Berman says there's no set timetable: \n     ``We'll get there.''\n       Juan Gilbert, chair of the University of Florida's \n     department of computer and information science & engineering, \n     says Amazon has an opportunity to use its data resources to \n     correct its oversight and avert falling into the retail \n     patterns of the past. ``I think it was a mistake, and it \n     never crossed their mind,'' he says. ``This is a perfect \n     example of how Amazon had a blind spot.''\n       Update, April 21: Corrects the number of New York City \n     residents who live in ZIP codes eligible for Amazon same-day \n     delivery; updates the article and final chart to indicate \n     cities where black residents are more likely than whites to \n     live in zip codes eligible for same day service.\n\n\n                              methodology\n\n       Amazon's website allows users to type in ZIP codes to see \n     where Prime Free Same-Day Delivery is available. Bloomberg \n     entered every U.S. ZIP code into the tool, and mapped the \n     results on top of a complete U.S. ZIP code shape file, \n     provided by ESRI, to produce a coverage map of Amazon's Prime \n     same-day delivery areas. Coverage maps show Amazon data as of \n     April 8, 2016.\n       Population data were compiled using block group figures \n     from the 2014 American Community Survey 5-Year estimates \n     tables. Table B03002--Hispanic or Latino Origin by Race--\n     provides population figures by racial category, including the \n     following subsets: white alone, black or African-American \n     alone, Hispanic or Latino, Asian alone, and other races. The \n     data were released on Dec. 3, 2015 and are the most recent \n     local population data available from the ACS. All ACS figures \n     are estimates with a 90% confidence interval and are subject \n     to a margin of error. City-level figures presented in the \n     graphics and charts are compilations of individual block \n     group estimates, and share the same 90% confidence level.\n       Each population dot represent 100 residents, and are evenly \n     distributed across each block group. They do not represent \n     exact addresses, and populations below a 100-person threshold \n     within an individual block group are not shown.\n       In some cases, individual block groups straddle multiple \n     ZIP codes or intersect a city boundary. Often these block \n     groups feature clear divisions between residential areas, and \n     nonresidential areas made up of parks, lakes, or empty land. \n     In these cases, a block group was included in the ZIP code \n     that included the residential area. When a block group was \n     not clearly separated in this manner, the population was \n     proportionally distributed based on the area of overlap.\n\n  Mr. RUSH.
