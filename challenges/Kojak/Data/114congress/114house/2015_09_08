Mr. Speaker, Friday, in the blistering heat of \nHouston, Texas, 11,000 people, including the Governor, attended the \nevent; many more stood outside. The ceremony was broadcast live on all \nfour local TV stations. Helicopters flew overhead. Peace officers from \nthe United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom were there. The city \nand State gave their final tribute and respect for one of its fallen--\nHarris County Deputy Sheriff Darren Goforth.\n  Darren left behind a widow, Kathleen, and children: Ava, 12, and \nRyan, 5.\n  Darren was assassinated the week before while he was putting gasoline \nin his patrol car, apparently targeted because he was a peace officer. \nHe was shot in the back of the head 15 times. An individual was quickly \ncaptured, and he is charged with capital murder.\n  Darren Goforth was a happy guy. He loved his family. He loved his \nsecond career as a lawman and loved working on old cars.\n  Everyone liked Darren. Even a local thief posted on social media that \nGoforth was his favorite police officer.\n  Darren loved his kids and recently bought his son and himself Captain \nAmerica t-shirts. Ryan, his son, wore his t-shirt at the funeral. \nDeputy Goforth was buried in his Captain America t-shirt underneath his \nuniform.\n  Peace officers like Goforth are a rare breed. They rush to \nemergencies and dangers while most flee from them. Their life is \ndedicated to serving and protecting others. They are willing to \nsacrifice everything for the rest of us. Darren Goforth was that type \nof peace officer.\n  Mr. Speaker, when the funeral was over and the bagpipers had played \n``Amazing Grace'' and the buglers had played ``Taps,'' it started to \nrain, as if the angels above were shedding tears for a remarkable guy, \nDeputy Sheriff Darren Goforth.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5790-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       AMERICA'S 122ND LABOR DAY\n\n  (Mr. GALLEGO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. GALLEGO. Mr. Speaker, Monday marked the 122nd year that we have \nhonored and celebrated the hard-working men and women of America on \nLabor Day.\n  It is also an occasion to reflect on the tremendous progress that the \nlabor movement has made in improving the lives of working families.\n  From strengthening pay and working conditions to fighting for fair \nhealth care and retirement benefits, unions have and will always play a \ncritical role in growing the American middle class.\n  However, we still have a long way to go. That is why I support \nraising the minimum wage, expanding the earned income tax credit, and \nfighting for fair trade agreements so that we can lift up the millions \nof working families in America still struggling to make ends meet.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is simple. Those willing to work should be able to \nfind good jobs. Through their hard work, they should be able to improve \ntheir family's quality of life. That is the core of the American Dream.\n  This Labor Day, let's recommit ourselves to building a nation and an \neconomy where that dream is within reach for every American.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5790-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5790]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             GOLD KING MINE\n\n  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, early last month the negligence of the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency caused the release of over 3 million \ngallons of wastewater at the Gold King Mine near Silverton, Colorado, \ncausing arguably the biggest environmental disaster of this year.\n  While over the congressional August work period, I was able to visit \nthe spill site and, with elected officials, was able to view it for \nmyself. As you can see, there is still considerable effluent coming out \nof the mouth of that mine as of 2 weeks ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will just ask: Has anyone been fired? Has anyone been \nheld accountable at the Environmental Protection Agency for this \ndisaster? No, they have not.\n  What would have happened had a private company been responsible for a \ndisaster of this order of magnitude? I shudder to think where those \npeople in charge of that company would be today.\n  The EPA did not follow its own procedures. It did not have proper \ncommunications equipment at the site of the disaster. They had no \nsatellite phone. They had no radio.\n  As a consequence, they did not notify local officials until a day \nlater of what had occurred at the mine. They have also refused to \nanswer questions about the potential health risks in the polluted water \nto humans and animals downriver.\n  The long-term effects of the EPA's neglect will be unknown, but I \nsubmit they will be significant for years to come.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5790-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5790-H5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            FRANCIS BELLAMY\n\n  (Mr. COLLINS of New York asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. COLLINS of New York. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate \nFrancis Bellamy, one of the most influential individuals from Mount \nMorris, New York. Francis Bellamy is the author of the Pledge of \nAllegiance.\n  Today marks the 123rd anniversary of the Pledge of Allegiance, which \nwas first published in a magazine called ``The Youth Companion'' on \nSeptember 8, 1892. The Pledge was initially written as part of a \ncampaign to put American flags in every school in the country.\n  In its original form, it read: ``I pledge allegiance to my Flag and \nthe Republic for which it stands, one Nation, indivisible, with liberty \nand justice for all.''\n  In 1923, the words, ``the Flag of the United States of America'' were \nadded. In 1954, Congress added the words ``under God,'' creating the \n31-word pledge we say every day.\n\n[[Page H5791]]\n\n  Bellamy's words are recited millions of times every day and are \ningrained in our society as an expression of national pride and \npatriotism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5791-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRESSIONAL LAND CONSERVATION CAUCUS\n\n  (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, the summer months provided \nus with an excellent opportunity to get outside and take advantage of \nthe natural resources, great parks, and public lands in our \ncommunities.\n  In southeastern Pennsylvania, we are fortunate that we do not have to \ngo much further than our own backyard to enjoy a wide variety of \nlandscapes and public lands.\n  In an effort to prioritize the conservation of our public lands, \nwaterways, natural resources, and public policies related to the same, \nI recently established the bipartisan Congressional Land Conservation \nCaucus with Representatives Joe Pitts, Earl Blumenauer, and Mike \nThompson of California. I appreciate their willingness to support this \neffort, and I urge my colleagues to join our caucus.\n  It is my hope this group of Members will focus on issues related to \nland conservation, the protection of natural resources, and the \npreservation of open space across the country.\n  I also want to thank Michael Rellahan and the Daily Local News for \ntheir in-depth observations on the past, present, and future of the \nChester County government-led efforts to protect open space. It has \nbeen a remarkably successful program over the past 30 years.\n  And, indeed, another county in my district, Montgomery County, has \nfollowed in their lead, as have many other counties in Pennsylvania and \nacross the country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5791-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5791]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n                          OPPOSE THE IRAN DEAL\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

It gives Iran weeks, if not \nmonths, of advance notice of any weapons site inspections.\n  It includes secret side agreements; one prohibits other countries \nfrom inspecting a possible nuclear weapons development site.\n  It is being implemented even though a majority in the House and the \nSenate oppose it.\n  The Iran deal destabilizes the Middle East, jeopardizes America's \nsecurity, and endangers the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5791-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5791-H5794]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   NOTICE OF INTENTION TO OFFER RESOLUTION RAISING A QUESTION OF THE \n                        PRIVILEGES OF THE HOUSE\n\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, pursuant to clause 2(a)(1) of rule IX, I \nrise to give notice of my intention to raise a question of the \nprivileges of the House.\n  The form of the resolution is as follows:\n  Whereas Rule IX of the Rules of the House of Representatives states \nthat a question of the privileges of the House ``shall be, first, those \naffecting the rights of the House collectively, its safety, dignity, \nand the integrity of its proceedings; and second, those affecting the \nrights, reputation, and conduct of Members, Delegates, or the Resident \nCommissioner, individually, in their representative capacity only'';\n  Whereas the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (in this \npreamble referred to as the ``Review Act'') was passed by the Senate on \nMay 7, 2015, by a vote of 98-1;\n  Whereas the House of Representatives passed the Review Act on May 14, \n2015, by a vote of 400-25;\n  Whereas the Review Act was signed by President Barack Obama on May \n22, 2015, becoming Public Law No. 114-17;\n  Whereas section 135(a)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as \nenacted by section 2 of the Review Act) states, ``Not later than 5 \ncalendar days after reaching an agreement with Iran relating to the \nnuclear program of Iran, the President shall transmit to the \nappropriate congressional committees and leadership--(A) the agreement, \nas defined in subsection (h)(1), including all related materials and \nannexes'';\n  Whereas section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as \nenacted by section 2 of the Review Act) states, ``The term `agreement' \nmeans an agreement related to the nuclear program of Iran that includes \nthe United States, commits the United States to take action, or \npursuant to which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to take \naction, regardless of the form it takes, whether a political commitment \nor otherwise, and regardless of whether it is legally binding or not, \nincluding any joint comprehensive plan of action entered into or made \nbetween Iran and any other parties, and any additional materials \nrelated thereto, including annexes, appendices, codicils, side \nagreements, implementing materials, documents, and guidance, technical \nor other understandings, and any related agreements, whether entered \ninto or implemented prior to the agreement or to be entered into or \nimplemented in the future'';\n  Whereas on July 14, 2015, the Director General of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency (in this preamble referred to as the ``IAEA'') and \nthe President of the Atomic Energy Organization of Iran signed the \n``Roadmap for the Clarification of Past and Present Outstanding Issues \nregarding Iran's Nuclear Program'', which refers to two ``separate \narrangements'' between the IAEA and Iran;\n  Whereas the first of these separate arrangements seeks to clarify and \nresolve longstanding questions about the possible military dimensions \nof Iran's nuclear program, including those identified in the IAEA \nDirector General's report to the Board of Governors, designated ``GOV/\n2011/65'';\n  Whereas section G(38) of that report states, ``Since 2002, the [IAEA] \nhas become increasingly concerned about the possible existence in Iran \nof undisclosed nuclear related activities involving military related \norganizations, including activities related to the development of a \nnuclear payload for a missile, about which the [IAEA] has regularly \nreceived new information'';\n  Whereas the Roadmap describes the second of these separate \narrangements as an effort to resolve outstanding issues regarding the \nmilitary facility at Parchin;\n  Whereas in his November 29, 2012, report to the Board of Governors, \nthe Director General of the IAEA stated, ``As you will recall, the \n[IAEA] has information indicating that Iran constructed a large \nexplosives containment vessel at the Parchin site in which to conduct \nhydrodynamic experiments. Despite repeated requests, Iran has still not \ngranted the [IAEA] access to the Parchin site. Satellite imagery shows \nthat extensive activities, including the removal and replacement of \nconsiderable quantities of earth, have taken place at this location. I \nam concerned that these activities will have seriously undermined the \n[IAEA's] ability to undertake effective verification. I reiterate my \nrequest that Iran, without further delay, provide access to that \nlocation and substantive answers to the [IAEA's] detailed questions \nregarding the Parchin site'';\n  Whereas an August 20, 2015, report by the Associated Press includes \ndraft text of the Parchin separate agreement, which details a process \nby which Iran will provide photographs, videos, soil samples, and other \nmaterials in lieu of giving the IAEA access to the Parchin site;\n  Whereas Dr. Olli Heinonen, a 27-year veteran of the IAEA and its \nformer Deputy Director General and chief inspector, stated, ``Much of \nthe current concerns arise from the reported arrangements worked out \nbetween the IAEA and Iran in the side documents to address PMD \n[possible military dimension] issues. If the reporting is accurate, \nthese procedures appear to be risky, departing significantly from well-\nestablished and proven safeguards practices. At a broader level, if \nverification standards have been diluted for Parchin (or elsewhere) and \nlimits imposed, the ramification is significant as it will affect the \nIAEA's\n\n[[Page H5792]]\n\nability to draw definitive conclusions with the requisite level of \nassurances and without undue hampering of the verification process'';\n  Whereas the self inspection and verification by Iran of its own \nnuclear weapons-related activities performed at the Parchin military \nfacility are inadequate and incapable of demonstrating Iran's \ncompliance with safeguards against nuclear weapons development, as \nestablished by the IAEA or the international nuclear agreement with \nIran;\n  Whereas on July 14, 2015, the P5+1 (the United States, the United \nKingdom, France, the People's Republic of China, the Russian \nFederation, and Germany) and Iran announced that the parties had agreed \nto a Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action;\n  Whereas section C(13) of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \nrequires Iran's parliament and president to implement the Additional \nProtocol to Iran's Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA;\n  Whereas section C(14) of the agreed Joint Comprehensive Plan of \nAction requires Iran to fully implement the ``Roadmap for Clarification \nof Past and Present Outstanding Issues regarding Iran's Nuclear \nProgram'', which was agreed to with the IAEA;\n  Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action is necessarily \npredicated on and interdependent with the two side agreements between \nthe IAEA and Iran, all of which are mutually reinforcing and \nindivisible;\n  Whereas State Department spokesman John Kirby issued a public \nstatement on July 19, 2015, stating that ``today the State Department \ntransmitted to Congress the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, its \nannexes, and related materials. These documents include the \nUnclassified Verification Assessment Report on the JCPOA and the \nIntelligence Community's Classified Annex to the Verification \nAssessment Report, as required under the law. Therefore, Day One of the \n60-day review period begins tomorrow, Monday, July 20'';\n  Whereas section 135(c)(1)(E) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as \nenacted by section 2 of the Review Act) states, ``it is critically \nimportant that Congress have the opportunity, in an orderly and \ndeliberative manner, to consider and, as appropriate, take action \naffecting the statutory sanctions regime imposed by Congress'', thereby \nproviding the right to the House collectively, and the Members of the \nHouse individually in their representative capacities, to review the \nIran nuclear agreement, as defined in section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic \nEnergy Act of 1954, in order to determine what action, if any, to take;\n  Whereas section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as \nenacted by section 2 of the Review Act) specifically requires the \nPresident to provide Congress with the text of ``side agreements'' and \n``related agreements'', including those agreements ``between Iran and \nany other parties'';\n  Whereas the State Department's transmission to Congress did not \ninclude the text or materials relating to the two side agreements \nbetween the IAEA and Iran and was therefore incomplete as a matter of \nlaw;\n  Whereas on July 21, 2015, Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman \nBob Corker and Ranking Member Ben Cardin sent a bipartisan letter to \nthe State Department requesting the actual text of the two separate \nagreements between the IAEA and Iran;\n  Whereas on July 22, 2015, Congressman Mike Pompeo and Senator Tom \nCotton, along with the Speaker of the House and the Majority Leader of \nthe Senate, sent a letter to the President requesting the text of the \ntwo separate agreements between the IAEA and Iran;\n  Whereas on August 4, 2015, Congressman Pompeo sent a further letter \nto the President, co-signed by the House Majority Leader and 92 other \nMembers of the House, requesting the President to provide the text of \nthe two separate agreements between the IAEA and Iran;\n  Whereas contrary to the law and these requests, the President did not \nprovide the text of the separate agreements to Congress or any of its \nMembers;\n  Whereas on July 22, 2015, State Department spokesman John Kirby \nstated, ``There's no side deals. There's no secret deals between Iran \nand the IAEA that the P5+1 has not been briefed on in detail'';\n  Whereas in an August 5, 2015, letter to Members of Congress, \nAssistant Secretary of State for Legislative Affairs Julia Frifield \ncontradicted this claim, saying, ``The Roadmap refers to two `separate \nagreements' between the IAEA and Iran. Within the IAEA system, such \narrangements related to safeguards procedures and inspection activities \nare confidential and are not released to other member states'';\n  Whereas on July 28, 2015, Secretary of State John Kerry told the \nHouse Foreign Affairs Committee, in responding to the statement that \nNational Security Advisor Susan Rice has seen the actual text of the \ntwo side agreements, ``I don't believe Susan Rice, National Security \nAdvisor, has seen it'';\n  Whereas responding further to whether he has seen the actual text, \nSecretary Kerry said, ``No, I haven't seen it, I've been briefed on \nit'';\n  Whereas on July 29, 2015, Secretary of Energy Ernest Moniz stated, \n``I, personally, have not seen those documents'';\n  Whereas on July 31, 2015, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest \nstated, ``Our negotiators were briefed on the contents of that \nagreement'' (a reference to the side agreements);\n  Whereas being briefed second- or third-hand, including by Obama \nAdministration officials who themselves have not read the actual text \nof the side agreements, is akin to a game of telephone and is not the \nsame thing as allowing Members of Congress to read the actual text of \nthe agreements;\n  Whereas the congressional review period prescribed in section 135(b) \nof Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as enacted by section 2 of the Review \nAct) to review the Iran nuclear agreement begins only ``if an \nagreement, including all materials required to be transmitted to \nCongress pursuant to subsection (a)(1)'' is transmitted by the \nPresident to the Congress for review;\n  Whereas on July 14, 2015, President Obama stated, ``This deal is not \nbuilt on trust. It is built on verification'' ;\n  Whereas it is impossible for the President, Congress, and the \nAmerican people to consider and determine whether to support or oppose \nan Iran nuclear agreement without reviewing key inspection and \nverification details contained in the text of the two side agreements \nbetween the IAEA and Iran;\n   Whereas the determination by the Parliamentarian of the House of \nRepresentatives, acting as an Officer of the House, that the President \nhas transmitted to Congress the agreement and related materials as \nrequired by law, and therefore to begin counting the elapsing of the \ncongressional review period beginning on July 20, 2015, deprives the \nHouse collectively and the Members of the House individually in their \nrepresentative capacities, of the right to the review the Iran nuclear \nagreement;\n  Whereas the Congressional Record for the legislative day of July 27, \n2015, is incorrect, listing under the heading ``Executive \nCommunications'' the following entry: ``A letter from the Assistant \nSecretary, Legislative Affairs, Department of State, transmitting a \nletter and attachments satisfying all requirements of Sec. 135(a) of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-17), as received July 19, 2015; jointly \nto the Committees on Foreign Affairs, Financial Services, the \nJudiciary, Oversight and Government Reform, and Ways and Means'';\n  Whereas the House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on a \nresolution of disapproval of the Iran nuclear agreement as soon as \nSeptember 9, 2015, a procedure provided for under section 135(e)(4) of \nthe of Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as enacted by section 2 of the Review \nAct);\n  Whereas such a vote is injurious to the integrity of the proceedings \nof the House as it violates the process provided under section 135 of \nthe Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as enacted by section 2 of the Review \nAct), which is contingent upon both the President's transmittal of the \nIran nuclear agreement and all related documents, including side \nagreements, and the observance of the congressional review period \nprovided in such section 135;\n  Whereas in her August 5, 2015, letter to Members of Congress, \nAssistant Secretary of State Frifield inaccurately\n\n[[Page H5793]]\n\nstated, ``The United States does not have a right to demand these [side \nagreement] documents from the IAEA'';\n  Whereas Dr. Heinonen, the former Deputy Director General and chief \ninspector of the IAEA stated, ``According to the IAEA rules and \npractices, such documents could be made available to the members of the \nIAEA Board'';\n  Whereas Dr. Heinonen further stated, ``The issue of confidentiality \nis an important matter for the IAEA. However, it should not be used as \na blanket to stop legitimate questions, particularly regarding \nverification methods at Parchin. Historically, the IAEA has not viewed \nsuch issues as confidential. The IAEA and its member states have \ndisclosed much more detailed facility-specific approaches at regular \nsafeguards symposia. Additionally, in 2007 the IAEA Iran Work Plan \naddressing outstanding issues, accumulated over several years, was made \navailable to all IAEA member states, and the Board also received a 2012 \ndocument from Iran related to very specific PMD [possible military \ndimensions] questions, which happened while the IAEA was negotiating \nwith Iran for greater clarity and access'';\n  Whereas part I, section 5 of IAEA Information Circular 153 provides \nthat ``specific information relating to such implementation [of \nmeasures to safeguard nuclear materials] in the State may be given to \nthe Board of Governors and to such Agency staff members as require such \nknowledge'';\n  Whereas Article VI of the Statute of the IAEA authorizes the Board of \nGovernors of the IAEA to direct the work of the IAEA, including in \nsafeguarding nuclear materials and ensuring the peaceful ends of a \nparticipating member state's nuclear program;\n  Whereas Rule 18 of the Rules of the Board of Governors of the IAEA, \nentitled ``Circulation of Documents of Particular Importance'', \nestablishes procedures by which member states of the IAEA Board of \nGovernors may access relevant documents related to their duties;\n  Whereas the United States serves on the Board of Governors of the \nIAEA and has both the need and the authority to access the actual text \nof the two side agreements between the IAEA and Iran;\n  Whereas on July 30, 2015, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest, \nspeaking on behalf of the President of the United States, stated, ``I \nwill acknowledge that I don't know exactly what the requirements are of \nthe Iran Review Act, so I'm not sure exactly what that means [Congress \nis] asking for'';\n  Whereas on April 6, 2015, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest \nstated, ``[W]e do believe that Congress should play their rightful role \nin terms of ultimately deciding whether or not the sanctions that \nCongress passed into law should be removed'';\n  Whereas on April 7, 2015, White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest \nfurther stated, ``[M]embers of Congress should consider the agreement \nand decide whether or not the President has achieved his stated \nobjective of preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, shutting \ndown every pathway they have and making them cooperate with the most \nintrusive set of inspections that have ever been imposed on a country's \nnuclear program'';\n  Whereas the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which was negotiated \nand agreed to by the Obama Administration, fails to accomplish those \nobjectives;\n  Whereas any recognition by the House of Representatives of the \ntransmittal by the President of an Iran nuclear agreement that does not \ninclude all of the materials required by law, including the text of the \n2 side agreements agreed to between the IAEA and Iran, violates the \nrights of the Members of the House individually in their representative \ncapacity, impeding their ability to make a fully informed decision on \nhow to vote on behalf of their constituents, as conceived and provided \nfor in the enactment of the Review Act;\n  Whereas Director of National Intelligence James Clapper has labeled \nIran the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism;\n  Whereas the Web site WhiteHouse.gov states that Iran currently has a \n2-3 month breakout time to build a nuclear bomb;\n  Whereas legislative action on an Iran nuclear agreement is one of the \nmost important issues that will ever come before the House, as it \ndirectly affects the safety and security of the Members of the House \nand their constituents;\n  Whereas the taking of legislative action without reasonable \nconsideration and knowledge damages the reputation and credibility of \nthe House collectively and its Members individually in their \nrepresentative capacities; and\n  Whereas the President's failure to follow a law that he signed is an \naffront to the dignity of the House and cannot be ignored: Now, \ntherefore, be it\n  Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n  (1) reaffirms its legal right to obtain all materials, including the \nfull text of all side agreements, comprising the Iran nuclear \nagreement, as defined in section 135(h)(1) of the Atomic Energy Act of \n1954, as enacted by section 2 of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act \nof 2015 (in this section referred to as the ``Review Act''), which was \nsigned into law by President Obama;\n  (2) directs the Parliamentarian of the House of Representatives not \nto recognize, for purposes of determining the dates of the \ncongressional review period prescribed in section 135(b) of Atomic \nEnergy Act of 1954 (as enacted by section 2 of the Review Act), any \nagreement and related documents submitted by the President that do not \ninclude the actual text of the two side agreements between the IAEA and \nIran;\n  (3) directs the Clerk of the House of Representatives and the \nOfficers of the House to correct Executive Communication numbered 2207, \nappearing on page 5522 in the Congressional Record of the legislative \nday of July 27, 2015, to state the following: ``A letter from the \nAssistant Secretary, Legislative Affairs, Department of State, \ntransmitting a letter and attachments which does not satisfy all \nrequirements of Sec. 135(a) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as \namended by the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (Pub. L. 114-\n17), as received July 19, 2015; jointly to the Committees on Foreign \nAffairs, Financial Services, the Judiciary, Oversight and Government \nReform, and Ways and Means'';\n  (4) instructs the Speaker of the House of Representatives to dispatch \nwithout delay a notification to the President, on behalf of the whole \nHouse, entitled ``Failure to Follow the Law'' and stating that--\n  (A) the President's transmittal of that agreement to the House is \nincomplete as a matter of law;\n  (B) consequently, the congressional review period provided in section \n135 of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 (as enacted by section 2 of the \nReview Act) has not begun; and\n  (C) pursuant to section 135(b)(3) of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954 \n(as so enacted), until the end of the congressional review period, \n``the President may not waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or \notherwise limit the application of statutory sanctions with respect to \nIran under any provision of law or refrain from applying any such \nsanctions pursuant to an agreement described in subsection (a)'';\n  (5) instructs the Speaker of the House of Representatives, on behalf \nof the whole House, to return the agreement and related materials \nprovided in the President's transmission of July 19, 2015, in order \nthat the President may provide a full and complete transmission of all \nmaterials required by law, including the text of side agreements; and\n  (6) instructs the Speaker to take such actions as may be necessary to \nprovide an appropriate remedy to ensure that the integrity of the \nlegislative process is protected and to report his actions and \nrecommendations to the House.\n\n                              {time}  1438\n\n  And, Mr. Speaker, if you didn't catch it, I am happy to repeat it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under rule IX, a resolution offered from the \nfloor by a Member other than the majority leader or the minority leader \nas a question of the privileges of the House has immediate precedence \nonly at a time designated by the Chair within 2 legislative days after \nthe resolution is properly noticed.\n  Pending that designation, the form of the resolution noticed by the \ngentleman from Illinois will appear in the Record at this point.\n\n[[Page H5794]]\n\n  The Chair will not at this point determine whether the resolution \nconstitutes a question of privilege.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am pleased that, today, the House is considering H.R. 1344, the \nEarly Hearing Detection and Intervention Act of 2015. This bipartisan \nbill sets a strong precedent for working together on the many big \nissues before Congress this month.\n  This bill, which I introduced along with Congresswoman Lois Capps, \nreauthorizes the program for the early detection, diagnosis, and \ntreatment of deaf and hard of hearing newborns, infants, and young \nchildren.\n  H.R. 1344 encourages hearing tests and intervention for newborn \nbabies. Through early detection, these children and their families can \nbe made aware of a child's hearing loss and given access to specialized \nearly intervention providers and programs in order to help children \nmeet their potential. This reauthorization increases the focus on loss \nto followup. So those children whose hearing loss is identified don't \njust stop with identification; they may go on to receive intervention, \ntreatment, or an introduction to deaf services.\n  This program has proven success. In 2000, only 40 percent of newborns \nwere screened for hearing loss. That number rose to just over 86 \npercent in 2011, and, today, the CDC reports that, roughly, 97 percent \nof all infant children are screened for hearing loss.\n  In closing, I want to thank my colleague, Congresswoman Capps, for \nher leadership over the years on this important bipartisan issue. I \nurge my colleagues to support H.R. 1344 so we can continue these vital \nservices for newborn babies and young children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1344, the Early Hearing Detection and \nIntervention Act. This important legislation is led by Representatives \nLois Capps and Brett Guthrie, both members of our committee.\n  Beginning in 2000, Congress took steps to facilitate the development \nof newborn and infant screening and intervention programs. This bill \nreauthorizes and makes further improvements to the Early Hearing \nDetection and Intervention Program, which supports detection and \ntreatment for hearing-impaired newborns and young children.\n  The early identification of a child's hearing loss increases the \nlikelihood that intervention and treatment services can successfully \nprevent or limit developmental delays. Research shows that it can \nsignificantly improve quality of life and education outcomes for \nchildren with hearing impairments. The vast majority of deaf children \nare born to parents who do not have impaired hearing and who, \ntherefore, may not be able to identify their children's conditions \nearly on. The outreach services provided for by the program \nreauthorized in this bill may help ensure\n\n[[Page H5796]]\n\nthat children and their parents receive appropriate screenings and \nfollowup.\n  I want to thank Representatives Capps and Guthrie for their \nleadership on this issue. I thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member \nPallone, and Chairman Pitts for their work to advance this important \nlegislation. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1344, the Early \nHearing Detection and Intervention Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Capps), my colleague and a cosponsor \nof the bill.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1344, the Early Hearing \nDetection and Intervention Act, which I was so pleased to coauthor with \nmy colleague from Kentucky, Congressman Brett Guthrie.\n  Hearing loss in newborns is considered an invisible disability. \nAlmost 3 out of every 1,000 children in the United States are born deaf \nor hard of hearing, and even more children lose their hearing later on \nduring childhood. When hearing loss is left undetected, it can impede \nspeech, language, and cognitive development; but we know that, when \nhearing loss is caught early, children have much better outcomes. In \nfact, early intervention can help children overcome hearing issues and \nget them ready to learn on par with their peers.\n  That is exactly what the Early Hearing Detection and Intervention Act \ndoes, pronounced ``Eddie.'' As it is commonly called, EHDI has helped \nfamilies in all 50 States and the District of Columbia identify \nchildren in need of care early when interventions are most effective.\n  By all accounts, this program has worked. Since the implementation of \nthe EHDI program 15 years ago, we have seen a tremendous increase in \nthe number of newborns who are being screened for hearing loss. Back in \n2000, when we first set up the EHDI program, only 44 percent of \nnewborns in the country were being screened for hearing loss. Now we \nare screening newborns at a rate of over 96 percent. This is a \nremarkable achievement, but our work is not done.\n  While it is important that all babies are screened for hearing loss, \nit is just as important that those babies who do not pass this \nscreening receive a diagnostic evaluation and be connected to early \nintervention programs. Unfortunately, according to the Centers for \nDisease Control, 36 percent of newborns who fail their initial hearing \nscreenings are not receiving appropriate followup care. This \nreauthorization effort will focus on those children, helping to bridge \nthe gap between screening and intervention.\n  My background is as a school nurse for over 20 years, and I have \nworked with so many students who were lagging behind their classmates \ndue to undiagnosed or untreated hearing loss.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mrs. CAPPS. These children did not need to suffer. We can and must \nhelp them succeed through stronger investments in followup and \ninterventions, such as sign language training, hearing aids, and \nspeech-language development. Early identification and intervention are \nboth keys to a child's well-being.\n  Our legislation would ensure that these programs are there for the \nchildren who need them. A vote for this bill is a vote to keep this \nprogram strong. I urge my colleagues to support our bipartisan bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I urge the support of this \nbill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I thank my friend from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps) so much for our working together to move this \nbipartisan bill forward. I thank our subcommittee ranking member, Mr. \nGreen, and our chairman, Chairman Pitts.\n  I was involved in this effort in Kentucky when I was in the State \nSenate. I have seen the difference that it makes, and I am glad to be \ninvolved in this on a national level. Knowing that 97 percent of our \nbabies are screened so they can get intervention and treatment very \nearly in their lives makes a big difference. I am proud to be a part of \nthis, and I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1344.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1344, the ``Early Hearing \nDetection and Intervention Act of 2015'' introduced by my colleagues \nRepresentatives Capps and Guthrie.\n  H.R. 1344, would reauthorize the Early Hearing Detection and \nIntervention Program. Prior to the creation of this program, less than \n50 percent of all newborns were regularly screened for hearing loss. \nI'm proud to say that thanks to this program about 97 percent of \nnewborns now receive a hearing screening. Through this program, \nchildren gain early access to interventions and treatments that are \ncritical in minimizing a hearing-impaired child's risk of developmental \ndelays, especially communication, social skills and cognition. H.R. \n1344 would ensure that we continue to support this valuable public \nhealth program that has a proven track record of success.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1344, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5796-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5796-H5798]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       NATIONAL ALL SCHEDULES PRESCRIPTION ELECTRONIC REPORTING \n                      REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1725, the National All Schedules \nPrescription Electronic Reporting Reauthorization Act of 2015, \nintroduced by my colleagues Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Kennedy, Mr. Bucshon, \nand Mr. Pallone.\n  Prescription drug abuse is an epidemic in this country, and, sadly, \nKentucky is impacted by high rates of prescription drug abuse. Every \nyear, there are 15,000 overdose deaths from prescription pain \nrelievers. For every overdose death, there are an estimated 10 \naddiction treatment admissions and 32 emergency department visits. One \nimportant tool we have as a nation to combat this epidemic is \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Programs. They prevent doctor shopping and \nhelp physicians make more informed clinical decisions.\n  Reauthorizing NASPER would provide grant support to States to \nestablish Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs. Healthcare providers \ncan access a patient's prescription history through the PDMP to help \nthem identify patients at risk for addiction or those who are abusing \nprescription drugs. NASPER also helps identify best practices for new \nPDMPs and ways to improve existing monitoring programs.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1725, the National All Schedules \nPrescription Electronic Reporting Reauthorization Act. This important \nlegislation is sponsored by Ranking Member Pallone, Representatives Joe \nKennedy and Ed Whitfield, and Congressman Larry Bucshon.\n  The reauthorization of NASPER is urgently needed to ensure that \nphysicians have patient-specific information through Prescription Drug \nMonitoring\n\n[[Page H5798]]\n\nPrograms, PDMPs, at the point of care. As its name suggests, PDMPs help \nphysicians and other providers make appropriate prescribing decisions \nwhile ensuring that patients with legitimate pain management needs have \naccess to necessary care. We are in the middle of an epidemic of \nprescription drug opioid misuse and overdose. According to the Centers \nfor Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013, more than 16,000 Americans \ndied from an opioid-related overdose.\n  PDMPs are an integral part of our Nation's effort to combat the \nongoing opioid and prescription drug epidemic. They allow for the early \nidentification of at-risk patients and timely intervention to prevent \nprescription drug abuse. States have recognized that PDMPs are a vital \ntool to address this public health crisis as demonstrated by their \nuniversal adoption amongst the States.\n  H.R. 1725 reauthorizes grants to States to enhance their PDMPs, and \nit makes further improvements to the programs. Funding for PDMPs is \nneeded to help States utilize this effective tool, to incentivize \ninformation sharing across State lines, and to further the \nimplementation of best practices.\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Pallone and Representatives Kennedy, \nWhitfield, and Bucshon for their leadership. I also want to thank my \ncolleagues on the Energy and Commerce Committee for their commitment to \naddressing our Nation's opioid epidemic. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 1725.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Whitfield), who has worked tirelessly on these issues in \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee and back home to try to address the \nprescription drug problem in our State.\n  Mr. WHITFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1725, the \nNational All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting \nReauthorization Act, as we call it, NASPER.\n  I introduced this legislation earlier this year with my colleagues, \nCongressman Larry Bucshon of Indiana, Frank Pallone of New Jersey, and \nJoe Kennedy of Massachusetts.\n  I want to thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, as well as \nSubcommittee Chair Pitts, Ranking Member Green, and Congressman Guthrie \nfor helping move this bill through the committee and subcommittee.\n  It has already been stated, the importance of this legislation to \nreauthorize NASPER. Prescription drug overdose death is reaching an \nepidemic proportion. Tragically, it has increased in America by \nfivefold since 1980, and drug overdose now kills more Americans than \nautomobile accidents.\n  In my home State of Kentucky, more than 1,000 individuals die each \nyear from prescription drug overdose, which is the third highest rate \nin the country.\n  Ten years ago NASPER was signed into law to assist States in \ncombating prescription drug abuse through the creation and improvement \nof prescription drug-monitoring programs, which experts agree are one \nof the most promising clinical tools to address this epidemic.\n  So today we come to the floor to reauthorize this important \nlegislation, and I hope that we can continue our efforts to obtain \nadequate funding from the Appropriations Committee for NASPER.\n  While there is no silver bullet to solve the problem, we do have an \nopportunity to make a difference by advancing this reauthorization act. \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting that effort.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Bucshon), a colleague, friend, neighbor--our districts are \njoined on the Ohio River--who is a physician who understands these \nissues.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today as an original coauthor of \nthis legislation, H.R. 1725. The reauthorization of NASPER would allow \nSAMHSA to provide grants to States for the establishment, \nimplementation, and improvement of prescription drug-monitoring \nprograms, or PDMPs, offering timely access to accurate prescription \ninformation for healthcare providers.\n  As a physician, I understand this is critical to a provider's ability \nto screen and treat patients at risk for addiction.\n  The NASPER program also promotes greater information sharing among \nStates by requiring grantees to facilitate these monitoring programs \nwith at least one bordering State while simultaneously protecting \nagainst unauthorized access to patient records.\n  This reauthorization language would also encourage States to explore \nways to incorporate access to their PDMPs into provider workflow \nsystems, such as electronic health records and e-prescribing. Given the \ngrowing problem of prescription drug abuse, this is a commonsense \nmeasure to protect the public.\n  I want to thank Mr. Whitfield, Mr. Kennedy, and Ranking Member \nPallone for their work on this legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate Mr. Whitfield, Dr. Bucshon, certainly Mr. Kennedy, and \nMr. Pallone for bringing this forward. It is important. It is important \nto my State, and it is important to our neighboring States and citizens \nthroughout this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 1725.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to support H.R. 1725, the \n``National All Schedules Prescription Electronic Reporting (NASPER) \nReauthorization Act,'' which helps States establish and maintain \nprescription drug monitoring programs in order to combat prescription \ndrug abuse, a public health crisis affecting communities across the \ncountry. I have been a long-time champion of this bill with my \ncolleague Representative Whitfield and I am pleased that \nRepresentatives Kennedy and Bucshon joined our efforts this Congress to \nreauthorize the NASPER program.\n  Prescription drug monitoring programs help prescribers, pharmacists, \nand law enforcement track and prevent the misuse of prescription drugs. \nForty nine states currently have laws authorizing these programs and \nthey are playing a critical role in our efforts to combat the opioid \ncrisis. This bill, however, once passed into law, will need funding and \ninvestment by appropriators in order to be effective. I urge Members to \nensure that investment is met.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1725, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5798-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5798-H5801]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   PROTECTING OUR INFANTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Protecting Our Infants Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds as follows:\n       (1) Opioid prescription rates have risen dramatically over \n     the past several years. According to the Centers for Disease \n     Control and Prevention, in some States, there are as many as \n     96 to 143 prescriptions for opioids per 100 adults per year.\n       (2) In recent years, there has been a steady rise in the \n     number of overdose deaths involving heroin. According to the \n     Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the death rate \n     for heroin overdose doubled from 2010 to 2012.\n       (3) At the same time, there has been an increase in cases \n     of neonatal abstinence syndrome (referred to in this section \n     as ``NAS''). In the United States, the incidence of NAS has \n     risen from 1.20 per 1,000 hospital births in 2000 to 3.39 per \n     1,000 hospital births in 2009.\n       (4) NAS refers to medical issues associated with drug \n     withdrawal in newborns due to exposure to opioids or other \n     drugs in utero.\n       (5) The average cost of treatment in a hospital for NAS \n     increased from $39,400 in 2000 to $53,400 in 2009. Most of \n     these costs are born by the Medicaid program.\n       (6) Preventing opioid abuse among pregnant women and women \n     of childbearing age is crucial.\n\n[[Page H5799]]\n\n       (7) Medically appropriate opioid use in pregnancy is not \n     uncommon, and opioids are often the safest and most \n     appropriate treatment for moderate to severe pain for \n     pregnant women.\n       (8) Addressing NAS effectively requires a focus on women of \n     childbearing age, pregnant women, and infants from \n     preconception through early childhood.\n       (9) NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs as \n     prescribed for medical reasons, from the abuse of \n     prescription drugs, or from the use of illegal opioids like \n     heroin.\n       (10) For pregnant women who are abusing opioids, it is most \n     appropriate to treat and manage maternal substance use in a \n     non-punitive manner.\n       (11) According to a report of the Government Accountability \n     Office (referred to in this section as the ``GAO report''), \n     more research is needed to optimize the identification and \n     treatment of babies with NAS and to better understand long-\n     term impacts on children.\n       (12) According to the GAO report, the Department of Health \n     and Human Services does not have a focal point to lead \n     planning and coordinating efforts to address prenatal opioid \n     use and NAS across the department.\n       (13) According to the GAO report, ``given the increasing \n     use of heroin and abuse of opioids prescribed for pain \n     management, as well as the increased rate of NAS in the \n     United States, it is important to improve the efficiency and \n     effectiveness of planning and coordination of Federal efforts \n     on prenatal opioid use and NAS''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1462, the Protecting Our Infants Act \nof 2015, introduced by my colleagues, Ms. Clark of Massachusetts and \nMr. Stivers.\n  Over the past several years, opioid addiction has risen dramatically \nin the United States, reaching epidemic proportions. The death rate for \nheroin overdose doubled in just 2 years, from 2010 to 2012.\n  One of the issues that has arisen as a result of this epidemic is \nneonatal abstinence syndrome, known as NAS.\n  These are infants born addicted to opioids and suffer medical issues \nassociated with drug withdrawal. Symptoms can last for weeks, keeping \notherwise healthy infants confined to the hospital at the start of \ntheir lives.\n  NAS can result from the use of prescription drugs or from the use of \nillegal opioids. Sadly, over the past 15 years, a prevalence of NAS has \ntripled in the United States. This is a rapidly growing problem that \nneeds to be addressed for the safety of our mothers and children.\n  H.R. 1462 would address the increasing problem of prenatal opioid \nabuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. Preventing opioid abuse among \npregnant women and women of childbearing age is crucial in addressing \nNAS.\n  The Government Accountability Office has identified that more \nresearch is needed in this area to help treat babies born with NAS and \nmothers addicted to opioids.\n  This legislation would help fill this research gap by studying issues \nand developing recommendations for preventing and treating prenatal \nopioid abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 1462, the Protecting Our Infants Act, led \nby Representatives Katherine Clark and Steve Stivers.\n  The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has found drug \noverdose to be the leading cause of injury death in the United States.\n\n[[Page H5800]]\n\n  According to a recent study by the New England Journal of Medicine, \nfrom 2004 to 2013, the incidence rate of neonatal abstinence syndrome, \nNAS, has quadrupled.\n  NAS refers to medical complications in newborns associated with drug \nwithdrawal due to exposure to opioids and other drugs during pregnancy.\n  Babies born with NAS often require weeks of hospitalization and can \nsuffer from seizures and other severe complications.\n  There is an urgent need for further research to facilitate the \nidentification and treatment of infants with NAS and determine long-\nterm health impacts.\n  The GAO and other experts identified specific research gaps related \nto best practices for treating pregnant women with opioid use \ndisorders, the long-term effects of prenatal drug exposure, and best \npractices in the screening, diagnosis, and treatment of NAS.\n  The Protecting Our Infants Act takes proactive steps to help reduce \nthe number of newborns born exposed to opioids and other drugs and to \nimprove their care if they are exposed.\n  It will facilitate the development of recommendations for treatment \nand coordinate a national strategy to close the known gaps in research \nand coordination. It will also help States improve data collection and \nsurveillance activities.\n  I want to thank Representatives Clark of Massachusetts and Stivers \nfor their leadership. I also want to thank Chairman Upton, Ranking \nMember Pallone, Chairman Pitts, and my colleagues on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee for advancing this important legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1462. I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWest Virginia (Mr. Jenkins).\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, every day in hospitals \nacross the Third Congressional District of West Virginia and the \ncountry babies begin their lives going through drug withdrawal because \nthey were exposed during pregnancy. As you have heard, it is the \ndiagnosis known as neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS.\n  No baby--no baby--deserves to start his or her life in withdrawal \nfrom heroin or other opioids. But, sadly, the rate of babies born with \nNAS, again, as you have heard, has skyrocketed nationally.\n  Doctors, nurses, and caregivers are providing innovative care for \nnewborns with NAS, but there are still gaps in research and our \nunderstanding of how best to care for our most vulnerable.\n  The Protecting Our Infants Act makes significant strides in \naddressing this nationwide gap and developing these strategies, and I \nam proud to be a cosponsor of this bill.\n  West Virginia has been at the forefront of this epidemic, with NAS \nrates much higher than the national average.\n  Our nurses and doctors are tirelessly working to care for newborns \nwith NAS, and having additional resources and research will only \nfurther their efforts in providing the best possible care.\n  I have met with caregivers throughout my district to discuss their \napproaches to treating NAS, and I know this legislation will help in \ntheir efforts to treat these babies.\n  While we must continue to guarantee that newborns receive the \nabsolute best care, we must also address the issue of addiction in \npregnant and postnatal women.\n  This legislation will help identify and develop treatment methods for \nexpectant mothers with opioid addictions, leading to healthier outcomes \nfor mother and baby alike.\n  NAS is a nationwide crisis, one that impacts urban, rural, and \nsuburban areas. Nearly every district in America has been touched by \nheroin and opioid addiction. We must address the impact this addiction \nhas on our most vulnerable in society, our newborn babies.\n  I commend Congresswoman Clark for her efforts on this important \nlegislation, and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), the \ncosponsor of the bill.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nTexas for yielding.\n  Our Nation is experiencing a deadly opiate epidemic, an epidemic that \nknows no boundaries and destroys lives, families, and communities.\n  Today 58 babies--one baby every 25 minutes--will be born suffering \nfrom the same pain adults describe as the worst pain of their lives. It \nis the pain of drug withdrawal.\n  Neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS for short, occurs when babies \nare born dependent on opioids, and it is one of the chief causes of the \nsignificant surge of newborns in neonatal intensive care units across \nthe Nation.\n  Over the last decade, the number of infants born dependent on \npowerful drugs has grown nearly fivefold. In States like Massachusetts, \nNAS is occurring at a rate three times the national average.\n  NAS births are five times more costly than healthy ones. Costs have \nrisen to more than $1.5 billion a year, 80 percent of which are paid \nfor by Medicaid.\n  Because of this skyrocketing rise of NAS cases and costs, doctors are \ndesperately trying to find the most effective method of diagnosis and \ntreatment.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  There is little coordination of data and best practices and protocols \namong States, healthcare systems, and practitioners; and no medications \nhave been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for \ntreating these babies.\n  The Protecting Our Infants Act is the first Federal bill to take \nproactive steps in addressing the rise of NAS. With broad bipartisan \nsupport in both Chambers, this is an opportunity for Congress to make a \ndifference for babies suffering from opioid exposure and the families \nstruggling with addiction.\n  This bill directs the Department of Health and Human Services to \ndevelop the protocols for treating and preventing NAS. The Protecting \nOur Infants Act helps babies suffering from opioid withdrawal by making \nsure they get the best care available.\n  This act will ensure that every hospital has access to the best \npractices and that States have the public health data they need to \naddress this crisis. This is good for families, good for our healthcare \nproviders, and good for our Nation's bottom line.\n  I want to thank my colleagues in the House and, in particular, \nCongressman Steve Stivers for his partnership in this bill. I am \ngrateful for his deep commitment to addressing this problem and \ncrafting a solution. I am also grateful to Senators McConnell and Casey \nfor sponsoring this legislation in the Senate.\n  Today, we have a chance to help the youngest of those suffering from \nthe opioid crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass the bipartisan Protecting Our Infants \nAct.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nStivers), my friend.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support a bill that my \ncolleague from Massachusetts, Representative Katherine Clark, and I \nintroduced, H.R. 1462, the Protect Our Infants Act. I want to thank \nRepresentative Clark for her leadership, her hard work, and her \ncommitment to protecting America's children.\n  This bill has the support of 95 bipartisan cosponsors. It is a \ntargeted effort to address a national epidemic of babies being born \naddicted to drugs.\n  Recent data has shown that this issue, called neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome, is sadly on the rise throughout the country. A baby is born \nwith neonatal abstinence syndrome every 25 minutes, and symptoms can \nlast for months and lead to weeks of hospitalization and have a \nlifelong impact.\n  A report by the Journal of the American Medical Association showed \nthat the number of newborns diagnosed with NAS tripled from 2000 to \n2009. In my home State of Ohio, the rate of neonatal abstinence \nsyndrome grew over 600 percent between 2004 and 2011.\n  It has taken a heavy toll on Ohio's healthcare system and Ohio's \nfamilies. Treating newborns with NAS was associated with over $70 \nmillion in charges and approximately 19,000 hospital stays, and that \nwas back in 2011. It has been on the rise ever since.\n  This issue is especially devastating to our families and especially \ndevastating to the youngest among us, the\n\n[[Page H5801]]\n\nbabies who are born addicted to drugs. I recently heard from a \ngrandmother to three babies who were born with NAS. She was pleading \nfor help for her innocent grandchildren, and she wanted to make sure we \ndid something about this terrible disease.\n  I am proud to say that the response in my district has been strong to \nour bill. There is a healthcare system called Adena Regional Medical \nCenter in Chillicothe, Ohio, and they actually have an incredible \nprogram which was piloted with a bunch of OB/GYNs, and they started \nwith just 15 pregnant women who were addicted to drugs, and they have \nserved those women. Now, they are on their second class to try to get \nthose women off of drugs before they deliver.\n  I am happy to report that, because of the support of the Adena Health \nSystem, none of the women in that group delivered a baby with NAS. Due \nto the success of the pilot, there is a permanent program that is \nstarting now, and it already has a wait list, so I am really excited to \nsay that there are people out there showing real leadership.\n  Last week, I hosted my fourth annual opiate roundtable in my district \nto bring together a lot of issues, and we talked about this bill and \nhow important it was, so I am so proud that it is on the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to support the Protecting Our \nInfants Act, H.R. 1462, to help our Nation's most innocent citizens. \nAgain, I want to thank Katherine Clark for her incredible leadership on \nthis bill and her commitment.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers, and \nin closing, I encourage our colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, during the hearing in the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce, one of the physicians testifying, a neonatologist, \nturned out to practice with my first cousin, so I got to do research \nfurther into what is moving forward in this bill.\n  I learned even more from personal stories about how important it is \nand how critical this is and how sad it is for children to be born \naddicted and how the opportunity is for us to help.\n  I certainly appreciate my friend from Massachusetts, Ms. Clark, and \nmy friend from Ohio, Mr. Stivers. I would encourage all my colleagues \nto vote for H.R. 1462, Protecting Our Infants Act of 2015.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 1462 the ``Protecting Our \nInfants Act of 2015.'' This legislation would address the urgent need \nfor a comprehensive strategy for one of the harmful outcome of our \nnation's opioid epidemic. Neonatal abstinence syndrome, or NAS, occurs \nin newborns who were exposed to opioids, including pain killers, while \nin their mother's womb. NAS is associated with negative health outcomes \nlike preterm births and low birthweight.\n  I'm saddened to say that the opioid epidemic has resulted in a steep \nincrease in the occurrence of NAS over the past decade. H.R. 1462 would \nrequire HHS to develop recommendations for the treatment and prevention \nof prenatal opiate abuse and neonatal abstinence syndrome. It would \nalso require the collection of data to better monitor the problem.\n  I want to thank Representative Katherine Clark for her leadership on \nthis issue and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this \nnecessary legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 1462.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5801-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5801-H5804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     STEM CELL THERAPEUTIC AND RESEARCH REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2820, the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic and Research Reauthorization Act of 2015, introduced by my \ncolleagues Chris Smith and Doris Matsui.\n  Bone marrow transplantation has been used for more than 50 years to \ntreat blood-related diseases, such as leukemia, different anemias, and \nlymphoma. It is a rich source of blood stem cells. In more recent \nyears, breakthroughs have been made using blood stem cells from \numbilical cord blood in the treatment of those various blood-related \ndiseases and conditions.\n  It can be very difficult to find a bone marrow transplant match, and \nin some cases, cord blood can be used instead. Bone marrow and cord \nblood donation are critical to ensure those in need of transplant can \nfind a match. The need for this lifesaving transplantation has risen 25 \npercent since 2005.\n  H.R. 2820 reauthorizes the National Marrow Donor Program and creates \na national network of public cord blood banks. The legislation also \nprovides healthcare professionals the ability to search for bone marrow \nand umbilical cord blood units for transplantation.\n  H.R. 2820 also bolsters patient and advocacy services; provides for \npublic and professional education; and collects, analyzes, and reports \ndata on transplant outcomes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2820, the Stem Cell \nTherapeutic Research Reauthorization Act. This important legislation is \nchampioned by Representatives Doris Matsui and Chris Smith.\n  According to the Health Resources and Services Administration, nearly \n20,000 patients in the United States need a bone marrow or cord blood \ntransplant each year. Stem cells from both cord blood and bone marrow \nare used to treat nearly 80 lifesaving diseases, including cancers, \nblood diseases, and immune disorders.\n  H.R. 2820 provides Federal support for cord blood donation, the \ncontinuation of the national bone marrow registry, and critical medical \nresearch. This legislation reauthorizes the C. W. Bill Young Cell \nTransplantation Program, which includes the National Marrow Donor \nProgram.\n  The program helps patients in need of lifesaving transplants find \nmatching bone marrow donors or cord blood units. It also includes a \nstem cell therapeutic outcomes database, which facilitates research to \nbetter understand the matching process. This legislation will give hope \nof access to patients and their families in need of a curative \ntransplant.\n  I want to thank Representatives Matsui and Smith for their leadership\n\n[[Page H5802]]\n\non this issue. I also want to thank Chairman Upton, Ranking Member \nPallone, Chairman Pitts, and my colleagues on the Committee on Energy \nand Commerce for advancing this important legislation. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 2820.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 6 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), my good friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank my good friend Mr. Guthrie for \nyielding and for his support on this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, Maalik was diagnosed with Hurler syndrome at 15 months \nold, a rare and life-threatening metabolic disorder. He had a curved \nspine, and he could not walk.\n  After receiving an umbilical cord blood transplant facilitated \nthrough the Carolinas Cord Blood Bank, Maalik is running around and is \nexpected to have a normal lifespan. His mother, Krystal, said: ``My son \nis extremely happy now. He is energetic and more independent. The \ntransplant saved his life.''\n  In like manner, bone marrow donations provide lifesaving transplants \nfor a myriad of diseases. Clara was only 4 months old when she was \ndiagnosed with acute myeloid leukemia. John had registered with the \nNational Marrow Donor Program Be The Match as a bone marrow donor when \nClara was only 17 days old. It turned out it was a perfect match for \nClara. John's donation saved Clara's life. She is now thriving at 2 \nyears of age.\n  Mr. Speaker, not only has God in His wisdom and goodness created a \nplacenta and an umbilical cord to nurture and protect the precious life \nof an unborn child, but now, we find He has left a great gift behind. \nImmediately after birth, something very special is left behind, cord \nblood that is teeming with lifesaving stem cells.\n  Breathtaking scientific breakthroughs have turned medical waste--\npostbirth placentas and umbilical cord blood--into medical miracles, \ntreating more than 80 diseases, including leukemia, lymphoma, and \nsickle cell anemia.\n  As a matter of fact, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University and \npresident of the Cord Blood Association told Chairman Pitts' \nsubcommittee on June 25 that sickle cell anemia can be cured with cord \nblood transplantation and that it has become one of the most optimal \ndonor sources for patients with sickle cell disease.\n  H.R. 2820, under consideration by the House today, reauthorizes \nthrough 2020 the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005, a law \nI sponsored a decade ago, joined by Artur Davis of Alabama, legislation \nthat cleared the Senate with the incomparable help of Senator Orrin \nHatch.\n  That law built upon the excellent work of our distinguished late \ncolleague Bill Young of Florida to facilitate bone marrow transplants \nand created a brand-new national umbilical cord blood donation and \ntransplantation program.\n  Special thanks, Mr. Speaker, to both Chairmen Upton and Pitts for \ntheir outstanding leadership and help on this bill, as well as the \nstrong support by Ranking Members Pallone and my good friend and \ncolleague Mr. Green.\n  I am deeply grateful to our original sponsors, Ms. Matsui, Mr. Jolly, \nand Mr. Fattah, for their contributions and special thanks to Adrianna \nSimonelli, Katie Novaria, and Megan McCrum.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, under the National Cord Blood Inventory program, \ncontracts are awarded to cord blood banks to collect cord blood units \ndonated after their mothers give birth. These units are then made \navailable through the C. W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program, \nalso called the Be The Match Registry.\n  The program provides a single point of access, enabling those in need \nof lifesaving transplants to search for a match via an integrated \nnationwide network of bone marrow and cord blood stem cells.\n  Americans willing to volunteer are at the heart of the success of \nthis program. In reauthorizing it, we are grateful for the adult donors \nwilling to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, as well \nas mothers who donate their baby's cord blood to public cord blood \nbanks.\n  There are 13 public banks contracted through the NCBI, including the \nNew Jersey Cord Blood Bank in my home State, which collects cord blood \nfrom five participating hospitals.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it ought to be noted as well that, in addition to \ntreating more than 80 diseases, cord blood units from the NCBI banks \nare also available for research on future therapies.\n  Indeed, Dr. Kurtzberg pointed out that, ``in addition to use in \npatients with malignant and genetic diseases, cord blood is showing \nenormous potential for use in cellular therapies and other regenerative \nmedicine. Cord blood derived vaccines against viruses and certain types \nof cancers are currently under development and in early phase clinical \ntrials. Cells, manufactured from cord blood units are being developed \nto boost recovery of the immune system. Cells regulating autoimmunity \nare also in clinical trials. These approaches, which often utilize cord \nblood banked in family banks, may help patients with type 1 diabetes, \nas well as other diseases,'' she testified just a few months ago.\n  She also pointed out that ``over the past 6 years, we have initiated \ntrials of the patient's own cord blood in babies with birth asphyxia, \ncerebral palsy, hearing loss''; and she is doing some incredible work \non an issue that I have worked on for over 20 years, and that is the \nissue and the disability known as autism.\n  Dr. Kurtzberg finally said, ``We've learned that when a donor cells \nare infused into one's body, they go to the brain and help heal the \nbrain. When a child has a brain injury around birth, we can use their \nown cord blood cells to correct the damage that's occurred.''\n  Dr. Jeffrey Chell, of Be the Match--he is the CEO for it--noted that \nfor many diseases, including blood cancers and sickle cell disease, \ncellular therapy is the best hope for a cure.\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, I visited Celgene Corporation of Summit, New \nJersey, to learn of their extraordinary efforts to use cord blood to \nheal diabetic foot ulcers, and they now have turned amniotic membrane, \nan old placenta, into wound management that has now advanced--it is on \nthe market--past stage 3 clinical trials.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. I yield the gentleman another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. H.R. 2820 authorizes $265 million over 5 \nyears and will ensure that thousands of present-day and future patients \nbenefit from this exciting field of regenerative medicine.\n  We have only just begun. This legislation furthers that work. And \nagain, I thank my colleagues for this bipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, Maalik was diagnosed with Hurler Syndrome at 15 months \nold--a rare and life-threatening metabolic disorder. He had a curved \nspine and could not walk. After receiving an umbilical cord blood \ntransplant facilitated through the Carolina Blood Bank, Maalik is \nrunning around and expected to have a normal lifespan. His mother \nKrystal told the Herald Sun newspaper in North Carolina, ``My son is \nextremely happy now . . . He's energetic, and more independent. The \ntransplant saved his life.''\n  In like manner, bone marrow donations provide lifesaving transplants \nto treat diseases like blood cancer or inherited metabolic or immune \nsystem disorders. Clara was only 4 months old when she was diagnosed \nwith acute myeloid leukemia. John had registered with the National \nMarrow Donor Program (NMDP) Be the Match as a bone marrow donor when \nClara was only 17 days old. It turned out he was a perfect match for \nClara. John's donation saved Clara's life, she is now a thriving 2 year \nold.\n  Valentina was 10 months old and only 13 pounds--and diagnosed with \nsevere combined immunodeficiency (SCID). Her doctor treated her with \nchemotherapy followed by a cord blood transplant. 5 months after the \ntransplant Valentina weighed 21 pounds and doctors credited her \nstrengthened immune system from the stem cells in cord blood.\n  Jennifer, 45, was suffering from acute myeloid leukemia but unable to \nfind a matched bone-marrow transplant. Because of the high rate of \ntissue type diversity among racial and ethnic minorities it can be \ndifficult to find a matched bone marrow transplant, but umbilical cord \nblood can be successfully used for treatment with a less perfect match \nof tissue type. After undergoing chemotherapy and radiation she \nreceived a cord blood transplant, and is now living cancer free.\n\n[[Page H5803]]\n\n  Not only has God in His wisdom and goodness created a placenta and \numbilical cord to nurture and protect the precious life of an unborn \nchild, but now we know that another gift awaits us immediately after \nbirth. Something very special is left behind--cord blood that is \nteeming with lifesaving stem cells.\n  Breathtaking scientific breakthroughs have turned medical waste--post \nbirth placentas and umbilical cord blood--into medical miracles \ntreating more than 80 diseases including leukemia, lymphoma and sickle \ncell anemia.\n  As a matter of fact, Dr. Joanne Kurtzberg of Duke University and \nPresident of the Cord Blood Association told Chairman Pitts' Health \nSubcommittee on June 25 that sickle cell anemia can be ``cured'' with \ncord blood transplantation and that ``it has become one of the optimal \ndonor sources for patients with sickle cell disease'' because it \ndoesn't have to be perfectly matched.\n  H.R. 2820 under consideration by the House today reauthorizes through \n2020 the Stem Cell Therapeutic and Research Act of 2005 a law that I \nsponsored a decade ago joined by Artur Davis of Alabama; legislation \nthat cleared the Senate with the incomparable help of Senator Orrin \nHatch. That law built upon the excellent work of our distinguished late \ncolleague Bill Young of Florida to facilitate bone marrow transplants \nand created a brand new national umbilical cord blood donation and \ntransplantation program.\n  Special thanks to both Chairmen Upton and Pitts for their outstanding \nleadership and help on this bill, as well as the strong support by \nRanking Members Pallone and Green. I am deeply grateful to original \ncosponsors Ms. Matsui, Mr. Jolly and Mr. Fattah for their important \ncontributions. And special thanks to Katie Novaria, Adrianna Simonelli, \nand Megan McCrum.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, under the National Cord Blood Inventory Program \n(NCBI), contracts are awarded to cord blood banks to collect cord blood \nunits donated after mothers give birth. These units are then made \navailable through the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program also \ncalled the Be the Match Registry. The Program provides a single point \nof access, enabling those in need of lifesaving transplants to search \nfor a match via an integrated nationwide network of bone marrow donors \nand cord blood stem cells. The Program's Bone Marrow and Cord Blood \nCoordinating Centers makes information about bone marrow and cord blood \ntransplant available to donors and patients, and the Office of Patient \nAdvocacy helps support patients and families dealing with a life-\nthreatening diagnosis. And the Stem Cell Therapeutic Outcomes Database \ntracks results.\n  Americans willing to volunteer are the heart of the success of this \nprogram. In reauthorizing it we are grateful for the adult donors \nwilling to donate bone marrow or peripheral blood stem cells, as well \nas mothers who donate their babies' cord blood through public cord \nblood banks.\n  There are 13 public banks contracted through NCBI, including the New \nJersey Cord Blood Bank in my home state, which collects cord blood from \n5 participating hospitals.\n  According to the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA), \nevery year 18,000 people in the U.S. are diagnosed with illnesses for \nwhich blood stem cell transplantation from a matched donor is their \nbest treatment option. Of this number, only about 30% have a sibling \nwho can be the ideal matched donor, so about 12,600 people annually \ndepend on the programs made available by this law to find an unrelated \nadult marrow donor or cord blood unit for treatment.\n  Cord blood transplants have accounted for about one half of the \ngrowth in stem cell transplants since NCBI was established in 2005. \nMore NCBI units have been released for transplantation with each \nsuccessive year since the program's inception.\n  In addition to currently treating more than 80 diseases, cord blood \nunits from NCBI banks are also made available for research on future \ntherapies. In groundbreaking research, Dr. Kurtzberg of Duke University \nalso testified last June that ``in addition to use in patients with \nmalignant and genetic diseases, cord blood is showing enormous \npotential for use in cellular therapies and regenerative medicine. Cord \nblood derived vaccines against viruses and certain types of cancers are \ncurrently under development and in early phase clinical trials. Cells \nmanufactured from cord blood units are being developed to boost \nrecovery of the immune system. Cells regulating autoimmunity \n(Regulatory T cells) are also in clinical trials. These approaches, \nwhich often utilize cord blood banked in family banks, may help \npatients with Type 1 Diabetes, as well as other diseases.''\n  Dr. Kurtzberg further testified that she and others are developing \nuses for cord blood to treat acquired brain disorders. ``Over the past \nsix years'' she said ``we have initiated trials of autologous (the \npatient's own) cord blood in babies with birth asphyxia, cerebral \npalsy, hearing loss and autism . . .''\n  Dr. Kurtzberg has also said ``We've learned that when donor cells are \ninfused into one's body, they go to the brain and help heal the brain. \nWhen a child has a brain injury around birth, we can use their own cord \nblood cells to correct the damage that's occurred.''\n  Dr. Jeffrey W. Chell, CEO of NMDP/Be the Match noted that for many \ndiseases including blood cancers and sickle cell disease, cellular \ntherapy is the best hope for a cure. He told Chairman Pitts' \nsubcommittee that the patient population ``rising the most quickly is \nthe elderly population . . . growing by double digits every year, and \nthe reason for that is the medical conditions for which transplant is \noften the only cure tend to occur in older populations for diseases \nlike acute myeloid leukemia, myelodysplastic syndrome, myelofibrosis \nand others.''\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, I visited Celgene Corporation of Summit, New \nJersey to learn of their extraordinary efforts to use cord blood to \nheal diabetic foot ulcers and how they've turned amniotic membrane--an \nold placenta--into wound management that has now advanced past stage 3 \nclinical trials to the approval and regulatory filings stage.\n  H.R. 2820 authorizes $265 million over five years and will ensure \nthat thousands of present-day and future patients benefit from the \nexciting field of regenerative medicine.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose with a quick story.\n  There is a good friend of mine. His name is Philip Schardein, and I \nam great friends with his family. He went off to play golf in college--\ngreat athlete. All of a sudden, he came down with leukemia, and I \nremember that there were some issues at first about his sister being \nable to donate bone marrow.\n  So my town, Bowling Green, Kentucky, organized a bone marrow drive to \nsee if anybody could match Philip Schardein. I have probably never been \nmore proud to call myself a resident of the hometown of Bowling Green \nthan that day. I remember going three times, and it was so overwhelmed \nwith volunteers trying to have their bone marrow, the blood type, to \nsee if they matched, that it just overwhelmed the system.\n  I remember finally getting through late in the afternoon, and people \nwaited all day to see if they could match and help Philip Schardein. \nAnd God bless, for whatever reason his sister couldn't donate, it \nturned out that she could donate, and he is a healthy person now with \nfamily and children, and everything is going well.\n  But just about a year after that, I was in Holiday World with my \nfamily. I was having a day with them. My cell phone rang, and it turned \nout I had matched, because of going to get my bone marrow tested, or my \nblood tested, that I matched someone. The lady got on the phone, and \nshe told me what it takes to be a donor and, Will you be willing to \nmove forward? I said, Of course.\n  I remember the reason I said I was at Holiday World was because I \nremember standing there going, here I am with my family having fun, \nlaughing and having a great afternoon, and there is some family \nsomewhere that is anonymous, not having the same experience, probably \ntrying to figure out if their loved one is going to live or survive or \nwhat is going to be the prognosis.\n  So I went through the process, and I remember going through, having \nmy blood taken and several of the steps. Just getting close to the \nactual time to do the bone marrow transplant, for whatever reason, we \ngot notified that it wasn't going forward. It could do that for many \nreasons. One, hopefully, is the anonymous person was cured or the \nprognosis was better, or maybe a sibling or something matched like it \ndid for Philip Schardein.\n  But I've often wondered about the life on the other end, because they \ndon't tell you for reason of anonymity, and it is just something that \nhas always weighed on my mind. Even sitting here and getting ready to \nclose, I was thinking about who was on the other end, and I hope that \nthey have a good story, as well as Philip Schardein.\n  But what I want to stress is how important it is that families in \nneed and worry and wondering what is going to happen with their loved \nones, and the loved ones themselves, and this is something we can do. \nIt was a little thing that I was able to do, that we all were able to \ndo in my community, and\n\n[[Page H5804]]\n\npeople across this country can do to try to help people live long and \nfruitful lives.\n  Our prayers were answered with Philip Schardein, and this is an \nopportunity for us to come together, in a bipartisan way, as all the \nbills were.\n  I want to close with this. We have been through four bills in the \nlast hour, and they are dealing with touching families, and every one \nof them has been bipartisan. We have been able to come together and \nfind where we agree and work together, that we can work for infants, \nfor families suffering with leukemia and other blood disorders, for \ninfants with opioid addiction, for parents who have children with early \nhearing detection, and that is where we have been able to come together \nand work together.\n  I appreciate the effort of Ranking Member Green in bringing us all \ntogether, and our subcommittee chairman, Mr. Pitts.\n  I look forward to voting for this bill, and I urge my colleagues to \nvote for H.R. 2820. I appreciate my friend, Mr. Smith, for bringing it \nforward.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, H.R. 820, the ``Stem Cell Therapeutic and \nResearch Reauthorization Act,'' would continue critical federal support \nfor the C.W. Bill Young Cell Transplantation Program. This program \nincludes the Be the Match registry for bone marrow and umbilical cord \nblood transplantation which continues to provide hope to people in need \nof a lifesaving transplants.\n  Each year thousands of patients in need of life saving transplants \nare unable to find a match within their family and therefore require a \nnonrelative donor. That is why the Be the Match Registry and its nearly \n12.5 million registered bone marrow donors and collection of more than \n209,000 cord blood units is so important. The Program also supports the \ncollection and use of transplantation data to advance medical research.\n  I'd like to thank Representative Doris Matsui for her leadership in \nthis area and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2820 to ensure that \nthe lifesaving Be the Match registry continues.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2820.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5804-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5804-H5805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         E-WARRANTY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (S. 1359) to allow manufacturers to meet warranty and labeling \nrequirements for consumer products by displaying the terms of \nwarranties on Internet websites, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                S. 1359\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``E-Warranty Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Many manufacturers and consumers prefer to have the \n     option to provide or receive warranty information online.\n       (2) Modernizing warranty notification rules is necessary to \n     allow the United States to continue to compete globally in \n     manufacturing, trade, and the development of consumer \n     products connected to the Internet.\n       (3) Allowing an electronic warranty option would expand \n     consumer access to relevant consumer information in an \n     environmentally friendly way, and would provide additional \n     flexibility to manufacturers to meet their labeling and \n     warranty requirements.\n\n     SEC. 3. ELECTRONIC DISPLAY OF TERMS OF WRITTEN WARRANTY FOR \n                   CONSUMER PRODUCTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 102(b) of the Magnuson-Moss \n     Warranty--Federal Trade Commission Improvement Act (15 U.S.C. \n     2302(b)) is amended by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(4)(A) Except as provided in subparagraph (B), the rules \n     prescribed under this subsection shall allow for the \n     satisfaction of all requirements concerning the availability \n     of terms of a written warranty on a consumer product under \n     this subsection by--\n       ``(i) making available such terms in an accessible digital \n     format on the Internet website of the manufacturer of the \n     consumer product in a clear and conspicuous manner; and\n       ``(ii) providing to the consumer (or prospective consumer) \n     information with respect to how to obtain and review such \n     terms by indicating on the product or product packaging or in \n     the product manual--\n       ``(I) the Internet website of the manufacturer where such \n     terms can be obtained and reviewed; and\n       ``(II) the phone number of the manufacturer, the postal \n     mailing address of the manufacturer, or another reasonable \n     non-Internet based means of contacting the manufacturer to \n     obtain and review such terms.\n       ``(B) With respect to any requirement that the terms of any \n     written warranty for a consumer product be made available to \n     the consumer (or prospective consumer) prior to sale of the \n     product, in a case in which a consumer product is offered for \n     sale in a retail location, by catalog, or through door-to-\n     door sales, subparagraph (A) shall only apply if the seller \n     makes available, through electronic or other means, at the \n     location of the sale to the consumer purchasing the consumer \n     product the terms of the warranty for the consumer product \n     before the purchase.''.\n       (b) Revision of Rules.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 1 year after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Federal Trade Commission shall \n     revise the rules prescribed under such section to comply with \n     the requirements of paragraph (4) of such section, as added \n     by subsection (a) of this section.\n       (2) Authority to waive requirement for oral presentation.--\n     In revising rules under paragraph (1), the Federal Trade \n     Commission may waive the requirement of section 109(a) of \n     such Act (15 U.S.C. 2309(a)) to give interested persons an \n     opportunity for oral presentation if the Commission \n     determines that giving interested persons such opportunity \n     would interfere with the ability of the Commission to revise \n     rules under paragraph (1) in a timely manner.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Burgess) and the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous materials into the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the E-Warranty Act of 2015 modernizes current warranty \nrequirements by allowing manufacturers to post product warranty \ninformation online.\n  I certainly want to thank Senator Fischer and Congressman Mullin for \ncrafting bipartisan legislation opening a path for manufacturers to \nconduct their business more efficiently in the digital age.\n  This legislation will give consumers better access to warranty \ninformation, while retaining flexibility for sellers and reducing costs \nfor manufacturers. The Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously \nforwarded the companion bill, H.R. 3154, to the House floor in July \nafter consideration by the Subcommittee on Commerce, Manufacturing, and \nTrade.\n  The subcommittee has been studying how the use of the Internet and \nother advanced technologies is generating great advances for consumers \nand creating jobs. Simple things like this will create savings across \nmultiple industries.\n  We will continue to look for ways to roll back outdated regulations \nthat slow down our e-commerce, economy and hurt jobs. This legislation \ndoes just that by bringing warranty regulations into the 21st century. \nI urge my colleagues to vote for S. 1359.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1359, the E-Warranty Act \nof 2015. I am pleased the House is considering this bipartisan, \nbicameral legislation. S. 1359 is identical to H.R. 3154, the E-\nWarranty Act of 2015, which I was very, very happy to introduce with my \ngood friend, the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  This commonsense legislation will bring product warranties into the \n21st century by allowing warranty information to be posted online. This \nsolution makes sense for both manufacturers and consumers, as many of \nwhich prefer the option of providing or receiving warranty information \nin electronic rather than paper form.\n  Not only will this bill reduce waste, it will make it easier for \nconsumers to\n\n[[Page H5805]]\n\nfind warranty information quickly and easily, without worrying that it \nwill be lost or discarded.\n  I thank the committee for bringing this bill forward, and I urge \nsupport for this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Mullin), the author of the House-sponsored legislation.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Chairman Burgess and the \ncommittee for allowing this bill to come to the floor. This is one of \nthose commonsense bills that brings a regulation that was put in place \nnearly 40 years ago and brings it to today's technology.\n  This bill has passed the Senate by unanimous consent and is identical \nto H.R. 3154 that Congressman Loebsack and I introduced and which \npassed the committee by voice vote. This bipartisan E-Warranty Act of \n2015 gives manufacturers the option of fulfilling their warranty notice \nrequirements by posting the information on the Web site.\n  Our current Federal regulation, as I stated earlier, was developed \nnearly 40 years ago. The world has changed since then, and, like many \nregulations, this has become outdated. Warranty requirements ensure \nconsumers get important information when they purchase a product, and \nwe need to make sure the methods for delivering this information keep \npace with innovation.\n  I urge all Members to vote ``yes'' on this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, it appears that I have no further \nspeakers, so I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BURGESS. Mr. Speaker, I would just simply add that I encourage \nall Members to vote in favor of the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 1359, the E-\nWarranty Act. And I want to thank Mr. Loebsack and Mr. Mullin for their \ncontributions to the bill.\n  The bill directs the Federal Trade Commission to amend its current \nrules on warranty notice to allow the pre-sale notice requirements to \nbe fulfilled by making warranty information available online. While I \nsupport this commonsense proposal, I would like to highlight one point \nthat the bill rightly acknowledges--there are many consumers and small \nbusiness owners without Internet access.\n  This bill requires that contact information of the product \nmanufacturers be made available so consumers may obtain warranty \ninformation by non-electronic means. To ensure that consumers and small \nbusiness owners without Internet access are not disadvantaged, this \nCommittee expects the FTC to require that consumers be provided with a \ntoll-free phone number and warrantors respond to non-Internet requests \nfor free and in a timely manner.\n  Moreover, I am confident that when the FTC changes its rules pursuant \nto this bill, it will maintain the protections that currently exist for \nconsumers and small business owners who do not have Internet access, \nincluding requiring manufacturers to ensure sellers can fulfill their \nobligations under the bill and the rules.\n  This bill will help modernize the rules regarding pre-sale warranty \nnotice by allowing warranty information to be made available online. I \nurge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Burgess) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 1359.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Madam Speaker, I would ask that members of the Virginia \ncongregation join me here in the well.\n  Madam Speaker, colleagues, along with my fellow members of the \ndelegation from the Commonwealth of Virginia, I rise today with a heavy \nheart.\n  On the morning of August 26, we were shaken by a tragic incident \nduring which WDBJ7 journalists Alison Parker and Adam Ward were killed \nin an act of senseless, heartbreaking violence. Vicki Gardner, head of \nthe Smith Mountain Lake Regional Chamber of Commerce, was seriously \ninjured in the shooting. She has recently been discharged from the \nhospital and continues her recovery.\n  Alison Parker was 24 years old. She graduated from Martinsville High \nSchool, attended Patrick Henry Community College, and went on to James \nMadison University's School of Media Arts and Design. After she \ngraduated, Alison joined the news team at WCTI 12 in North Carolina \nbefore, last year, landing a job reporting for the Mornin' Show at WDBJ \nin Roanoke, where she worked on the news team with Adam. It is a TV \nstation that broadcasts into her hometown and into Adam's hometown.\n  Adam Ward was 27. He grew up in Botetourt, but was described as \n``truly a Salem Spartan, born and bred.'' He started attending school \nat Andrew Lewis Middle School in the seventh grade, later playing \nfootball for Salem High. Adam fulfilled another dream by attending \nVirginia Tech and becoming a proud member of the Hokie Nation.\n  Alison and Adam were cheerful, hardworking, exuberant, and much-loved \nmembers of the WDBJ family who are and will continue to be missed.\n  Our community is grieving and coping. We are asking for comfort and \nhealing. We are reflecting on Alison's and Adam's lives while also \npraying for Vicki's ongoing recovery.\n  Madam Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me, my colleagues from the \nCommonwealth, and our community in a moment of silent prayer.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5807-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5807]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    MOMENT OF SILENCE IN HONOR OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE LOUIS STOKES\n\n  (Ms. KAPTUR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Madam Speaker, I rise this evening to pay tribute to an \nhistoric, distinguished former Member of this Chamber--Louis Stokes of \nCleveland, Ohio.\n  Congressman Stokes passed away on August 18, at the age of 90, with \nhis loving wife of 55 years, Jeanette, by his side.\n  On behalf of the people of Ohio and the Ohio delegation, I would like \nto express our deep sadness and enduring gratitude for the life of \nLouis Stokes.\n  Growing up in Cleveland in public housing, with his brother, Carl, \nand their widowed mother, life was hard, but Lou triumphed over \nhardship to become a passionate voice for the less fortunate. He gave \nhis life to public service, serving 3 years in the Army before using \nthe benefits he earned under the GI Bill to attend college and law \nschool; and, I might say, he served in a segregated Army. He worked \nclosely with the NAACP and argued the landmark stop and frisk case, \nTerry v. Ohio, before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n  In his 15 terms in Congress, he served as an ever-present voice for \npeople of color and vulnerable communities across this country, playing \na role to help found the Congressional Black Caucus in 1971. He was a \nfoundational figure. His leadership was also historic, as he was the \nfirst African American Member of Congress ever elected to represent \nOhio. Lou's resume in the House included stints as chairman of the \nselect committee that investigated the assassinations of John F. \nKennedy and Martin Luther King, Jr., from 1976 to 1978; as chairman of \nthe House Ethics Committee; as a member of the House select committee \nthat investigated the Iran-Contra affair; and as the first Black person \nto chair the Intelligence Committee and serve on the influential House \nAppropriations Committee and chair its Subcommittee on Veterans, \nHousing and Urban Development, and Independent Agencies.\n  A month before his passing, Lou gave an interview to the Cleveland \nPlain Dealer. He said: ``I was a very blessed guy . . . I've been \nblessed with the opportunity to participate in history, to rise to \nopportunities I never envisioned . . . and to provide for people \nopportunities that, in many cases, they would have never had.''\n  We stand here today in the footsteps of this historic champion. It is \nwe who are blessed to have worked alongside Congressman Stokes; and our \nthoughts and prayers are with his wife, Jeanette; his beautiful \ndaughters Angela, Shelley, and Lori; son, Chuck; and seven \ngrandchildren. Our thoughts and prayers are with all of them during \nthis difficult time of loss.\n  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the Ohio delegation, I ask that the House \nobserve a moment of silence in memory of the legendary, transformative \nlife of former Congressman Louis Stokes, and I thank you all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5807-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5807-H5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, this week, we will debate and vote \non one of the most consequential national security and foreign policy \nissues that we have faced in quite some time--the Iran nuclear \nagreement.\n  This deal allows Iran to continue to enrich uranium and to keep in \nplace nearly every key aspect of its nuclear program. It also provides \nan economic lifeline to the Iranian regime, with billions of dollars in \nsanctions relief, which will fund Iran's support for terror and its \nother acts of belligerence in the region.\n  This deal also lifts the arms embargo on Iran, lifts sanctions on its \nballistic missile program, and lifts certain sanctions on the Iranian \nRevolutionary Guard Corps and its leader, like Qasem Soleimani.\n  This is not a partisan or a political statement--this is the grim \nreality of the situation. This deal, as it has been presented to \nCongress and to the American people, will not prevent Iran from \nbecoming a nuclear weapons state. As such, it is incumbent upon us to \nreject this weak and dangerous Iran nuclear agreement this week.\n\n[[Page H5808]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5808-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE LIFE OF FORMER REPRESENTATIVE LOU STOKES\n\n  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I would like to just take a minute to \njoin with Congresswoman Kaptur, with Congresswoman Marcia Fudge, and \nwith Congresswoman Joyce Beatty in honoring the life of Louis Stokes.\n  We attended his funeral a few weeks back, and I just want to say \nthere were so many great stories that came about through his passing--\nfrom his family and from his grandkids, who gave beautiful eulogies, \nstories of their grandfather.\n  This is just to say, when I first got to the United States Congress \nas a young Congressman of 29 years old, it was Congressman Stokes who \nsat in my office, who gave me counsel, who was always there and was \nalways in a good mood, who was always joking and playing around and \nhaving a good time; but he took his job very seriously and took being a \nMember of Congress very seriously.\n  The striking and remarkable thing about him was, no matter how high \nup the ladder he moved, he always had time. Whether it was for a young \nboy or girl in Cleveland or a new Congressman from Youngstown, he had \ntime. He shared his advice, and he shared his counsel. He was such a \nremarkable man.\n  When you think of the word ``gentleman,'' that was Congressman Lou \nStokes. He was a gentle man and, I think, embodied the kind of \ncharacter we want our young men in Ohio to look up to and aspire to be.\n  I wanted to take a minute here on the House floor to thank him for \nall he did for me and all he did for Ohio and all he did for this \ncountry. He was a great man, and he will be missed. Our hearts and our \nprayers go out to him and his family.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5808-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            VOTE FOR NEW AMERICAN LEADERSHIP AND WORLD PEACE\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

Mr. Speaker, in the past year, our Nation has witnessed \nan unspeakable tragedy--a rivalry of law enforcement officers and the \ncommunities they work so hard to protect.\n  From riots in Ferguson and Baltimore to, most recently, the \nindividual targeting and murdering of police officers, our Nation is at \na crossroads.\n  We find ourselves asking:\n  When will the rule of law and those who enforce that law, once again, \nbe respected?\n  How many more violent protests and threatening chants will those who \nbravely wear the badge have to put up with?\n  How much more taunting under the guise of a misleading slogan be \ntolerated before community organizers, prominent African American \nleaders, and Democrats at the city, State, and national levels say \nenough is enough?\n  When will we hear in unison: ``It is not okay to kill police \nofficers''?\n  Mr. Speaker, my colleagues and I are here this evening to honor those \nin uniform who have fallen, but we are also here to call for an end to \nthis violence. We are here to call for the restoration of law and \norder. We are here to call for the protection of the men and women who \nput their lives on the line every single day--the ones who chose a \nprofession to help make their neighborhoods safer.\n  These are not just police officers. They are mothers; they are \nfathers; they are husbands and wives; they are sons and daughters. Mr. \nSpeaker, their lives matter, too, and all lives matter.\n  In God we trust.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                          IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Mr. FITZPATRICK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, a poll of my constituents in \nPennsylvania's Eighth District, one of the true swing districts in this \nHouse, shows that they disapprove of the administration's nuclear deal \nwith Iran by a 2 to 1 margin.\n  These returns are in line with recent national polls showing \nAmericans, as a whole, overwhelmingly disapprove of the agreement by a \nsimilar count, and they have every right to.\n  What we have learned about this deal is that it does not go far \nenough to achieve its ultimate goal, to prevent Iran from getting a \nnuclear weapon. In fact, it would allow just that when it sunsets.\n  In the meantime, ``anytime, anywhere'' inspections of Iranian nuclear \nsites were neutralized to provide up to 24 days' notice prior to any \ninspection.\n  In addition, this deal precipitates a nuclear arms race in the Middle \nEast, a reality we are already seeing, as nations like Egypt, Jordan, \nand Saudi Arabia have already begun building up their nuclear \ninfrastructure in response.\n  The hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions relief provided by \nthis deal will no doubt be used to further fund Tehran's state \nsponsorship of terror.\n  A nation that has a nine-figure line item in the budget to support \nterrorism, like attacks that devastated our Nation on September 11, \n2001, is hard to trust.\n  Unfortunately, what we have is a bad deal, one that makes an already \nvolatile, unstable Middle East less safe, clears the way for a nuclear \nIran, and gravely endangers allies like Israel.\n  I urge my colleagues to disapprove it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5808-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5808]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANTI-TRAFFICKING LAWS MAKE A DIFFERENCE\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, one of the issues that I have been most \npassionate about is stopping the horrific crime of sex trafficking and \nprotecting young victims.\n  Earlier this year Congress took action and passed a package of \nbipartisan bills, including one that I authored aimed at combatting \nthis crime. I said at the time that this legislation would save lives.\n  Madam Speaker, in the short time since these laws have gone into \neffect, we are already seeing results. Recently, a provision in the \nlegislation that allowed local law enforcement to coordinate their \nefforts with the U.S. Marshals Service was used to help find a \nkidnapped Tennessee teenager. The 14-year-old girl was rescued in \nVirginia, and her abductor, a known sex offender, was taken into \ncustody.\n  Madam Speaker, ending human trafficking requires vigilance and a \nbipartisan commitment to ensure that children are safe from those \nwishing to exploit them. The actions we have taken to combat this awful \ncrime are making a difference and saving lives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5808-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5808-H5809]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING ERNIE PELLOW\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Canyon is America's only hardened nuclear chemical separations \nplant still operating, and its dedicated staff play a vital role in our \nNation's history and in the future.\n  During the cold war, H. Canyon was vital for victory, promoting \nnational defense by peace through strength. Today it continues to \nprocess nuclear materials safely and securely and delivers fuels to the \nTennessee Valley Authority.\n  H. Canyon is also a pioneer for the future, developing plutonium-\npowered batteries for the National Aeronautics and Space Administration \nfor deep space exploration.

Madam Speaker, one of the most important votes we will \nmaybe ever do in this House will happen probably later this week. I am \ntalking about the Iran deal.\n  Indeed, the original premise of the Iran nuclear deal was that Iran \nwould be a nuclear-free, nonmilitary nuclear zone. That has already \nbeen conceded to in the deal we will be voting on here soon in the \nHouse and, I guess, over in the Senate as well.\n  This is going to greatly affect the security of our allies like our \ngood, solid ally, Israel, as well as others we do trading with in the \nMiddle East.\n  And if you don't think it affects U.S. homeland, then why does the \ndeal include provisions not only after 5 years for being able to trade \narms on the open market for Iran, but for them to have intercontinental \nballistic missiles within 8 years? What do you do with ICBMs? I will \nguarantee it isn't delivering forget-me-not bouquets to the United \nStates.\n  Our security is on the line in this deal. Seventy-three percent of \nAmericans don't even believe that we can strike a deal with Iran and \nhave them keep their word.\n  The Associated Press--and this is the real kicker--reported here \nrecently that Iran would be self-inspecting, self-reporting on the \ndeal. We can put no faith that they will uphold this deal and that they \nwill adhere to any of the provisions in it.\n  We need to vote ``no'' on this.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5809-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5809-H5815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HONORING FALLEN POLICE OFFICERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. McSally).

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Speaker, last Friday, August 28, 2015, a deputy \nsheriff that protects my neighborhood in Houston, Texas, Harris County \nDeputy Sheriff Darren Goforth, was ambushed and brutally murdered at a \ngas station that my family and I use regularly and that I drive past \nevery day.\n  I knew this good man. He was well known to my neighbors and me as a \nmodel citizen and as a model officer.\n  You could not ask for a kinder, gentler, better law enforcement \nofficer than Darren Goforth. He was murdered in cold blood, \nassassinated by someone whose motives are not completely clear yet.\n  In this atmosphere and this movement of extremist people calling on \nindividuals to attack law enforcement, I wanted to call this Special \nOrder. I want to thank my good friend, Judge Ted Poe, for organizing \nthis Special Order today.\n  We reserved this hour so that the Members of the House can come down \nhere today and express our love and admiration and appreciation for \nevery man and woman who wears the blue and defends our peace, our \nliberty, our property, and our safety on the streets of America.\n  Deputy Goforth was a 10-year veteran of the Harris County Sheriffs \nDepartment. He was a loving husband and a father of two precious \nchildren, ages 5 and 12. He was murdered for one reason: Because he \nwore the uniform. Because he wore the blue to protect us all, to \npreserve our liberty, to protect our homes and our property, he was \nmurdered in cold blood.\n  I went to many of the prayer vigils in the neighborhood. I went to a \nprayer vigil at the gas station where he was murdered, and I went to a \nservice last Friday. Our minister, Dr. Ed Young of Second Baptist \nChurch, conducted the service. It was overwhelming emotionally.\n  It was overwhelming and, also, encouraging to see the tremendous \noutpouring of support from the people of Houston, from the people of \nTexas, from people all over America, who showed up to express their \nlove and admiration and support for the men and\n\n[[Page H5810]]\n\nwomen in law enforcement who protect us every single day. It was an \noutpouring of support like I don't think the people of Houston have \nseen for a long, long time.\n  Dr. Young's service was particularly compelling as he pointed out \nthat the only prayer that Jesus taught us in the brief time he was here \nwith us on Earth was the Lord's Prayer.\n  Dr. Young pointed out that the Lord's Prayer concludes, as we all \nknow, with ``deliver us from evil.'' In that ``deliver us from evil,'' \nas Dr. Young pointed out, the word ``deliver'' actually means \n``shield'' in Greek.\n  Dr. Young pointed out that the temple priests in Christ's time all \nwore blue as a symbol of the protection that they afforded to the \ntemple-goers from evil and that Christ's robe was blue and it was \nappropriate that the men and women who protect us every day wear blue \nand we need to remember that they are there to shield us from evil.\n  There is no other job in America that you can go to work and might \nnot come home because of the threat that you face when you are willing \nto step in front of a bullet or take that risk on yourself in defense \nof your neighbors and your friends.\n  As Dr. Young pointed out in that service, the good thing to come from \nthis is that the people of Texas, the people of Houston, really, the \npeople of America--and that is demonstrated by my colleagues being here \nwith us today on the floor--have all stepped forward to let the law \nenforcement community know that we are there for them, we love them, we \nare praying for them, and that we have got their back.\n  In fact, one of the members of Second Baptist told Dr. Young and his \nstaff that, shortly after this terrible murder of Deputy Goforth, he \nspotted a law enforcement officer filling his gas tank at a \nneighborhood gas station. As the officer was looking over his shoulder \nnervously, the member of Second Baptist walked up to the officer and \nsaid, ``Don't worry, Officer. I have got your back.''\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  A concealed carry permit holder--and as so many of our constituents \nand neighbors in Texas are concealed carry permit holders--law \nenforcement knows that a concealed carry permit holder is their best \nfriend.\n  The message that I want to make sure that every law enforcement \nofficer in the country hears tonight from myself and my colleagues and \nfrom the people of Texas and America, for every law enforcement officer \nout there: We love you. We are proud of you. We are praying for you and \nyour family, and most of all, we got your back.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Bishop), my \ngood friend and colleague.\n\n\n                    Honoring Michael Byron Tabb, Sr.\n\n  Mr. BISHOP of Georgia. Madam Speaker, I want to commend the gentleman \nand all of my colleagues for coming tonight in support of law \nenforcement.\n  The Good Book tells us that greater love hath no man but that he lay \ndown his life for his friends. That is what our law enforcement, our \nfirst responders, our public safety personnel do for us each and every \nday, 24/7, all across this country. For that, we are so grateful.\n  They are Black; they are White; they are young; they are seasoned; \nthey are male, and they are female. In my community in Columbus, \nGeorgia, we have had all of them to give their last full measure of \ndevotion in defense of our communities, to keep us safe at night, so I \ncommend my colleagues for that.\n  I thank my colleague so much for allowing me to invade this Special \nOrder to give a special tribute to one of my constituents who passed \naway during our break.\n  It is with a heavy heart, Madam Speaker, and in solemn remembrance \nthat I rise today to pay tribute to a respected community leader, an \noutstanding citizen, Michael Byron Tabb, Sr.\n  Sadly, Mike passed away on Monday, August 17, 2015, and funeral \nservices were held Saturday, August 22, at 11 a.m. at the Milford \nBaptist Church in Leary, Georgia.\n  Mike Tabb was born in Albany, Georgia, and graduated from Baker \nCounty High School. He earned a bachelor's degree in secondary \neducation and minored in biology at Valdosta State College, now \nValdosta State University.\n  He was a teacher and a coach from 1967 until 1974 and a farmer from \n1974 to 1986. He then served as the managing editor for the Camilla \nEnterprise from 1987 until 1993 and wrote the column ``Plantation \nPete.''\n  From 1993 to 2012, Mike worked at the Camilla Housing Authority as \ngrant and public relations coordinator and program coordinator. \nFollowing his retirement, he continued to work part time with Community \nVentures, a nonprofit corporation that serves the community in various \nways, including building homes.\n  He was instrumental in obtaining grants totaling nearly $15 million \nand contracts with the department of human resources to match welfare \nclients with employment opportunities. He helped organize youth \ndevelopment activities in 20 counties and acquired funding to construct \nhousing for low-to-moderate-income citizens.\n  He was widely known by everybody as a driving force in the community. \nHe served as chairman of the Baker Commission, chairman of the Mitchell \nCounty Children and Youth Collaborative, chairman of the board of \ndirectors of the Mitchell-Baker Association for Retarded Citizens, \nchairman of the Baker County Historical Society, and chairman of the \nAdvisory Committee for South Georgia Judicial Circuit Indigent Defense \nProgram.\n  He was also a member of the Mitchell County Children and Youth Family \nConnection Corporate Board, Baker County Family Connection, Mitchell \nCounty Hospital Authority, and the Southwest Georgia Workforce \nInvestment Board.\n  He was instrumental in forming the first volunteer Baker County EMS \nand was an avid historian, playing a critical role in the publishing of \nthe Baker County history book and cemetery book.\n  He was a resolute steward of Christ's message, and he taught Sunday \nschool for over 35 years at Milford Baptist Church. His faith and \nspirituality always reminded those around him of the power of love and \nfellowship through Christ and the church.\n  Mike has accomplished much in his life, but none of it would have \nbeen possible without the love and support of his wife, Karin; his \nchildren; grandchildren; and great-grandchildren.\n  Madam Speaker, my wife, Vivian, and I, along with the more than \n730,000 people of the Second Congressional District, salute Mike Byron \nTabb for his dedicated service to his community.\n  I ask my colleagues in the House of Representatives to join us in \nextending our deepest sympathies to Mike's family, friends, and loved \nones during this difficult time. We pray that they will be consoled and \ncomforted by an abiding faith and the Holy Spirit in the days, weeks, \nand months ahead.\n  I thank my colleague for yielding to me. It was very special. I, \nagain, commend him for standing up and expressing our appreciation for \nAmerica's law enforcement, the men and women who protect us day in and \nday out.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, Sanford. I know the State of Georgia loves \nand admires law enforcement as much as we do.\n  I am privileged to yield to my neighbor and colleague from Texas, \nJudge Ted Poe.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, peace officers are really the last \nstrand of wire in defense between the fox and the chickens. They are \nthe ones that stand between the lawful and the lawless. They protect us \nfrom outlaws. Sometimes, they do so without much appreciation from the \npublic.\n  Friday, about 11,000 people or more gathered for the funeral of \nDeputy Darren Goforth at the Second Baptist Church in Houston, Texas. \nMany hundreds of others couldn't get in to any of the service. It was \ntelevised live on all four networks. Helicopters flew over during the \nservice. It was hot, and people stood and gave appreciation to this \nman.\n  He was married to Kathleen. They had two children, Ava and Ryan. Ava \nis 5, and Ryan is 12. He had been a Harris County deputy sheriff for 10 \nyears. I guess every member of the sheriff's department was at that \nfuneral.\n  There were police officers from all over the United States there. \nThere were some from Canada and the United Kingdom. I talked to a \npolice officer\n\n[[Page H5811]]\n\nfrom Connecticut who was in Houston for this funeral. He was stunned in \na way of appreciation for the people and other peace officers that came \nfor this man's funeral.\n  It affected the whole community and still does to a great degree for \na lot of reasons. In my other life, I was a prosecutor and a judge at \nthe criminal courts building in Houston. I prosecuted people who killed \npeace officers, and I tried cases where peace officers had been killed \nwhen I was a judge. It is a grim thing that happens when a peace \nofficer is murdered in the line of duty.\n  As my colleague, Mr. Culberson, pointed out, Darren Goforth was \ngetting gasoline at a local gas station he stopped at regularly and was \nfilling up his patrol car 2 weeks ago. An assassin came up from behind \nhim and shot him in the back of the head.\n  He kept shooting. He finally emptied his clip, and 15 times, Deputy \nGoforth was shot in the back of the head. The assassin fled but was \nlater captured, and a man is charged with capital murder.\n  There seems to be an environment in America that police officers are \nbeing targeted. We will leave that for a different discussion. These \nare real people. They do what most of us would never do. They go out \nand protect and serve us. Police officers have been referred to as the \nthin blue line.\n  As mentioned earlier, blue is a traditional color that peace officers \nwear. They also wear a badge or a star, a star in Texas for deputy \nsheriffs and Texas Rangers, a badge for local police officers. They \nplace that over their heart, symbolic of the shield that protects us \nfrom the lawless.\n  They do that all over the country. That is why the badge or the star \nis placed in that location. The badge, the star, it really represents \neverything that is good and right about law and order and America.\n  When a person, a peace officer is murdered, it affects all of us. It \nwas encouraging to me and I think other peace officers to see the \ncommunity support for Darren Goforth; his wife, Kathleen; Ava; and \nRyan.\n  A lot of stories were told about this wonderful person. Being a \npolice officer was his second career. He loved working on cars. He \nwanted to make them run, old cars--muscle cars, as we called them in my \nday.\n  He had recently bought his son, Ryan, a Captain America T-shirt, and \nhe bought himself one. They didn't have time to wear it, but at the \nfuneral, Ryan, his son, under his suit, wore his Captain America T-\nshirt. Deputy Goforth was buried in his, underneath his uniform. He was \na marvelous individual, a brave and good guy.\n  The community not only attended the funeral and watched it on TV. As \nthe processional left the church, led by I don't know how many police \nofficers on motorcycles and then you had the Patriot Guard motorcycle \nriders and other motorcycle groups at the end of the parade going \nthrough the Houston area to the cemetery, people stood on the side of \nthe road, put their hand over their heart.\n  A lot of money has been raised for Darren Goforth's family. At the \nlocation where he was murdered, a Chevron station, people are still \nputting up flowers and tributes.\n  As my colleague said, apparently, on more than one occasion, peace \nofficers have been filling up their patrol cars--and in Houston, patrol \nofficers, Houston officers and county officers, travel alone; there is \nnot two in a car--but while they have been filling up their patrol \ncars, apparently, on more than one occasion, some citizen has stopped, \ncome up to the officer, and said, ``I got your back,'' and that was \nreally the message.\n  In our area, in the Houston area, we are saddened by what happened to \nthis individual, but I think it is true that the community, like that \nConnecticut officer said, like no other place, is very supportive of \npeace officers, their families, and what they do and that we do have \ntheir back. The community supports them.\n  We mourn with the family; we mourn with all peace officers who have \nlost a brother peace officer, but we are also resolved and resilient \nthat, in the future, we are going to have their back because respecting \nand upholding the rule of law is what these men and women do, and we \nshould support them in that effort.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Dr. Young looked at that young family and said: I want \nyou to know that your father, your husband, did not die in vain because \nhe has steeled the resolve of this Nation to stand behind every man and \nwoman in uniform that defends our liberty and our safety on the streets \nof America.\n  I am proud to yield to my colleague from Texas, Dr. Babin.\n  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas not only \nfor yielding, but for getting this Special Order together on such a \nspecial issue.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today to honor the life of Harris County Deputy \nSheriff Darren Goforth and all of America's law enforcement officers. \nOn Friday, August 28, Deputy Goforth was ambushed and murdered while \nrefueling his patrol car in Houston, Texas.\n  I am proud to represent a portion of the city. Deputy Goforth was a \ncommitted 10-year veteran of the police force, a proud husband, and the \nfather of two.\n  Tragically, his life was cut short for one simple reason: his \nuniform. It is hard to express my outrage and my contempt for those who \nhave incited this war of hatred and violence toward our Nation's law \nenforcement officers.\n  Police officers take an oath to protect and to serve, and it is time \nthey receive the same level of commitment and protection in return.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  In August alone, we have lost five other police officers. In 2015, we \nhave seen 24 law enforcement officers gunned down. These brave men and \nwomen put their lives on the line every single day for our communities \nand for the safety of our families. They deserve our support and our \nrespect, and it is a travesty that this situation has gotten to this \npoint.\n  This is not an issue of whose life matters most. This is a matter of \nright and of wrong. And what we have seen in recent weeks is absolutely \nwrong, and it must end now.\n  Our community and elected leaders, starting with the President of the \nUnited States, must stand up for what is right and denounce the hatred \nbeing directed at our law enforcement personnel in this country.\n  I, personally, could not be more thankful and proud of the men and \nwomen who police our communities. Last week, I was honored to join in a \ncommunity celebration of the men and women in blue of Tyler County, \nTexas, my home--and all over America, as a matter of fact.\n  We also gathered together in Jasper County, Texas, on Saturday to \nhonor and rally support for America's first responders; and this week, \nmuch of my staff, while I am up here serving in Congress, will be \nattending an event recognizing the law enforcement personnel of Hardin \nCounty, Texas.\n  Our law enforcement officers have a very difficult job, and it is a \nshame that the violent rhetoric of a very few are putting their lives \nat greater risk.\n  During this difficult time, I, along with an overwhelming majority of \nAmericans, stand in strong solidarity with our law enforcement officers \nand offer them and their families our unwavering commitment, attention, \nand support.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, Dr. Babin.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to my colleague from California (Mr. Valadao) \nto speak on behalf of his constituents and the people of California of \ntheir love and respect for our law enforcement officers.\n  Mr. VALADAO. I thank my colleague from Texas for hosting this and \nallowing me the opportunity to speak.\n  Madam Speaker, my background is, as many of you know and I spoke of \nmany times, I am a farmer from California. One of the things that I \nhave had the opportunity of--and sometimes not always the best \nopportunity, but I have had a lot of opportunities--is to deal with law \nenforcement; metal thieves, different folks breaking into houses and \ndoing different types of things.\n  I remember one specific night where we had a person trespassing, and \nI showed up and it was dark, 10, 11 at night. I drove up in the middle \nof the field, had no idea if there was someone behind me, someone \ncoming up behind me or on the side of me. It was just a\n\n[[Page H5812]]\n\nreally scary feeling to think that I just drove up on this situation. \nHow many people are out here? What are their intentions?\n  Now, obviously, I called 911, and when the police showed up, they run \ninto these situations on a daily basis.\n  But the fear that I felt, knowing that there were people out there \nclose to me who could have been there for a really, really bad reason, \nlooking to do someone harm, is something that I just couldn't imagine \ndoing on a daily basis.\n  My wife and I are friends with some law enforcement folks in my \ndistrict, people I grew up with, as my wife did as well. When you look \nback--and we have had dinners with these folks--and you talk to their \nspouse or you talk to their kids, you know that their husbands, their \nwives go into these situations on a daily basis. They have to run out \nthere, jump into a situation where they know there is someone out there \nthat could have a gun, could have a weapon, could look to do these \npeople harm. They are the ones that we always call for backup. They are \nthe ones that we always call when there is a desperate situation. And \nthese people are the ones that are being threatened now, today.\n  There are so many people out there that put so much into their work. \nBut when you look at what our law enforcement does for us, every time \nwe dial 911, every time we call for help, every time that we have got a \nsituation that is out of our control, they are the people that step in, \nwithout any fear for their own lives, and step up and do what we need \nthem to do.\n  To see what has happened, especially now in Texas and other parts of \nthe country, where these people are being ambushed, where our \nprotectors, those who keep our families safe, are being attacked from \nbehind, is just something that is unimaginable.\n  The fact that we have got a group of Members here today, and I know \nso many more, stepping up and supporting those who do so much for us is \nsomething I am thrilled to be a part of, and it is an honor.\n  So, again, I want to thank all of those who put on the badge and step \nup to protect us, each and every one of us all throughout the country. \nSo again, thank you for what you do.\n  Thank you, Mr. Chairman, for allowing me this opportunity.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, David.\n  I think it is so important for each and every one of us, if we get an \nopportunity, we run across a law enforcement officer, just walk up and \ntell them how much we love them and appreciate them and that we have \ngot their back.\n  I am delighted to yield to my colleague from northeastern Louisiana \n(Mr. Abraham) to express the feeling of his constituents about law \nenforcement.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Congressman, for having this Special Order on \nsuch a somber occasion.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today to offer my support and utmost respect \nfor law enforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect \nour communities, as well as to applaud these men and women who take \npart in their selfless actions every day.\n  We sleep safely at night because we know the men and women who wear \nthe badges are on the streets looking out for us. They look out for our \nfamilies. They look out for our communities, for our country, and words \ncannot convey how grateful we are to them.\n  This year, there have been too many reminders that too many of our \nofficers are paying the ultimate sacrifice in the name of service. They \nrisk everything to protect us, and they deserve our utmost respect.\n  Unfortunately, my State of Louisiana has lost nine officers in the \nline of duty this year, one of the most in the Nation, according to the \nNational Law Enforcement Officers Memorial Fund. This is a statistic I \nam not proud of, and I will continue to do all in my power to ensure \nthat all officers in the Nation are safe.\n  I want to thank those men and women who have sacrificed for Louisiana \nand for the Nation.\n  We must always remember that the vast majority of law enforcement \nofficers serve because they want to make their community and their \ncountry better places, and for that we are very grateful.\n  We must always remember that these officers step out each day in the \nface of uncertainty. They never know what situation they will encounter \nand when a routine traffic stop could turn very tragic.\n  Thank you, officers, for putting your lives on the line for our \nsafety. Thank you for answering the call to serve and to protect \nLouisiana and the country.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege to yield to a \ncolleague from northeast Texas, Congressman John Ratcliffe.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. I thank my friend and colleague from Texas for holding \nthis Special Order and for yielding.\n  Madam Speaker, ``to protect and serve,'' those words are much more \nthan just a slogan on the side of police cars across this country. It \nis a promise, a promise that our men and women in blue fulfill on a \ndaily basis while they serve to uphold the pillars of law and order \nthat our society depends on. Without their work, without their \nsacrifice, our communities would be lawless, and our families, our \nfriends, our neighbors, our loved ones would all be in constant \njeopardy.\n  Thousands of police officers go to work each day knowing the danger, \nknowing that they may have to pay the ultimate sacrifice to provide us \nwith security. Officers like Deputy Goforth of Texas have been targeted \nfor execution and have paid the ultimate price simply because they \nchoose to protect our communities.\n  The recent wave of violence against our peace officers simply because \nthey wear a uniform is outrageous. It is appalling, and it must end.\n  Madam Speaker, I will continue to stand with our law enforcement, and \nI want to personally thank the men and women in law enforcement in the \nFourth Congressional District of Texas that I am privileged to \nrepresent.\n  I want to thank those Texas peace officers who have reached out to me \npersonally to express their concerns on this issue, like Mike Sullivan \nin Farmersville, Otis Henry in Sherman, Terry Garrett in Heath, Harold \nEavenson in Rockwall, Jay Burch in Denison, and Daniel Shiner in \nTexarkana.\n  Thanks to you all. Thanks to all the men and women who serve in law \nenforcement and serve our communities. You are appreciated. We are \ngrateful.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, John.\n  Madam Speaker, we are here from every corner of the United States to \ntell our men and women in uniform who risk their lives every day to \nprotect us and the safety of our families and our homes how much we \nappreciate them and love them and we are praying for them and we have \ngot their back.\n  It is a privilege to yield to my good friend and colleague from \nMinnesota, Congressman Tom Emmer.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding and having this Special Order tonight. It is important that we \nallow time to acknowledge the brave men and women who serve as police \nofficers throughout our country.\n  During the August district work period, I had the opportunity to \nparticipate in an event to memorialize and honor a fallen officer from \nMinnesota, Officer Tommy Decker. Tommy was an amazing individual who \ndedicated his life to serving the Cold Spring community in central \nMinnesota.\n  On Thursday, November 29, 2012, while conducting a welfare check, \nTommy was ambushed and taken from this world far too soon. At the young \nage of 31, Tommy had already given 10 years of his life to serve his \ncommunity.\n  My predecessor, Michele Bachmann, worked tirelessly to ensure that \nTommy received the recognition he so greatly deserved, and 2 weeks ago \nwe dedicated the Cold Spring Post Office in the name of Officer Tommy \nDecker, a man who gave his life to the Cold Spring community.\n  I was privileged to participate in the ceremony on behalf of \nMinnesota's Sixth Congressional District and to continue the great work \nthat Michele began. We now have this lasting reminder of Tommy, his \nservice, and his great heroism to his community.\n  We try to thank our military veterans and the servicemen and -women \nin uniform as much as possible for their work and sacrifice to protect \nour freedoms and keep us safe. We should do the same for our men and \nwomen in police uniforms.\n\n[[Page H5813]]\n\n  Police are courageous and selfless servants in our communities. They \npatrol our streets to keep us safe. Perhaps now more than ever, they \nnot only deserve but need our acknowledgement, support, and \nencouragement.\n  Every day, police officers across this country go to work not knowing \nwhat they are going to encounter, all the while knowing that, \nregardless, it is their duty to, quite literally, serve and protect.\n  Tommy and all of the men and women who proudly wear their police \nuniforms are looked up to by many, and we all owe them so much.\n  Thank you to all of our police officers across the United States. We \npray for your safe return home tonight and every night.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Speaker, it is important that the law \nenforcement community know that, while we are waiting to hear from the \nPresident of the United States, the Members of Congress are stepping \nforward tonight from every corner of the country to express our love \nand support for our law enforcement community.\n  I am privileged at this time to yield to my colleague from \nCalifornia's 25th District, Congressman Steve Knight.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Madam Speaker, I appreciate Mr. Culberson putting this \ntogether and allowing us time to talk about our heroes on the street.\n  During your shift as a police officer or as a sheriff's deputy, you \ngo into roll call or you go into briefing and start your day with info \nor assignments. You check out your equipment. You go over and you get \nin your car. You go to the gas pumps and you fill up the gas. And you \nmight talk to some of the other officers or the other deputies about \nwhat is happening on the street or what happened the night before, and \nyou start your day.\n  Your day might start off with talking to your partner and trying to \nfind out a little bit more about them if you don't know them, because \nthat happens on a day-to-day basis--new officers are put in with \nofficers every day--just trying to find out what your thoughts are, \nwhat your tactics are, what your training is, and how you feel like you \nare going to feel out these situations. This is the start of a police \nofficer's day.\n  For 18 years I was a Los Angeles police officer, and I served on the \nfront lines in a police car for 17 of those 18 years. So, as they say, \nI was out pushing the sled around for 12 hours a day, snooping and \npooping, looking for bad guys, and protecting and serving. On the side \nof my car, that is exactly what it said, ``to protect and to serve.'' \nThat is what a police officer does.\n  It is not like the shows that you see on TV. Some of it is boring \ntime, some of it is high adrenalin, but all of it is service to the \ncommunity. Every second, every minute of your shift is service to the \ncommunity.\n  So if we are out there enforcing the law, making a traffic stop, \nmaking an arrest, or just, as 1-Adam-12 used to do, go and respond to a \n``see the man,'' ``see the woman,'' and help and just serve, that is a \nday-to-day.\n  I didn't know Deputy Goforth, but I feel like he was a brother in \narms because he was. He was someone who went out and served his \ncommunity, served them with honor, served them with integrity. And I am \nsure that the community is better for his years of service.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  I am sure over the next decade or generations that they won't forget \nDeputy Goforth's commitment to the community. There will be a memorial. \nThere will be a yearly service. People will talk about what he meant to \nthe community.\n  I was in the 990 class in LAPD. The very first female officer who \ndied in the line of duty for LAPD was in the 590 class. Our class was \ntaken out of its normal duty of going and learning how to be a \nprofessional law enforcement officer, and we went to the service for \nthat officer.\n  Tina Kerbrat was the very first female officer who died in LAPD, and \nit was very similar to Deputy Goforth. It was basically a shooting, an \nassassination.\n  This will always stay with you when you go to a law enforcement \nofficer's funeral. You will never forget it. You will see the thousands \nof people.\n  Just like many of the Members said today, the thousands of people \nthat came from other departments all over the country, all over the \nworld, come to pay their respects to the law enforcement professional \nwho did everything that they could to protect their community.\n  My squadron leader in my academy class died in Afghanistan. He was a \nlaw enforcement officer with LAPD who was a SWAT officer. He did his \nduty, went to Afghanistan to fight for our ideals and for our morals \nwith the United States Marine Corps. He died in Afghanistan doing the \nsame thing that he would do on a 24-hour-a-day basis, protecting what \nwe believe here in America.\n  I am honored to be able to stand and talk about our heroes on the \nstreet, talk about the people who protect our community on a day-to-day \nbasis, put their lives on the line so that we can live the life that we \nchoose.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Steve, thank you for your service to the people of Los \nAngeles and California.\n  I think, as Congressman Knight said, it is so important to remember \nthat these young men and women are serving their community. They do it \nout of the goodness of their heart and the love for their neighbors, to \nhelp their fellow man to try to make their communities a better place.\n  God bless you. Thank you for your service.\n  I am proud to have with us tonight the congressman from the Ninth \nDistrict of North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger) to express the feelings of \nthe people of North Carolina that he represents about law enforcement.\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Thank you. I am so grateful that the gentleman from \nTexas took the leadership in honoring and paying tribute to those who \ndefend and protect us in our own communities.\n  Madam Speaker, tonight I can think of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police \nOfficers Harlan Proctor, Ashley Brown, and Scott Evett who, in the \naftermath of a horrific domestic violence homicide and arson earlier \nthis year, used their own time and their own money to purchase clothes \nand toys for the children left behind. They never expected to get any \ntype of recognition.\n  Madam Speaker, I think of my friend Detective Shane Page, who \nvolunteered for the Violent Criminal Apprehension Team, who was shot \nand seriously wounded while attempting to arrest a dangerous suspect \nwho was hiding out in a quiet neighborhood.\n  Earlier this year I met Cornelius Police Lieutenant James Quattlebaum \nat Carolinas Medical Center. He had just been shot earlier that day \nwhile responding to a domestic disturbance.\n  And Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Lieutenant Nate King was conducting \nroutine police business last year when a frantic mother drove up and \nplaced a lifeless baby in his arms. The 6-month-old baby was choking to \ndeath. But thanks to Lieutenant King's lifesaving efforts, the little \ngirl made a full recovery.\n  Every day thousands of brave superheroes go to work to serve and \nprotect our children, our homes, and our communities. The pay is low. \nThe hours are long. They are often screamed at. They are hit. They are \nspit upon and even bitten. Yet, they show back up for work each and \nevery day. Would we?\n  Madam Speaker, we should encourage greater dialogue between our local \npolice departments and the community, and we should encourage the best \npossible training. We should demand accountability because no one is \nabove the law.\n  However, we should also teach our children to have a healthy respect \nfor law enforcement and work hard to recognize the bravery and everyday \ngood deeds of America's law enforcement. We expect them to be at their \nbest when we are at our worst.\n  Thank you to America's law enforcement, who are truly committed to \nboth serve and to protect.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Robert, thank you very much.\n  We are still waiting, Mr. President, for you to step up and tell \nAmerica how proud you are of our law enforcement men and women and to \nhear you condemn, Mr. President, this violent, dangerous rhetoric that \nis encouraging mentally unbalanced people to attack our law enforcement \nofficers, as Deputy Sheriff Goforth was murdered in Houston, Texas.\n\n[[Page H5814]]\n\n  We are still waiting, Mr. President. But while we wait, Members of \nCongress are standing here on the floor tonight to tell America how \nproud we are of our men and women in uniform.\n  I am proud to yield to my colleague and friend from Texas (Mr. \nOlson).\n  Mr. OLSON. I thank my fellow Texan from the Seventh Congressional \nDistrict of Texas, Mr. Culberson.\n  My friends, America has a problem. I have lived here for 52 years and \nI have never heard the word ``assassination'' in the same sentence as \n``police officer'' or ``sheriff's deputy'' as I have in the past 6 \nmonths.\n  Harris County Deputy Sheriff Darren Goforth was assassinated a few \nweeks ago doing his job. As my colleagues mentioned, he was in uniform, \npumping gas at a service station in his sheriff's cruiser in a very \nnice neighborhood in Houston, Texas, and gunned down in cold blood, \nassassinated.\n  The shooter shot and shot and shot and shot and shot and shot and \nshot and shot and shot until Deputy Goforth dropped dead protecting us.\n  He left behind a wife, Kathleen, and two young kids who won't have a \nfather walk them down the aisle when they get married.\n  I want to go up there to the site of the assassination and pray with \nfellow Texans. I took this picture yesterday at the Chevron gas \nstation.\n  As you can see, there are flowers everywhere and notes and stuffed \nanimals, little stuffed teddy bears. This was replayed over and over \nand over. That was just one day.\n  And right on the sidewalk are all sorts of colored chalk with \nmessages for Deputy Sheriff Goforth. ``Darren Goforth, we love you,'' \n``Thank you,'' ``Rest in peace.''\n  I felt rejuvenated about America at that moment, but it got better.\n  I am coming home to Sugar Land, Texas. That is my neighborhood. It is \nat Alcorn Oaks Drive and Oakland Drive in my hometown.\n  These are six amazing young Texans with a lemonade stand for police. \nIt says ``Blue lives matter.'' These kids get it. They get it. They get \nit. We should love and praise our officers and thank them, thank them, \nthank them for their sacrifice.\n  I have to mention, too, my friend, I bought a glass of lemonade \nthere, the most expensive one I have ever purchased, close to $20.\n  In closing, these men and women protect us every single day from \npeople who want to hurt us and hurt our families. They deserve our \nlove, support, and admiration, and to know that we always have their \nbacks.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Thank you, Pete.\n  It is a privilege to yield to my colleague representing the people of \ncentral Indiana, the Congresswoman from the Fifth District, \nCongresswoman Susan Brooks.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. I want to thank the gentleman from Texas for \nholding this very important Special Order tonight because now, more \nthan ever, it is more important than ever that we recognize and thank \nour Nation's law enforcement officers. These are the loyal and selfless \nmen and women all across America who wake up each and every day and \nserve our community.\n  Madam Speaker, police officers are an integral part of our \ncommunities and our neighborhoods, working every day and at all hours \nto keep us safe. From downtown city blocks to small town squares, from \ncountry roads to busy highways, our Nation's law enforcement officers \nare always there, always ready to serve.\n  As we have heard, they are fathers and brothers, mothers and sisters, \nhusbands, wives, sons, and daughters. Some are friends. Some are \nneighbors. Some are the strangers that we see every day.\n  But we often don't even see them. They are on our morning commutes. \nThey are on our trips to the grocery store. They are all around us.\n  They are fellow citizens who have answered the call to serve and \nprotect and, in some cases, pay the ultimate sacrifice for the safety \nand welfare of those in their communities. They protect their families \nand loved ones, and they protect the lives of complete strangers day in \nand day out.\n  You may not know, but throughout U.S. history, over 20,000 law \nenforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice. Last year four \nHoosiers lost their lives while upholding their vow to serve and \nprotect.\n  And, unfortunately, as we have seen, this has been an incredibly \ndeadly August. Violence against police officers has skyrocketed \nrecently, with six officers being mercilessly gunned down by \nindividuals who neither respect law and order nor the value of human \nlife. These officers' sacrifices as well as that of their families do \nnot go unnoticed or unappreciated.\n  In fact, this August the family of Jake Laird, an officer who was \ngunned down in August of 2004--and we have to think about the \nfamilies--held another golf outing in order to raise money for more \nprotective vests for law enforcement and more personal safety equipment \nfor firefighters.\n  These families--and I have seen them. I have witnessed them \nfirsthand. They are remarkable families. They display courage in the \nface of adversity, compassion in the face of hardship, and an undying \ncommitment to serve the communities in which they live. We must thank \nthem, the families and the officers.\n  So today I salute the men and women in uniform who every day head out \nto the streets. They cover their beats. They patrol their precincts. \nThey take up again without fail the call to serve and protect.\n  We must be thankful for their service and send our thoughts and \nprayers to their loved ones because, without hesitation, we must renew \nour appreciation for and our steadfast commitment to the heroic men and \nwomen who are part of that thin blue line. Please thank a police \nofficer.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 12 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. At this time, it is my privilege to yield to my \ncolleague and good friend representing the people of North Carolina, \nMs. Foxx.\n  Ms. FOXX. I want to thank my colleague from Texas (Mr. Culberson) for \norganizing and conducting this Special Order tonight to honor our law \nenforcement personnel.\n  I do my best every time I see someone in law enforcement to say thank \nyou. I go out of my way to say thank you.\n  I point out to them, whether they are local, State, or national \npeople in law enforcement, that we owe to them and to our military \npeople the ability that we have to move around this country and do the \nthings that we do every day because of their willingness to serve and \nto put their lives on the line every single day of their lives.\n  We have seen, unfortunately, in the past few weeks a spate of \nsenseless killings of our wonderful law enforcement people. And I think \nit is wonderful, again, that my colleagues are here tonight to say \nthank you.\n  I want to encourage them, also--and I know many do--to say thank you \nto our law enforcement people every day as they go about protecting us, \nour families. I want to thank their families, also, for the sacrifices \nthey make.\n  Thank you, Congressman Culberson, for your efforts.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Madam Speaker, it is my privilege now to yield to the \ngentleman from northern California (Mr. LaMalfa), representing the \nFirst District.\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Thank you to my colleague, Mr. Culberson. It is really, \nreally good and proper that you are having this time here tonight, and \nI am glad to be able to join you with that.\n  Madam Speaker, it is amazing to me that we even have to have this \nconversation. It is always a good conversation to have to honor our \nofficers that put their lives on the line in so many aspects of our \nlives, whether it is highway patrol or sheriff or city police, park \nrangers, fish and game. All of them out there have some level of risk \nin order to maintain what it is we want in a free society for our \nsecurity.\n  What is so tragic about what is happening lately is it is coming down \nto a racial issue, so much that the sides are becoming much sharper and \nsharper as to what America is or what Americans are about. We need to \nget together on this. The enforcement of the law, the upholding of the \nlaw, the protection of families, of homes, this cuts across all lines.\n\n[[Page H5815]]\n\n  Indeed, I just saw a bit on the news a few minutes ago here where a \ngentleman in Florida--his name is George Cooper, as I recall; he \nhappens to be Black. He came to the defense of an officer who happens \nto be White who was being beaten in some type of an altercation there \nwhere he was trying to do his job.\n  There are examples where, as the gentleman said in the interview, it \nisn't a race thing, it doesn't matter who is White or who is Black in \nthis thing, it is about upholding the law and about having safe \nneighborhoods for all of us for Americans to be able to thrive.\n  It is tragic that so much is going on trying to pit Americans against \neach other. Yes, we have problems; we have issues that need to be \nresolved within how some may enforce the law, but we have protocols for \nthat. We need to make sure that they are followed and they are \nprosecuted, but it doesn't make the whole aura of law enforcement \nsomehow wrong.\n  Indeed, the effects we are seeing with cities now where cops are \nbacking off, crime rates are going up, murders are going up in some of \nthese cities here dramatically--I heard in one of the cities that it is \n96 percent.\n  This is not what we want. It is not good for the families, for the \nmoms that have to watch their kids go out the door and wonder if they \nare going to come back because there isn't that law enforcement.\n  I want to share with you a piece, though, that I think really \nencapsulates this, by a great American, Paul Harvey, from some years \nago: What are Policemen Made Of?\n\n       A policemen is a composite of what all men are, mingling of \n     a saint and sinner, dust and deity.\n       Gulled statistics wave the fan over the stinkers, \n     underscore instances of dishonesty and brutality because they \n     are ``new.'' What they really mean is that they are \n     exceptional, unusual, not commonplace.\n       Buried under the frost is the fact: Less than one-half of 1 \n     percent of policemen misfit the uniform. That's a better \n     average than you'd find among clergy.\n       What is a policeman made of? He, among all men, is once the \n     most needed and the most unwanted. He's a strangely nameless \n     creature who is ``sir'' to his face and ``pig'' or ``fuzz'' \n     to his back.\n       He must be such a diplomat that he can settle differences \n     between individuals so that each will think he won.\n       But . . . if the policeman is neat, he's conceited; if he's \n     careless, he's a bum. If he's pleasant, he's flirting; if \n     not, he's a grouch.\n       He must make an instant decision which would require months \n     for a lawyer to make.\n       But . . . if he hurries, he's careless; if he's deliberate, \n     he's lazy. He must be first to an accident and infallible \n     with his diagnosis. He must be able to start breathing, stop \n     bleeding, tie splints, and, above all, be sure the victim \n     goes home without a limp. Or expect to be sued.\n       The police officer must know every gun, draw on the run, \n     and hit where it doesn't hurt. He must be able to whip two \n     men twice his size and half his age without damaging his \n     uniform and without being ``brutal.'' If you hit him, he's a \n     coward. If he hits you, he's a bully.\n       A policeman must know everything--and not tell. He must \n     know where all the sin is and not partake.\n       A policeman must, from a single strand of hair, be able to \n     describe the crime, the weapon and the criminal--and tell you \n     where the criminal is hiding.\n       But . . . if he catches the criminal, he's lucky; if he \n     doesn't, he's a dunce. If he gets promoted, he has political \n     pull; if he doesn't, he's a dullard. The policeman must chase \n     a bum lead to a dead-end, stake out 10 nights to tag one \n     witness who saw it happen--but refused to remember.\n       The policeman must be a minister, a social worker, a \n     diplomat, a tough guy, and a gentleman.\n       And, of course, he'd have to be genius...for he will have \n     to feed his family on a policeman's salary.\n\n  This is just a sample of what officers go through across this country \nwhere they, giving of themselves in service many times, especially in \nthis present environment, feel like they are somehow made wrong for \nhaving done so.\n  We are here to uphold that tonight and tell them: You are doing it \nright. We support you and appreciate the thin blue line.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas has 5 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. CULBERSON. Mr. Speaker, I think that Congressman LaMalfa \nexpressed it very well. Police officers are expected to do their job \nperfectly every time and in so many ways that we cannot even imagine \nthe work that they do to help keep us safe, the work that they do to \nimprove our communities, the sacrifices that they make on a personal \nlevel.\n  They are counselors; they are mentors; they are enforcers, and above \nall, they are preservers and protectors of our liberty because, without \nlaw enforcement, there is no liberty. That responsibility is vested in \none person in our Constitution. Only the President of the United States \nis charged by our Founders in the Constitution with faithfully taking \ncare that the law be faithfully executed.\n  We are still waiting, Mr. President. We are still waiting for you to \nstep up, as we are here tonight, to say how proud you are of our men \nand women in blue, who protect us every night and every day and must do \ntheir job perfectly, as Doug LaMalfa just told us, every man and woman \nwho wears the uniform, who would step in front of a bullet for each and \nevery one of us.\n  We are still waiting, Mr. President, for you to condemn the vital \nrhetoric that tell the men and women across this Nation, who defend us \nevery day on the streets of America, how proud you are, Mr. President. \nWe need you to step up and tell them, tell us all, how proud you are of \ntheir sacrifice, of their service, of their dedication, to tell all the \nwidows and the children of Darren Goforth and all the other officers \nwho have lost their lives that their father's loss, their mother's \nloss, their sacrifice was not in vain.\n  As Dr. Ed Young told us all last Friday at 11 a.m., the sacrifice \nthat Darren Goforth made galvanized the people of Houston, the people \nof Texas. We see it across the Nation from California to Missouri to \nIndiana, to the East Coast. The people of America stand behind our law \nenforcement officers.\n  We are proud of you. We love you. We respect you. We recognize what a \nsacrifice you have made for not enough money to protect us. We know all \nthat you do. We understand the burden that you and your family carry.\n  As Kathleen Goforth said in her statement of her late husband:\n\n       There are no words for this. Darren was an incredibly \n     intricate blend of toughness and gentility. He was always \n     loyal, fiercely so. Darren was ethical. The right thing to do \n     is what guided his internal compass.\n\n  She said:\n\n       Darren was good. If people want to know what kind of man he \n     was, this is it. Darren was who you wanted for a friend, a \n     colleague, and a neighbor. However, it was I who was blessed \n     so richly, that I had the privilege of calling him my husband \n     and my best friend.\n\n  We are immensely proud of every man and woman who wears the uniform, \nand we will not forget the sacrifice of Darren Goforth or all the other \nmen and women who preserve our liberty and protect our lives and put \ntheir lives on the line for us every day. We are immensely proud of \nyou.\n  If the President of the United States won't say it, we will here in \nthis House, that we stand behind you, we are proud of you, we pray for \nyou every day, and we have got your back.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Buck). Members are reminded to address \ntheir remarks to the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5815-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.J.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank our Republican colleagues \nfor reminding us that this Nation is dependent upon those men and\n\n[[Page H5816]]\n\nwomen that serve as police officers, as deputy sheriffs, and in other \npositions.\n  Certainly, the deaths that we have seen and the murders that we have \nseen in recent days are a tragedy, and they cannot go without our \nnotice. I appreciate it.\n  I don't, however, think it is the President's fault, so let us move \non here.\n  I want to talk about something that is coming up here in the next \ncouple of days, an extremely important issue for all of us. While \nviolence in America and violence against police officers are important \nissues, this issue is also extremely important.\n  The Congress of the United States is going to take up the issue of \nthe Iran deal, the nuclear deal between the P5+1--China, Russia, \nGermany, France, United Kingdom, and the United States--negotiated over \nthe course of 2-plus years an agreement with Iran that would block \nIran's ability to create a nuclear weapon.\n  Prior to this agreement, the Iranian Government, in secret, was \nrapidly moving towards the development of a nuclear weapon. They had \ncreated an infrastructure that included the various centrifuges to \nconcentrate the uranium into low-enriched uranium and then on into \nhighly enriched uranium, which is the uranium that is necessary for a \nnuclear weapon.\n  They are also in the process of building a heavy water reactor that \nwould be capable of producing plutonium, the other route to a nuclear \nweapon. This was done in secret over many years, dating back probably \n15, maybe even 20 years.\n  For the last 10 years, the United States has placed sanctions on Iran \nto try to convince them that they should not be developing a nuclear \nweapon, that there would be significant economic sanctions and other \nsanctions imposed on the country.\n  Those sanctions did not go successfully. The Congress of the United \nStates added sanctions. I, together with many of my colleagues here, I \nthink almost unanimously on the floor of the House voted to impose \nthose ever harsher sanctions, but it didn't work until the P5+1 got \ntogether.\n  Secretary Clinton at that time, 3 years ago, 4 years ago, worked with \nthose countries, persuading them to sit down at the table together with \nthe United States to see if it was possible to negotiate an agreement \nwith Iran that would prevent Iran from ever having a nuclear weapon. \nThis spring, the agreements began to come together, and in June, July, \nthe agreements were culminated.\n  I want to talk tonight about those agreements and what they mean to \nthe United States, to the Middle East, and to the world. The very short \nway of saying this is that this agreement is the most recent and the \nmost significant nonnuclear proliferation agreement in the last decade, \nmaybe even longer.\n  Iran was very, very close to a nuclear weapon, so much so that it was \nbelieved that they could have a nuclear weapon very soon. Perhaps in 3 \nto 5 months, they could have material for perhaps nine weapons and be \nable to perfect those weapons into a bomb that could be delivered \nthrough their missile systems or through some mechanism.\n  Where are we today? We are going to vote. As I understand, I think \nthere is a rule that just came across the desk a few moments ago that \nwould put us in line to vote up or down on the Iranian agreement, and I \nunderstand that that vote will be taking place on Friday of this week--\na very, very significant moment in the history of nuclear proliferation \nor nonproliferation.\n  Let's take a look at where we are. First, the agreement came about as \na result of six nations, the largest economies in the world, sitting \ndown and negotiating with Iran.\n  What did those countries think about the deal that they signed onto?\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  This isn't just the United States. This deal was signed onto by the \nUnited Kingdom, France, Germany, Russia, China, and the United States.\n  So, if the United States Congress--the House and the Senate--were to \ntrash this agreement, what do those countries think?\n  We don't have to guess what they think. They actually have said, \ncategorically, their position on the deal, and their position is clear. \nWe signed onto it, they said. We agreed to this deal, and here is what \nwe think if the United States Congress negates this deal.\n  Let's start with the French. Frederic Dore, the French Embassy Deputy \nChief of Mission, said this in meetings with the United States Senate--\nand I understand that we will be meeting with the representatives of \nthese countries later this week.\n  The position of the French is: World powers have secured the best \ndeal possible with Iran.\n  The best deal possible.\n  All right. How about Germany?\n  The German Government's position is--as stated by Philipp Ackermann, \nthe Acting German Ambassador to the United States, before the U.S. \nSenate and, again, in the Foreign Policy magazine, on August 6, 2015--\nthe prospect of the rejection of a deal makes us nervous. It would be a \nnightmare for every European country if this deal is rejected.\n  Then there is the United Kingdom, again, in the Foreign Policy \nmagazine, on August 6, in words similar to this, or, perhaps, these \nexact words were said to the U.S. Senate a couple of weeks ago:\n  If Congress rejects this good deal and the U.S. is forced to walk \naway, Iran will be left with an unconstrained nuclear program with far \nweaker monitoring arrangements than the current international consensus \non sanctions, and the current international consensus on sanctions \nwould unravel, and international unity and pressure on Iran would be \nseriously undermined.\n  The P5+1 all signed onto the agreement, and all but the United States \nhas said categorically: Therefore, the agreement. They are not looking \nto renegotiate, only the United States. So it is up to us, the Members \nof Congress, to decide whether to stay with the agreement that was \nnegotiated by the United States Government and five other countries and \nconfirmed by the European Union and the United Nations.\n  So where do we go?\n  Let's assume for a moment that the Senate and the House reject the \ndeal. Will these countries come back to the negotiating table?\n  The information we have from the meeting with the United States \nSenators--and all of these countries were there--was, no, they are not \ngoing to go back to the negotiating table. I think I said ``all of \nthese countries.'' I don't think China and Russia were at that meeting. \nYet the word is that they are not going to go back to the negotiating \ntable, so we would have to negotiate by ourselves. Keep in mind that we \nattempted to do that for many, many years without any success. It was \nonly when all of these countries got together that the sanctions really \nhit Iran in such a way that they decided to come to the table and to \nmake the agreement which is now before the Congress.\n  Let's go about that deal. What is it? This is basically what it is \nhere.\n  The deal blocks for at least 15 years--and, quite possibly, \nindefinitely into the future--Iran's ability to develop a nuclear \nweapon.\n  I am going to come back to this timeline, but I want to go here \nfirst.\n  So no deal. Without a deal. If the United States Congress this week \nand next week vote to do away with the deal, then where are we?\n  Iran has sufficient low enriched uranium and the ability to further \nenrich that uranium to highly enriched uranium--in other words, weapons \ngrade uranium--for approximately nine nuclear bombs. The number of \ncentrifuges that they presently have are some 19,000 centrifuges, and \nthat would be used to complete the enrichment process. Then the time to \nproduce a bomb's worth of material--highly enriched uranium--is a \ncouple of months, 2 or 3 months.\n  Presumably, under the present situation, with no deal, Iran would be \nable to move forward, as they have been in the past, for the full \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons within a matter of months. That is not a \ngood situation.\n  However, with a deal, where are we?\n  Iran's low enriched uranium and what amount of highly enriched \nuranium they have would be significantly reduced to an amount that \nwould be insufficient to make even one nuclear\n\n[[Page H5817]]\n\nweapon, and there would be verification procedures to assure that they \nwould not be able to make any additional nuclear weapons. The number of \ncentrifuges that they would be able to have are old, antiquated, and \nwould be some 6,000-plus, and all four pathways to a nuclear bomb are \nblocked. That is the choice we have. That is the choice we have.\n  Now, what does this mean over time?\n  Over time, for a long time--25 years or more--the implementation of \nadditional protocols, commitments to reprocess plutonium, and the \nnonproliferation treaty obligations remain in place indefinitely into \nthe future--way beyond 25 years. So, as for the nonproliferation \ntreaty, they have upped it once more. They have agreed to it again. \nNow, granted, they weren't paying attention to it in the past, but now \nwe have verification procedures.\n  Secondly, there would be continuous surveillance of uranium mines and \nmills so that we know what they are doing. Are they mining uranium? \nWhat are they doing with it? What are their mills doing? That would \ncontinue for 25 years.\n  There would be continued surveillance of centrifuge production for 20 \nyears. Now, you don't make highly enriched uranium in procedures other \nthan centrifuges unless you go to some very, very advanced procedures, \nwhich we do not believe Iran can do, and those procedures that are \ncurrently available to Iran and would be into the future are monitored \nfor 20 years.\n  The low enriched stockpile, which is several thousand kilograms, \nwould be reduced and capped at 300 kilograms, and there would be no \nfurther enrichment for new highly enriched uranium beyond a very, very \nsmall amount for research purposes; and the heavy water reactor that \ncould produce plutonium within a matter of a couple of years would be, \nbasically, decommissioned and be unable to produce plutonium, and that \nwould go for the next 15 years. In the short period of time, 10 years \nto 15 years, these other procedures that prevent the operation of the \ncentrifuges would be in place.\n  This is how you block the path to nuclear weapons. All of these \nprocedures are in place. Scientists, physicists, generals, and others \nhave all looked at this and have all come to the conclusion that, hey, \nthis works. This will block Iran from developing a nuclear weapon for a \nminimum of 15 years, probably 20 years, and assuming that we are able \nto hold them to the agreement, 25 years and beyond. That is the \nnonproliferation treaty.\n  Now, all of this, of course, is dependent upon verification. We don't \ntrust Iran. We don't need to trust Iran. In fact, we should go into \nthis not trusting Iran. Therefore, do we have sufficient verification \nprocedures in place to hold Iran to the deal?\n\n  The answer is yes.\n  The International Atomic Energy Agency, the IAEA, is and has been for \ndecades the United Nations' watchdog for the nonproliferation treaty. \nThey have been in Iran in the past. They have observed cheating. They \nhave observed obfuscation. However, under the new agreement, the doors \nare open to all of the facilities that are known to be involved in the \nnuclear production and the nuclear bomb activities. There is an \nadditional procedure that, within 24 days, should there be an \nindication of a site that is not now known to be involved in nuclear \nactivity, the IAEA, the International Atomic Energy Agency, would be \nable to observe what is going on at that site. As for the other sites--\nthe secret sites of the past--we would have the IAEA observing, \nmonitoring, and verifying that the agreement is being held to its \nstandard.\n  We also have other methods of knowing what is going on in Iran. \nNuclear material leaves a radiation signature. We have the capability \nof reading those signatures and understanding in detail what is going \non at any particular site--past, present, and into the future.\n  The verifications that are in this treaty are built upon the fact \nthat we do not trust Iran, and, therefore, these verification \nprocedures are the most robust, comprehensive, and extensive in any \nproliferation treaty with Russia or anybody else. So that is in place.\n  Now, what if they do cheat?\n  If they do cheat and if they do not honor the agreement, we will \nknow. That is what the verification is all about. It is agreed by the \nP5+1--that is the United Kingdom, which is Britain; France; Germany; \nRussia; China; the U.N.; and the European Union--that should there be a \nbreach of the procedures in this deal that the sanctions--the toughest \nof them--would automatically snap back into place and would continue to \napply the kind of economic-social pressure on Iran that brought them to \nthe negotiating table in the first place.\n  Can we trust these countries to snap back?\n  I believe we can. It is an agreement that they have made not just \nwith the United States but with each other.\n  Now, if they don't, we still have our own sanctions, which are tough, \nwhich provide us with an ability to put a lot of pressure on Iran, even \nthough not as much as the other countries together with us could do; \nbut, nonetheless, those sanctions are always available to us now and on \ninto the future should Iran renege in any way on this deal.\n  There are a couple of other things about this that we need to \nconsider.\n  There is a lot of talk that this deal would free a vast amount of \nmoney that Iran has had sequestered--having been known to get their \nhands on a vast amount of money. The numbers bandied about are $150 \nbillion. It has been said by the Treasury Department and by the \nSecretary of State that the amount is actually closer to $100 billion. \nThat is a lot of money. There is great fear--and, I think, \nappropriately--that Iran would use that money to advance, enhance, and \nincrease its support of terrorism around the world--specifically in the \nMiddle East--and against Israel.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I suppose that is a possibility. But when an analysis is done of that \nmoney, about $40 billion of that $100 billion is owed to other \ncountries and other entities outside of Iran.\n  So as soon as that sanction is removed and that money is available, \nthen $40 billion of the $100 billion is not available to Iran. It is in \nsome other country's hand.\n  The remaining money presumably could be used for support of terrorist \nactivities. However, we should keep in mind that Iran has been heavily \nhit by the existing sanctions, so much so that their economy is in \nterrible condition.\n  Their infrastructure, specifically in the oil arena, is woefully old, \ninadequate, and not capable of significant production. So they are \ngoing to need to invest a lot of money in that and in other \ninfrastructure.\n  How much money would be available for terrorism? Far more than we \nwould want. And, therefore, we need to be certain that our support for \nthose countries that are fighting the terrorist activity in the Middle \nEast and beyond have the full support of the United States Government, \npeople, and our Treasury.\n  It is going to cost us some money, but this is something we are going \nto have to do. We must make certain that Israel has whatever it needs \nto counter whatever terrorist threats there may be and whatever threats \nthere may be in the more conventional military sense.\n  Already we are preparing to ship to Israel our most advanced \nfighters, the F-35, which is just now coming off our production lines, \nand there will be a lot of other equipment made available.\n  Certainly, with regard to intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance, we will continue to work with Israel very closely as we \nhave for many, many years, in fact, decades. All of that is there.\n  We also need to be aware that the other Gulf state countries and \nother countries in the area that have been subject to Iranian attacks \nand trouble need our support.\n  We should also be willing, as we have in the past and as we are \ncommitted to now, to provide them with the support that they need to \npush back not only on terrorism, but on overt Iranian military \nactivity.\n  So here we are. Deal? No deal? No deal. Is there a better deal? \nHighly unlikely that the P5+1 will ever come back together again to \nnegotiate a better deal.\n  So we would probably almost certainly have to do it by ourselves. We \nhave already proved in the past, before the P5+1 went into existence, \nthat we were not successful alone negotiating a deal with Iran.\n\n[[Page H5818]]\n\n  The sanctions by our country alone were insufficient. But, as a \nglobal community, we were sufficient. And that is where the P5+1 comes \nin. Listen carefully to what those countries are saying about a \nrenegotiation, ``not likely.''\n  So where are we? I believe we have to support this deal that was put \ntogether by these six major countries, supported by the European Union \nand the United Nations. This is the path that would block all paths to \na nuclear weapon that Iran might be able to pursue for at least the \nnext 15 years and beyond.\n  I ask my colleagues to look hard at this. Unfortunately, a lot of the \nnewspapers are portraying this as a partisan fight. I don't believe it \nis. I know that many of my colleagues on the Democratic side and \ncertainly what appears to be most Republicans, if not all, are opposed \nto the deal. I am certain many of them have their own reasons for that \nopposition.\n  But I think, when you take a comprehensive look at this deal, when \nyou look at all of the elements, that is, what happens if there is no \ndeal and Iran can immediately restart its nuclear weapons program, you \ngo, ``Whoa. That is not a good thing.''\n  On the other hand, if this deal holds, then Iran will be prevented \nfrom having a nuclear weapon for at least 15 years, quite probably 20 \nyears.\n  Should they continue to honor the nonproliferation treaty, then it \nwould go on indefinitely. That is a good thing. And, therefore, I \nsupport this negotiated deal and I ask my colleagues to do the same.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I have completed my time on the floor.\n  I notice that two of my colleagues are here to speak to the passing \nof one of our Members of this House who served here for many, many \nyears.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5818-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5818-H5823]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HONORING REPRESENTATIVE LOUIS STOKES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur) is recognized \nfor the remainder of the hour as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I would like to extend deepest thanks to \nCongressman Garamendi for sharing his time with us and, also, to \nCongresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson, who has been waiting almost an \nhour to share her memories of a very great American.\n  We are here this evening, Mr. Speaker, and we rise to honor the \nillustrious career of a dear friend and stellar colleague, the late \nCongressman Louis Stokes from Cleveland, Ohio.\n  Our hearts are heavy, but immensely grateful for his path-breaking \nlife and legendary generous service. As the first African American \nMember of Congress elected to serve from Ohio, he wrote new history for \nAmerica, for Ohio, every day of his life.\n  Rising from the public housing projects of Cleveland, he and his \nbrother Carl became revered as they built a more inclusive and \nrepresentative America. What courage and passion that required.\n  A proud, personable, and gracious man whose fashion and manner exuded \ndignity, it was actually never his aspiration to be a politician. He \nopted instead to serve the local neighborhoods of Cleveland, where he \ngrew up, after returning from 3 years of service in the U.S. Army \nduring World War II.\n  After using his GI benefits to go to college, Lou served in the \nVeterans Administration and the Treasury Department before attending \nlaw school. He loved the law. He loved being a lawyer, and he loved \nwriting laws here.\n  His enlightened leadership moved America forward socially, \neconomically, and legally. In Congress, his gentlemanly demeanor and \nsharp intellect allowed him to chair, again, as the first African \nAmerican, the Appropriations subcommittee on Veterans, Housing and \nUrban Development, and Independent Agencies.\n  As a much newer, younger Member of Congress, I had the great \nprivilege of serving under him as he chaired that important committee.\n  He also chaired the House Select Committee on Assassinations and \nserved on the House Select Committee to investigate covert arms \ntransactions with Iran. His agile legal mind was evident in the \ninvestigations he conducted.\n  The people of Cleveland and Ohio have been blessed throughout his \nlife and hold abiding gratitude for his extraordinary accomplishments \nand generous spirit. I can still hear his laugh.\n  I am privileged, actually, to have served with Congressman Stokes for \nalmost a quarter century and hold lasting memories of his deep love for \nhis wife, for his mother, for his brother, for his children, and his \ngrandchildren.\n  He had indefatigable and inspired efforts to gain respect and equal \njustice in the law for all of our citizens. And he saw progress, great \nprogress, in his lifetime that we have so far to go.\n  I witnessed his perseverance in building America's communities \nforward and his dedication to meeting our Nation's obligations to \nveterans, to advance space science, and to catapult Cleveland's health \nand human services to the top rung of national assets.\n  I have so many memories of Congressman Stokes. I can remember one \ntime in a subcommittee he had the head of Arlington Cemetery come up, \nand he had these big volumes that he brought with him of who were the \nveterans who were interred there.\n  And Congressman Stokes pointed out to the entire committee, ``Go down \nand read the roster.'' And the roster said, ``No name,'' ``No name,'' \n``No name,'' ``No name.'' And Congressman Stokes informed us that, in \nfact, those were Africa Americans who had died in service to our \ncountry, but they were buried with no name at Arlington. And he made \nsure that that area was especially recognized, and he was writing \nhistory for America for the first time.\n  I thought, wow, this isn't 1870. This was in the 1980s and 1990s. He \nwas a great teacher.\n  I shall sorely miss his dogged determination, easy smile, keen and \nmeasured counsel, and persevering nature.\n  The last time we were together was at a Fair Housing meeting in \nCleveland, Ohio, just a few months ago. Looking back on his generous \nattendance at age 90 and looking in really great shape, I think it was \nhis way--he hadn't told anyone yet what was ailing him, but I think it \nwas his way of saying good-bye.\n  What a gracious gentleman he was. What a gifted leader has lived \namong us.\n  I am going to place in the Congressional Record a special story that \nwas in the Cleveland Plain Dealer entitled, ``Lou Stokes--The \nCongressman, Leading Lawyer, and Towering Political Presence Has \nDied,'' written by Brent Larkin, Tom Diemer, and Sabrina Eaton of the \nNortheast Ohio Media Group.\n  Though I won't read the entire article into the record tonight, let \nme just read a few sentences:\n  ``We have been blessed as a family with a legacy we can always be \nproud of,'' Lou Stokes said. ``Together with Carl''--his brother--``we \nmade a name that stood for something. What greater honor could have \ncome to two brothers who grew up in poverty here in Cleveland?''\n  And he tells a story about his mother. He would always get tears in \nhis eyes when he would talk of his mother. She had become ill at one \npoint, and he went to visit her.\n  And he said, ``I took her hands to give her some comfort and, when I \nfelt those hard, cold hands from scrubbing floors in order to give me \nan education, I began to understand what her life was about, what her \nlife meant.'' And that piercing memory Lou carried with him every day \nof his life.\n  ``Beginning in junior high school, Stokes took jobs delivering the \nCleveland News, shining shoes, and working in a small factory that made \ncanned whipped cream.''\n  When he was 16, a man named Isadore Apisdorf hired him to perform odd \njobs at his Army-Navy surplus store on lower Prospect Avenue. Seeing \nsomething in the youngster, Apisdorf ignored the risk to his business \nin those days and hired Stokes as a salesman.\n\n  When speaking of his early years, Stokes always remembered to mention \nthe kindness demonstrated to him by a man ``who sort of acted like a \nfather to me,'' Congressman Stokes said.\n  Stokes graduated from Central High School in 1943. And with World War \nII raging, he joined the Army and was assigned to a segregated unit \nthat remained Stateside, mainly in the south.\n  Stokes recalled a layover his unit once had in Memphis where a group \nof\n\n[[Page H5819]]\n\nGerman prisoners of war in a train station restaurant were treated \nbetter than the Black soldiers.\n  Louis Stokes embodied so many memories and so much progress that he \nhelped not just Cleveland, not just Ohio, but our country and people \neverywhere to persevere, no matter what the odds.\n  I shall miss him. What a gifted leader has lived among us. I know all \nof the people of Ohio join me, as do our colleagues, in saying: May the \nangels carry him to a deserved, peaceful rest close to the heart of \nGod.\n  There are other Members that wish to speak this evening. I just feel \nvery honored to be here. I can still see Lou in the cloakroom in the \nback with his good friend, Bill Clay, and some of the guys. We weren't \nincluded, as women, in those conversations, but we respected them.\n  And he was always cordial. He always sort of stood halfway turned so \nhe could say hello to those Members going by. He had a special gracious \nmanner about him.\n\n                  [From Cleveland.com, Aug. 19, 2015]\n\n  Lou Stokes--The Congressman, Leading Lawyer and Towering Political \n                           Presence Has Died\n\n                           (By Brent Larkin)\n\n       Cleveland, OH.--Louis Stokes, whose iconic career in public \n     life assures him a place as one of the most revered, \n     respected and powerful figures in Cleveland history, died \n     Tuesday night.\n       He was 90.\n       The older brother of former Mayor Carl B. Stokes had an \n     aggressive form of cancer, diagnosed in late June.\n       A proud, personable and gracious man whose dress and manner \n     exuded dignity, Stokes never wanted to be a politician, \n     aspiring instead to become Cleveland's leading black lawyer.\n       But the reluctant officeholder who came to Congress in 1969 \n     left it 30 years later as a towering political figure both in \n     Washington and at home.\n       Mayor Frank Jackson was one of dozens to publicly mourn the \n     death of his longtime friend.\n       ``Congressman Louis Stokes' long career in public life was \n     a model of how to serve with dignity, integrity and honor,'' \n     Jackson said. ``His service paved the way for many who would \n     follow in both public and private careers. I know full well \n     that, but for him, I would have never had the opportunity to \n     become mayor.''\n       For more than three decades, Stokes, his brother, former \n     Council President George Forbes, and former Cleveland School \n     Board President Arnold Pinkney dominated every aspect of \n     black political life in the city.\n       Now, only Forbes survives.\n       ``The four of us had parallel careers in public life,'' \n     Forbes said. ``It was not unusual for some of the things we \n     did or said to be questioned. But not Lou Stokes. If he said \n     it, or did it, it was like a pronouncement from Sinai. It was \n     the gospel. It was the last word. No one disagreed with \n     him.''\n       Stokes' resume in the House included stints as chairman of \n     the select committee that from 1976 to 1978 investigated the \n     assassinations of President John F. Kennedy and Martin Luther \n     King Jr., chairman of the House Ethics Committee, a member of \n     the House select committee that investigated the Iran-Contra \n     affair, and the first black to chair the Intelligence \n     Committee and serve on the influential House Appropriations \n     Committee.\n       In Cleveland, Stokes' political muscle was the 21st \n     Congressional District Caucus, a political organization \n     founded by his late brother that became so powerful, its \n     ability to influence election outcomes sometimes surpassed \n     that of the Cuyahoga County Democratic Party.\n       When Stokes and the caucus urged Democrats in his district \n     to vote against a sitting Democratic president in the Ohio \n     presidential primary in 1980, they did just that, supporting \n     Massachusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy over President Jimmy Carter \n     by a margin of nearly 2-1.\n       Stokes never lost an election. Nor did he forget where he \n     came from.\n       And he never strayed from his commitment to expand \n     political and economic opportunities for minorities.\n       In an interview at his home just a month before his death \n     and days after he learned of his terminal illness, Stokes \n     emotionally reminisced on his storybook life.\n       ``I was a very blessed guy,'' he began. ``I've been blessed \n     with the opportunity to participate in history, to rise to \n     opportunities I never envisioned . . . and to provide for \n     people opportunities that, in many cases, they would have \n     never had.\n       ``We have been blessed as a family with a legacy we can \n     always be proud of. Together with Carl, we made a name that \n     stood for something.\n       ``What greater honor could have come to two brothers who \n     grew up in poverty here in Cleveland?''\n\n\n                           Humble beginnings\n\n       Lou Stokes was born Feb. 23, 1925, the first of two \n     children born to Charles and Louise Stokes. Carl was born a \n     little more than two years later.\n       Their father died when Lou was three, and Louise Stokes \n     took an $8-a-day job as a domestic worker at homes in the \n     eastern suburbs. To help raise the young boys in their small \n     apartment on East 69th Street, Louise's mother moved to \n     Cleveland from Georgia.\n       Stokes spoke often and with great emotion of his mother, \n     and her repeated lectures on the importance of an education.\n       ``One night, she was lying in bed ill and I went into her \n     room and sat with her,'' Stokes recalled during an interview \n     last year at the Maltz Museum of Jewish Heritage.\n       ``I took her hands to give her some comfort. And when I \n     felt those hard, cold hands from scrubbing floors in order to \n     give me an education, I began to understand what she meant.''\n       Beginning in junior high, Stokes took jobs delivering the \n     Cleveland News, shining shoes and working in a small factory \n     that made canned whip cream.\n       When Stokes was 16, Isadore Apisdorf hired him to perform \n     odd jobs at his Army-Navy surplus store on lower Prospect \n     Avenue. Seeing something in the youngster, Apisdorf ignored \n     the risks to his business and hired Stokes as a salesman.\n       When speaking of his early years, Stokes always remembered \n     to mention the kindness demonstrated to him by a man ``who \n     sort of acted like a father to me.''\n       Stokes graduated from Central High School in 1943. With \n     World War II raging, he joined the Army and was assigned to a \n     segregated unit that remained stateside, mainly in the South. \n     Stokes recalled a layover his unit once had in Memphis where \n     a group of German prisoners of war in a train station \n     restaurant were treated better than the black soldiers.\n       After the war, Stokes attended Western Reserve University \n     on the G.I. Bill. He worked for a time for the Veterans \n     Administration and Treasury Department before graduating from \n     Cleveland State University's Cleveland Marshall College of \n     Law in 1953.\n       Stokes opened up a small law office on St. Clair Avenue, \n     and was later joined by his brother. Carl also became a \n     lawyer and, in 1962, became the first black Democrat elected \n     to the Ohio House.\n       Around this time, Stokes drew the attention of Norman \n     Minor, considered one of the greatest lawyers in Ohio history \n     and the greatest black lawyer Cleveland ever produced.\n       ``I tried to be like Norman Minor in every way I could,'' \n     Stokes recalled in 2014. ``Carl loved politics. I didn't have \n     that love. I loved being a lawyer.''\n\n\n                             Making history\n\n       On the night of Nov. 7, 1967, Stokes sat with Martin Luther \n     King Jr. in the Rockefeller Building just west of Public \n     Square, and experienced what he described as ``a pioneering \n     political event for America''--Carl Stokes' election as the \n     nation's first black, big-city mayor.\n       In 1965 and again two years later, King had made numerous \n     trips to Cleveland aimed at registering blacks to vote. Carl \n     Stokes lost the 1965 mayoral primary by about 1,700 votes. \n     Two years later, he beat Republican Seth Taft by about 2,500 \n     votes.\n       Lou Stokes said King was ``tremendously helpful'' to his \n     brother in both those elections.\n       Less than a month after his brother's winning election, \n     Stokes enjoyed his own first moment of fame, arguing a case \n     before the U.S. Supreme Court.\n       The case involved John Terry, a Cleveland man suspected of \n     preparing to rob a Euclid Avenue store downtown in 1963. \n     Terry and two others were stopped on the sidewalk by a \n     Cleveland policeman, who frisked Terry and found a gun.\n       The landmark case of Terry v. Ohio upheld the arrest, but \n     allowed police to stop and frisk suspects only when the \n     officer has a ``reasonable suspicion'' the suspect is about \n     to commit a crime, and may be armed and dangerous.\n       That same year, another landmark Supreme Court ruling known \n     as ``one man, one vote'' led to Carl Stokes and Gov. James \n     Rhodes collaborating in the creation of a new, majority-\n     minority congressional district comprised of Cleveland's East \n     Side and some eastern suburbs.\n       At his brother's urging, a reluctant Lou Stokes put his law \n     career on hold and became a candidate. In the Democratic \n     primary, Stokes beat 13 opponents, including George Forbes, \n     Leo Jackson and George White.\n       In January 1969, Stokes entered Congress along with Shirley \n     Chisholm of New York and William ``Bill'' Clay of Missouri. \n     Their elections brought to nine the number of blacks in \n     Congress.\n       Stokes immediately began to make his mark, becoming a \n     founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus a little \n     more than a year after taking office.\n       Always served well by his personality, Stokes was a tall, \n     hard-working man with a loud, infectious laugh. His gentle \n     nature masked a steely commitment--and, at times, he was \n     viewed as a bit too thin-skinned. Nevertheless, among his \n     colleagues, Stokes was always considered one of the body's \n     most popular members.\n       When Tip O'Neill became speaker of the U.S. House in 1977, \n     Stokes' career took off. O'Neill's respect for Stokes earned \n     him prestigious and powerful committee assignments, which \n     often translated into federal spending on projects important \n     to Cleveland.\n\n[[Page H5820]]\n\n       ``We had a very special relationship,'' Stokes said of \n     O'Neill during his July 14 interview. ``He used to call me \n     `Louie, my pal.' He gave me some very tough assignments.''\n       In 1987, Stokes had a memorable back-and-forth with Oliver \n     North during the Iran-Contra hearings, telling the Marine \n     Corps lieutenant colonel, ``While I admire your love for \n     America, I just hope you will never forget that others, too, \n     love America just as much as you do--and . . . will die for \n     America just as quickly as you will.''\n\n\n                            The power broker\n\n       Back in Cleveland, the 1971 decision by Carl Stokes to \n     leave town for a television career in New York instead of \n     seeking a third term as mayor created a significant power \n     vacuum within the black political establishment.\n       Stokes moved decisively to fill that vacuum, and Democratic \n     leaders awarded him a co-chairmanship of the county party. \n     But Forbes and Arnold Pinkney were becoming powerful black \n     political figures in their own right.\n       For the next 10 to 15 years, the inevitable tensions that \n     arise with power-sharing led to public disagreements and some \n     angry private moments--with Call and Post founder and \n     publisher W.O. Walker often serving as a mediator.\n       Over time, those strains disappeared. And while Forbes \n     would eventually cement a legacy as the most powerful City \n     Council president in Cleveland history and Pinkney twice \n     waged competitive campaigns for mayor and became a nationally \n     recognized political consultant, there was never any doubt \n     who owned the magic political name.\n       That name at times moved Stokes and the 21st Congressional \n     District Caucus to part ways with the Democratic Party. And \n     Stokes was not above using the caucus as a weapon to punish \n     and defeat candidates he believed did not deserve black \n     votes.\n       The caucus' influence was often most pronounced in down-\n     the-ballot races for judge and other offices. But in the 1977 \n     election for mayor, one of the most competitive and dramatic \n     in the city's history, support from the Stokes brothers \n     probably made the difference in Dennis Kucinich's victory \n     over Democratic Party-backed Edward Feighan.\n       Tim Hagan served as Feighan's de facto campaign manager. \n     Several months after the election, he would become chairman \n     of the county's Democratic Party.\n       ``If Congressman Stokes was with you, it gave you \n     unquestioned credibility with the people he represented,'' \n     said Hagan. ``It made the difference between winning or \n     losing an election. Lou's endorsement was the most important \n     endorsement a candidate sought.''\n       There were a few stumbles, but none major. And they did \n     little or nothing to tarnish Stokes' relationship with his \n     constituents. [In 1983, following a late-night session of \n     Congress, he was convicted on a minor charge of driving under \n     the influence and also of running a red light; Stokes said he \n     was overly tired but sober, but decided not to appeal the \n     jury verdict.] In the early 1990s, he had 551 overdrafts at \n     the House Bank, most for small amounts.\n       In 1993, Stokes reached the height of his power in \n     Congress, joining the prestigious ``College of Cardinals'' \n     when he became chair of the Appropriations subcommittee for \n     the Veterans Administration and Housing and Urban \n     Development. It was a position that gave Stokes enormous say \n     in how and where tens of billions in federal dollars were \n     spent. The Louis Stokes Cleveland VA Medical Center on East \n     105th Street is one of several Cleveland buildings named in \n     his honor.\n       But his enthusiasm for the job would soon wane. In 1994, \n     Republicans took control of the House. Two years later, at \n     age 71, Stokes had open heart surgery at the Cleveland Clinic \n     and a tumor removed from his vocal cords.\n       When, in April 1996, Carl Stokes died of cancer, Stokes \n     lost his best friend.\n\n\n                             The denouement\n\n       By 1998, after 30 years in office, Stokes decided not to \n     seek re-election.\n       On the day he announced his retirement, Plain Dealer \n     columnist Elizabeth Auster wrote, ``Stokes brought more than \n     money home from Washington. He also brought laughter and \n     inspiration and pride. And sometimes those are harder to come \n     by.''\n       Then-Cleveland Mayor Michael White said of Stokes, \n     ``Someone will fill his seat, but I don't think anyone will \n     ever fill his shoes.''\n       It was always a foregone conclusion Stokes' job would pass \n     to Stephanie Tubbs Jones, county prosecutor at the time. When \n     Tubbs Jones died unexpectedly in 2008, Marcia Fudge became \n     only the third person to hold the seat.\n       In retirement, Stokes became senior counsel at the \n     Cleveland-based law firm of what was then Squire Sanders & \n     Dempsey. He served on several corporate boards, including \n     Forest City Enterprises.\n       When asked in the July interview about the lack of civility \n     in Washington today, Stokes said he was sometimes embarrassed \n     to be a former member of Congress.\n       ``I have members of Congress whom I see, on both sides of \n     the aisle, and they tell me, `Louie, you wouldn't want to be \n     here now.' It's a waste of your time and intellect to be \n     involved there now and see how difficult it is to concentrate \n     on doing what's best for people--considering you were sent \n     there to help people. That's gone now.''\n       Stokes retired from the law firm in 2012, and resigned from \n     the Forest City board last year. In recent months, he spent \n     time assisting his daughter, Cleveland Municipal Court Judge \n     Angela Stokes, who is contesting disciplinary charges filed \n     against her by the Ohio Supreme Court's Disciplinary Counsel.\n       Besides Angela, he is survived by his wife of 55 years, \n     Jeanette (Jay); daughter Shelley Stokes-Hammond, retired \n     public affairs director at Howard University; daughter Lori, \n     a television news anchor in New York City; son Chuck, \n     editorial and public affairs director at a Detroit television \n     station; and seven grandchildren.\n       Funeral arrangements are pending.\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I yield to Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, \nwho I know was a very, very dear friend of Congressman Stokes. I thank \nher so much for joining us this evening.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to \njoin Congresswoman Kaptur in sharing some sentiments.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand in recognition of the late Congressman Louis \nStokes, a dear friend and a tremendous patriot, who dedicated his life \nto serving our great Nation. He was dedicated to expanding political \nand economic opportunities for all Americans, and he was determined to \ntranscend the culture of discrimination and injustice.\n  Louis Stokes rose from humble beginnings in the local housing \nprojects of Cleveland, Ohio, to serve 30 years in the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives. He was first elected in 1968. Reluctant to enter the \npolitical arena, Stokes was persuaded to run for office by his younger \nbrother, Carl B. Stokes, the first African American mayor of a major \nAmerican city, elected in 1967.\n  Prior to serving in Congress, Mr. Stokes served as a civil rights \nlawyer. He was the first African American to represent the State of \nOhio in Congress and was a founding member of the Congressional Black \nCaucus. Throughout his tenure in the House, he chaired several \ncongressional committees and was the first African American to win a \nseat on the House Committee on Appropriations.\n  During his long tenure in Congress, he headed and participated in \nseveral major House investigations. In March of 1977, he was appointed \nto lead the Select Committee on Assassinations, formed to conduct an \ninvestigation of the circumstances surrounding the deaths of President \nJohn F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.\n  He also served as the chairman of the House Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence and became the first African American Member \nof Congress to head this committee.\n  He was the dean of the Ohio congressional delegation. His work in the \narea of health led to his appointment as a member of the Pepper \nCommission of comprehensive health care, and he was the founder and \nchairman of the Congressional Black Caucus Health Braintrust. In 1981, \nhe chaired the House Committee on Standards of Official Conduct.\n  When Louis Stokes retired in 1998, he became the first African \nAmerican in the history of the U.S. Congress to retire after 30 years \nof service. Following his service in Congress, he became a senior \ncounsel at Squire, Sanders & Dempsey, LLP, a global law firm, and \ndistinguished visiting professor at the Mandel School of Applied Social \nSciences at Case Western Reserve University.\n  He also served as a vice chairman of the Pew Environmental Health \nCommission at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and was \nappointed by the former Health and Human Services Secretary, Donna \nShalala, as chairman of the Advisory Committee on Minority Health.\n  As a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus, he engineered \na vehicle that would foster collaboration and strategic alliances for \ngenerations. Because of his visionary leadership, we all benefit from \nan organization powerful enough to engage, empower, and excite \ngenerations of African American leaders who influence the political \nlandscape, impact the outcome of elections, and serve as strong voices \nfor those weakened by poverty, discrimination, and lack of opportunity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud and honored to have had the privilege of \nserving with this Congressman. I was inspired by his intelligence, \npreparation, dignity, generosity, and forward thinking.\n\n[[Page H5821]]\n\nHe leaves behind a legacy that inspires not only those who served with \nhim, but a generation of future leaders.\n  I am grateful for this vision that he had, his integrity, his grace, \nhis friendship, and his mentorship.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Thank you, Congresswoman Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas, \na long way from Cleveland, for your great service and for sharing your \nmemories of our beloved friend, Congressman Louis Stokes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I know others want to enter material in the Record in \nmemory of Congressman Stokes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have 5 \nlegislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I also wanted to mention that Congressman \nStokes' beautiful wife, Jeanette, who was at his side through all his \nyears of service; his daughters, Angela, Shelley, Lori; his son, Chuck; \nand seven grandchildren.\n  What an amazing family--the Stokes family has made many contributions \nto Ohio and to our country, but I think Jeanette and Congressman Stokes \nare proudest of the children and grandchildren that they have raised. \nThey have represented the family well during this most difficult time.\n\n\n                      Honoring Speaker Jim Wright\n\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I would like to turn to a different subject, if I might, \nin the remaining time.\n  Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago, there was a Special Order that was \ngiven on Speaker Jim Wright, and I was unable, because of duties in \nOhio, to join my remarks to those of his friends and colleagues here in \nthe Congress. I rise tonight to honor him for the leader and master of \nthe legislative process that Speaker Jim Wright of Fort Worth, Texas, \nwas.\n  He approached life with an eager and courageous mission and a true \ndemocratic heart. He loved this House. He just loved it. He just basked \nin its glory and its power, and he had the keenness of intellect, the \nbalance of knowledge, the intuition, the direction, and the wisdom that \ncomes from the long years of experience that he had at the level of \nFort Worth and then the State of Texas and then, obviously, federally.\n  He was a veteran of World War II and had been a pilot and received \nthe Distinguished Flying Cross. He was truly--truly--a courageous hero \nfor our country and chose to serve then in elected life.\n  What I will forever remember of him was his dignity and his strength. \nHis personal ability to also forgive those who sought to harm him and \nmove on was an amazing trait, and I think it revealed some of what he \nwas able to bring as a negotiator and a statesman to the work here.\n  He was a passionate fighter for the people of our country, especially \nthose of ordinary means who might not have their voices heard, and when \nhe got into a topic that he loved, he was absolutely unstoppable.\n  He was a gifted orator. He spoke with all of his heart, and he \nelevated this House and the people who served in it. He loved Congress. \nHe referred to it as a heady place to be, where Members of both \npolitical parties should cooperate to make America a world leader and \nto build and support a strong middle class.\n  His early life growing up during the Great Depression had a permanent \nimprint on him, and he never forgot the common person. His service in \nthe Army during World War II instilled in him a life of service and a \ndedication to help those less fortunate, but also a passion for \nliberty.\n  His legislative achievements were legion. He helped create the Clean \nWater Act and the Interstate Highway System, and he helped guarantee \nbenefits for returning veterans. I remember what a master he was. I \nbelieve he chaired the House Public Works Committee and rose from \nthere.\n\n  I can still see him making the case, right at this podium here in the \nHouse, for a modern transportation bill, clinking dimes in a large \nglass bowl to say that we have to pay our way forward here. He \nunderstood what it took to build and maintain a great nation's \nprosperity. He was a terrific, terrific orator.\n  In foreign affairs, Speaker Wright had a contribution that one could \ndescribe as profound. He was a peacemaker. He visited the Middle East \nand facilitated the meeting that led to the accord between Israel and \nEgypt in 1977.\n  More than a decade later, he led a successful push for a compromise \nthat would end the war between the Sandinista government and the \nContras in Nicaragua. Over time, his approach would lead to the end of \nU.S. military financing and the start of democratically held elections \nthere. How many Americans can say they have ever been involved in \nsomething of that magnitude?\n  In his farewell speech before Congress, Speaker Wright said: ``When \nvengeance becomes more desirable than vindication, harsh personal \nattacks on one another's motives, one another's character, drown out \nthe quiet logic of serious debate on important issues, things that we \nought to be involved ourselves in, surely that is unworthy of our \ninstitution, unworthy of our American political process. All of us in \nboth parties must resolve to bring this period of mindless cannibalism \nto an end. There has been enough of it.''\n  Speaker Wright returned to Fort Worth where he donated his official \npapers to Texas Christian University's library and taught a TCU course \ncalled Congress and the Presidents for more than 20 years. His \nintention to keep the class small was simply impossible, as his \nenrollment grew at an increasing rate every year.\n  Speaker Wright always treated me graciously. Here I was from Ohio, a \ncompletely different part of the country, but I appreciate the fact \nthat he assisted my efforts to seek a seat on the Committee on \nAppropriations--it took me over a decade to arrive there--since no one \nfrom our part of Ohio had ever served on it.\n  He saw the exclusion, and he helped me. I am so grateful to him \nforever for that and what I have been able to do to help the country in \nthat position.\n  He and I shared many experiences and pursuits during our shared years \nin Congress, but one of my favorite memories is something we had in \ncommon, and that was a love of gardening and roses. He was especially \nfond of a gray-purplish variety of rose that he had raised to \nperfection. He just loved life.\n  Speaker Wright would often quote Horace Greeley in saying: ``Fame is \na vapor; popularity an accident; riches take wings; those who cheer \ntoday may curse tomorrow; only one thing endures--character.''\n  Speaker Wright was certainly a man of great character and great \ntalent and ability and great accomplishment.\n  We shall miss him greatly. May the hearts of his loved ones, his \nbeloved wife, Betty; his four children; 15 grandchildren; 24 great-\ngrandchildren; and his sister Betty Lee Wright be warmed by the light \nof his memory and the legacy of liberty he bestowed upon us all and the \ngreat affection we shall always have for him in our hearts.\n  May God bless the Wright family.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, Louis Stokes rose from the local \nhousing projects to serve 30 years in the U.S. House, becoming a potent \nsymbol for his Cleveland-based majority-black district. Reluctant to \nenter the political arena, Stokes was persuaded to run for office by \nhis prominent brother and by community members he had served for \ndecades as a civil rights lawyer.\n  His accomplishments were substantive and of historic proportions. The \nfirst Black to represent Ohio, Stokes chaired several congressional \ncommittees (including the Permanent Select Intelligence Committee) and \nwas the first African American to win a seat on the powerful House \nAppropriations Committee.\n  He used his success to try to increase opportunities for millions of \nAfrican Americans, saying, ``I'm going to keep on denouncing the \ninequities of this system, but I'm going to work within it. To go \noutside the system would be to deny myself--to deny my own existence. \nI've beaten the system. I've proved it can be done--so have a lot of \nothers.'' Stokes continued, ``But the problem is that a black man has \nto be extra special to win in this system. Why should you have to be a \nsuper black to get someplace? That's what's wrong in the society. The \nordinary black man doesn't have the\n\n[[Page H5822]]\n\nsame chance as the ordinary white man does.''\n  Louis Stokes was born on February 23, 1925, in Cleveland, Ohio, to \nCharles and Louise Cinthy (Stone) Stokes. His father worked in a \nlaundromat and died when Louis was young. Stokes and his younger \nbrother, Carl, were raised by their widowed mother, whose salary as a \ndomestic was supplemented by welfare payments. Louis Stokes \nsupplemented the family income by shining shoes around the Cleveland \nprojects and clerking at an Army/Navy store. He attended Cleveland's \npublic schools and served as a personnel specialist in the U.S. Army \nfrom 1943 to 1946. He returned home with an honorable discharge, taking \njobs in the Veterans Administration and Treasury Department offices in \nCleveland while attending college at night with the help of the GI \nBill. He attended the Cleveland College of Western Reserve University \nfrom 1946 to 1948. Stokes eventually earned a J.D. from the Cleveland \nMarshall School of Law in 1953 and, with his brother, opened the law \nfirm Stokes and Stokes. On August 21, 1960, Louis Stokes married \nJeanette (Jay) Francis, and they raised four children: Shelly, Louis \nC., Angela, and Lorene.\n  He devoted himself to his law practice, where he became involved in a \nnumber of civil rights--related cases--often working pro bono on behalf \nof poor clients and activists. He was an active participant in civic \naffairs. Working on behalf of the Cleveland NAACP, Stokes helped \nchallenge the Ohio legislature's redistricting in 1965 that followed \nthe Supreme Court's ``one man, one vote'' decision.\n\n  The state legislature had fragmented the congressional districts that \noverlay Cleveland, diluting black voting strength. Stokes joined forces \nwith Charles Lucas, a black Republican, to challenge that action. They \nlost their case in U.S. District Court, but based on Stokes's written \nappeal, the U.S. Supreme Court agreed with the brief in 1967. From that \ndecision followed the creation of Ohio's first majority-black district. \nLater that year, in December 1967, Stokes made an oral argument before \nthe U.S. Supreme Court in Terry v. Ohio, a precedent-setting case that \ndefined the legality of police search and seizure procedures.\n  At his brother Carl's behest Louis Stokes made his first run for \nelective office in 1968. He sought to win the seat in the newly created \ncongressional district that encompassed much of the east side of \nCleveland. Stokes was hardly a typical newcomer to the political \ncampaign. First, his brother, Mayor Stokes, put the services of his \npolitical network at Louis's disposal. Stokes won by a landslide. He \nwon his subsequent 14 general elections by lopsided margins in the \nheavily Democratic district taking as much as 88 percent of the vote.\n  As a freshman Representative, Stokes received assignments on the \nEducation and Labor Committee and the Internal Security Committee \n(formerly the House Un-American Activities Committee). He \nenthusiastically accepted the former assignment, believing Education \nand Labor would be a prime platform from which he could push the agenda \nfor his urban district: job training, economic opportunity, and \neducational interests. But Stokes was less pleased with the Internal \nSecurity panel, which had lapsed into an increasingly irrelevant entity \nsince its heyday investigating communists in the 1940s and 1950s. \n(House leaders disbanded it entirely in the mid-1970s.)\n  During his second term in the House, Stokes earned a seat on the \nAppropriations Committee. During more than two decades on the \ncommittee, Stokes steered hundreds of millions of federal dollars into \nprojects in his home state. He eventually became an Appropriations \nsubcommittee chair, or ``cardinal,'' for Veterans, HUD, and Independent \nAgencies. Stokes was the second African-American ``cardinal'' ever (the \nfirst, Julian Dixon of California, chaired the DC Subcommittee). Years \nlater, Stokes said of the Appropriations Committee, ``It's the only \ncommittee to be on. All the rest is window dressing.'' In addition to \nchairing an Appropriations subcommittee, Stokes is one of fewer than \ntwo dozen African Americans ever to chair a House committee and one of \njust a handful to wield the gavel on multiple panels: the Permanent \nSelect Committee on Intelligence (100th Congress), the Committee on \nStandards of Official Conduct (97th-98th Congresses, 102nd Congress), \nand the Select Committee on Assassinations (95th Congress).\n  The growing ranks of black Members sought to create a power base, \nrealizing--in the words of Representative William (Bill) Clay, Sr. of \nMissouri they ``had to parlay massive voting potential into concrete \neconomic results.'', As freshman House Members, Stokes and Clay quickly \ndeveloped an enduring friendship and became strong supporters of the \nformation of the Congressional Black Caucus (CBC), to promote economic, \neducational, and social issues that were important to African \nAmericans. This strategy dovetailed with Stokes's perception of his \nrole as an advocate for the ``black community'' in his district. Stokes \nserved as chairman of the CBC for two consecutive terms beginning in \n1972, after Chairman Charles Diggs, Jr., of Michigan resigned from the \npost. A centrist, Stokes was widely credited with shepherding the group \naway from the polarizing politics of various black factions toward a \nmore stable and organized policy agenda.\n  Using his position as CBC chairman and his increasing influence on \nthe Appropriations Committee, Representative Stokes pushed a \nlegislative agenda that mirrored the needs of his majority-black \ndistrict. He earned a reputation as a congenial but determined activist \nfor minority issues, consistently scoring as one of the most liberal \nMembers of the House in the Americans for Democratic Action and the \nAmerican Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial Organizations \nvote tallies. He advocated more funding for education (particularly for \nminority colleges), affirmative action programs to employ more blacks, \nhousing and urban development projects, and initiatives to improve \naccess to health care for working-class Americans. In the 1980s, Stokes \nvocalized black concerns that the Ronald W. Reagan administration was \nintent on rolling back minority gains made in the 1960s and 1970s. He \ndescribed conservative efforts to scale back school desegregation \nefforts and affirmative action programs--as well as massive spending on \nmilitary programs--as a ``full scale attack'' on the priorities of the \nblack community. He also was an early advocate of federal government \nintervention in the fight against HIV/AIDS.\n\n  From his seat on the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nStokes was a particularly forceful critic of the Reagan \nadministration's foreign policy. He gained national prominence as a \nmember of the House Select Committee to Investigate Covert Arms \nTransactions with Iran when he grilled Lieutenant Colonel Oliver North \nin 1987 about his role in funding anticommunist Nicaraguan Contras \nthrough weapons sales to Tehran. At one juncture he reminded North, ``I \nwore [the uniform] as proudly as you do, even when our government \nrequired black and white soldiers in the same Army to live, sleep, eat \nand travel separate and apart, while fighting and dying for our \ncountry.''\n  House leaders repeatedly sought to capitalize on Stokes's image as a \nstable, trustworthy, and competent adjudicator--turning to him to lead \nhigh-profile committees and handle controversial national issues, as \nwell as the occasional ethics scandals in the House. When \nRepresentative Henry Gonzalez of Texas resigned as chairman of the \nSelect Committee on Assassinations, Speaker Thomas P. (Tip) O'Neill of \nMassachusetts tapped Stokes to lead the panel, which was investigating \nthe circumstances surrounding the deaths of President John F. Kennedy \nand Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. In 1978, Stokes's committee filed 27 \nvolumes of hearings and a final report that recommended administrative \nand legislative reforms. While the panel found that the King and the \nKennedy murders may have involved multiple assassins (James Earl Ray \nand Lee Harvey Oswald have traditionally been described as lone \nkillers), it concluded there was no evidence to support assertions of a \nbroad conspiracy involving domestic groups or foreign governments--an \nassessment that has been upheld for the past three decades. The \ncommittee did suggest that Oswald may have had an accomplice on Dealey \nPlaza, where Kennedy was killed in November 1963.\n  Stokes's chairmanship of the Select Committee on Assassinations led \nto his appointment by Speaker O'Neill in 1981 as chairman of the House \nCommittee on Standards of Official Conduct (often called the Ethics \nCommittee). Stokes steered the panel through a turbulent period that \nincluded investigations of Members implicated in the Federal Bureau of \nInvestigation's ABSCAM sting and a sex scandal that involved two House \nMembers and current and former House Pages.\n  During the 1990s, Stokes's seniority made him an influential voice on \nthe Appropriations Committee. In 1993, at the start of the 103rd \nCongress, he assumed the chairman's gavel of the Subcommittee on VA, \nHUD, and Independent Agencies, which controlled one of the largest \nchunks of discretionary spending in the federal budget. Stokes prodded \nfederal agencies to hire and serve more minorities. Republicans praised \nhim for his nonpartisan leadership of the subcommittee, but when the \nGOP won control of the House in the 1994 elections, and Stokes became \nthe Ranking Member of the panel, he often found himself fighting \nRepublican efforts to trim federal spending that involved cutting \nwelfare programs, including public housing.\n  In January 1998, Stokes announced his retirement from the House, \nnoting that he wanted to leave ``without ever losing an election.'' \nMoreover, a new generation of rising black politicians Cleveland was \ndisplacing those of Stokes's generation. Among his proudest \naccomplishments as a Representative, Stokes\n\n[[Page H5823]]\n\ncited his ability to bring Appropriations Committee money to his \ndistrict to address needs in housing and urban development and the \nopportunities that allowed him to set ``historic precedents'' as an \nAfrican American in the House. ``When I started this journey, I \nrealized that I was the first black American ever to hold this position \nin this state,'' Stokes told a newspaper reporter. ``I had to write the \nbook . . . I was going to set a standard of excellence that would give \nany successor something to shoot for.'' After his congressional career, \nLouis Stokes resumed his work as a lawyer. He was a great American \nHero--to be admired and remembered by us all.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the life of a truly \nremarkable man--former Congressman Louis B. Stokes, who passed away \nlast month at the age of 90.\n  It was my honor to meet with Congressman Stokes when I was a staffer \nin the office of Congressman Ron Dellums. I later had the honor to \nserve with him as a member of the House of Representatives as we worked \nto secure funding for homeless shelters in my district.\n  Congressman Stokes was a trailblazer.\n  Born in Cleveland in 1925, he loved his home city and his home state \nof Ohio. And he was determined to improve the lives of everyone in his \ncommunity. After serving in the military, he returned home to become a \ncivil rights attorney and work on behalf of the poor and \ndisenfranchised.\n  Raised in poverty along with his brother Carl, he dreamed of a more \njust and equal world. He refused to allow prejudice or adversity to \nslow him down.\n  Through his life, Lou showed an unwavering commitment to the people \nof Cleveland, and particularly the vulnerable and voiceless.\n  As the first African American member of Congress from Ohio--and an \noriginal cofounder of the Congressional Black Caucus and founding chair \nof the CBC's Health Brain Trust--Congressman Stokes was a proud voice \nfor civil rights and equality.\n  And as the first African American to serve on the House \nAppropriations committee--the committee on which I now serve--\nCongressman Stokes worked tirelessly to bring resources and \nopportunities to folks struggling across the country.\n  In many ways, Congressman Stokes was ahead of his time. He was one of \nthe earliest and most vocal supporters of addressing the burgeoning \nHIV/AIDS crisis.\n  As a veteran, he fought to ensure every veteran had the highest \npossible quality services and care upon returning home. And as the \nchairman of the Appropriations subcommittee on Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development, he worked to ensure agency services \nreached communities of color.\n  His work to combat discrimination in every form--housing, education, \nhealth care access, economic opportunity and more--continues to inspire \nme.\n  While Congressman Stokes will be greatly missed, his legacy and work \nlives on.\n  By opening doors of opportunity, and inspiring generations of leaders \nin Cleveland, Ohio and beyond, Congressman Lou Stokes has made our \nnation a more just and equal place. He was a great man and a good \nfriend who will be greatly missed. My thoughts and prayers are with his \nfamily and my deepest gratitude for sharing this great human being with \nus.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5823-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5823-H5825]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      IRAN'S PAST BEHAVIOR IS AN INDICATOR OF ITS FUTURE BEHAVIOR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, it is a psychological fact of life that, \nwhen it comes to human beings, the best predictor of future behavior is \npast behavior, period, end of story.\n  Psychologists who study human behavior agree that past behavior is a \nuseful marker for future behavior, but only under certain specific \nconditions. For example, high-frequency, habitual behaviors are more \npredictive than infrequent behaviors. Predictions work best if done \nover short periods of time, based upon these behaviors. The anticipated \nsituation must be essentially the same as the past situation that \nactivated the behavior in the first place. Also, the behavior did not \nchange by corrective or negative action or feedback. The person must \nremain essentially unchanged in their consistent behavior. The person \nmust be fairly consistent in his or her behaviors over time.\n  Forensic psychologists that observe such behavior often use metaphor \nto warn of serious danger by referring to such individuals as ``a \nticking time bomb'' or as one ``carrying a hand grenade, and it is just \na matter of when the pin is pulled.''\n  What happens if we apply these same criteria to Iran's behavior? The \nresult is the same. Psychologically, there is no reason to expect \nfuture behavioral change, given Iran's 36 years of bad behavior.\n  The record of history since 1979 is clear with regard to Iran's \nactions with the West and, in particular, the United States. For 30 of \nthose 36 years, the United States has declared Iran as the most active \nstate sponsor of terrorism in the world.\n  For 36 years, Iran has brutally murdered more Americans than any \nother terror group or state sponsor of terror. Their clerics have \ndeclared fatwas on the United States; their leaders have dubbed us the \nGreat Satan and have called Israel a one-bomb state, with pledges to \neliminate their existence.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  That brutal behavior earned them treatment, and rightfully so, as a \npariah, shunned by global economy, diplomacy, and withholding \ninternational goodwill.\n  So what a fantastic time to accommodate a terrorist state and make a \ndeal.\n  Some, such as Secretary of State John Kerry, dismiss all of Iran's \nreticence as posturing rhetoric. How in God's name can we be so naive \nat the highest levels of our Republic to believe it?\n  How in God's name can we judge Iran's actions worthy of fair \ntreatment and goodwill?\n  Perhaps we should take the teachings of Christ as a guide when he \nstated:\n\n       Every good tree bears good fruit. A good tree cannot bear \n     bad fruit, but a bad tree bears bad fruit. Therefore, by \n     their fruits, you will know them.\n\n  Christ's words, of course, are true. Iranian deeds speak louder than \nwords. The problem is both word and deed are reprehensible, which \nshould cause us even more alarm.\n  Don't believe me? Here are the facts of Iranian actions under this \nregime.\n  1979, hostage crisis. From the moment this regime came into being, \nthe first act was to overrun the United States Embassy in Tehran, \nterrorizing 66 American hostages for 444 days, most of them, and \nforcing abandonment of our U.S. Embassy and consulates.\n  1982-1992, Lieutenant Colonel William Buckley, the CIA Station Chief \nand Vietnam warrior, decorated for valor, is tortured and brutally \nmurdered.\n  David Anderson, a reporter of great renown, was captured and held for \n7 years.\n  American University President David Dodge was captured and held for a \nyear.\n  1983, April 18, the U.S. Embassy in Beirut is bombed, murdering 63, \n17 of them Americans. The entire CIA Middle East contingent is \nreportedly murdered. The entire operation was directed by Hezbollah and \nfinanced by Iran.\n  October 23, the United States Marine barracks in Beirut was destroyed \nby the largest nonnuclear explosion detonated on Earth by the hand of \nan Iranian terrorist; 241 United States Marines are slaughtered, and \n100 are wounded.\n  During the same attack, the French barracks are destroyed by another \nIranian terrorist bomb that murders 58 French paratroopers.\n  December 12, 1983, the U.S. Embassy in Kuwait was bombed by Iranian \nterrorists from Iranian-backed Hezbollah and Dawa, murdering 5 and \nwounding 86. Seventeen members of the Dawa are captured and arrested in \nconnection. Iranian-sponsored terrorist acts then are perpetrated for \nyears to come to try to negotiate their release.\n  1984, September 20, United States Embassy annex in Beirut is \ndestroyed by Iranian-backed Hezbollah terrorists, murdering 22 \ncivilians and 2 U.S. soldiers.\n  1985, June 14, Trans World Airlines Flight 847 hijacked with 160 \nhostages. Robert Dean Stetham, a United States Navy diver, is forced to \nkneel in front of an open aircraft door, shot in the back of the head, \nand dumped onto the tarmac. The remaining hostages are released, \nfollowing terrorist releases from prisons in Israel and Lebanon.\n  1989, July 13, Dr. Abdul Rahman Ghassemlou, the Secretary General of \nthe Kurdish Democratic Party of Iran, was assassinated by Iranian \noperatives, along with two associates in Vienna, where he was secretly \nmeeting with envoys sent by then-Iranian President Akbar Hashemi \nRafsanjani.\n\n[[Page H5824]]\n\n  1991, August 8, the assassination of Shapour Bakhtiar, who was the \nlast Iranian Prime Minister prior to the Islamic Revolution by Iranian \noperatives. In a botched attempt on Bakhtiar's life in a Paris suburb \nbefore in 1980, his assailants murdered a French policeman and a female \nneighbor.\n  1992, March 17, the Israeli Embassy bombing in Buenos Aires, \nArgentina. Iran's terrorist proxy, Hezbollah, perpetrated the suicide \nbomb attack on the Israeli Embassy in Argentina, which murdered 29 \npeople and wounded 242 others, the great majority of which were \ncivilian bystanders in the vicinity of the embassy.\n  On the 17th of September 1992, Kurdish leader Dr. Mohammad Sadegh \nSaeid Sharafkandi and three other Iranian Kurds were assassinated at \nthe Mykonos Cafe in Berlin. German courts linked the Iranian Government \nand Minister of Intelligence, Ali Fallahian, to the assassination.\n  1994, July 18, Iran was directly responsible for the Argentinian-\nIsraeli Mutual Association Jewish community center bombing in Buenos \nAires, Argentina, which murdered 85 and wounded 300. The AMIA attack \nremains the deadliest terrorist attack in Argentina's history.\n  In 2006, an Argentine court ``declared former Iranian President \nHashemi Rafsanjani and eight others fugitives from justice in \nArgentina'' for their role in the AMIA bombing.\n  1996, June 25, 14 members of the Iranian-backed Saudi branch of \nHezbollah detonated a massive bomb in front of the Khobar Towers, a \nU.S. military housing complex in Saudi Arabia. The terrorist attack \nmurdered 19 Americans and wounded 372 of our service men and women.\n  The attackers detonated a parked truck laden with the equivalent of \nsomewhere between 3,000 and 8,000 pounds of explosive in the Khobar \nTowers parking lot. The resulting explosion ``sheared the face off an \neight-story structure which housed U.S. Air Force personnel.''\n  2003-2011, following the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, Iran undermined \nU.S. operations by ``consistently supplying weapons, its own advisers, \nand Iranian proxy Hezbollah advisers from Lebanon to multiple residence \ngroups, both Sunni and Shia,'' which targeted Coalition Forces.\n  For the U.S., ``concern revolved around Iran's role in arming and \nassisting the Shiite militias.'' In Iraq, ``the top killer of U.S. \ntroops'' were IEDs, or improvised explosive devices, which were \nprimarily supplied by Iran. In total, Iran's support for Iraqi \ninsurgents led to the death of thousands of U.S. soldiers and others in \nIraq.\n  In 2010, United States Ambassador to Iraq James Jeffrey stated, ``Up \nto a quarter, or 1,200 of the American casualties, and some of the more \nhorrific incidents in which Americans were kidnapped can be traced \nwithout doubt to these Iranian groups.''\n  I should also personally note that many were my friends, and all were \nmy brothers and sisters as fellow warriors.\n  2006-2015, Iranian support for the Taliban against United States \ntroops in Afghanistan has been ongoing since at least 2006. According \nto a RAND report, ``although Iran has traditionally backed Tajik and \nShia groups opposed to the Taliban, its enmity with the United States \nand tensions over the nuclear program led it to provide measured \nsupport to the Taliban.''\n  According to the Treasury Department, ``since at least 2006, Iran has \narranged frequent shipments of small arms and associated ammunition, \nrocket-propelled grenades, mortar rounds, 107 mm rockets, plastic \nexplosives, and probably man-portable defense systems to the Taliban.''\n  A member of my own staff left limbs in Afghanistan by these devices.\n  Through ``Qods force materials support,'' the report states, ``we \nbelieve Iran is seeking to inflict casualties on U.S. and NATO \nforces.'' In 2010, multiple media sources reported Iran as ``paying \nTaliban fighters $1,000 for each U.S. soldier they kill in \nAfghanistan.'' This is currently.\n  Over a 6-month period in 2010, one ``Taliban treasurer'' claimed to \nhave collected more than $77,000 from an Iranian firm in Kabul as \npayment for killing Americans.\n  2011, October, U.S. authorities thwarted a terrorist plot in this \ntown, Washington, D.C., which included ``the assassination of Saudi \nArabian Ambassador to the United States and subsequent bomb attacks on \nSaudi and Israeli Embassies.''\n  U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder stated that the plot was ``directed \nand approved by elements of the Iranian Government and, specifically, \nsenior members of the Quds Force''--in this town. The two individuals \ncharged were ``Manssor Arbabsiar, a 56-year-old naturalized U.S. \ncitizen holding both Iranian and U.S. passports, and Gholam Shakuri, an \nIran-based member of Iran's Quds Force.''\n  U.S. authorities arrested Arbabsiar on September 29, 2011, with \nShakuri remaining at large.\n  2012, in March, Azerbaijan. United States and Israeli officials were \namong those targeted for assassination by a group of the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps from Iran-linked terrorists. They were \narrested in Baku, Azerbaijan.\n  According to The Washington Post, ``United States and Middle Eastern \nofficials now see the attempts as part of a broader campaign by Iran-\nlinked operatives to kill foreign diplomats in at least seven countries \nover a span of 13 months.''\n  How right they were.\n  13-14 February, New Delhi, India, the wife of Israeli Defense attache \nand her driver were wounded after a device attached to their car \nexploded. The Delhi police concluded that the suspects were members of \nthe Iranian Revolutionary Guard Corps.\n  A similar device was defused in Tbilisi, Georgia, after being \ndiscovered on the underside of an Israeli diplomat's car.\n  The following day, three Iranian men accidentally detonated a cache \nof explosives--darn--in Bangkok, Thailand. The explosives were intended \nto be used to assassinate Israeli diplomats. A multinational \ninvestigation has produced ``the clearest evidence yet that Iran was \ninvolved'' in all three plots.\n  18 July, a suicide bomber destroyed an Israeli tour bus in Burgas, \nBulgaria, murdering the bus driver and five Israelis, and wounding more \nthan 30 others. In an investigation in 2012, the Bulgarian Government \nfound Iran and its proxy, Hezbollah, responsible for the attack.\n  Behavior, behavior, 36 consistent years. But now President Obama \nwants to negotiate with terrorists to prevent war.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are not the attackers here. Threat of war only comes \nfrom the United States when we are bullied, cajoled, attacked, or \nthreatened. The President and Secretaries Kerry, Lew, and Moniz want us \nto show goodwill for bad behavior.\n  The American people are against it, as evidenced by the strong \nopposition from the majority of Americans who rightly deduce the deal \nwould allow nuclear capacity for Iran and makes a legal path to possess \nweapons of mass destruction.\n  The President often makes political speeches demanding we keep \ndangerous firearms out of the hands of those with psychological \nproblems, yet, under identical behavioral criteria, he would give \nnuclear capacity to Iran.\n  While public multiple-victim shootings are horrific, imagine an Iran \nwith a nuclear capacity. Given Iran's prolific use of every form of \nweaponry and export of terror, are our leaders so naive to think Iran's \nbehavior would be any better than putting a weapon in the hands of a \npsychologically consistent and dangerous individual?\n  Past behavior is the best predictor of future behavior. Any \npsychologist or criminologist will tell you this, yet the President is \nselling us on the deluded hope that this is somehow the right and only \npath to take. Nonsense.\n  No alternative you say? How can that be?\n  Our own administration does not even realize that Iran's \ninterpretation of this very deal and ours are separated by a fairly \nproblematic gulf.\n  In the last month, even the last few days, Iran's President Rouhani \nand his foreign ministry have made public statements that declare the \nfollowing regarding this good deal. According to Iran and its \nstatements from its leaders, here is what they think they have agreed \nto:\n  Iran can pursue the development of missiles without any restriction.\n  They can violate the U.N. resolutions without violating the \nagreement. Iran says it is not a treaty but binding.\n\n[[Page H5825]]\n\n  Iran can violate the U.N. Security Council Resolution without \nviolating the JCPOA, or the agreement.\n  Iran intends to violate the United Nations Security Council \nResolution restrictions on weapons sales and imports. In fact, they are \nalready negotiating with Russia for the sale of SS-300 and -400 \nmissiles.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  And Iran also has not agreed to inspect Parchin itself, but it will \nrefuse to let anyone else inspect it.\n  These are from their own statements in recent days. Iran's public \nstatements declare, Mr. Speaker, that all sanctions will be lifted.\n  Under Iran's interpretation and even in the stated language of the \nagreement, this includes those, such as the Islamic Revolutionary \nGuards Corps--they are in the agreement; they are listed--and the Quds \nForce, the same organization that we just itemized all of these \nterrorist acts, both of these groups. Two of the most reprehensible \nterrorist organizations in the world are in this agreement for \nsanctions to be lifted. Read them. Annex II sanctions list. I have.\n  This flies in the face of our President's own statements and \nreassurances. Under Secretary of Treasury Szubin assures us that \nsanctions on these organizations will be maintained.\n  Secretary of Treasury Lew even goes further and has stated recently \nthat, ``We will not be providing any sanctions relief to any of these \nlines of activity and will not be delisting from sanctions the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guards Corps, the Quds Force, or any of their \nsubsidiaries or senior officials.''\n  Then, why are they in the deal? According to the agreement and even \nIran's recent public statements, they believe that they will be lifted.\n  Terrorists Soleimani, A.Q. Khan, numerous organizations that I have \nhad to fight on battlefields, now we will reward their bad behavior \nwith goodwill.\n  The Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps and the Quds Force are both \nlisted in this agreement and have sanctions against them lifted, \naccording to interpretations of its terms. What a great deal. There is \nnone better. This is the best we can do.\n  President Hassan Rouhani declared last month, ``After the agreement \nis implemented, the economic sanctions will be immediately removed, \nmeaning, financial, banking, insurance, transportation, petrochemical \nsanctions. All economic sanctions will be removed.''\n  Congratulations, Mr. President, on that good deal and that goodwill.\n  Mr. Speaker, our Nation is in grave danger. We are trusting a \npsychologically fanatical and terrorist State with 36 consistent years \nof bad behavior to now behave well.\n  Perhaps the only thing missing to shore up the President and \nSecretary Kerry's reassurances is perhaps an airplane on the tarmac \nwith an open door with our United States leader waving a document in \nhis hand, declaring, ``Peace in our time.''\n  The power of this Nation only rests with the consent of the people. \nThat is where the Congress, both parties, this august body, comes in.\n  But now our President even wants to find a political way to strip the \nAmerican people from a vote by their duly elected representatives to \navoid the optics of an opposition.\n  I guess he and President Hassan Rouhani of Iran do have something \nvery much in common after all: not allowing a vote in their respective \nlegislative bodies. One would expect that from a fanatical, unstable, \nreligious dictatorship, but not in the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President is outside his constitutional authority. \nNo other President in the history of our Nation has ever cobbled \ntogether sanctions provisions meant to prevent nuclear capacity, to \nprovide a de facto treaty with a foreign rogue State and give them what \nthe sanctions were intended to deny.\n  The President has acted without the consent of the people. Therefore, \nMr. Speaker, the people, through their duly elected Representatives, \nwill now act without the consent of the President.\n  Article I, Section 8, of the United States Constitution, a document I \nhave defended since I was 18, states that the power to regulate \ncommerce with foreign nations rests in the Congress of these United \nStates.\n  Article II, Section 2, states that the President can only make a \nbinding treaty with a foreign nation upon two-thirds consent with the \nSenate.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President states that this is not a treaty. We \nagree. And, therefore, constitutionally, we are not bound to abide by \nit. Neither are the States.\n  The Supremacy Clause does not apply here. It is not a treaty. Not \nhaving the effect of treaty law, the States are free to act. And today \nthey are and will. And we will.\n  I call upon my colleagues, people that have taken an oath to support \nand defend this republic, to stand with me.\n  We will declare the lifting of sanctions of terrorists as laid out in \nthe agreement as null and void. It is illegal under past U.S. sanctions \nlaw.\n  We will uphold United States sanctions law against executive fiat \naction. We will make explicit the sense of Congress in upcoming State \nactions both legally and economically.\n  We will prevent the lifting of sanctions on scores of those listed in \nthe agreement, thereby violating section 37 of Annex II of the Iran \ndeal.\n  We will send a strong message to Iran that the power of this republic \ndoes not rest with its President. It rests by the consent of the \npeople. We are bound to uphold that trust as our constitutional duty.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also call upon Americans to stand with me. Pound the \nWhite House with calls and emails. Support State legislative actions \nand sanctions. Support your representatives, both State and assembly, \nand your U.S. Representatives in this fight.\n  We ask the people to support us in this fight, not shoot us in the \nback, regardless of political party with anger and cynicism, leveling \nblame on those who oppose this deal rather than on the one who has \ncreated it.\n  Then, if we do this, what will the future look like? It will look \nlike an Iran contained, not an Iran accommodated. It will look like a \nNation that led rather than cowered.\n  It will have a United States that stands firm when Iran, a signatory \nto the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, does--if they ever do--decide \nto go rogue, will be like North Korea, when a previous administration \nassured us that, if we reached out to them with the IAEA and lifting of \nsanctions and easing, that they would come around.\n  They abandoned it. We should have known it. Their bad behavior was \nconsistent. That future was predictable. They have nuclear weapons, and \nwe knew it. We said we could trust them in a similar agreement.\n  But our country will stand for free people and free economies on this \nglobe. It is what we do. And if we fail in that task, who will take our \nplace?\n  How we fight today determines how we shape tomorrow. Accommodating \nterrorists and nations with 36 consistent years of bad behavior is not \nthe best deal we have. If Iran, like Libya, displays good behavior \nfirst, then we will have a basis for discussion and follow-on goodwill, \nwhich we saw in that case.\n  Until then, the power of the republic rests with its people, not with \nits executive. Let us never waiver from that position. As long as we \ntreasure this republic and its Constitution, this will defend.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5825-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5825-H5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              REMEMBERING FORMER CONGRESSMAN LOUIS STOKES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer) until 10 p.m.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise regretting that I was unable to be \nhere when Marcy Kaptur, the gentlewoman from Ohio, was talking about \nRepresentative Louis Stokes.\n  Congressman Stokes and I were very good friends. I had the \nopportunity to serve with him for many years. And I wanted to take this \ntime, Mr. Speaker, to thank Ms. Kaptur for leading the special order.\n  On August 18, we learned of the passing of our friend, former \nRepresentative Lou Stokes.\n  He was a reluctant candidate, Mr. Speaker, who went on to serve his \nconstituents for three decades. I have had the honor of serving here \nfor 34 years.\n\n[[Page H5826]]\n\n  But when I first came here, of course, I thought Lou Stokes had been \nhere forever. I don't really think I have been here forever.\n  But he was a friend to all, respected by his colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle and beloved by his constituents. For three decades, he \nserved here and left a lasting imprint on a State, our Nation, and, \nindeed, the world.\n  Lou Stokes was the first African American to represent Ohio and the \nfirst to chair the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence. He was \nchairman as well of the Black Caucus and a tireless campaigner for \ncivil rights and equality.\n  Moreover, he was also the first African American to serve on the \nAppropriations Committee, where he and I were colleagues. I sat just \ntwo chairs from him for almost a decade along with Ms. Kaptur for a \nnumber of years.\n  He chaired the Appropriations Subcommittee for Veterans Affairs and \nHousing and Urban Development. That chairmanship reflected \nRepresentative Stokes' longstanding mission to address the unmet needs \nof millions of Americans living in inner city neighborhoods, like many \nof those in Cleveland who sent him to Congress.\n  Having been raised in a housing project himself along with his \nbrother, former Cleveland Mayor Carl Stokes, he made it his mission to \nensure that Congress was paying attention to the important issues of \naffordable housing, access to jobs, healthcare delivery, and crime \nprevention.\n  As a veteran, Representative Stokes never wavered from his \ndetermination to make certain that Congress was meeting its \nresponsibility to those who had served our Nation in uniform.\n  I was saddened to learn of his passing. In his 90 years, \nRepresentative Stokes lived a very rich and full life. He was full of \nlife and a deep and abiding love for his family, this House, the State, \nand Nation that he served so ably.\n  Lou Stokes was a gentleman and a gentle man. He was a giant in \nintegrity and in intellect, committed to common sense, courage, and \nseeking the right answers for his people, for his State, and for his \ncountry.\n  It is a testament to him that his four children all followed him into \ncareers that helped better their communities and our country.\n  One is an administrator at Howard University. Another is a well-\nrespected journalist and news anchor in New York. The third is a \nCleveland municipal court judge. And the fourth is an editor and public \naffairs director for a television station in Detroit.\n  He was extraordinarily proud of his children and of his \ngrandchildren. They, like all of us in this House who served with him, \nMr. Speaker, were and are extraordinarily proud of Congressman Louis \nStokes.\n  I join in extending my condolences to them, to their mother, \nRepresentative Stokes' wife of 55 years, Angela, and to the seven \ngrandchildren that Representative Stokes so cherished.\n  The House of Representatives was made a better body by having Lou \nStokes serve in this hall. A grateful Nation thanks him and his family \nfor sharing his life with all of us who had the honor and privilege and \njoy of serving by his side in this revered House of the people that he \nloved and who loved him.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5826-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. McCollum (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nfuneral in district.\n  Ms. Roybal-Allard (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/08/house-section/article/H5826-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5826]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE BILLS REFERRED\n\n  Bills of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 267.
