Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, the simple truth is \nthese trade agreements are destroying our middle class. They are \ncausing millions of Americans in mining and manufacturing to lose their \njobs, millions of others to lose wages and benefits. It now takes two \nor three jobs to earn the same kind of income that one used to be able \nto earn from one job before these trade agreements.\n  The fact is, over the last century, we built the strongest middle \nclass in the history of this world with living wages and benefits and \nprotections for health and safety and the environment; but with the \nemergence of these trade agreements, we are asking Americans to compete \nwith countries who have little or none of these benefits. To compete, \nAmericans would have to give up on all this progress, give up on the \nAmerican Dream. That is what this is all about.\n  I have reviewed the TPP documents and, make no mistake about it, this \nis a race to the bottom. The time has come for Congress to say ``no'' \nto these agreements. The time has come to put an end to them. They have \nbeen negotiated in secret for the benefit of a few and kept from the \npublic for the benefit of the few at the top of our economic ladder.\n  The fact is it is destroying the American Dream--the American \neconomy, the middle class, and, with that, the American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4246-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            NATIONAL COLLEGIATE ATHLETICS ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nthe National Collegiate Athletic Accountability Act introduced by my \nfriend and Penn State fellow alumnus, Congressman Charlie Dent.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no secret that for years the NCAA has failed \nwhen it comes to following their own rules. It has certainly failed \nwhen it comes to unduly exerting their perceived powers over college \nathletics.\n  The bipartisan National Collegiate Athletics Accountability Act will \nensure that the NCAA is held to the highest standard possible by \nproviding much-needed accountability and reforms. The NCAA Act would \nprohibit universities from receiving title IV funds if they participate \nin athletic associations that do not implement and enforce specific \nrules related to student athletes' health, safety, education, and due \nprocess protections.\n  For far too long, we have seen the NCAA fail to protect the well-\nbeing of our student athletes, and this bipartisan legislation is a \nhuge step in the right direction to help fix that.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this \nbipartisan measure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4246-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      STOP TRADE ADJUSTMENT ASSISTANCE AND SAVE AMERICA'S ECONOMY\n\n  (Mr. DeFAZIO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, how many times will Congress pretend to be \nfooled by yet another job-killing trade agreement.\n  First, there was NAFTA. They told us it would create hundreds of \nthousands of jobs. Unfortunately, they neglected to say they would be \nsouth of the border, and they would be at the expense of American \nworkers.\n  Then there was the WTO. We are going to level the playing field--\nyeah, it is at bargain-basement prices--and compete with Chinese \nworkers at 25 cents an hour and unfair trade practices.\n  Now, the Obama administration has a new paradigm--Korea. ``This is \nthe model for the future. It is going to be great.'' We are already \nrunning larger trade deficits with Korea. We have already lost 50,000 \njobs.\n  Now, the last, biggest, worst trade agreement--the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership. Ironically, a key vote will be over something called trade \nadjustment assistance. That is right; it is critical. We have to have \nthat because hundreds of thousands or millions of Americans are going \nto lose their jobs, so we need to retrain them for McDonald's or other \nhigh-level jobs. Secondly, of course, the trade adjustment assistance \nis funded by cutting Medicare.\n  So this is the critical vote. Ironically, this is it. They have got \nthe votes from corporate America and the Obama administration to jam \nthis thing through unless we kill trade adjustment assistance. We can \nstop it here today and save America's economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4246-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  BRINGING MILITARY WORKING DOGS HOME\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, the actions of the brave men and women in \nthe military sacrifice so much for our country. Many of these soldiers \non the front lines are aided by military working dogs who perform \ncountless, dangerous actions on the battlefield. So it is easy to \nunderstand why there is a special bond that is formed between \nservicemembers and their military service dogs.\n  Currently, the Department of Defense is not required to bring these \ndogs home after they are retired, and this means veterans are often \nforced to spend their own money to transport them back to the United \nStates for adoption. That is why I have introduced bipartisan \nlegislation with my colleague, Congresswoman Kyrsten Sinema, that would \nfix this problem by ensuring that military working dogs are returned to \nthe United States for adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a waiting list of over 1,200 people looking to \nadopt these canines, and ensuring that our troops and veterans can \neasily adopt these dogs honors their service and their partnership.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4246-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      HONORING CHARLES ``BOB'' PROVINE, JR., ON HIS 95TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McNERNEY.

During this time, Bob saw combat action in Germany and \nserved in the occupation of Czechoslovakia and Germany, finally coming \nhome to Antioch.\n  After serving our great Nation at war, Bob served his community in \npeace as a volunteer firefighter and, for many years, as a volunteer at \nthe public library. Bob saw Antioch grow from 35,000 to over 100,000 \npeople.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring Bob Provine for his \nservice to his community and to our great Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4246-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4246-H4247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HUMAN TRAFFICKING IN NEPAL\n\n  (Mr. HULTGREN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to not only \nthe human toll incurred by Nepal's earthquakes in April, but also \natrocious exploitation occurring in the aftermath.\n\n[[Page H4247]]\n\n  Recent news reports have revealed that criminal groups, some \nmasquerading as relief workers, are luring young girls and boys across \nborders into brothels in India into forced prostitution or into forced \nlabor. Some traffickers have put a price on these young ones' lives, \noffering $500 per child.\n  It is truly sickening that these criminals are using the chaos and \ninsecurity following an earthquake that claimed 8,000 lives to steal \nmany more vulnerable lives. The United Nations and some NGOs estimate \nbetween 12,000 and 15,000 girls are trafficked from Nepal alone.\n  As a member of the Tom Lantos Human Rights Commission, I have \nintroduced legislation targeting the demand for sex trafficking. Those \nwho sell and purchase these young lives must be brought to justice, and \ngovernment must take action.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express the importance of \ninvesting in our Nation's infrastructure. This is all about the future \neconomy of this Nation and jobs, jobs, and jobs.\n  Today, we are living off the investments that our parents and our \ngrandparents made generations ago. Let me give you an example of what \nwe are trying to do in California.\n  A high-speed rail project is a great example of how you invest in the \nfuture. This project in California will create 20,000 jobs annually for \nthe next 5 years, a fact important not only to California, but my \ndistrict, which is economically challenged.\n  Workforce investment boards in my district and throughout the valley \nhave dedicated resources to making sure that the local workforce is \nready to build. Apprenticeship programs like these connect \ndisadvantaged workers with good-paying jobs and boost the valley's \neconomy.\n  The California high-speed rail project, which combines Federal, \nState, and private sector investments, will ensure that our State \ntransportation infrastructure is fit for the 21st century.\n  Here in our Nation's Capital, we need to provide the long-term \nfunding for infrastructure across the Nation. That is what we need to \ndo: to invest in our water projects and invest in our transportation \nprojects. That is what we need for jobs in the 21st century.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4247-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ARMY'S 240TH BIRTHDAY\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina.

Established on June 14, 1775, as \nthe Continental Army, the U.S. Army faithfully protects American \nfamilies.\n  I am grateful to represent Fort Jackson, the largest initial-entry \ntraining facility in the U.S. Army. Last month, I attended Fort \nJackson's change of command, where I was honored to recognize Major \nGeneral Bradley Becker and Brigadier General Roger Cloutier for their \nleadership and dedicated service.\n  As the son of an Army Air Corps Flying Tiger of the 14th Air Force \nand as the father of three sons currently serving in the South Carolina \nArmy National Guard and myself as a veteran of the Army Reserve in the \nSouth Carolina Army National Guard, I am grateful to know firsthand of \nthe competence and patriotism of our servicemembers.\n  Twenty-five years ago today, I visited the Berlin Wall and was denied \nentry into East Germany at the Brandenburg Gate.

and\n       (13) to take into account conditions relating to religious \n     freedom of any party to negotiations for a trade agreement \n     with the United States.\n       (b) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives.--\n       (1) Trade in goods.--The principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding trade in goods are--\n       (A) to expand competitive market opportunities for exports \n     of goods from the United States and to obtain fairer and more \n     open conditions of trade, including through the utilization \n     of global value chains, by reducing or eliminating tariff and \n     nontariff barriers and policies and practices of foreign \n     governments directly related to trade that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or otherwise distort \n     United States trade; and\n       (B) to obtain reciprocal tariff and nontariff barrier \n     elimination agreements, including with respect to those \n     tariff categories covered in section 111(b) of the Uruguay \n     Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3521(b)).\n       (2) Trade in services.--(A) The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States regarding trade in services is \n     to expand competitive market opportunities for United States \n     services and to obtain fairer and more open conditions of \n     trade, including through utilization of global value chains, \n     by reducing or eliminating barriers to international trade in \n     services, such as regulatory and other barriers that deny \n     national treatment and market access or unreasonably restrict \n     the establishment or operations of service suppliers.\n       (B) Recognizing that expansion of trade in services \n     generates benefits for all sectors of the economy and \n     facilitates trade, the objective described in subparagraph \n     (A) should be pursued through all means, including through a \n     plurilateral agreement with those countries willing and able \n     to undertake high standard services commitments for both \n     existing and new services.\n       (3) Trade in agriculture.--The principal negotiating \n     objective of the United States with respect to agriculture is \n     to obtain competitive opportunities for United States exports \n     of agricultural commodities in foreign markets substantially \n     equivalent to the competitive opportunities afforded foreign \n     exports in United States markets and to achieve fairer and \n     more open conditions of trade in bulk, specialty crop, and \n     value added commodities by--\n       (A) securing more open and equitable market access through \n     robust rules on sanitary and phytosanitary measures that--\n       (i) encourage the adoption of international standards and \n     require a science-based justification be provided for a \n     sanitary or phytosanitary measure if the measure is more \n     restrictive than the applicable international standard;\n       (ii) improve regulatory coherence, promote the use of \n     systems-based approaches, and appropriately recognize the \n     equivalence of health and safety protection systems of \n     exporting countries;\n       (iii) require that measures are transparently developed and \n     implemented, are based on risk assessments that take into \n     account relevant international guidelines and scientific \n     data, and are not more restrictive on trade than necessary to \n     meet the intended purpose; and\n       (iv) improve import check processes, including testing \n     methodologies and procedures, and certification requirements,\n     while recognizing that countries may put in place measures to \n     protect human, animal, or plant life or health in a manner \n     consistent with their international obligations, including \n     the WTO Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and \n     Phytosanitary Measures (referred to in section 101(d)(3) of \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements Act (19 U.S.C. 3511(d)(3)));\n       (B) reducing or eliminating, by a date certain, tariffs or \n     other charges that decrease market opportunities for United \n     States exports--\n       (i) giving priority to those products that are subject to \n     significantly higher tariffs or subsidy regimes of major \n     producing countries; and\n       (ii) providing reasonable adjustment periods for United \n     States import sensitive products, in close consultation with \n     Congress on such products before initiating tariff reduction \n     negotiations;\n       (C) reducing tariffs to levels that are the same as or \n     lower than those in the United States;\n       (D) reducing or eliminating subsidies that decrease market \n     opportunities for United States exports or unfairly distort \n     agriculture markets to the detriment of the United States;\n       (E) allowing the preservation of programs that support \n     family farms and rural communities but do not distort trade;\n       (F) developing disciplines for domestic support programs, \n     so that production that is in excess of domestic food \n     security needs is sold at world prices;\n       (G) eliminating government policies that create price \n     depressing surpluses;\n       (H) eliminating state trading enterprises whenever \n     possible;\n       (I) developing, strengthening, and clarifying rules to \n     eliminate practices that unfairly decrease United States \n     market access opportunities or distort agricultural markets \n     to the detriment of the United States, and ensuring that such \n     rules are subject to efficient, timely, and effective dispute \n     settlement, including--\n       (i) unfair or trade distorting activities of state trading \n     enterprises and other administrative mechanisms, with \n     emphasis on requiring price transparency in the operation of \n     state trading enterprises and such other mechanisms in order \n     to end cross subsidization, price discrimination, and price \n     undercutting;\n       (ii) unjustified trade restrictions or commercial \n     requirements, such as labeling, that affect new technologies, \n     including biotechnology;\n       (iii) unjustified sanitary or phytosanitary restrictions, \n     including restrictions not based on scientific principles in \n     contravention of obligations in the Uruguay Round Agreements \n     or bilateral or regional trade agreements;\n       (iv) other unjustified technical barriers to trade; and\n       (v) restrictive rules in the administration of tariff rate \n     quotas;\n       (J) eliminating practices that adversely affect trade in \n     perishable or cyclical products, while improving import \n     relief mechanisms to recognize the unique characteristics of \n     perishable and cyclical agriculture;\n       (K) ensuring that import relief mechanisms for perishable \n     and cyclical agriculture are as accessible and timely to \n     growers in the United States as those mechanisms that are \n     used by other countries;\n       (L) taking into account whether a party to the negotiations \n     has failed to adhere to the provisions of already existing \n     trade agreements with the United States or has circumvented \n     obligations under those agreements;\n       (M) taking into account whether a product is subject to \n     market distortions by reason of a failure of a major \n     producing country to adhere to the provisions of already \n     existing trade agreements with the United States or by the \n     circumvention by that country of its obligations under those \n     agreements;\n       (N) otherwise ensuring that countries that accede to the \n     World Trade Organization have made meaningful market \n     liberalization commitments in agriculture;\n       (O) taking into account the impact that agreements covering \n     agriculture to which the United States is a party have on the \n     United States agricultural industry;\n       (P) maintaining bona fide food assistance programs, market \n     development programs, and export credit programs;\n       (Q) seeking to secure the broadest market access possible \n     in multilateral, regional, and bilateral negotiations, \n     recognizing the effect that simultaneous sets of negotiations \n     may have on United States import sensitive commodities \n     (including those subject to tariff rate quotas);\n       (R) seeking to develop an international consensus on the \n     treatment of seasonal or perishable agricultural products in \n     investigations relating to dumping and safeguards and in any \n     other relevant area;\n       (S) seeking to establish the common base year for \n     calculating the Aggregated Measurement of Support (as defined \n     in the Agreement on Agriculture) as the end of each country's \n     Uruguay Round implementation period, as reported in each \n     country's Uruguay Round market access schedule;\n       (T) ensuring transparency in the administration of tariff \n     rate quotas through multilateral, plurilateral, and bilateral \n     negotiations; and\n       (U) eliminating and preventing the undermining of market \n     access for United States products through improper use of a \n     country's system for protecting or recognizing geographical \n     indications, including failing to ensure transparency and \n     procedural fairness and protecting generic terms.\n       (4) Foreign investment.--Recognizing that United States law \n     on the whole provides a high level of protection for \n     investment, consistent with or greater than the level \n     required by international law, the principal negotiating \n     objectives of the United States regarding foreign investment \n     are to reduce or eliminate artificial or trade distorting \n     barriers to foreign investment, while ensuring that foreign \n     investors in the\n\n[[Page H4249]]\n\n     United States are not accorded greater substantive rights \n     with respect to investment protections than United States \n     investors in the United States, and to secure for investors \n     important rights comparable to those that would be available \n     under United States legal principles and practice, by--\n       (A) reducing or eliminating exceptions to the principle of \n     national treatment;\n       (B) freeing the transfer of funds relating to investments;\n       (C) reducing or eliminating performance requirements, \n     forced technology transfers, and other unreasonable barriers \n     to the establishment and operation of investments;\n       (D) seeking to establish standards for expropriation and \n     compensation for expropriation, consistent with United States \n     legal principles and practice;\n       (E) seeking to establish standards for fair and equitable \n     treatment, consistent with United States legal principles and \n     practice, including the principle of due process;\n       (F) providing meaningful procedures for resolving \n     investment disputes;\n       (G) seeking to improve mechanisms used to resolve disputes \n     between an investor and a government through--\n       (i) mechanisms to eliminate frivolous claims and to deter \n     the filing of frivolous claims;\n       (ii) procedures to ensure the efficient selection of \n     arbitrators and the expeditious disposition of claims;\n       (iii) procedures to enhance opportunities for public input \n     into the formulation of government positions; and\n       (iv) providing for an appellate body or similar mechanism \n     to provide coherence to the interpretations of investment \n     provisions in trade agreements; and\n       (H) ensuring the fullest measure of transparency in the \n     dispute settlement mechanism, to the extent consistent with \n     the need to protect information that is classified or \n     business confidential, by--\n       (i) ensuring that all requests for dispute settlement are \n     promptly made public;\n       (ii) ensuring that--\n\n       (I) all proceedings, submissions, findings, and decisions \n     are promptly made public;

and\n       (ii) with respect to labor, decisions regarding the \n     distribution of enforcement resources are not a reason for \n     not complying with a party's labor obligations; a party to a \n     trade agreement retains the right to reasonable exercise of \n     discretion and to make bona fide decisions regarding the \n     allocation of resources between labor enforcement activities \n     among core labor standards, provided the exercise of such \n     discretion and such decisions are not inconsistent with its \n     obligations;\n       (C) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to promote respect for core labor standards (as \n     defined in section 111(7));\n       (D) to strengthen the capacity of United States trading \n     partners to protect the environment through the promotion of \n     sustainable development;\n       (E) to reduce or eliminate government practices or policies \n     that unduly threaten sustainable development;\n       (F) to seek market access, through the elimination of \n     tariffs and nontariff barriers, for United States \n     environmental technologies, goods, and services;\n       (G) to ensure that labor, environmental, health, or safety \n     policies and practices of the parties to trade agreements \n     with the United States do not arbitrarily or unjustifiably \n     discriminate against United States exports or serve as \n     disguised barriers to trade;\n       (H) to ensure that enforceable labor and environment \n     obligations are subject to the same dispute settlement and \n     remedies as other enforceable obligations under the \n     agreement; and\n       (I) to ensure that a trade agreement is not construed to \n     empower a party's authorities to undertake labor or \n     environmental law enforcement activities in the territory of \n     the United States.\n       (11) Currency.--The principal negotiating objective of the \n     United States with respect to currency practices is that \n     parties to a trade agreement with the United States avoid \n     manipulating exchange rates in order to prevent effective \n     balance of payments adjustment or to gain an unfair \n     competitive advantage over other parties to the agreement, \n     such as through cooperative mechanisms, enforceable rules, \n     reporting, monitoring, transparency, or other means, as \n     appropriate.\n       (12) Foreign currency manipulation.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     unfair currency practices is to seek to establish \n     accountability through enforceable rules, transparency, \n     reporting, monitoring, cooperative mechanisms, or other means \n     to address exchange rate manipulation involving protracted \n     large scale intervention in one direction in the exchange \n     markets and a persistently undervalued foreign exchange rate \n     to gain an unfair competitive advantage in trade over other \n     parties to a trade agreement, consistent with existing \n     obligations of the United States as a member of the \n     International Monetary Fund and the World Trade Organization.\n       (13) WTO and multilateral trade agreements.--Recognizing \n     that the World Trade Organization is the foundation of the \n     global trading system, the principal negotiating objectives \n     of the United States regarding the World Trade Organization, \n     the Uruguay Round Agreements, and other multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements are--\n       (A) to achieve full implementation and extend the coverage \n     of the World Trade Organization and multilateral and \n     plurilateral agreements to products, sectors, and conditions \n     of trade not adequately covered;\n       (B) to expand country participation in and enhancement of \n     the Information Technology Agreement, the Government \n     Procurement Agreement, and other plurilateral trade \n     agreements of the World Trade Organization;\n       (C) to expand competitive market opportunities for United \n     States exports and to obtain fairer and more open conditions \n     of trade, including through utilization of global value \n     chains, through the negotiation of new WTO multilateral and \n     plurilateral trade agreements, such as an agreement on trade \n     facilitation;\n       (D) to ensure that regional trade agreements to which the \n     United States is not a party fully achieve the high standards \n     of, and comply with, WTO disciplines, including Article XXIV \n     of GATT 1994, Article V and V bis of the General Agreement on \n     Trade in Services, and the Enabling Clause, including through \n     meaningful WTO review of such regional trade agreements;\n       (E) to enhance compliance by WTO members with their \n     obligations as WTO members through active participation in \n     the bodies of the World Trade Organization by the United \n     States and all other WTO members, including in the trade \n     policy review mechanism and the committee system of the World \n     Trade Organization, and by working to increase the \n     effectiveness of such bodies; and\n       (F) to encourage greater cooperation between the World \n     Trade Organization and other international organizations.\n       (14) Trade institution transparency.--The principal \n     negotiating objective of the United States with respect to \n     transparency is to obtain wider and broader application of \n     the principle of transparency in the World Trade \n     Organization, entities established under bilateral and \n     regional trade agreements, and other international trade fora \n     through seeking--\n       (A) timely public access to information regarding trade \n     issues and the activities of such institutions;\n       (B) openness by ensuring public access to appropriate \n     meetings, proceedings, and submissions, including with regard \n     to trade and investment dispute settlement;

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the motion.\n  The text of the motion is as follows:\n\n       Mr. Ryan of Wisconsin moves that the House concur in the \n     Senate amendment to H.R. 1314.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 305, the motion \nshall be debatable for 1 hour equally divided and controlled by the \nchair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  The gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Ryan) and the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Levin) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 1314, the Trade \nAct of 2015, currently under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as may I \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the question before us today is really pretty simple: Is \nAmerica going to shape the global economy or is it going to shape us? \nNinety-five percent of the world's consumers, they don't live in this \ncountry. They live in other countries. So if we want to create more \njobs in America, we have got to make more things here in America and \nsell them over there. In fact, one out of every five jobs in America \nalready today depends on trade, and you know what, that is a good thing \nbecause these jobs pay more. They pay on average 18 percent more. But \nwhile the world is moving full steam ahead we have been standing still, \nMr. Speaker.\n  We haven't completed a trade agreement in years. Today, there are 262 \nfree trade agreements in place across the world. We are a party to 14. \nSince 2007, when the last version of trade promotion authority expired, \nthere have been 100 trade agreements negotiated and signed. The U.S. is \na party to none of those. China is negotiating seven agreements right \nnow, including one with 16 countries.\n  In the global economy, if you are standing still, you are falling \nbehind because all these other countries are negotiating agreements \nwithout us. What that basically means is other countries are lowering \ntheir trade barriers between those countries. As a result of them \nlowering their trade barriers, making their products more affordable, \ngetting more market share, they are putting up barriers against our \nproducts, making it harder for us to get access to those markets.\n  Big companies can set up a factory in another country, make something \nthere, and sell it there. Getting trade agreements means removing those \nbarriers so we keep those factories here, so all businesses, big and \nsmall, can make things in America, grow things in America, and sell \nthem overseas.\n  Let me just give you an example. Since the year 2000 there have been \n48 trade agreements in East Asia alone. America has been a party to \nonly two of them, and as a result of that, our share of their imports \nfell by 42 percent.\n  The rules of the global economy are being written right now, Mr. \nSpeaker. That is not the question. The question is: Are we going to \nwrite the rules of the global economy with our allies or are we going \nto let other countries write the rules, such as China? This is why H.R. \n1314, the Trade Act, would establish TPA, or trade promotion authority.\n  Now, there has been a lot of confusion about this bill, a lot of \nhonest confusion and sometimes a lot of intentional confusion. Let me \nsay really clearly what this bill is.\n  TPA is not a trade deal. TPA is not a trade agreement. TPA is a \nprocess for negotiating a trade agreement. Congress is not considering \na trade agreement today. There is no secret agreement that nobody has \nread that is being voted on today. All we are voting on today is a \nprocess by which Congress considers trade agreements. The earliest we \nwould do so would be in the fall, at the earliest. Why should we care \nabout this process? Because a good process gets us a good result.\n  This TPA will give us the leverage that we, in Congress, need to get \na fair deal for the American worker because when other countries know \nthat the deal that they agreed to is a deal Congress will vote on they \nwill give us their best offers. Countries aren't going to give us a \ngood agreement if they have to negotiate with 535 people.\n  Here is how it works. Congress says to the President, when you submit \na trade agreement, we will give you an up-or-down vote on three \nconditions. First, you have got to pursue specific negotiating \nobjectives, 150 of them. Here is what we want to see in a trade \nagreement and here is what cannot be in a trade agreement.\n\n[[Page H4262]]\n\n  Second, you have got to keep us informed. You have got to regularly \nconsult with Congress. Congress must have access to all of the \nnegotiating texts. Right now, it is whatever the administration chooses \nto give us. They control it. They decide on their terms. With TPA, \nCongress says no, no, no; we, in Congress, get access to these \nnegotiating documents while it is being negotiated. We, in Congress, \nare accredited to go to the negotiations if we want to, and with the \nZinke protocol, which we added to this, if we ourselves can't make it, \nwe will send representatives for ourselves to these negotiations.\n  Third, and perhaps most importantly, transparency. In the old days, \nthey used to call this thing fast track. President goes out and gets an \nagreement and then wham, whizzes it through, has Congress vote on it, \nit is in law, everybody's wondering what the heck just happened, what \nis in this thing. Not again. No more.\n  When an agreement is reached, when America gets an agreement with \nother countries, before the President can even sign off on it, we make \nit public for 60 days, up on the Internet, everybody can read it for \nthemselves and see what it is. That is in this law. Never done that \nbefore. And then the President can sign it, but when he signs it, it \ndoesn't go into effect. When he signs it, it just means he sends it to \nCongress, and then Congress considers it. Congress considers it and \nCongress determines whether it is going to happen or not. It is a bill \nlike any other bill. Congress has to pass it. They have to \naffirmatively pass it for it to go into effect, and if the House of \nRepresentatives doesn't like the trade agreement and they vote it down \nwith a simple majority vote, it doesn't happen. That is what this bill \ndoes. We have the final say.\n  I understand a lot of our Members, especially on our side of the \naisle, they don't trust this administration. Join the club. Neither do \nI. That is precisely why I support this bill. TPA puts Congress in the \ndriver's seat.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world is watching this. The world is watching \nwhether or not--and they are trying to make a decision--is America \nstill America or is America in retreat? Our allies want our leadership. \nOur adversaries are measuring how much we stack up. Our enemies would \nlove for us to retreat. The world is watching as to whether or not \nAmerica is going to lead in the world, whether America in the dawn of \nthe 21st century is going to take command of writing the rules of the \nglobal economy or cede that command to other countries.\n  If we establish TPA, we are saying, on a bipartisan basis, we want \nAmerica to lead; we believe in our country; we believe in our workers; \nwe believe in our economy; we want to open up markets so that we can \nuse American ingenuity and American workers to create American jobs. So \nwe can sell our goods and our services and our products overseas so we \ncan create more good-paying jobs right here at home. That is what this \nis about. It is about getting us on the playing field.\n  There have been 100 trade agreements negotiated, signed since 2007 \nwhen TPA last expired. We are a party to zero of those. The rest of the \nworld is moving around. The rest of the world is getting better deals. \nThe rest of the world is freezing us out. We have got to get back in \nthis game and lead this game and define this game.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2015.\n     Hon.

Tom Price,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Budget, Cannon House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding your \n     Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1892, the Trade \n     Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015, ordered reported by the \n     Committee on Ways and Means on April 23, 2015. I appreciate \n     your decision to facilitate prompt consideration of the bill \n     by the full House. I understand that by foregoing a mark-up \n     of the bill, the Committee on the Budget is not waiving its \n     interest in the provisions within its jurisdiction or the \n     right to seek conferees.\n       Per your request, I will include a copy of our exchange of \n     letters with respect to H.R. 1892 in the Congressional Record \n     during House consideration of this bill. We appreciate your \n     cooperation and look forward to working with you as this bill \n     moves through the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                      Committee on the Budget,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Ryan: I am writing regarding H.R. 1892, the \n     Trade Adjustment Assistance Act of 2015, as amended, which \n     the Committee on Ways and Means ordered reported without \n     recommendation on April 23, 2015.\n       The bill contains provisions that fall within the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on the Budget. In order to \n     expedite House consideration of H.R. 1892, as amended, the \n     Committee on the Budget will forgo action on the bill. This \n     is being done with the understanding that, by foregoing \n     consideration of H.R. 1892, as amended, the Committee on the \n     Budget does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in this bill or similar legislation and that \n     the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     this bill or similar legislation moves forward so that the \n     Committee may address any remaining issues that fall within \n     its jurisdiction. The Committee on the Budget also reserves \n     the right to seek appointment of an appropriate number of \n     conferees to any House-Senate conference involving this or \n     similar legislation, and requests your support of any such \n     request.\n       We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to working \n     with you as this bill moves through the Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Tom Price, M.D.,\n                                Chairman, Committee on the Budget.\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have worked in all my years here to expand trade in ways that \nspread its benefits to the many, not just to the few. Charlie Rangel \nand I led the fight to include strong and enforceable labor and \nenvironmental positions and to strike the right balance between \ninnovation and access to medicines in the historic May 10 agreement of \n2007.\n  The trouble with this TPA is that it means no meaningful provisions \nwhatsoever in TPP on currency manipulation, which has destroyed \nmillions of middle class American jobs and allows investors to \nchallenge American health and environmental regulations and others, not \nthrough the American legal system but through unregulated arbitration \npanels.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  It is about a TPP going in the wrong direction in access to medicines \nand, in some important ways, on environmental protections; and it is \nabout countries like Mexico that deny their workers basic labor rights \nto gain an uncompetitive advantage over our companies and workers. It \nis about Vietnam and Malaysia, which stand in clear violation of the \nMay 10 provisions on international workers' rights, with no plan we \nknow of.\n  In that sense, it is secret of a TPP to change that, far from a \nprogressive trade agreement. On this and every other area of the TPP, \nthere are only vague negotiating objectives left to be determined \nwhether they were met by those who did the negotiating. I just want to \nsay these negotiating objectives are so vague that they are \nmeaningless, and to hold them up as something that holds USTR to action \nis simply a mirage.\n  Instead of passing this bill, which gives a blank check to the \nadministration to finish up TPP negotiations where they are now and \nleaves Congress with only an up-or-down vote at the end, we should be \nusing our leverage to impact the negotiations. This bill does not do \nthat.\n  We in Congress, despite all of the rhetoric, will be in the back \nseat, not in the falsely claimed driver's seat. That is what this is \nall about, not protectionism versus free trade, not reflective \nopposition as is sometimes claimed to expanded trade. I have worked for \nexpanded trade. It is quite the opposite. I want a TPP that is worthy \nof broad bipartisan support.\n  As to TAA and proponents of TPA, they are the ones who have linked \nthe two together in a single bill. TAA should not be a bargaining chip \nto get a deeply flawed TPA across the finish line, and that is how this \nhas been set up. This TPA should stand on its own feet. Even in its \nbest form, TAA was a modest program, and I was one of the authors \nsupporting it, but this TAA bill includes a number of shortcomings \ncompared to the high watermark of the program.\n  Despite the fact that the need in this country is growing and trade \nis expanding, the truth of the matter is we need to do far more to \ntrain and educate our workers and to invest in our future in order to \ncompete in a global economy.\n  A ``no'' vote will give us another opportunity to improve TAA and TPA \nand to achieve our ultimate goal for which I and others have been \nworking for months and months and months and months, and that is the \ngoal: a strong TPP agreement that can gain broad, bipartisan support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, let me inquire as to the time \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 21\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan has 25 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, some have called Trade Adjustment \nAssistance ``burial insurance'' since it delivers limited help after a \njob is dead and buried.\n  At a time when Fast Trackers are claiming that they will include over \nhalf of the world's economy, we need a TAA that is funded for more \nworkers\n\n[[Page H4264]]\n\nat risk of job loss. Unfortunately, this particular TAA proposal is \nreally short for ``Taking Away Assistance.''\n  It includes substantially less funding than the Administration has \nsaid was essential to protecting those who lose their jobs through \nexpanded trade. Further, this TAA fails to restore coverage to \nthousands whose jobs may be exported.\n  In a very contrived process this morning, designed to obscure what is \nreally happening and to remove accountability from Members of this \nHouse, desperate Fast Trackers and fast talkers have split up the \nSenate bill into two pieces--two votes--before they put it back \ntogether in exactly the same form it was when it first got to the \nHouse. And along the way, they have a self-executing rule so that it \nappears that Members are not voting to do what they are doing.\n  The first vote we take today at the end of this debate is on TAA. \nVote ``no.'' Your vote of ``no'' offers an opportunity to achieve both \nbetter Trade Adjustment Assistance and better trade legislation, and \nyour vote ``no'' will also ensure that you are not on record as voting \nto send a bill to the President, which is exactly what will happen if \nyou vote ``yes,'' that cuts Medicare by $700 billion.\n  Reject this bill, and develop a better alternative that reflects our \nvalues and 21st century economic realities. What really needs \n``adjusting'' here today is the no compromise, no amendment attitude on \ntrade. This vote wouldn't be so close if this process had not been so \nclosed.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Nunes), the chairman of the House \nIntelligence Committee, the former chairman of the Trade Subcommittee \nof the Ways and Means Committee, and a senior member of the Ways and \nMeans Committee.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, this is a time when everybody in this body \nneeds to step back and really realize what we are here to do today. \nThis is an historic moment. We will either move forward with our \nallies, with our partners--with our trading partners--or we will move \nback. TPA is just one step. It is a step that we must have in order to \npass additional trade agreements that we have been doing throughout our \nhistory.\n  If you look at where we are today, this is about trade promotion \nauthority. People will have plenty of time to look at whatever trade \nagreements come down the pipeline over the next 5 years. That is what \nthis debate is about. Why do we need trade agreements? We need to \nreduce tariffs on products that are made in the United States so that \nwe have a better opportunity to export them overseas.\n  Mr. Speaker, this agreement has geopolitical concerns also. If we \nlook down the road at the first trade agreement that is supposed to \ncome up, it is supposed to be the Trans-Pacific Partnership. Today, if \nyou look at what our partners and allies in Asia are dealing with, it \nis a behemoth in China, and China doesn't want to play by the rules. \nThey have consistently avoided playing by the rules, which is putting \nour allies and our trading partners at risk, which is why we need to \ncome together and pass an agreement.\n  If you pass the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement and the EU \nagreement, you have two-thirds of the world's economy under one set of \nrules. That is what this is really about. If we pass trade promotion \nauthority, we move to the Trans-Pacific Partnership, and we move to the \nEuropean Union agreement. Then we get two-thirds of the world's economy \nunder the same set of rules.\n  I hope that my colleagues will step back and just stop all of the \nrhetoric on both sides of the aisle. On one side, we have people who \nare clearly representing the labor unions. On the other side, we have \npeople who don't want to give the President a victory.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, is a time when we need to step back and do the \nright thing for the right reasons for the American people.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) be permitted to control the time on \nour side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Kind), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation before us today, \ntrade promotion authority as well as Trade Adjustment Assistance.\n  What we are debating and what we have to decide today is whether to \ngrant this President, this administration, the same type of trade \nnegotiating authority that every President since FDR, minus Richard \nNixon, has enjoyed.\n  As a Democrat who has supported this administration, I wonder why we \nwould not at least have a modicum of trust in this President going out \nand trying to get the best trade deal that he can. We will have an \nopportunity later to analyze any agreement that is reached to make sure \nit makes sense for our constituents, for our States, and, ultimately, \nfor our country.\n  Let's be clear here. We are already trading with these nations: \nVietnam, Brunei, Malaysia. The question moving forward now is what the \nrules of trade are going to be. That is why we need to be at the table, \nnegotiating those rules, elevating standards.\n  Now, we are going to be negotiating core labor, environmental, and \nhuman rights standards in the body of the agreement, fully enforceable \nlike any other provision in it, which is something that we have lacked \nin past trade agreements.\n  When President Obama first ran for election, he was hoping for an \nopportunity to go back and amend NAFTA because he felt, as I did, that \nthere were deficiencies in that agreement. This is the opportunity to \ngo back and amend the problems that NAFTA created, the lack of core \nlabor or environmental standards, especially as it related to Mexico.\n  We need to be clear that this is an opportunity to move forward, \ngetting the rules of trade and the standards elevated up to where we \nare so that we have a level playing field for our workers, our farmers, \nour businesses to compete.\n  Otherwise, the alternative is a race to the bottom with no rules at \nall or, possibly, with China's rules. That, ultimately, is the choice \nwe face here today: to move forward with this authority, to move \nforward with these trade agreements, elevating standards to where we \nare, or to end up in a global trading system with no rules or with \nChina's rules. That would be a race to the bottom, and we will not be \nable to compete very effectively in it.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the passage today so we can \nstart leveling the playing field for our workers at home.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, it is now my honor to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young), a member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee and a great partner in trying to open up and break down \nbarriers around the world.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. \n1314, the Trade Act of 2015, and H.R. 644, the Trade Facilitation and \nTrade Enforcement Act.\n  With 96 percent of the world's customers living outside of the United \nStates, it remains vital for Congress to facilitate free trade \nagreements through the passage of trade promotion authority. Absent \nTPA, America will continue to sit on the sidelines while the rest of \nthe world negotiates free trade agreements and opens additional \nmarkets.\n  In my home State of Indiana, we have the largest number of \nmanufacturers per capita in the United States. In the Hoosier State, \nexporting manufacturing goods supports 22 percent of our manufacturing \njobs, 1 out of every 5. Our Hoosier farmers export over $3.6 billion \nacross our 5 largest agricultural export sectors.\n  At the end of the day, trade equals jobs. Congress must pass TPA to \nempower our negotiators to receive the best deal possible for American \nfamilies and job creators.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. TIBERI. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I was proud to work with Chairman\n\n[[Page H4265]]\n\nRyan to ensure that the House was able to include language within this \nact to ensure that no future free trade agreement can include language \nfor backdoor cap-and-trade agreements.\n  We included language that would prevent this as it would negatively \nimpact States like Indiana, which is the second largest user of coal in \nthe United States. I look forward to voting in support of this vital \npiece of legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further \nconsideration of the motion to concur is postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4265-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4265]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further \nconsideration of the motion to concur in the Senate amendment to the \nbill (H.R. 1314) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to provide \nfor a right to an administrative appeal relating to adverse \ndeterminations of tax-exempt status of certain organizations will now \nresume.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. When proceedings were postponed earlier \ntoday, 39 minutes of debate remained on the bill.\n  The gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi) has 18 minutes remaining, and \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) has 21 minutes remaining.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), one of our leaders here in \nthe Congress on free trade.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman so much for \nyielding and for his good work.\n  Mr. Speaker, trade means prosperity. In any trade, both sides go away \nwith something of greater value to themselves, or the trade wouldn't \ntake place. More markets for American products means more jobs and \nhigher wages for American workers. More products entering our economy \nmeans more consumer choices and lower prices.\n  Trade agreements make trade possible, but the authority to \neffectively negotiate trade agreements lapsed years ago, handicapping \nAmerica ever since. This is not some new power; it just restores the \nsame negotiating process that has served us well since the 1930s.\n  A lot of people confuse the TPA with the TPP. That is a trade \nagreement that hasn't even been finalized. If it is finalized, this \nbill assures that it has to meet 150 congressionally mandated \nconditions and be available for every American to read for at least 60 \ndays before Congress votes to approve or reject it.\n  TPA tells world markets America is back.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Lewis), a member of our committee, \nthe most distinguished Member from Georgia--or I should say the very \ndistinguished Member.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and my ranking \nmember for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the fast track amendment.\n  Over 20 years ago, I stood on this very House floor in opposition to \nNAFTA. I felt strongly then, as I do now, that these agreements are \nabout more than trade. They are reflections of our values. Let me be \nclear, I am for trade. Since NAFTA, I have opposed some agreements and \nsupported others, but I am not for trade at any price or at any cost.\n  Those of us on the Ways and Means Committee tried time and time again \nto make this legislation better, but mine and every single other \nDemocratic amendment was rejected.\n  Mr. Speaker, I visited Vietnam, and I know that there is much work to \nbe done. There is no freedom to organize, and freedom of speech is \nlimited.\n  The people of Georgia are calling and writing my office in waves. For \nover 20 years, they have felt the hardship of unfair trade. Textile and \nautomobile factories disappeared from metro Atlanta. Good jobs were \nshipped to Bangladesh, to China, to Mexico. Americans should not have \nto compete with starvation wages and environmental destruction.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do not know about you, but as Joshua of old said, as \nfor me and my house, I am going to cast my lot with the working people \nof America.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to do what is right and what is just.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 15 seconds.\n  Mr. LEWIS. We can develop smart trade policies which reflect our \nvalues. Labor, human rights, and trade have always been connected. This \nis not new. This little planet is not ours to waste, but to use what we \nneed and leave this little planet a little greener and a little more \npeaceful for generations yet unborn.\n  This Congress must be a headlight and not a taillight, or history \nwill not be kind to us.\n  I urge each and every Member of this Congress to do what is right. \nStand up for the working people of our country.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Paulsen), a leader on trade, a member of the Ways and \nMeans Subcommittee on Trade.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  It is difficult to overstate the importance of trade with other \ncountries. The benefits of trade are huge and enormous for our economy.\n  If you take all the trade agreements that we have with other \ncountries around the world and you add them together, we have a trade \nsurplus. If you take the nontrade agreements with the countries we \ndon't have trade agreements with, we have a deficit. These agreements \nhelp us; they benefit us.\n  There is no doubt that the U.S. has been on the sidelines in recent \nyears. This gets us back in the game, making us create a healthier \neconomy here at home, changing and making sure that our status as a \nglobal leader will be right back on top, higher-paying jobs, better-\npaying jobs. This is an opportunity also to make sure the United States \nis setting the rules for our economy, for the world economy, instead of \nChina.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you are for these things, you should be for this \nlegislation. Trade promotion authority allows these agreements to move \nforward with congressional oversight.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis), a member of our committee.\n\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  I rise in strong opposition to the trade bill before us, and I am \nalso in opposition to using 1 cent of Medicare money for anything other \nthan paying for health care for senior citizens.\n  I am not antitrade; I believe in trade, and I want a trade bill, but \nI want a trade bill that creates jobs and economic opportunity for the \ncommunities that I represent. I want a trade bill that creates fair \nwages and opportunities for employment.\n  I don't want a bill that continues to help the rich get richer and \nthe poor get poorer and the middle class get squeezed into oblivion, \nand I don't want a fast track. As a matter of fact, the jobs in \neconomic development have left the communities I represent fast enough. \nThey don't need our help, and they don't need to be gone. We need jobs \nin America.\n  I am going to vote against this. If I do and if it is the wrong vote, \nI am going to be voting with the people that I represent, the people \nwho sent me here, the people who have said ``represent us.'' They want \na ``no'' vote. I vote ``no'' because I represent them.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Smith), a leader on trade, a\n\n[[Page H4266]]\n\nmember of the Ways and Means Subcommittee on Trade.\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nTrade Act of 2015.\n  We have the opportunity to remove major trade barriers which make it \nharder to sell U.S. products to consumers in other countries.\n  To grow our economy, we must expand our access to the 96 percent of \nconsumers outside the United States. Nebraska's producers--farmers, \nranchers, and others--want to serve new markets, and this bill is an \nimportant step forward.\n  A number of concerns have been raised, and I want to clarify a couple \nof points. Many Nebraskans are concerned about the President's actions \non a number of issues. To address these concerns, we need to actually \npass this bill and establish more than 150 congressional parameters \nthat the President will be required to follow as trade negotiations \ntake place.\n  Some might be concerned that no one is allowed to read proposed trade \nagreements. We must pass this bill, actually, to ensure that every \nMember of this body has full access to negotiating text and any final \nagreement is publicly posted online for 60 days before the President \ncan sign it.\n  This bill also ensures we have an up-or-down vote on any trade \nagreement and contains new provisions allowing us to block agreements \nif the executive branch does not follow our rules.\n  This bill is important; it is an important step for opportunity and \ngrowth, and I ask for a ``yea'' vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), another valued member of our committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, Democrats just left a very powerful \npresentation from the President of the United States to our Members, \nwho simply ask that our Members play it straight: vote for things they \nbelieve in.\n  For instance, 125 Democrats voted for Trade Adjustment Assistance to \nhelp workers displaced because of things in the global economy. We have \na provision before us today that is actually stronger than what 125 of \nus voted for before; yet there are some that are thinking, well, they \nmay not vote for it.\n  I have had ads run against me for cutting Medicare; yet I am going to \nask to enter into the Record a letter from the American Hospital \nAssociation, the American Medical Association, American Health Care \nAssociation, and the National Association for Home Care & Hospice that \npoint out there were no cuts to Medicare because of the changes that we \nare involved with making.\n  Now, this is part of the problem we are having dealing with how to \nconsider trade promotion authority. This is something that all of us \nshould embrace. It sets the rules for the administration to negotiate \nand how we will evaluate it.\n  It will guarantee, as my friend from Nebraska just pointed out, \neverybody in America will have almost 5 full months to look at it \nbefore it is ever voted on. It contains the strongest environmental and \nlabor provisions of any trade provisions in history.\n  That is what people talked to me about when they wanted NAFTA fixed. \nTrade promotion authority that we have here will do it. It is very \nimportant. I have not stopped working to improve this package. I have \ngot things I want to change, work with the Senate, work in conference \ncommittee.\n  If we ever get an agreement, then I will evaluate the TPP based on \nwhat is in it, not speculation, innuendo, and reckless charges.\n\n                                                    June 11, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of our \n     members, who include a broad spectrum of Medicare providers, \n     we are writing to share with you our appreciation for \n     addressing the cuts to Medicare that had been included in \n     trade legislation but will now be removed. We support the \n     provisions in H.R. 1295, the ``Trade Preferences Extension \n     Act of 2015,'' that remove this Medicare cut.\n       This week, the House is considering several trade bills. \n     Section 603 of H.R. 1295, which was passed by the House \n     earlier today, would eliminate the Medicare sequester \n     extension for the last six months in 2024, which would have \n     cut $700 million from Medicare according to Congressional \n     Budget Office estimates. This provision also would have \n     resulted in a net effect of increasing the sequester in 2024 \n     beyond the 2 percent in the Budget Control Act. With the \n     protection of Section 603, coupled with expeditious passage \n     by the Senate of H.R. 1295 as amended, we would no longer \n     view a vote in favor of the Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) \n     legislation as a vote to cut Medicare.\n       Hospitals, physicians, nursing homes and home health and \n     hospice providers have already absorbed hundreds of billions \n     of dollars in cuts to the Medicare program in recent years. \n     We believe that it is an unwise precedent to use Medicare \n     cuts to pay for non-Medicare related legislation. We are \n     grateful this is addressed favorably in Section 603.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Hospital Association;\n     American Medical Association;\n     American Health Care Association;\n     National Association for Home Care & Hospice.\n\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Dold), a new member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, we want to make sure that we are moving forward and \nproviding American leadership when it comes to trade.\n  My friend from Oregon here just articulately noted some of the \nreasons why this needs to move forward. Literally one in three \nmanufacturing jobs relies upon exports; 95 percent of the world's \nconsumers are outside of the United States.\n  I want to make sure that we have got good, high-paying jobs right \nhere at home. The way to do that is to be able to make sure that we are \ndeciding what are the rules of the road when it comes to trade.\n  The rules of the 21st century in the global economy are being written \ntoday, and the question is: Will the United States of America be there \nto be able to write these rules, to be part of the process? If we \ndon't, certainly China and others will, putting the United States and \nour businesses, our workers, at an enormous disadvantage.\n  We want trade deals that are enforceable, accountable, and have high \nstandards. This is about creating good, high-paying American jobs. This \nis what we all want. Frankly, we have got an opportunity to move \nforward.\n  The 10th Congressional District is the 4th largest manufacturing \ndistrict in the nation, with over 107,000 manufacturing employees.\n  1 in 3 manufacturing jobs rely on exports.\n  New opportunities for America's small businesses.\n  97% of U.S. companies that export are small and medium-sized \nbusinesses.\n  The actual vote on any final trade agreement is months away. I want \nto clear up confusion, because there are efforts by critics of trade to \ndistort what TPA is.\n  This is merely a vote on the process associated with moving forward \non trade agreements--this is not the vote on any actual trade deal. \nThat vote would not occur for months.\n  TPA explicitly prevents the enactment of any trade deal without \nseparate, subsequent approval by Congress. Nothing will be enacted \nwithout an additional up-or-down vote in Congress.\n  TPA ensures that the American people will have an opportunity to read \nthe actual text of any preliminary agreement that the President intends \nto enter into.\n  Specifically, the President must publish the text online at least 60 \ndays prior to signing off on anything. And even after that, Congress \nstill gets an up-or-down vote on approval or rejection. So, there is \nunprecedented transparency here.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nPascrell), another member of our committee.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you what an innuendo is. It is \nsaying that the jobs that we lose are going to be replaced by just as \ngood or better jobs.\n  Well, here is the record. Remember, you are giving assistance to \nworkers who already lost their jobs. Wouldn't it make sense logically \nto try to save the jobs in the first place? Or do we believe, as \nPresident Bush said in February of 2004 in his economic report: Hey, if \nthey make it cheaper overseas, we have got to do something else? That \nis a way out. That is innuendo.\n  If you want to talk about inequality, the jobs we are losing in \nmanufacturing are paying over $600 a week, and\n\n[[Page H4267]]\n\nthe jobs that are being replaced pay $330. Who are we kidding here? Get \nto the facts. Get to the facts.\n  Past trade deals have hurt the American worker. By the way, you \nplaced this thing--those who are proponents of this legislation--that \nwe are against trade. Nothing could be further from the truth. We want \nfair deals that help our workers. That is what this is all about.\n  In my town, a textile business lost everything 40-50 years ago; \n25,000-30,000 people were employed with that textile industry. We sat \nhere in the Congress of the United States and watched these people lose \ntheir jobs. You are sure as heck they want the retail jobs. Do you know \nwhat they paid?\n  Fast track and the underlying Trans-Pacific Partnership will continue \nthe trend of corporations offshoring American jobs, driving down wages; \nand now, we are going to be competing with the Vietnamese who pay maybe \n60 cents an hour. That is the level.\n  Everybody can't be like us. We understand that. We are not against \ntrade. We want it to be fair, and we want the American worker to be \nprotected. That is what this is all about.\n  We had our fears confirmed when the President told us that China \nwanted to join the TPP. That is the icing on the cake, making a bad \ndeal even worse.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to remind my friend that globalization occurred long \nbefore any trade agreement. My dad lost his job, his steelworker job, \nyears before NAFTA. In fact, we have a trade surplus, Mr. Speaker.\n  We have a trade surplus with the 20 countries that we have a trade \nagreement with, a deficit with the countries that we don't.\n  It is now my privilege to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), a member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the Trade Act of 2015.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's market is outside the United \nStates, and selling our goods to these markets is critical to America's \nfuture prosperity. One in five of American jobs are directly tied to \ntrade. If we can't knock down the tariffs that are placed on American \ngoods around the world, the world is going to buy these goods \nelsewhere. Simply put, a strong trade agenda is essential to America's \nnational security and the economic opportunity of hard-working \ntaxpayers.\n  If you want a strong trade agreement with better protections for U.S. \nworkers, you want trade promotion authority. TPA allows Congress to \nhold the administration accountable and gives Congress the chance to \nvote down a bad deal. Without it, we are negotiating from a \ndisadvantage. If we are not setting the rules on global trade, China \nwill.\n  Mr. Speaker, trade promotion authority means stronger, better trade \nagreements. I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nit because what is happening right now is, if we don't have an \nincreasingly aggressive China in there setting the rules, the trade \nagreements give us the chances on things like labor, things like the \nenvironment, things like a fair and open Internet. Those are the kinds \nof things that are going to create future jobs and keep the world safer \nand better.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez), another valued member of our \ncommittee.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak \nagainst this misguided TPA bill. Many of my colleagues have highlighted \nthe reasons to oppose the bill, but I want to focus on two specific \nfundamental issues, labor and civil rights.\n  There is nothing in this that requires countries to bring their labor \nlaws and regulations into compliance before this deal takes effect. How \ncan we have an agreement that doesn't require everybody to play by the \nsame rules? That is just ridiculous.\n  We need trade agreements that prohibit signatory countries from \nmurdering, jailing, torturing, or firing citizens for doing such \noutlandish things as trying to unionize and bargain for safer working \nconditions.\n  Enforceable labor provisions tell trading partners that we mean \nbusiness on labor rights before letting their goods into the U.S. Trade \nagreements should not continue a race to the bottom for workers. We \nshould be setting the standards.\n  I am frustrated that TPP negotiations are nearly complete and we are \njust now giving the administration their marching orders, but here we \nare, and those marching orders should be clear, especially on labor \nrights.\n  Additionally, in the Ways and Means markup for this legislation, I \noffered a commonsense amendment to address the issue of countries whose \nlaws call for imprisonment, torture, and even death for the supposed \ncrime of one's sexual orientation.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  I was baffled to watch every single Republican member on the \ncommittee vote to say that it is perfectly acceptable to do business \nwith countries that have these laws. Perhaps it was naive of me to \nthink that we could at least have one bright-line rule for the most \nbasic of human rights--not to be put to death based on a person's \nactual or perceived sexual orientation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. U.S. market access shouldn't be a \nfree pass. If you want to do business with the U.S., we shouldn't \ntolerate such barbaric behavior.\n  For these reasons, I urge my colleagues to oppose this legislation.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I now have the privilege to yield 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), a member of the \nWays and Means Committee and an important voice on trade.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. I thank Chairman Tiberi.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of two things is going to happen: we are either \ngoing to lean forward and claim the best days of America, which are \nahead of us, or we are going to recede from those. The choice is here \nand the choice is today, and I urge us to move forward because I truly \nbelieve, if we pursue an aggressive trade agenda and if the United \nStates leads on that trade agenda, I think good things are going to \nhappen.\n  There is another part of this story, Mr. Speaker, as we have an \nopportunity to make history today as well. Included in the TPA is \nbipartisan legislation that I authored to shield Israel from being the \nvictim of the insidious boycott, divestment, and sanctions movement \nthat is brewing within Europe. This would be the first time in nearly \nfour decades that Congress has taken action to combat boycotts against \nIsrael.\n  Just last week, we saw a telecom giant, Orange, which is a company \npartially owned by the French Government, recede back from doing \nbusiness in Israel and so forth based on BDS pressure. The language I \noffered that was unanimously adopted is simple: If you want to trade \nwith the United States, you can't boycott Israel.\n  I want to thank Chairman Ryan and Chairman Tiberi for their \nleadership and Representative Vargas and Senators Portman and Cardin \nfor working with me on these important issues.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise to stand as tall and as boldly as I \ncan for the American worker. Almost 10 million Americans are \nunemployed; middle class income wages have been stagnant for decades; \nalmost every low-wage job that could have moved overseas has moved \noverseas. We have to do something different--something smart, honest, \nbrave, bold, and based on the almost unanimous consensus of American \neconomists.\n  We need to tear down the trade barriers of other countries so that \nthey will buy our goods and services. We need to establish much \nstronger labor and environmental laws overseas. We need to bring the \nrule of law to those countries so that investors will build new plants \nand equipment, and we need much stronger intellectual property \nprotections around the world. We have to take globalization head on. We \ncannot isolate ourselves. No economy can grow from within. We tried \nprotectionism, and we got the Great Recession.\n\n[[Page H4268]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand for the American worker, and I support the Obama \nadministration's commitment to free trade and to lifting the American \nmiddle class.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Brady), a leader on trade, a leader on the Trade \nSubcommittee, a past chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, and a leader \non the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. I thank Chairman Tiberi for his leadership on \ntrade and American success.\n  Mr. Speaker, who has the power? This is the question. When your \nfamily or your business wants to buy a product, who decides what you \ncan buy and at what price? Is it you, or is it special interests or \nunion bosses or the government? If you build a better product or come \nup with a new idea, who has the power to decide where you can sell it \naround the world? Is it you, or is it special interests and government \nand, again, the union?\n  American trade is about giving you the power and you the freedom to \nbuy and sell and compete around the world with as little government \ninterference as possible. It is not enough to just buy American. We \nwant to sell our American products around the world. When we do, we \nwin. When we say to countries, ``You are selling into the U.S., and we \ninsist we sell into your country,'' we win and we create jobs. When we \ndon't, America grows weaker, and our foreign competitors grow stronger. \nOur manufacturers and our farmers and our local businesses get priced \nout and shut down.\n  American trade is about our jobs and our prosperity. This bill sets \nthe rules for trade so that, with these agreements, everyone benefits; \neveryone plays by the rules; everyone has the same opportunity. I am \nvoting ``yes'' for more American jobs and more American economic \nopportunity and for less government control of our trade.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Ohio \n(Ms. Kaptur), a longtime veteran of this Congress.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank our distinguished ranking member, Mr. Levin of \nMichigan.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this limited fast-track \ntrade debate.\n  Proponents of TPA are trying to lure votes for this Pacific deal by \ncynically adding $700 million to trade adjustment assistance to take \ncare of millions more people who are going to lose their jobs as \nbillions and billions more of our productive wealth is outsourced to \nother countries. What a fig leaf. It is too little for the damage about \nto be done.\n  The eyes of working families in communities across our country are \nfocused on Congress today, hoping we will finally stand up and do what \nis right for America. This latest job outsourcing trade deal serves \nonly the 1 percent, rewarding the few at the expense of the many. It is \na great deal for Wall Street, and it is a great deal for transnational \ncorporations. But for Main Street, a shrinking middle class, and \nmillions more of our workers, it is another punch to the gut.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week's scenario reminds me of the NAFTA fight. To \npick up wavering Members back then, a deal was cut even to protect the \ncorn broom industry, but in this deal, we don't protect people. In this \ndeal, there is no protection against human trafficking. That has been \nstripped out. So we have protections for corn brooms but not for \npeople.\n  In return for securing votes for narrow interests to gain a majority \nfor passage, a few thousand people may benefit handsomely from these \nlittle provisions, but America won't. We will continue to rack up \nmassive trade and job deficits as world markets remain closed to us, as \nthey have for four decades. State-run enterprises will continue to eat \nmore of our lunch. And for America's working class, millions more of \nwhom will be left out in the cold, the TPP will be a truly pathetic \npackage. I urge ``no,'' ``no,'' ``no'' votes this afternoon. Stand up \nfor America's workers for a change.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I have great respect for my colleague from Ohio, but let me just give \nyou a few facts.\n  Of the 20 countries with which we have trade agreements, we have a \ntrade surplus. With the countries with which we don't, we have a trade \ndeficit. It speaks for itself. In Ohio, 89 percent of our exporters are \nsmall- and medium-sized companies with fewer than 500 people. With \nrespect to TAA, I must say that most of these trading dollars are spent \nat community colleges, at technical colleges, and they use that money \nto train workers and to upgrade skills for a 21st century economy.\n  I wish my dad, who had lost his manufacturing job way before NAFTA \nand who had lost his steelworker job way before any bilateral trade \nagreement for globalization, had had TAA to help him get a new job.\n  As the President said, in reality, a vote against this TAA bill will \nbe a vote to actually cut funding for community college. As the \nPresident said yesterday, a ``no'' vote could potentially kill TAA \nforever.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Washington \nState (Mr. Reichert), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee and Trade Subcommittee and a leader on trade issues.\n  Mr. REICHERT. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, Americans find themselves asking this question \nover and over again: Are things ever going to get better for America? \nThe only answer has to be ``yes.'' Today, we begin that process. Today, \nit is time for action. Today, we vote on trade legislation that is \nabsolutely critical for America's future. Today, we send a message to \nthe world--across this globe--a strong message that we are America, \nthat we are strong, that we are free, and that we are united.\n  A ``yes'' vote today on TPA and TAA is a vote for a healthy economy. \nIt is a vote for creating jobs. It is a vote for higher wages. It is a \nvote for selling America. That is the message we are going to send \nacross this globe today. America is back, and we are going to be strong \nin this world economy.\n  Hard-working taxpayers deserve a government that gives the citizens \nof this country freedom, choice, and control to pursue their futures. \nEvery American deserves this--to build one's own business, to hire \nemployees, to seek promotions, and to provide for one's family. Mr. \nSpeaker, it is what real leaders will deliver today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Ashford).\n  Mr. ASHFORD. I thank the ranking member.\n  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this is a vote for the ages. My \nconstituents in Nebraska are asking me: ``Brad, can we govern? Can we \ncome together? Can we move this country forward?'' What we do here \ntoday will determine how we do move forward as a nation. What kind of \ncountry do we leave our children?\n  In my view, Mr. Speaker, we are at our best when we reach for the \nMoon. This, in my view, is one of those moments. This is a vote for \nbetter jobs, a stronger economy for American workers and for American \nexceptionalism. I believe, Mr. Speaker, that this is a vote for the \nages. Please support TAA and TPP and TPA to make life better for all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Boustany), a leader on trade, a leader on the Ways and \nMeans Committee, and a leader for Louisiana.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, after 1945, the U.S. set up a global trading system, and \ncountries around the world are taking advantage of it. The world is not \nsitting still. Hundreds of trade agreements exist, but we only have 20 \nwith which we have a trade surplus, and we are sitting on the \nsidelines, standing still. It is just unacceptable.\n  American leadership is needed. If we are going to grow this economy, \nif we are going to create good-paying jobs for workers and farmers, we \nneed to open markets, as 95 percent of the markets are outside the U.S. \nLet's open those markets. Let's be fair to our American workers and \nfarmers. Let's give them market access. TPA is the catalyst to opening \nthose markets and for growth.\n\n[[Page H4269]]\n\n  The world is crying for American leadership. I am afraid American \nprestige is on the line right now. It is waning. Countries around the \nworld are watching us to see how we vote on this today. We have the \nopportunity to show that America will lead the global trading system we \ncreated. I think, if we don't do this, we have dealt a serious blow to \nAmerican leadership. It is a catalyst for American leadership. Let's \npass TPA.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, would you tell us how much time remains.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 8 minutes \nremaining, and the gentleman from Ohio has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of yielding 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez).\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, time and again, we are promised trade deals create \nopportunity. Time and again, instead, they send jobs abroad. In the \nfirst 7 years of NAFTA, New York City's textile and apparel industry \nshed 7,900 jobs. In total, fast-track trade policies have cost the U.S. \nmore than 1 million jobs. New York lost more than 374,000 manufacturing \njobs since NAFTA and the World Trade Organization agreements.\n  Why would the Trans-Pacific Partnership be different? If that deal is \napproved, the U.S. will lose more than 130,000 jobs to just 2 of the 12 \nTPP members--Japan and Vietnam. New York already ran a $47 billion \ntrade deficit last year. This agreement will make the situation worse.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 20 seconds.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. When I go home to New York, I don't hear people \ntelling me we need to rush into another trade deal. The only people \npushing fast track are lobbyists and big corporations. They are not \nwhom I represent. I would rather stand with New York's working families \nwho oppose fast track. Vote ``no.''\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nSouth Dakota (Mrs. Noem), a leader on the Committee on Ways and Means, \na leader on trade.\n  Mrs. NOEM. Mr. Speaker, South Dakota tells the true story of what the \nbenefits of trade can bring. When we have a trade agreement with \nanother country, we sell 11\\1/2\\ times more goods to that country than \nif there were no agreement in place.\n  Trade has been and continues to be an important part of the American \neconomy, but we cannot afford to fall behind. We have to continue to \nexpand opportunities to export American-made products to these \ncountries, but first we have to set the rules of the road.\n  The Constitution allows the President to negotiate trade agreements, \nbut only Congress can approve or disapprove them. What we are voting on \ntoday ensures that Congress sets the priorities and the rules that the \nPresident has to follow. It allows an open and transparent process \nwhere the public can view any potential trade deal for 60 days before \nit is sent to Congress. If the President doesn't follow our rules, we \ncan take TPA away; or if we don't like future trade deals, we can \nsimply vote them down. But we need to assert the power of Congress in \nthe process and ensure that the public gets to weigh in down the road. \nThat is what we are doing here today.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill. America is counting on it.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nPrice).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend for \nyielding.\n  Over the past 2 years, I have been a part of efforts, good-faith \nefforts, to write the strongest possible fast-track bill. But the \nprocess the legislation has gone through recently, with Ways and Means \nDemocrats denied every opportunity to improve the legislation in \ncommittee, while Republicans were accommodated in the Customs bill with \nanti-immigrant, anti-environmental provisions, has moved the bill in \nprecisely the wrong direction from what might have gained my support. \nTherefore, I plan to vote against TPA today.\n  But I strongly oppose the devious and reckless efforts to bring down \nTPA by trying to defeat the Trade Adjustment Assistance Act. TAA is a \ngood bill which reflects longstanding Democratic priorities, and the \nobjectionable Medicare offset that it contained has been removed. TAA \nhas been critically important in North Carolina. I refuse to put \ndisplaced workers at risk for the sake of a political tactic.\n  I urge my colleagues, play it straight. Support TAA whether or not \nyou support TPA.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Smith), a new member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of TPA \nbecause trade is too important to southeast and southern Missouri to \nleave in the hands of this President or any President. TPA would bring \nmore transparency and involvement to the negotiation process and gives \nCongress more authority over the President.\n  Without TPA, the President can keep Congress and the public in the \ndark on trade negotiations. Without TPA, the President alone sets the \nnegotiating objectives; without TPA, Members of Congress are not \nentitled to read the text of negotiating documents during the process; \nand without TPA, the President does not have to publish updated \nsummaries of trade bills during the negotiations.\n  However, with TPA, Members of Congress can be involved in the \nnegotiation process to get the best deal for our folks back home. With \nTPA, for the first time ever, all bills negotiated would have to be \npublic for 60 days before Congress votes on them; with TPA, Congress \ndirects the negotiating objectives for trade bills; and with TPA, \nMembers of Congress will have open access to the text anytime they \nwant.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need TPA so that American trade deals can be \ntransparent, effective, and enforceable.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, the proponents of this bill have not played \nit straight as far as legislative procedure. They took a Senate bill \nthat should be a ``yes'' or ``no'' vote on this floor and split it up \ninto two or three pieces. It is one package. If you are against fast \ntrack, vote ``no'' on TAA.\n  It is not the opponents who came up with this crazy procedure. If \nthey had played it straight, we could play it straight. But now we are \nin a position to use the legislative tactics afforded by this House, \npursuant to a rule that is complicated beyond belief, to sink this \nwhole package by voting ``no'' on TAA. Vote ``no'' on Trade Adjustment \nAssistance because, if that happens, Republican leadership has said we \ngo home.\n  What is the good of having a little bit of trade adjustment \nassistance if we lose millions of jobs because we put them on a fast \ntrack to Asia? Take Nancy Reagan seriously; when it comes to all three \nvotes today, just vote ``no.''\n  Mr. TIBERI. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. I thank the ranking member for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, President John F. Kennedy once said: ``The U.S. did not \nrise to greatness waiting for others to lead. Economic isolation and \npolitical leadership are wholly incompatible.''\n  This is the moment for the United States to lead. I am voting ``yes'' \non the trade bills that we have today. Trade is good for the United \nStates: 95 percent of all consumers are outside the United States. \nTrade is good for Texas: last year we had over $289 billion of goods \nexported from Texas; 1.1 million jobs were created in Texas; millions \nof other jobs were created in the United States.\n  Now, who are those small companies? Who are those companies \nexporting? Ninety-three percent of those companies in Texas are small- \nand medium-sized, so therefore this is how we create good jobs here in \nthe United States.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, let's support fair trade. Again, I ask you to \nsupport the trade bill today.\n  Mr. TIBERI. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4270]]\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. How much time do I have remaining, please?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 3\\3/4\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the debate today is about one issue; it \ncomes down to one question: Do we support hard-working Americans or do \nwe abandon them? A vote for these bills is a vote against jobs, and it \nis a vote against wages.\n  The Trade Adjustment Assistance bill is underfunded. It excludes \nteachers, police officers, firefighters, and farmers who are hurt when \nproduction jobs are shipped abroad, go overseas. If we want to protect \nworking families, we must stop fast-tracking bad trade deals.\n  Fast track denies public scrutiny, it denies debate in this House, \nand it relinquishes our congressional authority and does not allow us \nto amend a piece of legislation that will have such an effect on \npeople's lives in this country.\n  Why is this trade agreement in so much difficulty? Why? Because this \nis the first time that a majority of the Congress is starting to say: \nWe need to prioritize what is happening to the hard-working men and \nwomen in our country. What is happening to their lives? What is their \nstruggle?\n  This trade agreement is only going to hurt their ability to have a \njob and to increase their wages. If we want to change that, then our \njob today is to vote down this bill.\n  Say ``no'' to Trade Adjustment Assistance and say ``no'' to fast \ntrack.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, before I yield to the gentleman from \nKentucky, I just want to point out the record here. No public service \nworker has ever been certified for TAA under the 2009 stimulus TAA that \nwas passed. I will also reiterate a statement from the White House with \nrespect to TAA, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       If you're a Member of Congress and you vote against TAA \n     this week, you are signing the death certificate for this \n     assistance.\n\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Barr).\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for the opportunity to \nspeak in favor of this important legislation for jobs, our economy, \ntransparency, and accountability.\n  Free trade is critical for my constituents in central and eastern \nKentucky. More than half a million Kentucky jobs are related to \ninternational trade, and expanding trade agreements will provide even \nmore opportunities for job growth. Our State has a diverse economy that \nis synonymous with certain products, including coal, bourbon, and \nthoroughbred racehorses. We are a powerhouse of manufacturing, \nproducing vehicles such as the Toyota Camry and even aerospace \ntechnology, which is the State's leading export category.\n  To continue the growth in these signature industries, we need to \nestablish fair and strong rules that hold other nations accountable for \ntheir unfair trade practices. We need to tear down barriers that block \nKentucky goods from foreign markets.\n  What does free trade mean for Kentucky? In 2013, 2 years after our \nlast free trade agreement was completed, the car of the year in South \nKorea was the Toyota Camry, manufactured in my district in Kentucky.\n  Let's be clear: The President already has the authority under the \nConstitution to negotiate trade agreements, but by passing TPA, we will \nensure that Congress has the input into the final product and that \nAmerica will shape the rules of global trade, not China.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n  Mr. POCAN. I thank the gentleman for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I grew up in an auto town, where almost everyone had a \nfamily member who worked in the industry, but today there are no cars \nmade there anymore. To me, trade deals should be about whether or not \nwe will fight for American jobs and American workers' wages. Bad trade \ndeals cost us both. Unless we have a say, unless the American people \nhave a say, this trade deal will do exactly the same and cost us more \njobs.\n  I have read the text, and I know where we are at with it as of now. I \nwould like to see a deal that has better real protective teeth for \nlabor and environmental law, strong protections for American \nsovereignty, and better protections for food safety and more. Bottom \nline: I want a trade deal that protects American jobs and lifts our \nwages right here at home.\n  If we vote for TPA, we will have no ability to make it better. For \nthis trade deal or any other trade deal in the next 6 years under any \nPresident, if we want the American people to have a voice, a real \nvoice, we must retain our authority to impact trade deals and vote \nagainst TPA in all votes that affect it today.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, let me set the record straight. All three \nbills that we are voting on today can be read. This is TPA. This is the \nbill that will hold the President accountable--this President, the next \nPresident. This is the bill that tells the administration what we \nexpect. This is the bill that Congress inserts itself into to the \nPresident's negotiating.\n  Listen, ladies and gentlemen, the world is trading. The world is \nglobalized. The world was globalized long before America decided to \npass NAFTA--long before. And, in fact, NAFTA, in 1993, the year before \nNAFTA took effect, the U.S. had a steel trade deficit of 3 million net \ntons with Canada and Mexico. In 2014, the most recent year for which \ndata is available, the U.S. had a steel trade surplus of 1.2 million \nnet tons with Canada and Mexico. NAFTA has benefited the entire North \nAmerican steel industry. Total U.S.-Canada steel trade has increased 99 \npercent from 1993 to 2014. Total U.S.-Mexico steel trade has increased \n352 percent between 1993 and 2014. That is why the steel industry in \nAmerica supports this bill along with the enforcement that we are going \nto debate in a little bit.\n  In Ohio, Honda of America is a net exporter--is a net exporter. This \nis about jobs. This is about allowing those people, those workers, some \nof my constituents at East Liberty or in Marysville, to build more cars \nin Ohio, to send them overseas. The only way we do that is to break \ndown barriers--more jobs.\n  Listen, I get job loss. My dad lost his job of 25 years. Ladies and \ngentlemen, we need to pass TPA to increase the number of jobs.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, today's vote on the trade package that \nincludes trade adjustment assistance and trade promotion authority, \nalso known as fast track, represents a flawed and hurried process to \nexpedite the proposed Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement that is \nalmost at the finish line. We should not vote for a TPA that fails to \ninclude strong and enforceable negotiating objectives on currency \nmanipulation, labor rights and does not address the investor state \ndispute settlement system, which could see corporations challenge \ngovernment regulations in secret tribunals that leave taxpayers on the \nhook for the bill.\n  I also strongly oppose using trade adjustment assistance as a \nbargaining chip to help pass a flawed TPA. I support providing \nassistance to workers displaced by trade but this bill should stand on \nits own merits and be improved on behalf of all workers before it is \nrushed through for a final vote. We must go back to strengthen TAA and \nTPA before moving forward on any future trade agreement that will have \nwide-ranging consequences for America's working class.\n  Mr. VISCLOSKY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1314, \nwhich allows for fast track Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) for trade \nagreements entered into prior to July 1, 2021, including the \nprospective Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) and the Transatlantic Trade \nand Investment Partnership (T-TIP). Past trade agreements have \noutsourced American jobs and caused irreparable harm to our domestic \nmanufacturing base. I believe that TPP, T-TIP, and other potential \nfuture agreements will be no different.\n   Throughout my career, I have voted against unfair trade agreements. \nI voted against the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), which \nwas sold on the promise of creating 200,000 American jobs. After \nenactment, the Economic Policy Institute (EPI) estimates that America \nlost 682,900 jobs, primarily in the manufacturing sector. I voted \nagainst the Korea Free Trade Agreement, which was sold on the promise \nof creating 70,000 American jobs. After enactment, again the EPI \nestimates that America lost 60,000 jobs. The future trade agreements we \nare discussing today are being sold on the promise\n\n[[Page H4271]]\n\nof creating more American jobs. That argument may continue to work for \nsome. But I am not buying it.\n   There has been a bipartisan failure, administration after \nadministration, to address the effects of unfair trade on domestic \nmanufacturers. Democrat and Republican administrations have been wrong \nto support irresponsible trade agreements in the past that have \nexacerbated the problems faced by American workers. President Obama is \nwrong in this instance. Congress should instead support trade \nagreements that substantially improve our existing trade laws and \nenhance our ability to enforce them in a timely fashion. We should only \nsupport trade agreements that include strong enforcement procedures, \naddress currency manipulation, provide environmental protections, and \nprotect American manufacturers from competing unfairly with exploited \nforeign workers. It is wrong to expect American workers to compete \nagainst state-owned enterprises that have unlimited government \nresources and violate our free market trade laws.\n   American manufacturing and the steel industry are struggling every \nday to keep their footing in the fight against unfair trade. Earlier \nthis year, I co-chaired a Congressional Steel Caucus hearing where \nindustry and labor representatives unanimously agreed that America's \nsteel sector is being systematically targeted by trading partners that \nuse the U.S. market as their dumping ground.\n   Just this month, six American steel producers, including two \nproducers with facilities in my district, filed anti-dumping and \ncountervailing duty petitions against foreign countries engaged in \nillegal trade practices. While I am pleased that American steel \nproducers are taking action to hold these countries accountable, I am \nconcerned that this case will not stop the ongoing trend of countries \ndumping their products into U.S. markets. I have frequently testified \nin front of the International Trade Commission (ITC), and was pleased \nthat in 2009 the ITC ruled against China in an Oil Country Tubular \nGoods case. However, last year I testified again in a similar case \ninvolving these same products. After duties were imposed on China in \n2009, other countries, such as Vietnam, Thailand, Turkey, and South \nKorea, started dumping the same product on our shores. This is a \ndangerous trend and Congress and the Administration must stop such \npractices from continuing.\n   I am encouraged that the House has taken some action to address \nunfair trade practices by including provisions in the Trade \nFacilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015 that would strengthen \nour antidumping and countervailing duty laws. But while these \nprovisions are a step in the right direction, they are not enough.\n   TPA does not include strong, enforceable currency reforms, and \ninstead allows the Administration, without any clear guidelines, to \ndetermine how best to address currency manipulators. TPA does nothing \nto ensure that strong environmental protections will be included in \nfuture trade agreements. TPA does not crack down on worker exploitation \nor lay out a roadmap to ensure countries included in future trade \nagreements are in compliance with international labor and human rights \nstandards. Such economic inhibitors should be rejected. Instead, we \nshould focus on investing in and encouraging vigorous domestic \nmanufacturing.\n   Mr. Speaker, steel is the economic backbone of the First \nCongressional District of Indiana, the foundation of our manufacturing \nbase, and an essential element of our national defense. I am proud to \nrepresent the workers who make this steel every single day. Today, I \nask that my colleagues stand up for American workers and oppose H.R. \n1314.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the Trade Act of \n2015 (H.R. 1314), which would ``fast-track'' trade agreements, such as \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), by allowing them to pass Congress \nby a straight up or down vote without any possibility of amendment.\n  Ever since NAFTA in 1993, these so-called free trade agreements have \nall been sold to the American people on the same propaganda; that they \nwill boost exports and increase jobs. Yet the results have always been \nthe same. Although we might increase exports somewhat, one of our \nbiggest exports has been American jobs. Any claims to the contrary are \nnot worth the paper they are written on.\n  For starters, these are not really free trade agreements. A true free \ntrade agreement would consist of no more than a few pages simply \nlisting the dates on which tariffs for various commodities would be \neliminated. In fact, these agreements consist of thousands of pages of \nnegotiated provisions, which history demonstrates have benefited multi-\nnational companies while destroying millions of American jobs and \ndepressing American wage levels. Without adequate labor, environmental \nand human rights standards, our trading partners can and do pay their \nworkers 30 cents per hour, make their goods cheaper by dumping waste \nproducts in the river, and murder workers who try to join a union. No \nwonder factories in the United States close and move abroad. No wonder \nour balance of trade becomes calamitous.\n  We are always told that the next trade agreement will have better \nprotections, but that has never been the case. None of the so-called \nprotections have been enforceable or enforced. So it is particularly \ntroubling that the text of the TPP is still classified. Members of \nCongress can look at it, but cannot take notes, cannot make copies, and \ncannot talk about what they have seen. What are they afraid people \nmight discover? If it is true that the TPP includes enforceable \nprovisions related to labor and environmental standards, why not make \nit public? Why not share what is supposedly so critical in this trade \nagreement with the American people?\n  The fact that the TPP is secret is obnoxious. Most of what we know \nabout it has come from leaks that indicate that the TPP, just like its \npredecessors, will simply help multi-national corporations and further \nimpoverish the lower and middle classes here at home.\n  For example, the TPP includes a chapter on Investment-State Dispute \nSettlement (ISDS) that would allow multi-national corporations to sue \nstate and local governments, or the Federal government, in private \ntribunals by alleging that American laws or regulations limit their \nprofits. Companies like Phillip Morris could sue for compensation for \nloss of sales because of cigarette labeling laws. Companies could sue \nto void enforcement of minimum wage, or factory, safety or consumer \nlaws.\n  According to the USTR, the TPP will also include new rules to \n``ensure fair competition between state-owned enterprises (SOEs) and \nprivate companies.'' This could lead to privatization of a variety of \npublic services. And just this week, the House voted to repeal our \nCountry of Origin Labeling law after the WTO ruled that it \ndiscriminated against Canada and Mexico, raising even more questions \nabout the consequences of these trade agreements on the sovereignty of \nour nation.\n  These questions are only the tip of the iceberg, and highlight the \nneed for an open and honest review of the TPP rather than blindly \nfacilitating its passage. The Constitution grants Congress the power to \nregulate foreign commerce. We must not cede that authority to the \nExecutive Branch and abdicate our responsibility to protect the public \ninterest. If the TPP is as beneficial as its supporters have claimed, \nit should be able to withstand scrutiny in the light of day and a full \ndebate in Congress.\n  But we don't have to rely on leaks about the TPP to justify voting \nagainst the bills on the floor today. A host of provisions that have \nbeen added to the Trade Enforcement bill (H.R. 644) in order to gain \nsupport for this bill are egregious, such as prohibiting negotiations \nto address climate change, weakening language to combat human \ntrafficking, and removing language to address currency manipulation.\n  This bill is dangerous and destructive. I urge my colleagues to vote \nNo.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of the \nmotion to concur is postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4271-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4271-H4333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1145\n                     AMERICA GIVES MORE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. TIBERI.

    Middle East--an area of paramount strategic importance to the \n     United States.\n       (2) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement formed \n     the modern foundation of the bilateral commercial \n     relationship between the two countries and was the first such \n     agreement signed by the United States with a foreign country.\n       (3) The United States-Israel Free Trade Agreement has been \n     instrumental in expanding commerce and the strategic \n     relationship between the United States and Israel.\n       (4) More than $45 billion in goods and services is traded \n     annually between the two countries in addition to roughly $10 \n     billion in United States foreign direct investment in Israel.\n       (5) The United States continues to look for and find new \n     opportunities to enhance cooperation with Israel, including \n     through the enactment of the United States-Israel Enhanced \n     Security Cooperation Act of 2012 (Public Law 112-150) and the \n     United States-Israel Strategic Partnership Act of 2014 \n     (Public Law 113-296).\n       (6) It has been the policy of the United States Government \n     to combat all elements of the Arab League Boycott of Israel \n     by--\n       (A) public statements of Administration officials;\n       (B) enactment of relevant sections of the Export \n     Administration Act

requirements relating to the boycott;\n       (C) enactment of the 1976 Tax Reform Act (Public Law 94-\n     455) that denies certain tax benefits to entities abiding by \n     the boycott;\n

sanctions;\n       (5) notes that the boycott, divestment, and sanctioning of \n     Israel by governments, governmental bodies, quasi-\n     governmental bodies, international organizations, and other \n     such entities is contrary to the General Agreement on Tariffs \n     and Trade (GATT) principle of non-discrimination;\n       (6) encourages the inclusion of politically motivated \n     actions that penalize or otherwise limit commercial relations \n     specifically with Israel such as boycotts, divestment from, \n     or sanctions against Israel as a topic of discussion at the \n     U.S.-Israel Joint Economic Development Group (JEDG) and other \n     areas to support the strengthening of the United States-\n     Israel commercial relationship and combat any commercial \n     discrimination against Israel;\n       (7) supports efforts to prevent investigations or \n     prosecutions by governments or international organizations of \n     United States persons on the sole basis of such persons\n\n[[Page H4320]]\n\n     doing business with Israel, with Israeli entities, or in \n     Israeli-controlled territories; and\n       (8) supports American States examining a company's \n     promotion or compliance with unsanctioned boycotts, \n     divestment from, or sanctions against Israel as part of its \n     consideration in awarding grants and contracts and supports \n     the divestment of State assets from companies that support or \n     promote actions to boycott, divest from, or sanction Israel.\n       (c) Principal Trade Negotiating Objectives of

discourage \n     commercial activity solely between the United States and \n     Israel.\n       (B) To discourage politically motivated actions to boycott, \n     divest from, or sanction Israel and

elimination of state-sponsored unsanctioned \n     foreign boycotts against Israel or compliance with the Arab \n     League Boycott of Israel by prospective trading partners.\n       (2) Effective

Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Ryan: On April 23, 2015, the Committee on \n     Ways and Means ordered H.R. 1907, the Trade Facilitation and \n     Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, to be reported favorably to \n     the House. I agree to discharge the Committee on Financial \n     Services from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may proceed expeditiously to the House Floor.\n       The Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that, by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1907 \n     at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     that our committee will be appropriately consulted and \n     involved as the bill or similar legislation moves forward so \n     that we may address any remaining issues that fall within our \n     Rule X jurisdiction. Our committee also reserves the right to \n     seek appointment of an appropriate number of conferees to any \n     House-Senate conference involving this or similar \n     legislation, and requests your support for any such request.\n       Finally, I would appreciate your response to this letter \n     confirming this understanding with respect to H.R. 1907 and \n     would ask that a copy of our exchange of letters on this \n     matter be included in your committee's report to accompany \n     the legislation and/or in the Congressional Record during \n     floor consideration thereof.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 14, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1907, the Trade \n     Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, and your \n     willingness to forego consideration by your committee.\n       I agree that the Committee on Financial Services has a \n     valid jurisdictional interest in certain provisions of the \n     bill and that the Committee's jurisdiction will not be \n     adversely affected by your decision to forego consideration. \n     As you have requested, I will support your request for an \n     appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your \n     committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this \n     or similar legislation should such a conference be convened.\n       Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this \n     response in the Congressional Record during the floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1907. Thank you again for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n      Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Ryan, I am writing with respect to H.R. 1907, \n     the ``Trade Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015.'' \n     As a result of your having consulted with us on provisions in \n     H.R. 1907 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary, I agree to waive consideration of \n     this bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House \n     floor for consideration.\n       The Judiciary Committee takes this action with our mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing consideration of H.R. 1907 at \n     this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the subject \n     matter contained in this or similar legislation, and that our \n     Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as the \n     bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues in our jurisdiction. Our \n     Committee also reserves the right to seek appointment of an \n     appropriate number of conferees to any House-Senate \n     conference involving this or similar legislation, and asks \n     that you support any such request.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding, and would ask that a copy of our exchange \n     of letters on this matter be included in the Congressional \n     Record during Floor consideration of H.R. 1907.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n      Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 13, 2015.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Rayburn House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     Committee's jurisdictional interest in H.R. 1907, the Trade \n     Facilitation and Trade Enforcement Act of 2015, and your \n     willingness to forego consideration by your committee.\n       I agree that the Committee on Judiciary has a valid \n     jurisdictional interest in certain\n\n[[Page H4323]]\n\n     provisions of the bill and that the Committee's jurisdiction \n     will not be adversely affected by your decision to forego \n     consideration. As you have requested, I will support your \n     request for an appropriate appointment of outside conferees \n     from your committee in the event of a House-Senate conference \n     on this or similar legislation should such a conference be \n     convened.\n       Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this \n     response in the Congressional Record during the floor \n     consideration of H.R. 1907. Thank you again for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nArizona (Mr. Schweikert).\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. I thank the gentleman from Ohio for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, have you ever had one of those moments where you are \ncompelled to come running down here and come up to the mike because you \nare so enraged with the duplicity of some of the things you are \nhearing?\n  Beyond the simple facts of the rhetoric, looking at the math of our \ntrade surplus and deficits, the countries that we actually have trade \nagreements with, we have a surplus in manufactured goods; but let's \nmove beyond the basic math of growing our economy, the demographics \nissue we have in our country, and the need to have markets around the \nworld.\n  Some of the crazy things I am seeing put out in the media by Big \nLabor, the willingness to make up stories, to make up facts, Goebbels \nwould be very proud of them.\n  Having paid attention to Arizona during the NAFTA disputes and some \nof the crazy things that were said then, now, we look back, and it \nwasn't true. NAFTA has been a net positive. All the scary things that \nwere supposed to happen never happened.\n  Be careful that we are not getting conned by made-up stories. This is \ngood for America.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want everybody to understand how these three bills are sequenced \nand how and why they were set up this way by the majority so people \nwill understand our votes.\n  The sequence is the first vote will be TAA; next, TPA; and next, \nCustoms. The reason for TAA being first is to try to maximize the votes \namong Democrats for TPA. That is really why they were set up this way. \nWhy is Customs last? It is because there are many Democrats who will \nvote for TPA--at least some, there aren't that many perhaps--who don't \nlike the Customs bill.\n  Everybody who is listening should understand the rationale for this \nsequencing, and everybody should understand our reaction to the \nsequencing and what has happened here.\n  The way this has evolved is this. For years, I have worked to try to \nbuild strong bipartisan support for trade agreements, and we often have \nsucceeded. With Peru, it was over 100 Democrats. We worked on Korea and \ngot less, but the leadership and I voted for it because we worked \ntogether eventually for a truly bipartisan bill.\n  This TPA bill doesn't have that, and essentially, what has happened--\nin part, because of that--is that the leverage has been lost by the \nadministration, to some extent, and on our side to resist items like in \nthe Customs bill. That is really what is happening here. So this \nCustoms bill has to go over to the Senate, but everybody should \nunderstand the predicament that this places the administration and all \nof us in.\n  For example, the language regarding Malaysia and human trafficking--\nor human trafficking generally. What this Customs bill does is to \nweaken the language that is in the Senate bill. This is on human \ntrafficking, sex human trafficking.\n  It also relates to workers. Hundreds of thousands of people--for \nexample, in Malaysia, and other countries--essentially come to those \ncountries. Often, their passports are taken. They have no rights. We \nsay this should not happen. Malaysia is in tier 3, and the original \namendment said any country in tier 3 should not have the benefits of \nTPP. This weakens it and places this in--if it succeeds--in the TPA \nbill.\n  Secondly, on climate change--we worked hard in the Peru FTA to \nincorporate the May 10 agreement. We worked hard on worker rights, on \nenvironment, on medicines. Actually, because the then-Administration \nwould not negotiate it, Mr. Rangel and I negotiated the United States-\nPeru Free Trade Agreement with the Peruvian Government. Let no one say \nI am not for expanded trade--or lots of other Democrats. It had an \nannex in it relating to forestation and deforestation and illegal \nlogging. Why? It is because the Amazon affects all of us, and it \naffects trade.\n  Now, what we have is language which, if accepted here and then in the \nSenate, would essentially preclude that kind of an agreement. That is \nwhat happens when you don't proceed on a truly bipartisan basis and \nthere is no leverage for some of us.\n  Let me also talk about currency. There is also a provision on \nimmigration which could have an impact in terms of the negotiation. I \ndon't know that there will be a provision. What I do know is that this \namendment takes out the Schumer amendments on currency.\n  Let me just say a word. You have put some language into this bill on \ncurrency. It is like every other negotiating objective. It is not even \nSwiss cheese, with lots of holes. It is the weakest kind of cheese that \nhas no real substance to it, except maybe a good taste, but this has a \nbad taste.\n  Those negotiating objectives really are not meaningful; they are so \nvague, and it is the person who negotiates it who judges whether those \nvague negotiating objectives have been met.\n  So you take out the Schumer amendment. Now, what has been the impact \nof currency manipulation on jobs in the United States of America? This \nis one of the bases of the feeling of a lot of people in various \ncommunities, including the labor community, but way beyond--and our \ncitizenry.\n  Because of Japan's manipulation of currency--and then China's--we \nlost several million jobs. That is the reality. When people come here \nand say this bill of theirs, this TPA bill will help in terms of job \ncreation, and they say, as was said many times in various places, these \nare jobs we have already lost, that is nonsense.\n  There are more jobs in manufacturing and other places that could be \nlost that relate to the worker provisions in terms of Mexico, which \ncompetes with us, but it also relates to currency manipulation. The \nPresident has now said that China is interested, and there will be no \nmeaningful currency manipulation in TPP. Essentially, we are opening \nthe door for more and more currency manipulation.\n  This is the reason for the depth of our feeling about this TPA and \nthese amendments that will make it even worse. Everybody listening \nshould understand the depth of the feeling from so many of us in and \nout of this place, every movement--whether labor, environmental, \nmedicines, or whatever--to what is going on here.\n  I think this Customs bill makes TPA even worse and essentially has \ntied the hands--because there is not a strong bipartisan basis--I \nthink, of the Administration to really throw its weight around in terms \nof these amendments. I am afraid some of them are going to become law, \nand that should not happen.\n  I strongly urge strong opposition to this Customs bill, H.R. 644. It \nis one of the several reasons we should be voting ``no'' on the three \nvotes that are coming before us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Ryan) will now control the time for the majority.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, it is my pleasure \nto yield 1 minute to the distinguished gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nBoehner), the Speaker of the House.\n  Mr. BOEHNER. Let me start by thanking the gentleman from Wisconsin \nfor his leadership on the committee and his leadership on this bill. I \nalso want to thank Chairman Sessions and members of the Rules Committee \nfor all of their work.\n  I want to thank Mr. Tiberi, the chairman of the Trade Subcommittee, \nfor the tremendous job that he has done. I am grateful to all Members \nwho have offered constructive contributions to this debate.\n  My colleagues, we are not here today to debate any particular trade \nbill. The day for that may come, and when it does, we want to make sure \nthat agreement reflects the people's priorities.\n\n[[Page H4324]]\n\n  That means more jobs, higher pay, and more opportunities for workers, \nfarmers, and small businesses. That is why we want to make sure that \nthis agreement isn't rushed and we want to make sure that there is no \nagreement that is in secret. We want to make sure--darn sure--that \nthere is less authority for the President and more authority for the \npeople.\n  That is what this bill does. It is a means to an end, and the end is \nmore free trade that is good for our economy and good for our country, \nwhich brings me to another priority in this bill, and that is American \nleadership.\n  When America leads, the world is safer, for freedom and for free \nenterprise. When we don't lead, we are allowing and essentially \ninviting China to go right on setting the rules of the world economy. \nWhat that does is keep our workers and our products on the sidelines.\n  We are Americans, aren't we? We are not people who stand still. We \ndon't give in to doubt and defeatism. This is one of those moments when \nwe need to remember that this country is an idea. It is an idea of \npeople who choose their own destiny and people who dare to be \nexceptional.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  My colleagues, you will recall that the Prime Minister of Japan was \nhere earlier this spring. And during his address, which was about the \nneed for America to lead on trade, he talked about how this is an \n``awesome country'' because here, he said, ``you just choose the best \nidea, no matter who it comes from.''\n  Well, today, the best idea is to vote ``yes,'' not for the President, \nnot for ourselves, but for our kids and our grandkids.\n  I know some Members of this body don't like trade promotion \nauthority, some don't like Trade Adjustment Assistance. But today I am \nhere to vote for both because it is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nNorcross).\n  Mr. NORCROSS. I thank the gentleman for yielding. I certainly \nappreciate it, and talking about these three bills, how they are linked \ntogether.\n  But if we look at a couple of them, in particular, the trade \nadjustment is the equivalent of an execution, but you are getting to \nchoose your last meal. But the end result is you are dead or, in this \ncase, you are losing your job.\n  I am an electrician with a tie. That is where I started my career. \nDay in and day out I heard those struggles. I can take you to my \ndistrict and show you those empty buildings from the failed promises of \na trade agreement.\n  I joined this body on November 12, coming out of the worst economic \ntimes, and the first thing we are going to do is kick the American \nworker, kick him when he is down.\n  We have empty plants, as I mentioned before. Trade adjustment helps \nyou get a job for lower pay, less benefits, less wages. They call it a \ntrade bill for a reason. You are trading good jobs in here in America \nfor trade jobs----\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. NORCROSS. They call it a trade bill because they are trading \njobs. You lose your good job that has a pension, benefits, and a good \nwage that can take care of your children, for a job, after you go \nthrough the wringer, that pays less than half.\n  Yeah, we might have more jobs, but they are at the bottom end. They \nare not the kind that would help raise that.\n  So this body, if we worked as hard as we are on this bill for a \ntransportation and infrastructure bill, those are jobs that are here \ntoday and are for our future and make our country stronger.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy. I yield to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino).\n  Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, from the time of Ben Franklin, reliable and affordable \nuniversal mail delivery service has been an essential commitment here \nin the United States, particularly to rural and low-income urban areas \nlike my own.\n  I am concerned when I hear my constituents assert that our ongoing \ntrade negotiations could undermine our Postal Service. TPA and trade \nnegotiations must not undermine the U.S. Postal Service.\n  I am also very concerned that continued dumped steel imports are \nhurting our steel manufacturers. This is a very important industry in \nmy district. Even when we have antidumping duties to counter dumped \nimports, these duties are often evaded through various schemes, such as \nsending steel to another country to manufacture steel products, then \nsend the finalized product to the United States.\n  We must address these problems in this litigation for my support.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, I appreciate the \ngentleman's concern about the impact of currently negotiated trade \nagreements on the U.S. Postal Service.\n  The United States has consistently excluded government services, such \nas mail delivery, from its obligations in past agreements. It is my \nunderstanding that the United States is continuing to do so in the \nongoing Trans-Pacific, EU, and Trade in Services negotiations.\n  In addition, TPA specifically directs that trade agreements take into \naccount legitimate U.S. domestic objectives, which has consistently \nincluded providing universal mail services.\n  Our trade remedy laws are vital for countering unfairly priced and \nsubsidized imports. That is also why I worked with the Steel Caucus \nhere in the House, you being a member of that, to add to our \nenforcement bill a series of provisions that we call ``Level the \nPlaying Field'' to strengthen those laws.\n  Evasion of these laws is also a serious problem, which is why this \nenforcement bill contains extensive provisions to create new tools and \nauthorities to both prevent and go after evasion.\n  I thank the gentleman and appreciate his leadership on these issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nBarletta) for the purpose of engaging in a colloquy.\n  Mr. BARLETTA. I thank the chairman for helping me to improve this \nbill by including Steve King's immigration prohibitions and strong \ntools to stop currency manipulation.\n  We need to establish a process at Customs that will stop duty \nevasion, which hurts manufacturers in my district.\n  You and I, Mr. Chairman, have talked about having Customs investigate \nand decide duty-evasion cases subject to deadlines. Subjecting the \ndecisionmaking process at Customs to review at the U.S. Court of \nInternational Trade will allow U.S. manufacturers hurt by duty evasion \nto finally get the relief that they deserve.\n  Mr. Chairman, do you commit to working with me on achieving these \ngoals in conference?\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Reclaiming my time, I commit to working with \nthe gentleman to improve the bill in conference to level the playing \nfield for American manufacturing and American workers. And I also thank \nthe gentleman for his leadership in ensuring that we fully enforce U.S. \ntrade laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Becerra), a member of the Ways and Means Committee, and \nthe chair of our caucus.\n  Mr. BECERRA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Trade is pretty simple. We do it every day, whether you are trading \nin the old car for a newer car, or whether it is the largest economy in \nthe world trading with the rest of the world. We do it every day.\n  At the end of the day, what we want is a fair deal. I give you \nsomething; the benefit of the bargain is I get something back.\n  Any country that wants access to our markets needs to play by the \nrules. We can't allow cheating to hurt our workers, their wages, our \nbusinesses, or our economy.\n  And the American people get it. That is why they are so apprehensive \nabout any trade deal this Congress puts before it, because they want to \nknow, will we lead on their behalf? Or are we going to let the special \ninterests dictate the rules?\n\n  Will we retreat from our responsibility to make sure that if some \nforeign company is going to have access\n\n[[Page H4325]]\n\nto our markets, they are going to play by the rules?\n  When I take a look at this trade promotion authority legislation, I \nask myself, how can you ever get a good trade deal out of this when the \nrules are rigged against America?\n  One simple example. Everyone agrees we have had a bipartisan \nconsensus in this House--more than 230 Members have signed on to a \nletter in the past saying, We have got to stop countries that \nmanipulate their currency to try to make their products produced by \ntheir companies look cheaper than American products.\n  Yet, this legislation would prohibit us from going after the \ncountries that are cheating to prevent the companies in those countries \nfrom cheating. So how are we going to stop the companies that we know \nare pirating, that are stealing, that are cheating against us, how are \nwe ever going to stop them if the rules require us to go through those \ncountries to try to get those companies to abide by the rules?\n  When the country is cheating, I guarantee you, the companies are \ngoing to cheat. And that is not the way you get foreigners to access \nour market.\n  We can do much better. We have to do much better because the American \npeople want us to lead, not retreat.\n  That is why we should vote this down and get a better deal that the \nAmerican people know and feel is the right thing for America.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the distinguished majority \nwhip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nWisconsin for his leadership in bringing this bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, American trade is critical to strengthening our economy \nand to giving American workers the competitive advantage that we need \nso we can go out and sell more of our goods all around the world.\n  There aren't many impediments for foreign countries to bring their \nproducts into our countries and sell their goods here, but there are \nmany, many impediments when we want to sell our products that we make, \nby American workers, to foreign countries, especially in Asian \ncountries and European countries.\n  Those countries right now, our allies around the world, want to get \ngood trade agreements, good level playing fields, so that we can have \ngood negotiated trade back and forth and sell more of our products in \nthose countries.\n  But right now China is writing the rules while America sits on the \nsidelines. We are not a country that sits on the sidelines, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  This bill gets us in the game so America can go out and our workers \ncan compete on a level playing field and we can sell more of our \nproducts overseas.\n  But something else that this bill does, Mr. Speaker, is it actually \ngives Congress a direct say in the process, every step of the way. We \nlay out criteria, things that cannot be in trade deals, protections \nagainst immigration and global warming-type issues being included in \nthese trade deals.\n  But it also gives transparency, strong and enforceable rules so that \nany agreement that is reached would have to be available online, not \njust for us to read, as Members of Congress, but for the entire Nation \nto read for at least 60 days before there is even a vote in Congress. \nAnd then, of course, Congress would have the ultimate veto authority \nover a bad deal if it was sent.\n  This bill is critical to getting America back in the game so our \nworkers can be competitive. And when America competes on a level \nplaying field, we win.\n  Let's go create those American jobs by passing this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 17\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 22\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I take special pleasure to yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, the vote today is why I came to Congress. \nI promised the working men and women in my district that I would fight \nto make sure that they had a seat at the table when we were making \ndecisions that impact their life and their livelihood.\n  We all know that we must grow our economy and we must compete in a \nglobal marketplace. We all know what great products the American worker \nbuilds, and that we can outcompete anybody in the world. But we cannot \ncompete with the Bank of Japan and the Bank of China.\n  NAFTA cost us 1 million jobs, and Michigan is still paying the price. \nThe Korea Free Trade Agreement was a great deal for South Korea. They \nhave expanded their imports into this country by almost half a million \nproducts. And we have worked to just get 20,000 into that market.\n  Enough is enough. Congress cannot abdicate its responsibility to the \nworking men and women of this country. It is our responsibility to \nprotect our workers. Fast Track doesn't allow this. We should not pass \nit.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I understand the \nimportance of trade and the impact trade negotiations can have on our \nlocal economies, even back home in Illinois.\n  Currently, 1 in 3 manufacturing jobs depend on exports, and 1 in 3 \nacres on all American farms are planted for hungry families overseas.\n  As a Congressman, it is my job to make sure trade agreements protect \nAmerican workers, farmers, manufacturers, innovators, and service \nproviders by opening markets around the world because, when given a \nfair playing field, I have the utmost confidence that American \ncompanies and industries can outcompete foreign competitors.\n  But too many times, past trade agreements have left our industries, \nespecially steel, vulnerable to unfair trading practices like dumping.\n  I will continue to fight for stronger trade enforcement and be \ncommitted to protecting American jobs.\n  I want to thank Chairman Ryan and Subcommittee Chairman Tiberi for \ntheir leadership on this issue. And I really want to thank my colleague \nfrom Illinois, Representative Mike Bost, for his tireless efforts to \nstrengthen our trade remedy laws to protect American workers and more \nthan 2,000 workers at our steel factory in Granite City, Illinois.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), a senior member of the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. I thank the distinguished chairman of the committee for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe all of us here in Congress can agree that \nevasion of antidumping and countervailing duties is a serious problem \nand needs to be effectively addressed. That is why I rise in support of \nthis bill, because I think it thoroughly and thoughtfully addresses the \nissue.\n  The seafood industry in Louisiana has been particularly hit by this, \nwhich prompted me to work with industry, the committee, and others in \nthe administration to come up with a legislative fix for the growing \nproblem.\n  Thankfully, the bill before us today contains language from my \nPROTECT Act, providing tools for Customs to help out our legitimate \nimporters, distributors, and trade-affected domestic industries to \nprevent and combat fraud at our border, not after the fact, which makes \nit much more difficult to deal with.\n  Specifically, the language in this bill is dedicated to preventing \nand investigating evasion. Within that unit, there will be a point of \ncontact for private sector evasion allegations who will have the \nauthority to direct these evasion investigations and the duty to inform \ninterested parties. They have to inform the interested parties about \nthe status of the investigations.\n  We have also increased the types of data that Customs can use to \ntarget evading imports, and this language will increase information \nsharing between the Department of Commerce and the International Trade \nCommission to effectively investigate evasion.\n\n[[Page H4326]]\n\n  Finally, the bill sets specific requirements for Customs to \nadequately train its personnel involved in combating this. These are \nnecessary improvements to stop fraud before it gets to our borders.\n  I can tell you, I have gotten plenty of comments from folks back in \nmy district. Kimberly Chauvin, who is the owner of Bluewater Shrimp \nCompany in Dulac, Louisiana, said the language ``creates provisions \nthat we need. The Senate bill is a watered-down version. If we do not \nget Boustany's bill, the whole bill does us no good whatsoever.''\n  We need these tools. These tools are essential to effectively combat \nevasion. Evasion is too important a problem to remain unaddressed, and \nI think we are going to get to the best possible agreement on this when \nwe go to conference with this bill.\n  So I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this very important \npiece of legislation. Let's move the ball forward. Let's really \nstrengthen our laws to combat evasion and get this job done.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi Walters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support \nof trade promotion authority, or TPA, and I would like to thank the \ngentleman from Wisconsin, Paul Ryan, for his leadership on this issue.\n  TPA, not to be confused with TPP, would put Congress in the driver's \nseat when it comes to negotiating trade agreements. It would ensure the \nPresident is held accountable to Congress and the American people in \nnegotiating all trade deals. TPA, a public document which I have read \nand is available for the American people to read--in fact, it is right \nhere--would require the President to make public any free trade \nagreement before it comes to Congress for a vote.\n  Trade is a vital part of our economy. One in five jobs is supported \nby trade, and 4.7 million jobs depend on trade in California.\n  Right now, American companies cannot compete on a level playing \nfield. Trade barriers make it difficult for the U.S. to sell their \ngoods to the 95 percent of consumers that live overseas. Free trade \nagreements would eliminate these barriers and put in place fair and \nstrong rules for U.S. companies to compete and win.\n  Furthermore, if Congress fails to pass TPA and set the rules of the \nglobal economy, China will. We simply cannot cede our role as the \nglobal leader in the 21st century.\n  I urge my colleagues in the House and the American people to rally \nbehind TPA.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Linda T. Sanchez), a member of our committee.\n  Ms. LINDA T. SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise to express \nboth strong concern and guarded optimism about the customs bill before \nus today.\n  I will be voting against the underlying bill before us today because \nof the drastic and unnecessary changes the bill makes to TPA provisions \nrelated to human trafficking, currency manipulation, and immigration \npolicy. However, I remain optimistic that the customs provisions in \nthis bill can become as strong as the Senate bill during conference.\n  Senators worked on a bipartisan basis to reach an agreement after \nnearly a decade of negotiations on how we should be enforcing our trade \nlaws. I am now hoping that House Republicans will be part of getting \nthese provisions across the finish line.\n  One of my biggest priorities for many years has been finding a way to \ncombat the blatant abuse and duty evasion by some foreign producers \nthat undercut American industry here. Foreign companies use schemes to \navoid paying the duties they owe on goods that they import into the \nUnited States. That is why I have introduced and fought for the ENFORCE \nAct. For the first time, it finally feels like we are very close to \ngetting this done.\n  And to that end, I want to thank Representatives Tiberi and Boustany, \nalong with Chairman Ryan, for several productive discussions on the \nbest way to get this done in conference. I hope that we will be able to \nkeep working on a bipartisan basis to get a final, bipartisan House \ncustoms bill.\n  Giving up on the opportunity to give real teeth to our enforcement \nprocedures would not only be harmful to our economy, but it sends a \nmessage to manufacturers, employers, and U.S. workers that this \nCongress doesn't care about them. By increasing our customs security \nmeasures, we can ensure that American companies that play by the rules \nare not undercut by foreign competitors who cheat by evading duties on \ntheir goods.\n  I urge my colleagues to work to improve this bill by incorporating \nfinal language with some teeth. U.S. manufacturers have waited long \nenough to have customs enforcement that works.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. At this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King).\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank Chairman Ryan for yielding, and I also \nthank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would point out three things: trade promotion \nauthority needs to pass, TAA needs to pass, and the customs bill needs \nto pass. Those are the toggle switches that are set up.\n  The negotiations with Chairman Ryan could not have been better. I \nlaid two issues out in front: one was my concern that the President \nwould negotiate global warming and climate change; the other one was \nthe strong things that go beyond rumors of the negotiation of \nimmigration provisions into the future trade agreements that would be \nnegotiated under a trade promotion authority.\n\n  We addressed those issues. The language in the customs bill is \nlanguage that is tight. I have confidence in it. It says it shall not \nobligate the United States to grant access or expand access to visas \nissued under 8 U.S.C. 1101(a)(15).\n  Mr. Speaker, this satisfies my concerns, and I know that enforcement \nis a concern. But we are committed to standing together should that day \ncome that we need to do that, and we are hopeful that and expect that \nthe President, who we also anticipate will follow his commitment to \nsign this bill, will also abide by the provisions in it.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. I thank the chairman.\n  We expect the President to abide by the provisions in it. We will \nfollow through on our part of this bargain, if not. And this Congress \nhas an opportunity to veto.\n  So what a wonderful thing it is to go into a trade promotion \nauthority circumstance and know that for the next 6 to 9 years the U.S. \nTrade Representative will not be negotiating global warming, will not \nbe negotiating immigration. We preserve that for the United States \nCongress, as the Constitution directs. So that level of confidence lets \nus then focus on the trade agreements that are good for the economic \ngrowth of the United States of America. That is what is in front of us \nhere today, and I am very grateful we have gotten to this point.\n  I urge adoption of the customs bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I now yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer), a member of our committee.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I am frustrated to be on the floor today \nunable to vote for H.R. 644. This bill should be about helping American \nbusinesses export more, with greater efficiency, cutting red tape at \nthe border, and enhancing our ability to hold foreign tax cheats \naccountable. Instead, this bill cuts corners on what matters to \nAmerica's exporters and those undercut by bad actors abroad and gives \nspecial attention to the paranoia of the Republican caucus.\n  The Senate passed a perfectly good, bipartisan customs bill which had \na couple of strong provisions that I have authored in it. That \nlegislation is not what we are considering. Instead, today's bill \ncontains ill-advised language on immigration, climate change. It shorts \nefforts to deal with human trafficking and currency, and it reverses \nlongstanding American policy towards Israel and settlements.\n  It is not so much the fact that there were these vote-buying tactics \nthat\n\n[[Page H4327]]\n\nwere used to lard this up with inappropriate items that's concerning, \nbecause most will fall off in conference. I am frustrated that \nprovisions that would strengthen the bill and get bipartisan support \nhave been left out.\n  The Green 301 provisions, to help American businesses working abroad \nwho are put at a competitive disadvantage by operating at or above \nlocal environmental laws while native companies get a free pass when it \ncomes to following what is on the books. It is not fair, and there \nshould be an avenue of redress. The Green 301 would have done that.\n  And no one benefits from a trade agreement which can't be enforced.\n  I had the STRONGER Act, a trade enforcement and capacity building \nprovision that I have offered up, that we have attempted to get through \nhere. It is in the Senate bill--and should be in the House bill.\n  I will be fighting in conference to make sure that these provisions--\nGreen 301 and STRONGER--are protected in the Senate, that we have a \ncustoms bill that is worthy of support and some of the goofy stuff gets \nstripped away.\n  I will vote for TPA, but I am really frustrated that we don't have a \ncustoms bill that we all can support.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume to engage in a colloquy with the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Turner).\n  Mr. TURNER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, despite a longstanding U.S. policy against the use of \noffset agreements, many foreign governments continue to insist on using \noffset agreements, which clearly distort trade, are an unfair trade \npractice, and result in lost opportunities for American workers.\n  Offset agreements and military sales contracts are add-on provisions \nthat require U.S. companies to reinvest in foreign companies through \nthe purchase of additional goods and services, technology transfer, \nforeign-based subcontractor mandates, and other similar activities.\n  Chairman Ryan, under TPA, how will the Federal Government curb a \nforeign country's use of military offsets?\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I thank my friend for his question.\n  I agree that offset agreements distort fair trade. Under TPA, \nCongress will establish negotiating objectives for the President to \nseek more open market access for U.S. companies in the reduction, \nelimination, or prevention of trade distortion and localization \nbarriers. Thus, these provisions will direct the President to seek to \ncurb our negotiating partners' insistence on the use of offset \nagreements.\n  Mr. TURNER. I thank the gentleman for his response, and I look \nforward to working with him on this important issue.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Rhode \nIsland (Mr. Cicilline).\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, many this morning have said TPA will \nprotect American jobs. In Rhode Island, my home State, we know that is \nnot true. TPA will facilitate another bad trade deal that will result \nin more American jobs being shipped overseas.\n  Those who think this trade deal is good should come to Rhode Island \nand meet with the men and women who still can't find work after decades \nof a bad trade deal just like this one.\n  I have listened to former jewelry and textile workers who worked in \nthe once bustling mills in Woonsocket, Pawtucket, and Providence, who \ndon't understand why Congress is considering another trade bill that \nwill eliminate more American jobs.\n  My State lost over 40,000 jobs after NAFTA, mostly in manufacturing.\n  Haven't we seen the devastating impact of bad trade deals? Haven't we \nlearned our lesson, that a trade deal that fails to address currency \nmanipulation, that doesn't include enforceable provisions on the \nenvironment and on labor is a bad deal for American workers?\n  Of course we need to compete in a global economy. Of course we need \nto grow our economy. But we need to do it in a way that protects \nAmerican jobs and protects American workers. We need fair trade, not \njust free trade.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Bost), a member of the Steel Caucus, a \nMember who has been very passionate on the issue of leveling the \nplaying field.\n  Mr. BOST. I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, American workers can compete when everyone is on the \nsame playing field and has the same rules.\n  While opening new markets in the U.S., products are important. We \nmust have effective laws that protect companies and their workers from \nforeign companies who cheat. This includes nations that illegally dump \ninto our markets.\n  Under our current trade laws, American companies like U.S. Steel in \nsouthern Illinois must suffer long-term harm before remedies take \neffect. You know, that is like waiting until the house burns to the \nground before you call the fire department. It doesn't make sense.\n  That is why I am pleased that we are voting on the Enforcement bill \ntoday, which includes language that my friend from Illinois, \nCongressman Rodney Davis, and I introduced to combat these illegal \ntrade practices. This legislation speeds up the process and helps \ncompanies like U.S. Steel respond to illegal dumping before it causes \nserious harm to the company and its workers.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support today's bill, and we can protect \nour businesses and our workers from unfair trade.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1\\1/2\\ \nminutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Messer), a member of our \nleadership team, the Policy Committee director.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of trade promotion \nauthority because I am a conservative who believes trade creates jobs \nand opportunity.\n  In my district, farmers grow corn and soybeans and sell them all over \nthe world. Factory workers, like my mom, build faucets, cars, \nforklifts, and caskets and sell them all over the world.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Trade allows that to happen. When the American worker gets a chance \nto compete on a level playing field, we win. That is why we need trade \nagreements.\n  The truth is, under the policies of this administration, paychecks \nare shrinking. For many workers, there is more month than money as they \nstruggle to pay their bills. Killing this legislation does nothing to \nhelp those workers. In fact, it would only make their situation worse.\n  Trade-related jobs pay better. And when 95 percent of the Earth's \npopulation lives outside the United States, we can't afford to pull up \nthe drawbridges and shut out the rest of the world. That is not smart \npolicy, and it won't help the American worker.\n  Let's grow our economy. Let's secure good-paying jobs. And let's make \nsure the American worker leads this century just like we did the last.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 1 minute to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished House \nmajority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, before I move forward, I want to thank the \ngentleman. He has shown true leadership in working, and working with \neverybody, in this House. Any time you take up a large piece of \nlegislation, there are concerns. I have never seen another Member of \nthis House sit with more meaning, more concerns, and try to find a \nsolution, and I thank the chairman for that work.\n  Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, when I was headed home to California \nfrom D.C. one weekend, I saw something very troubling, but something \nactually today we can solve for the future. You see, it was February, \nand there was a labor dispute. There was a shutdown on our ports on the \nWest Coast. So as the plane descended, instead of seeing the beaches \nstretched throughout California or the Santa Monica mountains, my \nattention was drawn to the number of ships sitting idle in the ocean \nand the number of ships that were just sitting in the port. You see, \nthe docks were shut down and our economy was halted.\n\n[[Page H4328]]\n\n  When Americans cannot have their products moved to willing buyers, \nthe men and women who are part of the creation do not receive the \nrewards of their efforts. And in California, we cannot afford to waste \nany of our resources, especially what we have a short supply of--water. \nSo when the trade was shut down, the food that was produced throughout \nthe Central Valley would just rot on the docks.\n  But what was most interesting to me, Mr. Speaker, I remember a phone \ncall I got just another weekend after. It was the president of the \nRepublican freshman class here. He had just done a town hall, and he is \nfrom Colorado. He said: Mr. Leader, I have got a big issue in Colorado. \nThe ports of the West Coast are shut down. You see, my small businesses \nare hurt by that. They are hurt when we are not able to have trade.\n  I remember a big bipartisan press conference we had, Republicans and \nDemocrats alike, the largest one I have ever been a part of in the \npress room, talking about the ports being shut down, because every \nsingle one of their districts were affected, especially the small \nbusinesses.\n  When we cannot trade, our economy suffers and our way of life \nsuffers. In fact, during that same period of this crippling shutdown, \nour economy actually shrank.\n  Today, what we are talking about on the floor is trade promotion \nauthority. It allows us to get to an agreement. You know, we have not \nhad it for a few years.\n  So what has happened around the world while the rest of America sat \nidle? There have been 100 trade agreements; 100 trade agreements around \nthe world that we would want more of our small businesses to be a part \nof. You know how many we were a part of during that time? Zero, because \nwe did not have TPA.\n  You know, trade is the difference between rotting produce on the \nharbor docks and sending California goods around the world. Trade is \nthe difference between the lines of prosperity and the lines of \nstagnation.\n  We have a unique opportunity today. It is not a trade agreement. It \nis an opportunity. It is an opportunity that will empower each and \nevery Member of this floor to have input, to have transparency, but \nwhat is more important, to empower every single American to make sure \nthey are now at the table, that when there is the next trade agreement \nbetween countries who want to engage, America won't be left out, \nAmerica can lead once more.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nNadler).\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this bill. All the \ntrade agreements since NAFTA have been sold on the same propaganda, \nthat they will increase our exports and jobs, yet the results have \nalways been the same: they have multiplied our imports, ballooned our \ntrade deficits, hemorrhaged our jobs, and depressed our wages.\n  Now we are asked to vote for a fast-track agreement that will say we \ncannot amend any trade agreements, only vote them up or down, even if \nthey, like their predecessors, lack any means of protecting our workers \nfrom competition with workers who are paid 30 cents an hour and are \nassassinated if they try to form a union.\n  We know there will be a provision for private corporate tribunals \nthat can invalidate and render unenforceable American laws and \nregulations. It is our constitutional duty to regulate foreign commerce \nand trade agreements, not take them on a take-it-or-leave-it basis from \nthe executive branch. It is our constitutional duty to protect the \nAmerican sovereignty against foreign companies invalidating our laws \nthrough private corporate tribunals.\n  We must vote ``no'' on fast track to allow Congress to do its job to \nsee that the next trade agreement doesn't hemorrhage our jobs, doesn't \nignore currency manipulation, and doesn't invalidate our consumer, \nlabor, and environmental laws. We must say ``no.''\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, we are in the midst of an \nimpassioned debate on trade promotion authority, trade adjustment \nassistance, and trade enforcement. We are hearing arguments from our \ncolleagues on both sides of this issue, from both sides of the aisle. \nMr. Speaker, I am honored to serve as the voice of my constituents from \nsouth Florida, who directly see the impact of these free trade \nagreements every single day.\n  The United States currently has 20 free trade agreements, 11 of which \nare with countries in South and Central America. Miami is often called \nthe gateway to the Americas, and I am proud to represent a diverse and \nproud community that has seen the positive impact of free trade. \nWorkers in south Florida create goods and services that are used \nthroughout the world, something that is only made possible with free \ntrade agreements.\n  Congress must pass TPA so the United States can open up new markets. \nSince 2007, there have been over 100 agreements signed on a global \nscale while our country has sat idly by.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I want the American people's \nrepresentatives to have a strong hand in negotiating future free trade \nagreements, and this TPA bill ensures this will happen. It provides \nunprecedented amounts of time for the agreements to be read and ensures \nproper safeguards are in place for Congress, not the President, to \ndrive the agenda on the negotiations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage a ``yes'' vote on TAA, TPA, and trade \nenforcement. If anyone has any doubts as to whether TPA is good for our \ncountry, I encourage you to visit south Florida.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 30 seconds to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nBrendan F. Boyle), who I think has lost his voice.\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I am not going to \nspeak long as I have lost my voice.\n  If we pass fast track, the American workers will lose their voice. \nThis is wrong. The President has said that social mobility and income \ninequality are the issues of our time. If I really believed that \nanything we are voting on here would do anything to address that, I \nwould sincerely be voting ``yes,'' but it doesn't.\n  After 20 years of NAFTA and CAFTA and every sort of trade agreement, \nwe have not seen our middle class benefit. Let's finally use this time \nto rebuild the American middle class and stand up for our workers.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly), a Member from the other side of \nthe aisle.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, today's vote is about America's future. \nWho will shape it? It is not shaped by a recitation of grievance. It is \nnot shaped by making trade a symbol of all that we find bad in economic \nprogress. It is by seizing that future and shaping it, and that is what \nTPA does. It pries open foreign markets. It sets American rules \nsetting. It allows us to frame the issues in 40 percent of the world's \ntrade and economic activity.\n  We have never had an opportunity as important as this one to shape \nthe global economy to our advantage and to those of our trading \npartners. We must not lose this opportunity.\n  The grievances are legitimate, the concerns and fears are legitimate, \nbut we must look beyond them. We must address the future for future \ngenerations of American workers. I support the bill in front of us and \nurge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Ryan for his courtesy.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, how much time do we have remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan has 10 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 9\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield for the purpose of a unanimous consent request to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  (Mr. SHERMAN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SHERMAN. I insert in the Record a chart showing that we have a \n$100 billion trade deficit with our FTA countries. Those are the \nofficial statistics of the U.S. International Trade Commission.\n\n[[Page H4329]]\n\n                                               Public Citizen,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, February 2015.\n\n Job-Killing Trade Deficits Surge Under FTAs: U.S. Trade Deficits Grow \n    More Than 425% With FTA Countries, but Decline 11% With Non-FTA \n                               Countries\n\n       The aggregate U.S. goods trade deficit with Free Trade \n     Agreement (FTA) partners is more than five times as high as \n     before the deals went into effect, while the aggregate trade \n     deficit with non-FTA countries has actually fallen. The key \n     differences are soaring imports into the United States from \n     FTA partners and lower growth in U.S. exports to those \n     nations than to non-FTA nations. Growth of U.S. exports to \n     FTA partners has been 20 percent lower than U.S. export \n     growth to the rest of the world over the last decade (annual \n     average growth of 5.3 percent to non-FTA nations vs. 4.3 \n     percent to FTA nations from 2004 to 2014).\n       The aggregate U.S. trade deficit with FTA partners has \n     increased by about $144 billion, or 427 percent, since the \n     FTAs were implemented. In contrast, the aggregate trade \n     deficit with all non-FTA countries has decreased by about $95 \n     billion, or 11 percent, since 2006 (the median entry date of \n     existing FTAs). Using the Obama administration's net exports-\n     to-jobs ratio, the FTA trade deficit surge implies the loss \n     of about 780,000 U.S. jobs. The North American Free Trade \n     Agreement (NAFTA) contributed the most to the widening FTA \n     deficit--under NAFTA, the U.S. trade deficit with Canada has \n     ballooned and a U.S. trade surplus with Mexico has turned \n     into a nearly $100 billion deficit. More recent deals have \n     produced similar results. Under the 2012 Korea FTA, the U.S. \n     template for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, the U.S. trade \n     deficit with Korea has already surged 72 percent.\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n                                                           Pre-FTA trade                       Change in balance\n             FTA partner                  Entry date          balance          2014 Balance        since FTA\n----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\nIsrael *............................               1985             ($1.0)            ($15.2)            ($14.2)\nCanada..............................               1989             (23.9)             (82.4)             (58.5)\nMexico..............................               1994                2.6             (99.8)            (102.3)\nJordan..............................               2001                0.3                0.6                0.3\nChile...............................               2004              (2.0)                5.8                7.8\nSingapore...........................               2004                0.8               10.2                9.4\nAustralia...........................               2005                7.4               13.6                6.2\nBahrain.............................               2006              (0.1)                0.1                0.2\nEl Salvador.........................               2006              (0.2)                0.7                0.9\nGuatemala...........................               2006              (0.6)                1.5                2.1\nHonduras............................               2006              (0.7)                1.2                1.9\nMorocco.............................               2006                0.1                1.0                1.0\nNicaragua...........................               2006              (0.7)              (2.2)              (1.5)\nDominican Republic..................               2007                0.6                2.8                2.2\nCosta Rica..........................               2009                1.2              (3.2)              (4.4)\nOman................................               2009                0.6                0.9                0.4\nPeru................................               2009              (0.2)                2.9                3.0\nKorea...............................               2012             (15.4)             (26.6)             (11.2)\nColombia............................               2012             (10.0)              (1.2)               11.2\nPanama..............................               2012                7.8                9.4                1.6\n                                     ---------------------------------------------------------------------------\n    FTA TOTAL:......................  .................

Mr. Speaker, Members, trade adjustment assistance should \nnot be a sweetener, a trade-in coin. Trade adjustment assistance should \nbe what we do no matter what. It shouldn't pave the way for trade \npromotion authority.\n  It is important and good to stand with dislocated workers who \nbasically are pushed off their jobs because of bad trade deals, which \nwe have been pursuing for 40 years. Yet here we are today, told that we \nhave got to vote for this trade adjustment authority, which does not \ninclude public sector workers, which is smaller than it should be. We \nhave got to support it because--and the only reason we are here to \nsupport it, the only reason we have been lobbied by no less than the \nPresident and three top Cabinet officials, is because they know it \npaves the way to trade promotion authority, which is what they really \nwant so that, literally, Members give up our constitutional duty.\n  Where are my constitutional conservatives when you need them?\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nKildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I come from Flint, Michigan. Flint, \nMichigan, was the birthplace of General Motors, a place that put the \nworld on wheels. In the last couple of decades, it has seen 90 percent \nof our manufacturing jobs go away. Now, true, not all of them were lost \nbecause of bad trade deals, but many of them were. And bad trade deals \nhave exacerbated that job loss and have ruined many parts of that \ncommunity.\n  I support, as virtually all of us do, expanded trade as a way of \ngrowing the U.S. economy. I am a member of the President's Export \nCouncil. This is something we have to do. But this TPA is not a ``yes'' \nor ``no'' question on whether we should expand trade. This TPA is \nflawed. It fails to address the most significant trade barriers hurting \nAmerican manufacturers. It fails to address currency manipulation by \nour trading partners. And if we don't address the most significant \nbarrier, how can we expect any trade deal to have the effect? All we \nhave to do is look at the performance of past deals that have had \nsimilar flaws and we can see why we have failed.\n  If we are going to engage in expanded trade, we have to do it right, \nin a way that deals with currency, that deals with labor obligations, \nthat deals with environmental obligations.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance \nof my time\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Meeks).\n  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, today's vote to grant the President trade \npromotion authority is about America's future in a globalized world.\n  Let's be clear what is at stake. America's standing as a global \nleader has not come without strong leadership from this body, and it \nwill not be sustained if we act out of fear rather than on facts. The \nmost basic fact is that nations around the world are fighting for trade \nagreements for every advantage they can get for their economies and \ntheir workers.\n  It then raises the question: If we don't pass this agreement, who \nwill set the standards of trade? Will it be us, or will it be China? If \nthis bill fails, it will be China.\n  The bill before us today is a bipartisan effort to ensure that trade \ndeals negotiated by the Executive will be guided by congressional \ndirectives to reach the highest, most transparent, and progressive \nstandards ever required by law.\n  This bill should have the support of any Member who cares about the \nenforceable labor and environmental standards, promoting the rule of \nlaw, greater congressional oversight, and greater transparency for the \nAmerican people.\n  Today, we are also considering Trade Adjustment Assistance, a program \nthat for years Democrats have promoted to provide income and job \ntraining for those affected. TAA should pass also.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 7 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H4330]]\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Tiberi), chairman of the Trade Subcommittee \nand member of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. TIBERI. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and thank him for his \nleadership, credible leadership, on this debate, about American \nleadership, quite frankly.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, we are here to debate three bills today: trade \nassistance for displaced workers, trade promotional and accountability \nauthority that inserts Congress into the President's ability under the \nConstitution to negotiate a trade agreement with anybody he or she \nwants, and then finally customs and enforcement.\n  Enforcement is critical, ladies and gentlemen. It is a bill I am so \nthrilled and honored to have had the opportunity to introduce here in \nthe House. This is a key bill as part of trade. Far too long, we \nhaven't had as good of enforcement, quite frankly, as we need to have, \nand I am committed to that.\n  Now, let me just mention one thing--trade deficits, trade surpluses. \nWe have 20 countries that we have agreements with, trade agreements \nwith, 20 of them. Two of them happen to be on our borders, Mexico and \nCanada.\n  You take out energy that we import from them--and I would rather \nimport it from them than anywhere else in the world--we have a trade \nsurplus with those 20 countries, a surplus in manufacturing.\n  My dad was in manufacturing. I already told you before--and Mr. Levin \nhas heard this 1,000 times, I think; he is probably tired of hearing \nit--my dad lost his job of 25 years, and I lost my health care as a kid \nin the household, along with my sisters, long before NAFTA.\n  Globalization began occurring, as Dr. Boustany said, after World War \nII. We can either engage or disengage. When we disengage, we lose. When \nAmerica engages, we win. We can outwork anybody.\n  What trade agreements do actually is break down barriers so we can \ncompete, and then we have to have the enforcement piece. Ladies and \ngentlemen, that is what this is about. It is about breaking down \nbarriers.\n  My State of Ohio has been devastated by globalization. My dad's job \nbefore NAFTA was devastated by globalization. Forty-eight countries in \nAsia have had trade agreements with each other. For the last 10 years, \nwe are party to two. The world is passing us by. We are being left \nbehind. We can compete if we break down barriers. That is what we need \nto do today.\n  Trade assistance--insert Congress into the President's ability to \nnegotiate because he already has that ability. This doesn't change \nthat. This inserts us. This inserts slow track. With that agreement, \nwhatever that agreement is, in Asia, in Europe, 60 days in public \nbefore the President can sign it, 60 days.\n  I wish I had 6 hours--6 hours--to review the Affordable Care Act \nbefore I had to vote on it. This is 60 days where Members will have an \nability to look at what was negotiated. If we don't like it, we will \nvote it down. We have the constitutional authority to do that.\n  This is about jobs. Vote all three bills ``yes.''\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski).\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of American \nworkers, American manufacturing, and the environment and in strong \nopposition to TPA.\n  TPA is woefully inadequate when it comes to stopping currency \nmanipulation, enforcing labor standards, and protecting American \nconsumer and environmental protections. This is exactly the wrong time \nfor Congress to be giving up its authority, which is our constituents' \nability to have a voice on trade deals.\n  This is not labor versus business. Lapham-Hickey Steel, Independence \nTube, and countless other manufacturers across my district oppose this. \nFord Motor opposes this because they know past trade agreements sold as \neconomic boons have been a bust, and they are gravely concerned about \nhow the massive TPP enabled by this TPA will kill more Americans jobs. \nWe need fair trade and American workers will win, but that is not what \nthey are being given.\n  It is time for Congress to stand up for the middle class and American \nmanufacturing and stop passing bad trade deals. Vote ``no'' on TPA.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Ryan).\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  This reminds me of the song: Are you going to believe me or your \nlying eyes? When you come from areas of the country that some of us \nrepresent, you see what has happened with these trade deals.\n  Adelphi factory in Warren, Ohio, had 13,000 workers. NAFTA passed; \nthey moved over the border and ship their products back to the United \nStates. We will be lucky if there are even 2,000 workers there. An auto \nplant had 16,000 workers, General Motors. Now, they are down to 3,000-\n4,000 because of the trade agreements.\n  The chairman talked about currency manipulation. We have countries \nshipping products to the United States; their final product lands on \nour shores, and it is the same cost as the raw materials for the \nAmerican company. That is not free trade. That is not fair trade. That \nis a raw deal for the companies in the United States and the American \nworkers.\n  Let's even say that these trade agreements are good for the economy, \nas many people may believe. You still need immigration reform; you \nstill need a transportation bill; you still need investments in \nresearch, in biosciences, and renewable energy.\n  I can't believe that some of us are voting for this and not getting \nany of those other things implemented. No, no, no.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes \nto the gentleman from New York (Mr. Reed), a Member of the House Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of trade. It is time for \nus to lead. When you open up markets to our manufacturers, to our \nworkers, you are creating jobs here on American soil.\n  I am a firm believer in U.S. manufacturing, Mr. Speaker. I co-chair \nwith my colleague from Ohio the Manufacturing Caucus here, and what we \nare seeing is a renaissance in U.S. manufacturing. We are finally \ndriving utility costs down. We are creating an opportunity where U.S. \nmanufacturers are coming back on shore.\n  What do we need to do? We need to create markets. Ninety-five percent \nof the world's population lives outside of America's borders. Forty \npercent of the world's market is represented in the negotiations that \nare going on with the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Why in the world would we not lead and negotiate an openness and fair \nlevel playing field for our American workers and our American \nmanufacturers? It doesn't make any sense.\n  I ask my colleagues to join us, join with us, to open up these \nmarkets so that we can create the jobs of today and tomorrow where we \nmake it here to sell it there. That is what this is doing. That is what \ntrade is all about. When we have rules-based trade, our workers and our \nmanufacturers win.\n  I encourage us not to get into these petty political fights and have \nsome type of litmus test as to who is on whose side in regards to this \nissue. Stand with the American workers; stand with the American \nmanufacturers; open up those world markets to our rules-based system, \nand I would agree, at the end of the day, we all win, and America will \nwin.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Clawson), as I understand he hasn't been able to get time \nfrom his side.\n  Mr. CLAWSON of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I am for opportunity for \neveryone and fairness for everyone, including American companies and \nAmerican workers.\n  Since leaving my career in the automotive industry, I often run into \nfolks that I used to know from the industry, except now they work at \nCVS or they work at the TSA. They say: Mr. Clawson, any chance the \nplant is going to open back up? I am having a hard time making ends \nmeet. I am having a hard time paying for my kid's college education.\n\n[[Page H4331]]\n\n  I, unfortunately, can't give them much hope. If those plants close \nbecause of lack of American competitiveness, I can swallow hard, and I \ncan accept it; but when those plants close because of currency \nmanipulations, which is an afterthought today, then I don't accept it, \nand my sadness for this unemployment turns to hardness, which is where \nI am today.\n  This is not about American competitiveness; this is about getting a \nchance for world-class manufacturing facilities who eliminate jobs.\n  I say currency manipulation, no way. I say TPA, no way. I say vote \n``no.''\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how many \nspeakers are left on the other side?\n  Mr. LEVIN. We have one, and I will close.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of the House \nRules Committee, the coauthor of the TPA bill.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the young chairman from Wisconsin \nfor his hard work.\n  Mr. Speaker, before we pass TPA today, the law is that the President \nof the United States can go negotiate whatever he wants without \nnegotiation with the Congress and just go do it and come and plop it on \nour doorstep.\n  I disagree with that, and that is why we are doing TPA, trade \npromotion authority, where the House of Representatives maintains its \nconstitutional prerogatives and is empowering through TPA any \nPresident, whoever the President is, for the next 7 years to go \nnegotiate in some 150 parameters as they negotiate.\n  We maintain our sovereignty in this bill, including additions that we \nsay the President cannot go negotiate--a new global warming trade bill, \nclimate change, he cannot go negotiate anything new on immigration; it \ngoes on and on and on--steel, and other things.\n  We are giving the President our authority and expecting him to \nnegotiate therein. This is a good deal for the American worker.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it is now my real pleasure to yield 1 minute \nto the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Pelosi), our leader.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. Mr. Speaker, today, we have a very important decision to \nmake in this Congress.\n  I join with the Speaker in acknowledging the hard work that so many \nhave put in on this important subject.\n  I want to thank the President of the United States and his \nadministration for being available with their Cabinet officers and the \nrest to explain to us how they see what is in the TPA--let me call it \n``fast track'' so we separate this out--and what the prospects are now \nfor the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  I want to thank our friends in labor, environmental groups, and \nfaith-based groups who have expressed their opposition to so much of \nwhat has been presented, all of which will be constructive as we try to \nmove forward with a better trade promotion act--fast track. Not so fast \nfast track.\n  We all understand that we live in a global economy. Some of us, as I \ndo, represent cities that are built on trade, the city of San \nFrancisco, and I grew up in a city where the famous clipper ships \nbrought product to and from our shores in Baltimore, Maryland. It is a \ngreat and exciting prospect to expand markets for our products and \nhaving U.S. global leadership.\n  I was hopeful from the start of all of this discussion that we could \nfind a path to ``yes'' for the fast-track legislation that was being \nput forth. There were some bumps in the road along the way and some \npotholes along the way--unfortunately, I think, sinkholes as well--but \nthat doesn't mean that that road cannot be repaired. I just believe \nthat it must be lengthened.\n  Each week, each of us goes home to our districts, and in the case of \nmany of us, we put our hands on a very hot stove. We hear the concerns \nof so many families who have financial instability and uncertainty. \nSome of it is still springing from 2008 when they were threatened with \nthe loss of their homes, their jobs, and their pensions, when they were \nliving on their savings, with the inability to send their kids to \ncollege--all of it undermining the American Dream. As the economy has \nimproved under the leadership of President Obama, still, middle class \neconomics have not fully turned around the country, because the \nconsumer confidence that people must have in order to invest, to spend, \nto inject demand into the economy is simply not there.\n  So my concern about all of this, it is about time. Why are we fast-\ntracking trade and slow-walking the highway bill? It is about time. \nAgain, people have not recovered from 2008 sufficiently to have the \nconsumer confidence to turn around our consumer economy. I think, \ntoday, we have an opportunity to slow down. We all know we want to \nengage in trade promotion and the rest of that, but we have to slow \ndown. With whatever the deal is with other countries, we want a better \ndeal for America's workers.\n  Another element of time that I am concerned about is the time that is \nrunning out for us to rein in the consequences of climate change. I \nwant to just talk about myself for a moment, and I am bragging. I hold \nmyself second to none in this body on the subject of protecting the \nenvironment and recognizing the challenges of climate crisis.\n  When I first came to the Congress, President George Herbert Walker \nBush was President, and he signed my legislation, which is now called \nthe Pelosi Amendment to the International Development and Finance Act \nof 1989. It said that any of our directors with any of our multilateral \ndevelopment banks had to have an environmental assessment made--and \nmade known--to the indigenous people who were affected by whatever \ndevelopment was there and made known to the world. The connection \nbetween the environment and commerce is inseparable, and for over 25 \nyears, the Pelosi Amendment has been in effect.\n  When I became Speaker, my flagship issue was energy independence and \nclimate, so I speak from some authority on this subject. The son of \nGeorge Herbert Walker Bush, President George W. Bush, signed the energy \nbill of 2007. We worked together to find alternatives to fossil fuels. \nHe wanted nuclear, and I wanted renewables. We had a very successful \nenergy bill of 2007, done under the auspices of the Select Committee on \nEnergy Independence and Global Warming that I established as Speaker, \nwhich has been abolished since then.\n  Pope Francis, in another week, will be announcing his initiative on \nclimate. While this is all going on--while schoolchildren know that \nthis is a challenge that we must face to protect our planet, while \npeople of faith join us and say, ``This is God's creation, and we have \na moral responsibility to be good stewards of it''--in this bill today, \nwhich is the customs bill that is on the floor right now, it prohibits \nthe USTR from negotiating on climate change. How could it be? Twenty-\nfive years ago, the Pelosi Amendment was passed because we saw melting \nsnow in regions, and areas as big as the United Kingdom were burning in \nthe Amazon. This is 25 years later, and we are putting in the bill that \nthe USTR cannot negotiate on climate change. You cannot separate \ncommerce and the environment.\n  I salute the President. He has been magnificent and courageous in \ngoing out there and taking up the fight for America's leadership on \nclimate change. He has been great. He has an agreement with China, \nwhich almost could not have been foreseen except for his leadership and \nthe cooperation between our two countries. So it is not that he isn't \ndoing his part. It is Congress. Again, it is about time, slowing down \nour responses when we should be proactive, yet fast-tracking \nlegislation to do that.\n  What is interesting is, we in the House, are we labeling ourselves \nthe ``lower body'' and giving new meaning to that term when the Senate \ncould have opportunity for amendment after amendment if their \ncolleagues gave them the votes? In this House, we fast-track the fast \ntrack with no chance to amend any of it. Just vote it up or down. I \nfind that unnecessary, unacceptable, and one place we could go to have \na discussion on how to improve the fast-track legislation. At the same \ntime, the Republican majority is allowing in the customs bill \namendments to the fast-track bill, this amendment on climate, other \namendments on immigration, and they were spelled out by Mr. Sessions \nearlier and with great\n\n[[Page H4332]]\n\npride--amendments to the fast track in the customs bill but no \namendments for Democrats. Again, I don't see how this Congress can \nignore that. I don't see how this trade agreement can ignore it.\n\n  Much has been said about security issues that are involved in this \nagreement and that we have to make a geopolitical case for this trade \nagreement. Of course, we always have the safety of the American people \nas our first responsibility. Their security is what we come here to \nprotect. Yet how could it be that we are allowing--again, let me say it \nanother way because I am being very prayerful about this. Pope Paul VI \nsaid--I mentioned Francis earlier--if you want peace, work for justice, \neconomic justice. I don't see this happening in this fast-track bill, \nor the lifting up of people in the rest of the world or having trade \nagreements that increase the paycheck of America's workers. That should \nbe our first order of business--environmental justice, looking at these \nprohibitions on dealing with climate in 11 other countries in the world \nand then our own.\n  I commend the President because, in the fast-track bill, there are \nsome good provisions, issues, on the environment. I am talking about an \nethic, a responsibility, a comprehensive view of the future. Again, the \nPelosi Amendment addressed the indigenous people, all of these people, \nwho will be not of the first, shall we say, priority for many of these \ncountries as they make their economic decisions.\n  On the subject of security, last year, 16 former three- and four-star \ngenerals and admirals who served on the CNA Corporation's Military \nAdvisory Board released a report, and 16 former three- and four-star \ngenerals said that climate change is a catalyst for conflict. Climate \nchange, they said, will have an impact on military readiness, strain \nbase resilience both at home and abroad, and it may limit our ability \nto respond to future demands.\n  We have rejected fast track before. After NAFTA, President Clinton \nsent a fast-track bill to the Congress, and it didn't even have enough \nvotes to be taken up. The second time, it was rejected. When we had a \nmajority in the House, we did not have fast track for President Bush. \nSo, when people say this is the first time, it isn't so. Instead, under \nthe leadership of Mr. Levin and Mr. Rangel, we had the May 10 agreement \nwith the basic principles of how we should engage other countries. That \nis part of--and thank you, Mr. President--what the TPA has as its \ngoals, but we were dealing bilaterally, one country at a time. This is \na multilateral agreement with 11 other countries--12 countries and \ngrowing--and we need to slow this fast track down. I think it is \npossible.\n  One of the questions that arises is the question of the trade \nadjustment assistance. Most of us have not only voted for this but have \nbeen champions of it over time. In speaking about myself again, it was \none of the first issues I dealt with when I came to the Congress. It is \nreally important, but as some of my colleagues have said, our people \nwould rather have a job than trade adjustment assistance. I talked \nabout that red-hot stove that people put their hands on when they go \nhome. Mr. Cicilline talked about his district, Mr. Norcross about his, \nMr. Boyle about his, and the list goes on and on. How do we say to \nthese people, ``We are here for you; you are our top priority'' when \nthe impression that they have is that this is not a good deal for them? \nBut it can be. I am hopeful that it can be. So, while I am a big \nsupporter of TAA, if TAA slows down the fast track, I am prepared to \nvote against TAA because, then, its defeat, sad to say, is the only way \nthat we will be able to slow down the fast track.\n  Now, I understand there will be some manipulations here one way or \nanother as to what bill comes first and what can come up and what \ncan't, but the facts are these, actually: if TAA fails, the fast track \nbill is stopped. They may take up the vote, as they said they would \nnot, but they have changed. They may take up the vote, but it doesn't \ngo anyplace. It is stuck in the station. And for that reason, because \nthe Senate has sent us the bill that way, connected--and if the fast \ntrack passes, we will need TAA--sadly, I would vote against the TAA, \nand I just wanted you to know where I was coming from on that.\n  For these and other reasons, I will be voting today to slow down the \nfast track in order to get a better deal for the American people--\nbigger paychecks, better infrastructure. Help the American people \nfulfill the American Dream.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Levin for his leadership, and I thank all of our \ncolleagues who have worked so hard on this, really, on both sides of \nthe issue.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. How much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Wisconsin has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining, and the gentleman from Michigan has 3 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Given that I have the right to close, I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close, and I yield myself the \nbalance of my time.\n  Today the votes on TAA and TPA are combined, and we did not do that. \nThe Republicans did so to win votes for TPA, so they used TAA as a \nbargaining chip. I don't support their doing so, as someone who has \nbeen a lead sponsor of TAA. Voting ``no'' on TAA gives us a better \nchance to get all of these issues right.\n  Throughout my career, I have voted on lots of trade agreements, and I \nhave voted for most of them. I negotiated a few of them when USTR would \nnot do so. As mentioned, we Democrats are responsible for the labor and \nenvironmental standards and, very importantly, access to medicines that \nwe worked out with difficulty also on May 10. So we Democrats built the \nfoundation, and we don't want to see it eroded. Language in bills isn't \nenough; it is what will happen in terms of the implementation of that \nlanguage.\n  I want to say just a few words about jobs, because it is often said \nwe have lost those jobs, they have gone away, so, therefore, don't \nworry. There are millions of jobs in this country that are in danger of \nbeing lost if we don't do trade right. That is why we need to do it \nright. I think TPA essentially puts TPP on a fast track when it is on \nthe wrong track. It is on the wrong track. There are negotiating \nobjectives, but they are so vague, they don't really mean anything.\n  We put forth a very, very important alternative, a substitute bill \nthat laid out instructions on each of these 10 or 11 issues, whether it \nwas workers' rights--I can go down the list--currency, environment, \ninvestment, access to medicines, automotive market access, rules of \norigin, tobacco controls, state-owned enterprises, agricultural market \naccess, food safety. There has been a response to none of these.\n  So as someone who believes in expanded trade, we have to do better, \nand to fast-track TPA is on the wrong track. I urge a ``no'' vote on \nall of these bills.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RYAN of Wisconsin. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I make two points. This is about bringing transparency and \naccountability to government. We are not considering a trade agreement \ntoday. We are considering a process by which we consider trade \nagreements. That is what trade promotion authority is. In this process, \nwe are saying you have got to let Members of Congress see the \nnegotiating text, you have got to let the country see a trade agreement \nonce an agreement is reached, and you have got to follow Congress' \nrules, Congress' direction. That is what this does to make sure that \nthe executive branch follows the track laid out by the legislative \nbranch. The bigger point is this: this is about jobs; it is about \nincome, take-home pay, American leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, the world is watching us right now. They are watching \nthis vote. Since TPA lapsed in 2007, the rest of the world kept going. \nWhile America stood still on trade, the rest of the world created 100 \ntrade agreements, negotiated and passed 100 trade agreements, to which \nthe United States was a party to zero of them. What this means is other \ncountries are going around the world getting better agreements between \nother countries, lower tariffs, lower nontariff barriers, so their \ntrade grows, and as a result the barriers against American products go \nhigher.\n  Ninety-five percent of the world's consumers don't live here; they \nlive in\n\n[[Page H4333]]\n\nother countries. If we want good jobs and good wages, we need to make \nand grow more things in America and sell them overseas. What is \nhappening is, every single day we do nothing to open these markets up, \nwe lose, and the rest of the world gets those jobs.\n  The last point is a point that I think people don't appreciate as \nwell. We are in the dawn of the 21st century with enormous issues: \ncyber threats, intellectual property, you name it. The rule book on how \nthe global economy works is being written right now. The only way for \nus to be in the game to write that rule book is through trade \nagreements: get other countries to agree to our rules, get other \ncountries to agree to our standards, open their markets to our \nproducts. That is how we write the rules for the global economy. That \nis how America leads.\n  A ``no'' vote is to say America can't even try. A ``yes'' vote is to \nsay more transparency, more accountability. Then Congress decides, and \nwe are giving America a chance to stay in the leading position in the \nworld. That is why I argue for a ``yes,'' ``yes,'' ``yes'' vote.\n  I want to thank everyone on the staff of the Ways and Means Trade \nSubcommittee.\n  Our staff director, Angela Ellard, Geoff Antell, Stephen Claeys, \nNasim, Neena Shenai, Casey Higgins, Paul Guaglianone.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to \nfast track authority and the Trade Act of 2015. Passage of this \nlegislation today will undermine Congress's constitutional authority to \nregulate trade and, I fear, accelerate the de-industrialization of our \ngreat country.\n  The Constitution is very clear that it is Congress, and Congress \nalone, that has the power to ``regulate commerce with foreign \nnations.'' Passage of fast track, which grants the Executive Branch \nauthority over how and when legislation must be considered by Congress, \nundermines our chamber's very ability to effectively regulate foreign \ncommerce.\n  I share the concerns of many Members and middle class families in \nTexas and around the country about the Trans-Pacific Partnership--TPP--\nthis mega-trade deal we are negotiating with Japan, Vietnam, and other \ncountries.\n  To this date, Congress has been left in the dark as to what's in TPP, \nlet alone made public to the American people. We are told that TPP will \nhelp American businesses export billions of dollars of manufactured and \nservices each year and has labor and environmental protections that all \ncountries will have to abide by. But we simply don't know because we \nhaven't seen the text.\n  What I do know is that these so-called free trade deals have \ndisplaced millions of middle class jobs to developing countries over \nthe past 20 years.\n  Our district in Houston and Harris County, Texas saw first-hand the \nconsequences of free trade when five plants moved to Mexico in the \nyears immediately after we joined NAFTA.\n  If TPP benefits the American people as much its supporters say, it \ndoesn't need fast track. It can--and should--be considered under \nregular order and give Congress and the American people the time to \ndebate the merits of this trade agreement, the largest our country has \never negotiated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I call on Members from both sides of the aisle to stand \nwith America's working families and small businesses and to vote no on \nfast track.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to clause 1(c) of rule XIX, further consideration of the \nmotion to concur with an amendment is postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4333-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4333-H4335]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       ENSURING TAX EXEMPT ORGANIZATIONS THE RIGHT TO APPEAL ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to pay tribute to the life of Burney \nStarks, a man who was beloved by many in southern Arizona and who \nrecently, suddenly passed away.\n  Burney dedicated his life to service as an Army veteran, a school \ncounselor, and drop-out prevention specialist for the Tucson Unified \nSchool District. He played football for the University of Arizona and \ngraduated from the U of A with honors.\n  Southern Arizonans will remember his incredible singing voice, his \nlove for Motown and karaoke, and his active involvement in the \ncommunity. He was a lead organizer for the Juneteenth Festival, and he \nwas involved in many local organizations, including the Tucson Boys \nChoir, Tucson MLK Celebration Committee, and the Warrior Alumni \nFoundation.\n  He had a passion for helping others succeed and a unique gift for \nbringing out their best. I had the distinct pleasure of seeing Burney a \nfew weeks ago on Memorial Day before he died. He was as lighthearted \nand dynamic as ever.\n  His smile and laughter will be missed by many, but no doubt his \nspirit will live on through the countless lives he touched during his \nlife.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4336-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       DETERMINING A PATH FORWARD\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, over the last couple of hours, we had \nthe opportunity to discuss some important issues that, as they were \nframed, many Americans might not understand. They are called trade \nissues or trade legislation to discuss the interactions between the \nUnited States and its future world trading partners.\n  No vote here should be maligned. When I stand here to emphasize that \nwhatever the ultimate results are, if these bills do not generate into \nactual jobs for our local districts, then we have all failed.\n  That is the question for this Congress and that is the question for \nthose who are working so intently and for those of us who raise the \nquestion whether jobs are created. And we will only move forward if we \ncan determine a pathway of a structure that actually addresses the \nquestion of documented jobs, nonlost jobs or substituting jobs for the \nAmerican people.\n  Trade, yes, it is business. But it is also the business of the \nAmerican people and the constituents of the 18th Congressional District \nin areas like Fifth Ward and southeast and South Park and Acres Home \nand Independence Heights. It is a question of whether or not jobs are \ncreated.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to that answer being answered as ``yes.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4336-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    NATIONAL GUARDSMAN FLORICH BURIAL AT ARLINGTON NATIONAL CEMETERY\n\n  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, every once in a while, this \nplace works. Recently, we had a National Guardsman, Sergeant Florich, \nwho perished along with a number of U.S. marines in the Gulf of Mexico \nas their Black Hawk went down.\n  The Secretary of the Army is granted the authority to grant \nexemptions to allow these heroes to be buried in Arlington National \nCemetery. Unfortunately, the initial decision by the Army was to reject \nSergeant Florich's burial request and that of his family. He was a \nfourth-generation Armed Forces military man serving our country.\n  Just today, Secretary McHugh reversed that decision. Along with the \nsupport of 120 Members of this body, on both the Republican and \nDemocrat side, they all came together and asked the Secretary to review \nthe decision.\n  I want to thank the Members of this House, Republican and Democrat, \nMembers that I want to ask that you all continue to keep the Florich \nfamily in your prayers as his wife is about to deliver their new child.\n  Thanks again to the Members, Mr. Speaker.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4336-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4336]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MARITIME NATIONAL HERITAGE ACT\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to mark the end of Capitol Hill \nOcean Week.\n  In my region, the Pacific Ocean was and is central to Native American \ncommunities. It also gave rise to a proud maritime tradition along our \ncoast. Entire industries sprang up and, for generations, folks have \nmade a good living as fishermen, boat builders, dock workers, and \nservicemembers.\n  The Pacific is a place teaming with a diverse life that we ought to \nprotect for future generations. If we want to protect our natural \nresources for our children, it is time to cherish our past and protect \nour future.\n  With that in mind, I will soon introduce the Maritime National \nHeritage Act. This legislation would designate the first and only \nheritage area in the country focused on maritime heritage. It would \ngive Washington State greater access to resources to protect \nlighthouses, vessels, and other landmarks that contribute to the \nhistory and who we are in Washington State.\n  This bill is a good way to remind folks what our oceans mean to us \nand why they are so vital.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4336-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4336-H4337]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    TO EXTEND THE AUTHORIZATION TO CARRY OUT THE REPLACEMENT OF THE \n   EXISTING MEDICAL CENTER OF THE DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS IN \n                            DENVER, COLORADO\n\n  Mr. COFFMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I reserve the right to object, although \nI don't object.\n  I just want to thank my friend from Colorado, the authorizing \ncommittee, and the appropriators for providing some time through the \nend of the fiscal year. It gives the Army Corps of Engineers, the VA, \nand the contractor an opportunity to continue construction of our big \nVA Medical Center in Colorado.

Mr. Speaker, trade promotion authority has passed the \nHouse on a pretty good bipartisan basis here. This will give the United \nStates the tools it needs to send a message around the world that we \nare going to be competitive and we are going to be serious about trade.\n  It also gives the Congress very important tools to adhere to the \nprinciples that we in this House believe are important to hold the USTR \nand the White House accountable with all of our principles together for \nwhat is good for the country.\n  When we have huge tariffs on some of the products we try and export \naround the world, it makes it noncompetitive. This will send, again, a \nvery strong signal the U.S. is ready to compete; it is not going to be \npushed around on trade, and TPA will be a good tool to do that.\n  However, it is not TPP, which we haven't had much input on lately, \nand is very difficult to get at. People need to understand, there is a \nstrong difference between TPA, that authorization, and TPP, which is \nstill not finished, still not negotiated, and is something that is a \ncomplete separate question from TPA, which I think was a responsible \nmeasure we got done here today.\n  We need to clear up the misconceptions on what is happening and the \ngood measures we in this House did today in order to have America and \nmore jobs be able to come home and stay in the U.S. because of better \ntrade policy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4337-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4337-H4338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    800TH ANNIVERSARY OF MAGNA CARTA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Foxx) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, June 15, we will celebrate the \n800th anniversary of Magna Carta, a document that revolutionized the \nworld and is the foundation for the freedoms that so many take for \ngranted today.\n  It is impossible to overstate the significance of that day at \nRunnymede in 1215 when King John of England declared that everyone, \nincluding the King, was subject to the rule of law; and as a result, \nconstitutional government was born.\n  Magna Carta is Latin for ``great charter,'' and it was so named \nbecause of the document's protracted length. Only later, did the world \nrealize how visionary the name truly is.\n  Most of the 63 clauses granted by King John dealt with specific \ngrievances of a group of barons relating to his rule, but that \nframework for the relationship between the King and his subjects \ninitiated the concept of freedom under law.\n  Clause 1 states:\n\n       First, that we have granted to God, and by his present \n     charter have confirmed for us and our heirs in perpetuity, \n     that the English Church shall be free, and shall have its \n     rights undiminished, and its liberties unimpaired. That we \n     wish this so to be observed, appears from the fact that of \n     our own free will, before the outbreak of the present dispute \n     between us and our barons, we granted and confirmed by \n     charter the freedom of the Church's elections--a right \n     reckoned to be of the greatest necessity and importance to \n     it--and caused this to be confirmed by Pope Innocent III. \n     This freedom we shall observe ourselves, and desire to be \n     observed in good faith by our heirs in perpetuity.\n       To all free men of our kingdom we have also granted, for us \n     and our heirs forever, all the liberties written out below, \n     to have and to keep for them and their heirs, of us and our \n     heirs.\n\n  Clause 12 reads:\n\n       No scutage or aid will be levied in our kingdom without its \n     general consent.\n\n  Clause 13 says:\n\n       The city of London shall enjoy all its ancient liberties \n     and free customs, both by land and by water. We also will and \n     grant that all other cities, boroughs, towns, and ports shall \n     enjoy all their liberties and free customs.\n\n  Clause 38 reads:\n\n       In future no official shall place a man on trial upon his \n     own unsupported statement, without producing credible \n     witnesses to the truth of it.\n\n  Finally, clause 39 states:\n\n       No free man shall be seized or imprisoned, or stripped of \n     his rights or possessions, or\n\n[[Page H4338]]\n\n     outlawed or exiled, or deprived of his standing in any way, \n     nor will we proceed with force against him, or send others to \n     do so, except by the lawful judgment of his equals or by the \n     law of the land.\n\n  Let me repeat those last few words, Mr. Speaker, ``the law of the \nland.'' In those words, we see the idea that the law does not come from \nany individual person or government. To quote Daniel Hannan, who wrote \na wonderful essay on the 800th anniversary of Magna Carta for The Wall \nStreet Journal last month: ``It is immanent in the land itself, the \ncommon inheritance of the people living there.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the language may sound a little stilted, and folks may \nthink, goodness, that doesn't sound like something we would say today, \nbut it is so important for us to understand the direct link between \nMagna Carta and the Revolution that occurred in this country in 1776.\n\n  Although Magna Carta failed to resolve the conflict between King John \nand his barons, it was reissued several times after his death. Again, \nMagna Carta's legacy is particularly evident in the documents that form \nthe basis of our government, the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of \nRights.\n  At the National Archives, visitors to Washington have the opportunity \nto view one of four surviving originals of the 1297 Magna Carta \nalongside the remarkable documents it inspired. When visitors come here \nto the House, I often point out to them on the walls the profiles of \nthe ancient lawgivers. Pope Innocent III is one of those ancient \nlawgivers shown here in the House.\n  Again, we can see directly, in many cases, how our Constitution and \nour Bill of Rights are derived from Magna Carta and also from the \nBible, that we can see those direct connections.\n  Today, I would like to acknowledge the debt of gratitude we owe to \nthose rebel barons with grievances against their King, and I am \nreminded that we must always be attentive to the freedom we have \ninherited.\n  Ronald Reagan said famously:\n\n       Freedom is not in our genes. It is only a generation away \n     from being lost. It is something we have to cherish.\n\n  Also, Mr. Speaker, with freedom comes opportunity and responsibility, \nand I want to say how grateful I am for the opportunity I have had to \nserve in the House of Representatives along with my colleagues.\n  I often tell, particularly schoolchildren, when I talk to them about \nthis country and the radical idea that it represents, that I am a \nperson who grew up in a house with no electricity and no running water, \nextraordinarily poor, and with parents with no privilege, no exalted \nstatus in our country.\n  As I said, with the freedom that we have comes opportunity. We on our \nside of the aisle--and I know many of my colleagues, or most of my \ncolleagues, on the other side of the aisle--want to see that \nopportunity that has been made available to those of us who currently \nserve, many of whom come from no privilege, to be able to hold onto \nthat opportunity.\n  To do that, Mr. Speaker, we have to hold on to freedom. We are the \nfreest country in the world, and that, the rule of law, and our \ncapitalistic system are those things that make us such a great country.\n  I want to express again my appreciation to those rebel barons and to \nall the people who came after them who kept the idea of Magna Carta \nalive to the time when we could develop our Constitution and Bill of \nRights and to the present time when we fight so hard to maintain those \nprinciples.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4338-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4338]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRATULATING ROBERTA GIANFORTONI\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it seems so often in this body we tend not \nto learn from mistakes. We passed a bill--I guess part of a bill--that \nthe Senate sent, referred to as the TPA, but it is all about a trade \nagreement that will provide a structure in which the President can \nnegotiate and dock other agreements into it. Since the TAA did not \npass, then it can't, apparently, go directly to conference unless we \npass an amendment to allow it to go to conference or find some other \nway to effectuate a conference on agreement. Mr. Speaker, I can only \nsurmise that, since the Speaker, himself, moved to reconsider, then \nthere is something afoot in order to keep it from dying, as it should \nhave, since both the TPA and the TAA did not pass.\n  The TPA, I read it. It has got some good aspects to it, but it is \nnot, in and of itself, free trade. As a judge in a district court--our \nhighest level trial court in Texas--so many times, I would be the fact \nfinder without a jury. So often, you would sit and listen to the \nevidence, and you would wonder why someone would take the action he \ndid. There has got to be some motivating factor. You consider all of \nthe possibilities.\n  We had a very rare visit from President Obama to the Capitol, trying \nto push people to vote for the TPA--this trade agreement--and the TAA. \nIt was great to see him come out to the Congressional Baseball Game \nlast night. It is not something he does regularly. So, Mr. Speaker, I \nam left to wonder. I mean, we have not seen this President push this \nhard on very many bills over the last 6\\1/2\\ years, and I am left \nwondering: Why would President Obama push so hard to pass this trade \nagreement structure that allows him to negotiate so many deals with so \nmany different countries?\n  One possibility is he did it because he knew that Speaker Boehner was \npushing to pass it, and it is possible that he really wanted to make \nSpeaker Boehner and Mitch McConnell, the leader down in the Senate, \nlook good. That is a possibility. I don't think it is terribly \nprobable. In weighing all of the evidence, it would seem to me that it \nis far more probable that the TPA will give this President far more \npower to fundamentally transform America in his remaining year and a \nhalf or so as President. That is what it appears to be to me.\n  Now, one of our Republicans speaking, whom I have tremendous respect \nand admiration for, commented that we are not a nation that sits on the \nsidelines. I agree that that used to be true, but we have basically sat \non the sidelines as Christians and Jews are being persecuted and killed \naround the world in greater numbers than ever before. We have sat on \nthe sidelines in Nigeria as precious little African girls are kidnapped \nand brutally, sexually assaulted day after day, month after month.\n  Then we see an article. According to the article, actually, this \nadministration communicated to Nigeria that, if they will change their \nlaws to provide for same-sex marriage and possibly for abortions to be \npaid for, then the United States would not continue to sit on the \nsidelines, that we would actually help them stop radical Islamists.\n\n[[Page H4339]]\n\nOf course, they didn't use the term ``radical Islamists,'' but that is \nwhat they are. They would stop them, the radical Islamists, from \ncontinuing to kill and persecute Christians the way they are doing in \nNigeria.\n  I have talked to some folks who have been on a recent trip to eastern \nAfrica and who have met and even prayed with leaders in east Africa. I \nwas going to be on the trip, but, apparently, the Speaker feels, if you \noppose him, then you are not allowed to travel, that those rewards are \nsaved for people who vote as he tells them to. I will tell you what: if \nthat is the price of speaking truth to power, it is still a great \ncountry.\n  The people who went on that trip indicated that leaders in eastern \nAfrica had indicated that the United States administration, the Obama \nadministration, was telling them, in essence, what the article said \nhappened in Nigeria, which is that, if you will change your laws to \nallow for same-sex marriage, though it is totally against their \nspiritual beliefs as Christians or as Muslims, then we would help them \nwith things like radical Islam, but, otherwise, we are not going to \nhelp them.\n  So I appreciate hearing a Republican say the United States is not a \nnation that sits on the sidelines, but this administration does. It \nsits on the sidelines and uses power to fundamentally transform this \ncountry and other countries. We have seen that.\n  I see my very dear friend from Kentucky (Mr. Massie) here on the \nfloor, and I would like to yield to him for his comments and thoughts.\n  Mr. MASSIE. I appreciate the gentleman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we had a vote on the TPA here, and I just wanted to take \nsome time to explain, and I think my colleague from Texas probably \nfeels the same way. I am for trade. I think trade is good. I am not \nagainst trade, but, today, I voted against the trade promotion \nauthority, which would fast track the TPP. I just wanted to take a \nsecond to explain why I was compelled to vote against this legislation \ntoday.\n  First of all, like my colleague, I have read the TPP. I have been \ndown to the confidential room. It is a very thick document, and there \nare two bound volumes, and there is a binder that goes with it as sort \nof a guide. What struck me the most about this TPP document is the \nenormity of it. My staff isn't even allowed to read the document. We \nare not allowed to have access to the Internet while we are in there \nwhen we are looking at the document. We are not allowed to take notes \nfrom the room, and this document references other bound documents.\n  So how could I possibly--one person, by myself in a confidential \nroom--understand what some of the unintended consequences of this trade \nagreement would be if I can't understand the document and if I am not \nallowed the resources to fully analyze this document? I want there to \nbe more daylight on this document before we put it on a path to \napproval.\n\n  The other reason I voted ``no'' today was the implication of ceding \nour authority to the World Trade Organization, which struck me this \nweek when we voted to overturn our country of origin labeling on beef \nand pork. Now, whether you think we should require companies to label \nbeef and pork when they bring them into this country from another \ncountry--whether that is a good thing or whether that is a bad thing--\nthat doesn't matter. What disturbs me is that the reason for writing \nthis law this week was the World Trade Organization told us we had to. \nThey said we have got to do that. We swore an oath to the Constitution, \nnot to the World Trade Organization. My concern is that this trade \nagreement could bind us to things that we don't even understand yet \nbecause, surely, some trade agreement years ago has caused us this week \nto change our food labeling laws.\n  The third and final reason I voted against the TPA today--and this \nmay be the best reason, in fact--is that my constituents don't like it. \nI have received 30 phone calls a day for the past week against this. I \nmight have received 1 or 2 all week saying to vote for it. We didn't \nget a chip implanted in our brains when we came to Congress that makes \nus smarter than all of our constituents. I think it is important to be \nhumble, to know that we don't always have the right answer. We don't \nreally have a whole lot more information than our constituents have in \nthis case. I think that their concern that they expressed to me, like \nof the President getting too much authority and that this President \ndoes not need more authority, is a valid concern; that there is not \nenough transparency is another valid concern.\n  I know my friend from Texas has expressed both of those concerns \nhimself, and I am sure he is hearing those from his constituents as \nwell.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I would like to follow up with the observation there \nabout our constituents because--I wish I didn't--I remember all too \nwell how things went in this room on TARP, the Wall Street bailout. The \nvast number of Americans--a huge percentage of Americans--did not want \nus to pass the Wall Street bailout. There was an FDIC former Director, \nnamed Isaac, who came. He had a lot of economists' support, and he had \na great free market solution. People were excited when that passed. I \nknow we had people clapping today just like they did when ObamaCare \npassed. A lot of people clapped when ObamaCare passed. Then they got \ndefeated in the next election, so they were not here to clap for this \none. There were people who clapped for the Wall Street bailout's \npassing. Some of them didn't come back because the people could see \nthis was not a good way to go.\n  Now, one of the things I love about being a Republican is that, \nbasically, as conservatives, we are optimists. We think things can get \nbetter, and that is why we are here. I know you and I have worked so \nmany times together, and that is why we are here. We want to make \nthings better, and we think we can--that we have got a shot at making \nthings better. But at some point, you at least have to take notice of \nthe old Washington saying that, no matter how cynical you get here in \nWashington, it is never enough to catch up.\n  I love that people are aware that the President promised in ObamaCare \nthat, if you liked your insurance, you could keep it and that, if you \nliked your doctor, you could keep him. He promised that nobody on \nMedicare would be affected, that it would only affect the \nreimbursements. Well, people have found out that those things were not \ntrue. They did lose the insurance they liked, and they lost the doctors \nthey liked. Medicare recipients had found out: Wait a minute. You said \nit wouldn't affect me, but what I found out is, when you cut $700 \nbillion from how much you reimburse the health care providers, my \ndoctors are not able to see me. It does affect me.\n  Then, of course, I remember--and I did consider Bart Stupak a friend. \nI saw him not long ago, and I still think of him as a friend. I know he \nwas pro-life and wanted to do what was right. He was promised by the \nPresident that nothing in or about ObamaCare would cause anybody who \ndisagreed with abortion or who had spiritual beliefs against abortion--\nthat nothing that they would ever have to buy would pay for abortion, \nthat no Federal money would go for abortion. As I understood it, he was \neven getting the President to put that in writing for him.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Well, as Joe Wilson observed during a speech being given in here, I \nthink he said it differently, but it turned out those things weren't \ntrue. Abortion is paid for with Federal dollars. The Federal Government \neven has fought people in court, like these precious Catholic nuns, the \nLittle Sisters of the Poor. They have dedicated their lives to helping \nour Nation's poor and people that are downtrodden. Those are the kind \nof people that government officials used to revere, admire, respect. \nNot now. Because those broken promises even resulted in this \nadministration fighting them in court to try to force them to have \ninsurance that paid for abortion that these precious nuns believed was \nmurdering a child in the womb.\n  Constituents were against TARP. There were people here that supported \nthis free trade agreement, just as you and I support free trade, but \nthey supported this TPA that truly will give the President more \nauthority.\n  I remember some of these same people saying: Look, we don't have to \nworry because by passing the bill we are about to pass, the President \ncan't remove anybody from Guantanamo without giving us notice, and when \nhe\n\n[[Page H4340]]\n\ngives us notice, we can stop him. I mean, I have been told that. And, \nin fact, the law is, he can't remove anybody from Guantanamo without \nfirst giving us notice. The American people remember that.\n  They also happen to have noticed that the President cut a deal for a \nguy that looks like he is going to be charged with desertion, and \nreleased five terrorists from Guantanamo and didn't give us notice \nuntil after he had released them. So I love the optimism that says, \nyes, there have been misrepresentations from this administration over \nand over and over and over, and now we have had 6\\1/2\\ years of \ncontinued misrepresentations from the administration, and the good news \nis this time we really think he means it. Now, I love that kind of \noptimism; I really do.\n  I want to yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Massie), my \nfriend, for his thoughts.\n  Mr. MASSIE. Well, you are an optimist, Mr. Gohmert, and I would \nwholeheartedly second that, but, look, you are also a realist, and I \nthink we all need to be realists. The best way to keep those promises \nis not to make a promise you can't keep or not to make a promise that \nyou can't make somebody else keep. So far, we have shown that we are \npretty ineffectual here in Congress at keeping the President \nmaintaining those promises. If you like the plan you have, you can keep \nit was one of those promises I remember.\n  While we are talking about the Affordable Care Act, I remember \nCongress was told to pass it so you can see what is in it. And we are \nbeing told: Pass the TPA so you can see what is in the TPP, at least so \nour constituents can see it.\n  I just want to close with this and not consume any more of the \ngentleman's time.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Before the gentleman gets too far, reclaiming my time, I \nwant to point out, he and I have been down to the classified area and \nviewed the TPP, but as I understand it, the President is going to be \nallowed to add like 20 percent to that that we have not even had an \nopportunity to see. So even when we say we have been down to the \nclassified area, they made it available, we have been through it, we \ncan't say that all of it was provided.\n  Is that your understanding?\n  Mr. MASSIE. That is absolutely correct. Furthermore, the document \nthat we viewed was a draft. It is not complete. If you read it, \nvirtually every page of it has a little footnote that says, oh, we are \nstill working on this page here. So, yeah, we are fast-tracking \nsomething that we can't see, we are not really going to be a party to \nthe negotiations, and we can't control the outcome of it. So I think we \nshould do that with great caution.\n  I just want to close with this. I want to say that the vote today was \nnot a referendum on free trade. It was not a referendum on whether it \nbenefits our country to trade with other countries. We know that. We \nbelieve it. We have seen it. Trade is good. But this was a referendum \non giving the President more authority; this was a referendum on voting \nfor something we can't see, we can't verify; and this was a referendum \non a huge, giant document. It reminds me of some of the omnibus bills \nwe are given 2 days to read that come to this body, 1600 pages.\n  But this was a referendum on the process. That is why they couldn't \nget the bill passed today. TPA is not a law yet. It didn't pass today, \nbut we support free trade. I know my colleague does. We just don't \nsupport the TPA.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. My friend has observed all the goings-on very closely. \nThe President has acted extraordinarily in reaching out to Congress, \ntrying to push through this trade bill.\n  I am curious whether the gentleman from Kentucky, my friend, thinks \nmaybe this, for the first time, is an effort by the President reaching \nout to make the Republican Party, Republican leadership look good. Or \nwhat kind of motivation do you think most likely caused him to reach \nout more than he has, as I recall, on a bill?\n  Mr. MASSIE. Well, I don't want to question anybody's motivations here \nin this body or in the other branch of the government, but I will say I \nhave seen a zeal for the deal, a zeal for the trade deal, a zeal for a \ndeal that people don't fully even understand but they want to get the \ndeal done.\n  So I think they just need to slow down, look at the terms of the \ndeal, get some experts in that room with you when you are looking at \nthat secret document, have them tell you what all those things mean in \nthere and just kind of calm down the zeal for the deal. We can do \ntrade, we can do free trade, we can do trade agreements, but not this \ngiant omnibus-like trade agreement.\n  Thank you.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I appreciate my friend, but my problem is, having had so \nmany provisions explained, for example, oh, this won't affect seniors \nby cutting $700 billion out of Medicare, and, gee, if you will just \nrenew the PATRIOT Act, section 215, gosh, you have got to be a \nterrorist before we get any of your personal information, your data--\nthere have just been so many explanations and promises that have been \nmade. With regard to section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, that was over two \nadministrations. But there have been so many representations on what an \nadministration--particularly this administration--believes something \nmeans that allowed activity far beyond that, that even if this \nadministration or the prior administration says this is what something \nmeans, I am sorry, the judge completely hasn't left me, the chief \njustice completely hasn't left me, and so I care more about what the \nlanguage says on its face than what somebody tells me they think it \nwill mean or how they will apply it. Again, you know, we were told \nthings about ObamaCare and the way it would be interpreted and carried \nout, the PATRIOT Act, the way it would be interpreted and carried out. \nIt turns out it simply was not the case.\n\n  It is still why I am concerned over the part of section 215, even \nthough I have been assured, oh, no, it really doesn't mean anything. \nBut it says not only can they gather the data of people associated with \nterrorists or involved in international terrorism, but it has this \nlittle two-letter disjunctive, the ``or,'' clandestine intelligence \nactivities. Nobody will explain where that is defined in writing \nbecause until it is defined adequately in writing, that can mean \nanything anybody wants it to mean. It is just too vague, allows too \nmuch arbitrariness and capriciousness. So I am not as concerned about \nwhat people tell me something says or means because I know when you put \nwords in a bill, at some point some judge somewhere is going to say, \nyou know what those words actually say; they mean exactly what they \nsay.\n  So I am concerned about the power that is given to the President. I \nam concerned about the ability of the President to cut deals, and if he \nhappens to forget to give us notice, as he happened to do with regard \nto the five terrorists that were released from Guantanamo, then I don't \nsee this body stepping up and stopping him. I know we absolutely \npledged we were going to on the illegal, unconstitutional amnesty he \ndid, but then we decided, well, we will just trust the judge in Texas \nthat his ruling will be upheld all the way to the Supreme Court. So we \ngave up on that fight as a body.\n  But I just have not seen anything from the House and Senate, either \nwhen it was under total Democratic control or now, that indicates we \nare going to be able to step up and stop the President if there is a \nviolation of the law or a violation of personal commitments that were \nmade. Because of that, I was not comfortable voting for TPA. I could \nnot vote for it. I voted against TAA because it would facilitate TPA.\n  I do have to make a parenthetical note here. It is interesting, we \nare assured that TPA is going to create this massive number of jobs, \nbut we have to--absolutely have to--pass TAA, which creates additional \nwelfare because there are going to be so many Americans that lose their \njobs as a result of TPA. So it is going to create all these American \njobs, but we have got to have TAA so we can cover all the American jobs \nthat are lost that go overseas, when the fact is: You want a free trade \nagreement, you want to blow the doors off the barriers in the world to \nAmerican goods and services? Let's cut the biggest tariff that any \nnation in the world puts on its own goods and services called a \ncorporate tax. Let's cut it, if not eliminate it, at least get it below \nthat of China. And the cuts to the prices will be so astounding that \nthe doors will come down. They will have to come down, because our \ngoods\n\n[[Page H4341]]\n\nwill not only be the best in the world, but they will be the best \nprices in the world.\n  So we want real free trade. You are not going to get it by cutting a \ndeal with countries that manipulate their currencies. Those were \nexcellent points that some across the aisle made. If you are talking \nabout free trade with countries that manipulate their own currencies, \nyou are not going to get free trade with countries that manipulate \ntheir own currency because they can always maneuver around you and make \ntheir product better. So this didn't address the manipulative nature of \nsome nations' currencies. Without that, you are not going to have a \nfree trade deal.\n  I would like to be an optimist and say that this bill that President \nObama pushed so hard--historically hard for his administration--to get \npassed, I would like to be the optimist, as so many of my colleagues \nare, and say, but the reason President Obama was pushing for this so \nhard is this will really curtail his ability to make agreements without \nour agreement. I would like to think that he worked that hard to \ncurtail his own power, but the realist, the old judge in me comes back \nand has to say, the verdict is he pushed for this TPA because it was \ngoing to give him a lot more power than he has now.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. I thank my colleague from Texas. I appreciate his loyalty \nand his patriotism to our country. I look forward to working with him \nin the future to talk about future negotiations to make sure that the \nFederal Government, every time we act, every time we move, every time \nwe vote is to do what is best for America, to make America stronger, \nmore competitive, and a better nation to pass on to our next \ngeneration.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. I thank my friend and yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/12/house-section/article/H4341-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4341]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
