Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Donald ``Buddy'' Wray, \na great Arkansan and American, a dear friend who passed away in \nJanuary.\n  A native of Des Arc, Buddy earned a bachelor's degree in animal \nhusbandry from the University of Arkansas. He spent time in the Army \nand later the Army Guard before joining a small poultry company in 1961 \ncalled Tyson Feed and Hatchery, today known as Tyson Foods.\n  For over 50 years, Buddy was instrumental in everything the company \ndid. As president and COO, he helped build Tyson Foods into one of the \nworld's leading food companies and a major contributor to our State's \neconomy.\n  In addition to his career, Buddy was also dedicated to the northwest \nArkansas community, especially Springdale. He was a member of the \nKiwanis Club and served on countless boards--Harding University, the \nUniversity of Arkansas, and the College of the Ozarks, to name a few. \nHe was also a man of faith, dedicated to the Robinson Avenue Church of \nChrist in Springdale.\n  Buddy will be missed by his many family members, countless friends, \nthe community, and the Tyson Foods family, but we find comfort in \nremembering Buddy's famous words: ``Look behind with no regrets . . . \nlook forward with no fear.'' Knowing his determination to live that \nmessage resulted in a life that made a difference.\n  Rest in peace, Buddy Wray.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H777-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H777]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         EULICE BRANDON GARRETT\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois.

Later he served as legislative director to \nCongresswoman Marcia Fudge of Ohio and policy director of the \nCongressional Black Caucus.\n  After a brief stint as policy director to Vice President Joe Biden's \n2012 reelection campaign, I was lucky to have Brandon take a gamble on \nme and agree to serve as my chief of staff. For nearly 3 years, he has \nworked tirelessly for the residents of the Second Congressional \nDistrict.\n  BG, you are truly one of a kind, from your very unique fashion to \nyour quick smile and your cool demeanor and ability to make everyone \nyou meet feel like they are your best friend.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize \nretired United States Air Force Colonel Carlyle ``Smitty'' Harris of \nTupelo, Mississippi.\n  On this day in 1973, after nearly 8 years of being held as a prisoner \nof war in Vietnam, he was released to be reunited with his wife, \nLouise; his daughters, Robin and Carolyn; and his son, Lyle, who was \nborn 1 month after he was captured.\n  Colonel Harris became a POW on April 4, 1965, when his F-105 \nThunderchief was shot down by enemy fire while he was on a mission to \nattack a bridge known as the Dragon's Jaw, an important target in \nnorthern Vietnam. After he was captured, he was then transported to the \nwell-known Hanoi Hilton.\n  Colonel Harris taught his fellow prisoners a vital way of \ncommunicating with each other through a method called the tap code. \nThis gave the men the ability to communicate without speaking, \nestablishing a chain of command and boosting morale. While he \nexperienced cruelty, torture, and isolation, he was able to find solace \nin his faith in God, love for his country, and hope of seeing his \nfamily again.\n  Colonel Harris embodies the characteristics that make you proud to be \nan American.\n  Thank you, Colonel Harris, for your service. I join you in \ncelebrating this happy anniversary of your homecoming.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H778-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PORTER RANCH\n\n  (Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SCHIFF.

This leak began last October. The full \nhealth and environmental impacts of this unmitigated disaster may not \nbe known for many years, and already it has displaced thousands of \nfamilies and caused innumerable illnesses and property losses.\n  Today I am calling on the U.S. Department of Energy to lead a \ncomprehensive investigation into what caused this leak, its inadequate \nresponse, and to provide recommendations for mitigating the damage and \npreventing future incidents. This tragedy must never be repeated.\n  Between Porter Ranch and Flint, Michigan, it is clear that both the \ngovernment and the private sector are far from placing the priority we \nneed on our families' health and their safety.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H778-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SPECIAL OLYMPICS IN PENNSYLVANIA\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, I was \nhonored to host Christa Mereen in Washington. Christa has competed in \nthe Special Olympics as an athlete for 15 years. Recently, more than \n300 athletes participated in the winter games in Pennsylvania, with 135 \ncoaches and more than 1,000 volunteers.\n  Pennsylvania's Special Olympics includes many athletes from \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, including Potter County \nathlete Denise Menderler. Denise is highly accomplished, having earned \n110 medals, including many gold honors. Denise gives back to her \ncommunity as a peer advocate and a Potter County Human Services \nAdvisory Board member. Denise's story is just like so many who \nparticipate in the Special Olympics who rise above challenges and excel \nin sports, from skiing to figure skating, speed skating, and snow \nshoeing.\n  Mr. Speaker, on March 5 and 6, the skills of our Special Olympians \nwill again be on display at the State Floor Hockey Tournament at Bald \nEagle Area High School in my home district.

With each game came new rounds of \nsupport as the Carolina fan base swarmed to uncharted numbers. I am \ncertain the Carolina Panthers put in long and hard hours of practice \nwhich led them to Super Bowl 50. The Panthers have had an amazing \nseason.\n  I know I speak for all North Carolina fans when I say the Panthers \ndid an amazing job making North Carolina proud to call them their home \nteam. What a phenomenal trek to the Super Bowl.\n  To Carolina's own NFL MVP, Cam Newton, thanks for leading the charge \nand inspiring so many fans, young and old.\n  Based off this season's performance, I know that next year the \nPanthers will keep pounding all the way to Super Bowl LI and bring home \nthe Lombardi Trophy.\n  Keep pounding.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H778-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H778]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             UNITED SERVICE ORGANIZATIONS' 75TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN.

When families are finally feeling the benefit of lower cost \nfuel, this President proposes a\n\n[[Page H779]]\n\nplan to take those savings away from families.\n  Worse, this new tax on driving will actually go to fund pie-in-the-\nsky government boondoggles like California's high-speed rail projects \nand many other pet projects of the President. That pet project in \nCalifornia has tripled in price since its first inception.\n  The American people paid a record amount of taxes last year to the \nTreasury, over $3.2 trillion, or nearly $22,000 per working American; \nyet there are those in government who still want to take more and spend \nmore.\n  I say ``no''--no more taxes on the American family; no more wasted \nbillions of dollars on the President's and California Governor Brown's \npet projects.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and put this country, instead, on a \nbalanced budget track.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H779-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H779]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING MARTIN GROSS\n\n  (Ms. KUSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. KUSTER.

and\n       (ii) the Department of the Treasury would soon introduce \n     new currency with improved security features to protect \n     against counterfeiting by the Government of North Korea.\n       (2) The Financial Action Task Force, an intergovernmental \n     body whose purpose is to develop and promote national and \n     international policies to combat money laundering and \n     terrorist financing, has repeatedly--\n       (A) expressed concern at deficiencies in North Korea's \n     regimes to combat money laundering and terrorist financing;\n       (B) urged North Korea to adopt a plan of action to address \n     significant deficiencies in those regimes and the serious \n     threat those deficiencies pose to the integrity of the \n     international financial system;\n       (C) urged all jurisdictions to apply countermeasures to \n     protect the international financial system from ongoing and \n     substantial money laundering and terrorist financing risks \n     emanating from North Korea;\n       (D) urged all jurisdictions to advise their financial \n     institutions to give special attention to business \n     relationships and transactions with North Korea, including \n     North Korean companies and financial institutions; and\n       (E) called on all jurisdictions--\n       (i) to protect against correspondent relationships being \n     used to bypass or evade countermeasures and risk mitigation \n     practices; and\n       (ii) to take into account money laundering and terrorist \n     financing risks when considering requests by North Korean \n     financial institutions to open branches and subsidiaries in \n     their respective jurisdictions.\n       (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council \n     unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--\n       (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's--\n       (i) recommendation on financial sanctions related to \n     proliferation; and\n       (ii) guidance on the implementation of such sanctions;\n       (B) decided that United Nations member states should apply \n     enhanced monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the \n     provision of financial services or the transfer of property \n     that could contribute to activities prohibited by applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions; and\n       (C) called upon United Nations member states to prohibit \n     North Korean financial institutions from establishing or \n     maintaining correspondent relationships with financial \n     institutions in their respective jurisdictions to prevent the \n     provision of financial services if such member states have \n     information that provides reasonable grounds to believe that \n     such activities could contribute to--\n       (i) activities prohibited by an applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolution; or\n       (ii) the evasion of such prohibitions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North \n     Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering \n     Concern.--Congress--\n\n[[Page H782]]\n\n       (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security \n     Council to impose limitations on, and to require the enhanced \n     monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial \n     institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;\n       (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms--\n       (A) to immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction \n     of primary money laundering concern; and\n       (B) to adopt stringent special measures to safeguard the \n     financial system against the risks posed by North Korea's \n     willful evasion of sanctions and its illicit activities; and\n       (3) urges the President to seek the prompt implementation \n     by other countries of enhanced monitoring and due diligence \n     to prevent North Korea's misuse of the international \n     financial system, including by sharing information about \n     activities, transactions, and property that could contribute \n     to--\n       (A) activities sanctioned by applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions; or\n       (B) the evasion of such sanctions.\n       (c) Determinations Regarding North Korea.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of the Treasury, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of State and the Attorney \n     General, and in accordance with section 5318A of title 31, \n     United States Code, shall determine whether reasonable \n     grounds exist for concluding that North Korea is a \n     jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern.\n       (2) Enhanced due diligence and reporting requirements.--If \n     the Secretary of the Treasury determines under paragraph (1) \n     that reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North Korea \n     is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern, the \n     Secretary, in consultation with the Federal functional \n     regulators (as defined in section 509 of the Gramm-Leach-\n     Bliley Act (15 U.S.C. 6809)), shall impose 1 or more of the \n     special measures described in section 5318A(b) of title 31, \n     United States Code, with respect to the jurisdiction of North \n     Korea.\n       (3) Report required.--\n       (A) In general.--Not later than 90 days after the date on \n     which the Secretary of the Treasury makes a determination \n     under paragraph (1), the Secretary shall submit to the \n     appropriate congressional committees a report that contains \n     the reasons for such determination.\n       (B) Form.--The report submitted under subparagraph (A) \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n\n     SEC. 202. ENSURING THE CONSISTENT ENFORCEMENT OF UNITED \n                   NATIONS SECURITY COUNCIL RESOLUTIONS AND \n                   FINANCIAL RESTRICTIONS ON NORTH KOREA.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) All member states of the United Nations are obligated \n     to implement and enforce applicable United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions fully and promptly, including by blocking \n     the property of, and ensuring that any property is prevented \n     from being made available to, persons designated for the \n     blocking of property by the Security Council under applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions.\n       (2) As of May 2015, 158 of the 193 member states of the \n     United Nations had not submitted reports on measures taken to \n     implement North Korea-specific United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions 1718, 1874, and 2094.\n       (3) A recent report by the Government Accountability Office \n     (GAO-15-485)--\n       (A) finds that officials of the United States and \n     representatives of the United Nations Panel of Experts \n     established pursuant to United Nations Security Council \n     Resolution 1874 (2009), which monitors and facilitates \n     implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea, \n     ``agree that the lack of detailed reports from all member \n     states is an impediment to the UN's effective implementation \n     of its sanctions''; and\n       (B) notes that ``many member states lack the technical \n     capacity to enforce sanctions and prepare reports'' on the \n     implementation of United Nations sanctions on North Korea.\n       (4) All member states share a common interest in protecting \n     the international financial system from the risks of money \n     laundering and illicit transactions emanating from North \n     Korea.\n       (5) The United States dollar and the euro are the world's \n     principal reserve currencies, and the United States and the \n     European Union are primarily responsible for the protection \n     of the international financial system from the risks \n     described in paragraph (4).\n       (6) The cooperation of the People's Republic of China, as \n     North Korea's principal trading partner, is essential to--\n       (A) the enforcement of applicable United Nations Security \n     Council resolutions; and\n       (B) the protection of the international financial system.\n       (7) The report of the Panel of Experts expressed concern \n     about the ability of banks to detect and prevent illicit \n     transfers involving North Korea if such banks are located in \n     member states with less effective regulators or member states \n     that are unable to afford effective compliance.\n       (8) North Korea has historically exploited inconsistencies \n     between jurisdictions in the interpretation and enforcement \n     of financial regulations and applicable United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions to circumvent sanctions and \n     launder the proceeds of illicit activities.\n       (9) Amroggang Development Bank, Bank of East Land, and \n     Tanchon Commercial Bank have been designated by the Secretary \n     of the Treasury, the United Nations Security Council, and the \n     European Union as having materially contributed to the \n     proliferation of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (10) Korea Daesong Bank and Korea Kwangson Banking \n     Corporation have been designated by the Secretary of the \n     Treasury and the European Union as having materially \n     contributed to the proliferation of weapons of mass \n     destruction.\n       (11) The Foreign Trade Bank of North Korea has been \n     designated by the Secretary of the Treasury for facilitating \n     transactions on behalf of persons linked to its proliferation \n     network and for serving as ``a key financial node''.\n       (12) Daedong Credit Bank has been designated by the \n     Secretary of the Treasury for activities prohibited by \n     applicable United Nations Security Council resolutions, \n     including the use of deceptive financial practices to \n     facilitate transactions on behalf of persons linked to North \n     Korea's proliferation network.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the President should intensify diplomatic efforts in \n     appropriate international fora, such as the United Nations, \n     and bilaterally, to develop and implement a coordinated, \n     consistent, multilateral strategy for protecting the global \n     financial system against risks emanating from North Korea, \n     including--\n       (1) the cessation of any financial services the \n     continuation of which is inconsistent with applicable United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (2) the cessation of any financial services to persons, \n     including financial institutions, that present unacceptable \n     risks of facilitating money laundering and illicit activity \n     by the Government of North Korea;\n       (3) the blocking by all member states, in accordance with \n     the legal process of the state in which the property is held, \n     of any property required to be blocked under applicable \n     United Nations Security Council resolutions;\n       (4) the blocking of any property derived from illicit \n     activity, or from the misappropriation, theft, or \n     embezzlement of public funds by, or for the benefit of, \n     officials of the Government of North Korea;\n       (5) the blocking of any property involved in significant \n     activities undermining cybersecurity by the Government of \n     North Korea, directly or indirectly, against United States \n     persons, or the theft of intellectual property by the \n     Government of North Korea, directly or indirectly from United \n     States persons; and\n       (6) the blocking of any property of persons directly or \n     indirectly involved in censorship or human rights abuses by \n     the Government of North Korea.\n       (c) Strategy to Improve International Implementation and \n     Enforcement of United Nations North Korea-specific \n     Sanctions.--The President shall direct the Secretary of \n     State, in coordination with other Federal departments and \n     agencies, as appropriate, to develop a strategy to improve \n     international implementation and enforcement of United \n     Nations North Korea-specific sanctions. The strategy should \n     include elements--\n       (1) to increase the number of countries submitting reports \n     to the United Nations Panel of Experts established pursuant \n     to United Nations Security Council Resolution 1874 (2009), \n     including developing a list of targeted countries where \n     effective implementation and enforcement of United Nations \n     sanctions would reduce the threat from North Korea;\n       (2) to encourage member states of the United Nations to \n     cooperate and share information with the panel in order to \n     help facilitate investigations;\n       (3) to expand cooperation with the Panel of Experts;\n       (4) to provide technical assistance to member states to \n     implement United Nations sanctions, including developing the \n     capacity to enforce sanctions through improved export control \n     regulations, border security, and customs systems;\n       (5) to harness existing United States Government \n     initiatives and assistance programs, as appropriate, to \n     improve sanctions implementation and enforcement; and\n       (6) to increase outreach to the people of North Korea, and \n     to support the engagement of independent, non-governmental \n     journalistic, humanitarian, and other institutions in North \n     Korea.\n       (d) Report Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, and annually thereafter, the \n     Secretary of State shall submit to the appropriate \n     congressional committees a report that describes the actions \n     undertaken to implement the strategy required by subsection \n     (c).\n\n     SEC. 203.

I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, for 3 years the Committee on Foreign Affairs that I \nchair has worked with great determination to build support for this \nNorth Korea sanctions legislation.\n  I want to thank my Democratic colleagues, and I especially want to \nthank the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), our ranking member, for \nhis support in this legislation.\n  I also thank Senators Corker, Cardin, and Gardner, for their \nleadership in the Senate and for their strong additions, particularly \non human rights and on cyber attacks by the brutal and hostile North \nKorean regime.\n  Today Congress--Democrats and Republicans, House and Senate--unites \nto put this North Korean sanctions legislation on the President's desk. \nLast month this bill passed the House with 418 votes, and this week it \npassed the Senate 96-0.\n  Mr. Speaker, these overwhelming votes reflect bipartisan frustration \nwith our North Korea policy, a policy of strategic patience that isn't \nworking. Today Congress unites to say it is time for a new approach.\n  Mr. Speaker, last month North Korea conducted its fourth known \nnuclear test, and last weekend it concluded a long-range missile test. \nOn Tuesday, our Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper, \ntestified that North Korea has restarted a plutonium reactor and \nexpanded that production of weapons-grade nuclear fuel.\n  The threat to the United States and our allies is real. The \ntyrannical regime of Kim Jong-un has developed increasingly destructive \nweapons: its miniaturized nuclear warheads that fit onto its most \nreliable missiles. We cannot stand by any longer.\n  The legislation we consider today, H.R. 757, is the most \ncomprehensive North Korea sanctions legislation to come before this \nbody. My bill uses targeted financial and economic pressure to isolate \nKim Jong-un and his top officials from the assets they maintain in \nforeign banks and from the hard currency that sustains their rule.\n  These assets are gained, in part, from illicit activities on the part \nof North Korea, like counterfeiting U.S. currency and selling weapons \naround the world, and they are used to advance the North Korean nuclear \nprogram.\n  They also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites and \nthe continued repression of the North Korean people by their police \nstate.\n  In 2005, the Treasury Department blacklisted a small bank in Macao \ncalled Banco Delta Asia, which not only froze North Korea's money in \nthe bank, but also scared away other financial institutions from \ndealing with the Government of North Korea for fear that they, too, \nwould be blacklisted. Unfortunately, this effective policy was shelved \nfor ill-fated negotiations, but this bill can get us back to a winning \nstrategy.\n  Equally important to the strong sanctions in this bill are its \ncritical human rights provisions. North Korea operates a brutal system \nof gulags that hold as many as 120,000 men, women, and children.\n  If a North Korean is suspected of any kind of dissenting opinion, \neven telling a joke about the regime, his entire family for three \ngenerations is punished. North Korea is a human rights house of \nhorrors.\n  Two years ago the U.N. Commission of Inquiry released the most \ncomprehensive report on North Korea to date, and their finding was that \nthe Kim Jong-un regime and the whole family regime has, for decades, \npursued policies involving crimes--and this is the words of the United \nNations report--crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.\n\n[[Page H786]]\n\n  This amended version requires the administration to develop a \nstrategy to promote North Korean human rights, including a list of \ncountries that use North Korean slave labor.\n  The implementation of this bill will help sever a key subsidy for \nNorth Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when the \nNorth Korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are \nuntenable will the prospects for peace and security in northeast Asia \nimprove.\n  I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  First of all, let me thank Chairman Royce for authoring the bill. I \nam proud to be the lead Democratic cosponsor, and I am glad that we are \nalmost to the finish line.\n  Just over a month ago we passed this bill and sent it to the Senate. \nThe Senate acted quickly to make minor adjustments, and today we will \npass this bipartisan legislation and send it to the President's desk.\n  This process is a great example of what we can accomplish when we \nwork in a bipartisan way to advance American security. As I have said \nmany times before, I am proud of the members on both sides of the aisle \nof the Committee on Foreign Affairs because we have worked in a \nbipartisan manner.\n  I would caution all Members about leveling political charges when it \ncomes to North Korea. I am reminded of the old adage that people who \nlive in glass houses shouldn't throw stones.\n  We all know North Korea is a problem, but let's not kid ourselves. \nThis problem has grown under many administrations, in Congresses of \nboth parties. So when we talk about how we got here, we need to really \nfocus in a bipartisan manner. That is what we are trying to do.\n  The Kim regime is dangerous. North Korea's nuclear program threatens \nregional stability and global security. It worries me to think what \nNorth Korea's leaders plan to do with their nuclear arsenal or who they \nmight be willing to sell nuclear material to.\n  While it is bad enough on its own, North Korea's nuclear program is \njust the top item on a long list of dangerous and illegal activity by \nthat regime.\n  From cyber attacks to money laundering and counterfeiting, from human \nrights abuses, as Chairman Royce has pointed out, to the regular \nattacks on South Korea, the Kim regime runs roughshod over the rules \nand norms that guide the global order. Yet, they haven't been deterred \nby some of the toughest sanctions imaginable or the near-universal \ncondemnation of the global community or the deepening isolation of \nNorth Korea from the rest of the world. So we are left to tighten the \nscrews even further. That is what we are trying to do today.\n  We need to work with South Korea and Japan on a tough, coordinated \nresponse. We need to take every opportunity to collaborate on this \nissue with the Chinese, who wield considerable influence over North \nKorea, and we need to dial up our own sanctions and toughen sanctions \nenforcement. That is exactly what this bill does.\n\n  North Korea is always looking for ways to get around our sanctions. \nThe sanctions in this bill would focus especially on North Korean \nelites who conduct shady transactions with shell corporations, then \ncover up the money trail. In Pyongyang, the capital, these cronies of \nthe Kim regime pocket the cash while the rest of the North Korean \npeople suffer.\n  I have been to North Korea twice, and it is just sickening that the \nregime and its friends profit from these crimes while the rest of the \ncountry is literally starving.\n  On that point, this bill includes important exceptions for the \nhumanitarian aid that benefits the North Korean people. Our anger is \nnot with the people of North Korea. In fact, the United States does a \ngreat deal to provide aid to this oppressed population.\n  But they deserve better from their leaders. That is why we should \nsend this bill to the President. That is why we should continue to make \nNorth Korea a top foreign policy priority.\n  The Kim family has ruled North Korea for many, many, many years. Kim \nJong-un seems to be the worst of the lot, with the repressions, the \nassassinations, the political stranglehold that he keeps the whole \ncountry in, and the fact that many people get caught, as Chairman Royce \npointed out, in the gulag. Families are oppressed. It is just a \nnightmare of horrors.\n  The North Korean people deserve better from their leaders. That is \nwhy we should send this bill to the President and why we should \ncontinue to make North Korea a top foreign policy priority.\n  I am proud to support this bill. I am proud to be the lead Democrat \non the bill. I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, before yielding to our next speaker, I also \nwant to note that this bill effectively reauthorizes and extends the \nNorth Korean Human Rights Act of 2004, which I have worked to support \nfor more than a dozen years.\n  That groundbreaking law, which was reauthorized in 2008 and again in \n2012 by our chairman emeritus, Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, emphasized that \nhuman rights, the free flow of information, and the protection of those \nwho escaped are not only important to the people of North Korea, they \nare also critical to changing North Korea's strategic calculus and \ntrying to force that rogue regime to address the needs of its own \npeople instead of threatening its neighbors.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global \nHealth, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the North Korean dictatorship is an existential threat \nthat requires significantly enhanced vigilance and response.\n  The North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016, authored by \nChairman Ed Royce, will ensure that the Obama administration takes \nmeaningful action to mitigate North Korea's cruelty, human rights \nabuse, and military danger.\n  The U.S. can no longer sit on the sidelines while Kim Jong-un \nproliferates nuclear and missile technology and abuses and starves the \nNorth Korean people.\n  North Korea violates every single human right enshrined in the \nUniversal Declaration of Human Rights. North Korea is listed by the \nState Department as a tier 3 country with respect to human trafficking. \nIt is designated as one of eight Countries of Particular Concern for \nengaging in egregious violations of religious freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have chaired four hearings on human rights abuses in \nNorth Korea. It is, as Chairman Royce noted, a house of horrors.\n  The U.N. Commission of Inquiry on North Korea recommended that the \nU.N. impose targeted sanctions on North Korean leaders responsible for \nthese crimes against humanity. However, China blocks effective U.N. \nactions. This, in part, is why the Congress and the administration must \nact now. North Korean human rights abusers must be identified and \nlisted so that sanctions can be appropriately applied.\n  North Korea's launch of a long-range rocket last week reenergized \nconcern over that country's intercontinental ballistic missile program. \nThe launch was strongly condemned by the U.N. Security Council, which \nvowed to apply further sanctions. Hopefully, the Security Council's \ninvestigation now underway will also look at partner nations who \npurchase North Korean missile technology.\n  Iran, to whom the administration has just released billions of \ndollars, is one of North Korea's nuclear partners. We should be very \nconcerned about that. At some point, the Iranians will acquire fissile \nmaterial beyond what they are allowed to produce, they may \nclandestinely purchase actual warheads from North Korea, or, perhaps, \nIran will get enriched uranium--their stash--back from Russia.\n  At a Foreign Affairs Committee hearing yesterday, Mr. Speaker--and \nChairman Royce has had well over 35 oversight hearings on Iran--I asked \nPresident Obama's coordinator for implementation of the Iran nuclear \ndeal where Iran's stockpile of enriched uranium was sent. Where did it \ngo? Is it in\n\n[[Page H787]]\n\nRussia? What city? Do we--or the IAEA--have onsite access to where it \nis stored for verifications purposes? Remember President Reagan? He \nsaid: Trust and verify. Onsite verification.\n  Shockingly, Ambassador Mull said he didn't know where the enriched \nuranium is. He did say it was on a Russian ship somewhere heading to a \nport or to a final destination. But its specific location--we don't \nhave a clue.\n  Yesterday's revelation was yet another flaw in an egregiously flawed \nIran nuclear deal. We know that there is a connection between North \nKorea and Iran. So our vigilance must be stepped up significantly. This \nbill is a major step. It is in fact bipartisan: Eliot Engel, again, \nworking side-by-side with the chairman to make sure a good bill is \nproduced.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Wilson), a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and \nchairman of the Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank Chairman Ed Royce for his \nleadership on freedom and liberty.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly support the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement \nAct of 2016.\n  Recently, we have seen overwhelming evidence that the monarchy in \nNorth Korea, led by an unstable dictator, has become increasingly \nhostile, threatening its neighbors, which are American allies.\n  Sadly, just last week, it successfully tested a long-range rocket \nwhich is capable of reaching California. This recent missile test comes \nafter years of ignoring nonproliferation agreements and conducting \nnuclear tests without facing any meaningful consequences.\n  As America continues to fight the global war on terrorism, we should \nnot allow an unpredictable rogue leader to continue unchecked. We must \nchange course to a strategy of peace through strength to protect \nAmerican families.\n  In 2003, I was one of the few Members of Congress to visit Pyongyang, \nNorth Korea, along with Ranking Member Eliot Engel and Chairman Jeff \nMiller. I saw firsthand the struggle and oppression its citizens have \nendured under Communist totalitarian rule. Compared to the dynamic \ncapital of South Korea, North Korea is the ultimate example of another \nsocialist failure.\n  The North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act strengthens our Nation's \nability to sanction the agents, government, and financial institutions \nthat enable North Korea's dangerous activities.\n  I am grateful to Chairman Ed Royce for introducing the North Korea \nSanctions Enforcement Act, unanimously supported in the U.S. Senate \nwith bipartisan support, which puts pressure on the regime by \nrestricting them from selling weapons of mass destruction, importing \nand exporting conventional weapons, and engaging in further \ncyberattacks. It also directs the State Department to hold the \nadministration accountable by creating a strategy to improve \nenforcement of existing sanctions.\n  This legislation is an important first step to achieving peace \nthrough strength in the region. I look forward to working with my \ncolleagues on the Foreign Affairs Committee and the Armed Services \nCommittee to promote positive change and stability in Northeast Asia so \nthat all Koreans can have a bright future.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to also reiterate the \nbipartisanship in which this legislation has been brought to the floor \nthrough the work of the chairman and the ranking member, who are \nexperts in foreign affairs and especially countries like North Korea.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I had a chance last year to visit with the Pacific \nCommand, I talked to the four-star Admiral in Pacific Command and asked \nhim this question: Of the five entities that are threats to the United \nStates--Russia, China, Iran, ISIS, and North Korea--which of those \nconcerns you the most? He quickly said: North Korea. Because they are \nan unstable regime.\n  This legislation will help, hopefully, have that unstable dictator, \nwho murders his own people, is trigger happy, and is developing all \ntypes of weapons and puts them on the open market to sell them to other \nnations that want to cause mischief in the world, stop this conduct in \nNorth Korea.\n  Yes, North Korea has nuclear weapons. They are developing missiles to \ndeliver those nuclear weapons. About a year or a year and a half ago, \nthe dictator of North Korea said he wanted that first intercontinental \nballistic missile to go to Austin, Texas. I take that a little \npersonal, Mr. Speaker. I don't know why he picked Austin. Anyway, they \nare working on their delivery capability. They have no intention of \nstopping.\n  So, the international community must tell the dictator of North \nKorea: You can't do this. You can't be a menace to not only your own \npeople, or the people in South Korea and the entire region, but the \nworld.\n  This legislation is an important step in stopping the mischief-making \nand trigger-happy dictator of North Korea.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Let me first start with Mr. Joe Wilson of South Carolina, who was on \nthe trip with me, as he mentioned, to North Korea.\n  We drove in from the airport on a bus. Joe was sitting at the front \nof it. We saw all these hostile billboards. We couldn't, of course, \nread it--it was in Korean--but we could look at the pictures.\n  One of the pictures had an American soldier on the ground and a North \nKorean soldier with a bayonet right through the American soldier's \nhead. The reason why we knew it was an American soldier is because it \nsaid USA on the soldier's uniform.\n  Mr. Wilson sat in the front and very carefully maneuvered his camera \nand snapped a picture. We have that picture. If the North Koreans had \nknown what we were doing, they probably would have confiscated the \ncamera, but they didn't. I just wanted to mention that.\n  There were, I believe, six of us on that trip. It was a bipartisan \ntrip. It was an eye-opener. I went back a few years later, but I \nremember the gentleman from South Carolina sitting there and very \nskillfully maneuvering that camera. That is a good picture that we \nshould probably blow up and let our colleagues see so that they \nunderstand the regime they are dealing with. This was not Kim Jung-un. \nHis father was in power at the time.\n  So, it seems to be getting progressively worse. The father was known \nas the ``Dear Leader.'' The grandfather, who was the person most \nresponsible for their revolution, was also heralded. Wherever we went \nin North Korea, there were pictures of the two of them on the walls, \nwhether it was in schools or at the hotel. It is a very eerie feeling.\n  It kind of brings you back, for those who read the book ``Nineteen \nEighty-Four'' when we were kids, which was in the future and now is in \nthe past. But for those people who read that book, to me, that sort of \ndescribes the Korean regime. It is really a scary, scary thing.\n  The work we are doing here today is so important. It is so important \nto send a message. It is so important to let the world know that we \nhaven't forgotten this. This remains a bipartisan priority for the U.S. \nCongress.\n  The Kim regime must understand that if it continues to defy the \nglobal consensus and ignore its obligation under international law, \nthere will be consequences. The elites in North Korea must be shown \nthat if they try to skirt sanctions, we will find new ways to go after \nthem. Anyone who wants to do business with North Korea must be warned \nthat we will crack down on those who help sustain this brutal regime.\n  The only way forward for North Korea is for its leaders to give up \ntheir illegal and dangerous pursuits and come back to the negotiating \ntable.\n  I am proud that Congress is sending this bill to the President, and I \nhope we will ramp up engagement with our partners and allies and make \nit clear that North Korea's present course can only lead to deeper \nisolation for the country's leaders and, sadly, continued suffering for \nthe country's people.\n\n[[Page H788]]\n\n  I think the most stark difference that I have seen in all the years I \nhave been in Congress was when we went to the North Korean capital of \nPyongyang and then traveled to the capital of South Korea--Seoul--where \nCongressman Wilson's wife and other spouses were waiting.\n  Seoul is a city that is vibrant. It is much like New York City, \nChicago, or any of the big cities in our country, where the people are \nwell-dressed and well-fed and shops are open. It looks like a real \nwestern-style city. Of course, it is Asia, but it reminds one of Tokyo \nor cities like that.\n  When you go to North Korea, it is just like going back into 1950's \nEast Germany. That is just the feeling that you get. You see hotels and \nbuildings that were constructed poorly and couldn't be occupied. When \nwe came back about 18 months later, it was still just the way it was 18 \nmonths before. You hardly see a car. Traffic lights don't work. It is \njust bizarre--I think that is the word--and the poor North Korean \npeople are the ones who are really suffering. The contrast between \nPyongyang, which is the capital of North Korea, and Seoul, the capital \nof South Korea, was just unbelievable. It was like night and day. It is \non the same peninsula, it is the same Korean people, and yet it is like \nnight and day.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  I think they say pictures are worth a thousand words. There is a \npicture of the Korean Peninsula at night. It was taken by satellite, \nand if you take a look, you see that South Korea is vibrant. There are \nall kinds of lights. It is lit up. North Korea is absolutely black, \nabsolutely dark--no lights, no energy, no power.\n  What a contrast--two Koreas, same people. One is a bastion of \ndemocracy in South Korea--the chairman and I have visited South Korea--\nand one, a brutal, brutal dictatorship.\n  So I hope that this bill overwhelmingly passes. I hope that we have \nstrong support from both sides of the aisle.\n  We want to let the people of North Korea know that we are with them, \nnot with the brutal regime, and that is why we are doing this \nlegislation today.\n  So I thank Chairman Royce. I urge everyone to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to again thank Ranking Member Eliot Engel \nfor his leadership on this issue. He is my coauthor on this bill.\n  I would just like to concur in his thoughts about the shocking nature \nof this totalitarian regime, not just in terms of the way it has \ntreated its people, but also its hostility towards South Korea and \ntowards the United States and to the West; and to just share the \nthought, as he has expressed, this level of struggle that the people \nthemselves in North Korea live in under this totalitarian state.\n  When I was in North Korea, I had an opportunity to see something that \nstruck me just in terms of the malnutrition. The NGO community tells us \nthat close to 50 percent of those children are malnourished. What I saw \nin terms of the malnourishment, the NGO community says malnourished to \nthe point that it affects their ability to learn.\n  The malnourishment can be seen everywhere. The actual height \ndifferential between the average person in North Korea, it is 4 inches \nshorter than in South Korea. That is a really stark thing to see as you \nare in North Korea.\n  But the other observation that Mr. Engel made was the overt hostility \nshown to the United States and, of course, to South Korea and to the \nrest of the world.\n  I remember seeing the Cheonan. This is a corvette. This was a South \nKorean ship on which 46 South Koreans lost their lives, over 50 were \ninjured. It was split in half by a torpedo from a North Korean \nsubmarine. And they actually lifted the two halves out of the water. \nInspecting that and looking at the letters, the last letters that some \nof those young South Korean sailors had sent home before they perished, \nit is just a reminder, it is a reminder of how brutal that regime can \nbe on its own people, but also on those against whom it has ill intent. \nSo the South Koreans have suffered from this.\n  And now, to see them move forward and try to expand this nuclear \nweapons program, each new launch brings them closer. They say they can \nhit the West Coast of the United States. They are claiming that they \nwill be able to hit the entire U.S. with their ICBM program. These \nplacards that you see and these posters actually show their missiles \ncoming down on the United States.\n  So, at this point, I think it is critical, and our colleagues in the \nSenate feel the same way. I want to thank our Senate colleagues for \nbuilding upon the House bill which Eliot Engel and I have authored. And \nI also appreciate the cooperation of the bipartisan House leadership to \nensure this bill's quick scheduling. It is just back from the Senate.\n  In the wake of North Korea's fourth nuclear test and its recent \nmissile launch, many of our allies also are trying to tighten the \nscrews now on that regime in order to slow its capability to deliver \nthis type of weapon. Only days ago, South Korea shuttered the Kaesong \nIndustrial Complex because, as they observed, it was giving the North \nKorean regime the hard currency it needed in order to move forward its \nweapons programs. This will end a very important revenue for the North \nKorean regime. Japan has issued a new set of sanctions as well, and \nChina and Russia should take notice and follow this example.\n  It is time for the United States to stand with our partners in \nnortheast Asia as we press China and Russia to follow suit, and this \nbill sends the message to that regime in North Korea that they must \nreform and they must disarm this nuclear weapons program. By cutting \noff Kim Jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his army and \nhis weapons, H.R. 757 will return us to the one strategy that has \nworked: financial pressure on the North Korean regime. So I urge the \npassage of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SALMON. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to add my strong support to \nH.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2016, a critical \nbill to target the rogue Kim Jong Un regime in North Korea. I want to \nthank Chairman Ed Royce for drafting this important piece of \nlegislation with Ranking Member Eliot Engel and moving swiftly to bring \nit for a final vote here in the House before sending it on to the \nPresident. North Korea needs to know that it cannot pursue a nuclear \nprogram without a tough response from the United States and our allies \nin the region.\n  This latest nuclear test and missile launch test fly in the face of \ncurrent international sanctions and against years and years of \nnegotiation to end North Korea's nuclear ambitions.\n  By their actions, it is clear that North Korea has every intention to \ncontinue advancing its nuclear and missile programs, in an effort to \nstrengthen both domestic and international positions. This must stop \nhere.\n  This bill before us today will seize assets connected with North \nKorea's proliferation program. It will staunch the flow of cash from \nanyone involved in arms trafficking, luxury goods, money laundering, \nand other means of weapons proliferation in North Korea.\n  H.R. 757 will also target the regime's horrendous and appalling human \nrights abuses, by requiring the Administration to develop a strategy \nthat would protect human rights in North Korea and identify those in \nthe North Korean regime who violate basic human rights and dignity.\n  The time is now to take action and punish the North Korean regime for \nits destructive behavior. The time to act is now. We cannot wait for \nanother nuclear test, another missile launch, another island shelling, \nanother ship sinking, or another hacking attack. If the Administration \nwill not act to hold the North Korean regime to account, then the \nCongress must.\n  I am proud to vote in favor of H.R. 757 and strongly encourage all of \nmy House colleagues to join me.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 757.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n[[Page H789]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H789-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H789-H802]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n             COMMON SENSE NUTRITION DISCLOSURE ACT OF 2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE.

Is there \nobjection to the request of the gentleman from Kentucky?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 611 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2017.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  0954\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2017) to amend the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act to \nimprove and clarify certain disclosure requirements for restaurants and \nsimilar retail food establishments, and to amend the authority to bring \nproceedings under section 403A, with Mr. Graves of Louisiana in the \nchair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Guthrie) and the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Kentucky.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 2017, the Common \nSense Nutrition Disclosure Act, sponsored by Conference Chair Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers and Representative Loretta Sanchez.\n  This legislation, first and foremost, is about making menu labeling \nwork for the American people and American businesses. Providing \naccurate information to consumers when they are deciding what to order \nis at the heart of this bill. This is not about hiding the calorie \ninformation. This bill is about making menu labeling requirements work \nfor the entire industry.\n  It seems obvious to me that a one-size-fits-all solution will not \nwork for all restaurant chains; yet FDA's menu labeling recommendation \ndoes just that, and its burdensome rules have raised alarm bells with \nbusinesses across the country.\n  Convenience stores, grocery stores, take-out restaurants, pizza \nrestaurants, movie theaters, amusement parks, bowling alleys, and chain \nrestaurants, I think it is fair to say, can be very different. \nExpecting these distinct businesses to all comply with the same \nstandards is simply not reasonable; in fact, it is ridiculous.\n  Furthermore, FDA's existing regulations force businesses to provide \ninformation that is often useless to the consumer. The Common Sense \nNutrition Disclosure Act provides calorie information to the customers \nwhen it would actually be helpful before they order. Knowing how many \ncalories are in your meal at the point of purchase is not going to help \nanyone. Having calorie information when you place your order will help \ncustomers make healthier decisions.\n  The current FDA menu labeling rules also will expose restaurants and \nretailers to harsh penalties. This bill makes sure that employees don't \nget penalized for an inadvertent error. This bill would also help \nprotect businesses from frivolous lawsuits.\n  Our bill also addresses other impractical, unworkable aspects of \nFDA's regulation. For example, flyers and advertisements were never \nmeant to be considered menus; yet, through guidance, the FDA confirmed \nthat they consider flyers and advertisements menus. FDA had their \nchance to make corrections and they did not. This must be fixed, and \nour bill does just that.\n  This bill came through our Subcommittee on Health with a voice vote. \nIn full committee, it passed with a bipartisan vote of 36-12-1. I look \nforward to passing H.R. 2017 through the House with an even stronger \nbipartisan vote. I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2017.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 10, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     2017, the ``Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015,'' \n     which was referred to the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n       As you know, H.R. 2017 contains provisions that fall within \n     the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary. As \n     a result of your having consulted with the Committee and in \n     order to expedite the House's consideration of H.R. 2017, the \n     Committee on the Judiciary will not assert its jurisdictional \n     claim over this bill by seeking a sequential referral. \n     However, this is conditional on our mutual understanding and \n     agreement that doing so will in no way diminish or alter the \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on the Judiciary with respect \n     to the appointment of conferees or to any future \n     jurisdictional claim over the subject matters contained in \n     the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate a response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding with respect to H.R. 2017, and would ask \n     that a copy of our exchange of letters on this matter be \n     included in the Congressional Record during Floor \n     consideration of H.R. 2017.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 11, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte, \n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: Thank you for your letter \n     regarding H.R. 2017, the ``Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure \n     Act of 2015.''\n       I appreciate your willingness to forgo seeking a sequential \n     referral of the bill, and I agree that your decision will in \n     no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     the Judiciary with respect to the appointment of conferees or \n     to any future jurisdictional claim over the subject matters \n     contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I will include a copy of your letter and this response in \n     the Congressional Record during consideration of H.R. 2017 on \n     the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 2017, the so-called \nCommon Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  Far from common sense, this unnecessary legislation would deny \nconsumers critical information about the food that we eat.\n  I began my career a long time ago as a consumer advocate, joining \ntogether with a small group of housewives to get retailers to put \nexpiration dates on the products they sell. This was way back in 1970, \nwhen every single item in the grocery store was code dated. Now \nexpiration dates are on nearly every single product because this change \nwas good not only for consumers, but it was good for the retailers. \nThey were able to control their inventory much better--less waste \nbecause dates are on the food. We can also control our refrigerators a \nlittle bit better as well.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Consumers can make better decisions with better information, and \nretailers can better control their inventory. Similarly, I believe menu \nlabeling would be helpful to both consumers and retail food \nestablishments, as more and more people are asking for this information \nand making smart decisions.\n  At a time when over 78 million adult Americans are obese and the \nestimated cost of obesity in the United States is $147 billion a year, \nwe should be embracing efforts to reduce this enormous cost to our \nhealthcare system.\n  In fact, a recent Harvard study found restaurant menu calorie \nlabeling could save over $4.6 billion in healthcare costs over 10 \nyears. That is not chump change.\n  Countless consumer and public health organizations oppose H.R. 2017. \nThat includes the American Diabetes Association, the American Cancer \nSociety, the American Heart Association, the American Public Health \nAssociation, and the Center for Science in the Public Interest.\n  Supporters claim that menu labeling requirements would be too \ndifficult to implement. That is what I heard from my colleague. But we \nknow this isn't\n\n[[Page H790]]\n\ntrue. Why? Because California, New York City, the State of Vermont, and \nseveral counties around the country have successfully implemented menu \nlabeling.\n  Only chain restaurants with 20 or more locations operating under the \nsame name must post calorie information. So this is not about small \nbusinesses must post calorie information. Many of these chains have \nalready had to comply with menu labeling in the places where it is \ncurrently required.\n  In addition, the National Restaurant Association has long supported \nmenu labeling, and consumers find this to be an asset. Claims that \nimplementation of menu labeling has been rushed or has not allowed \nindustry to weigh in are simply false.\n  It has been 6 years since the law first passed, giving industry \nplenty of time to weigh in with the FDA and implement this law. The FDA \nhas already issued a 1-year extension, and the FY16 omnibus delayed \nimplementation even further.\n  The FDA has allowed for plenty of industry participation through this \n6-year process, and their final regulations provide a great deal of \nflexibility.\n  H.R. 2017 would not only decrease consumer access to calorie \ninformation, but it would allow for inconsistent or confusing menu \ninformation. This legislation, for example, allows food establishments \nto simply make up their own serving sizes.\n  For example, the bill would allow establishments to list the calories \nfor one chicken wing as opposed to an order of chicken wings and \nwouldn't require the total number of calories to be listed.\n  We have also heard that many establishments, especially chain pizza \nrestaurants, claim that menu labeling would be too difficult for them \nto account for all the variations in their menu offerings.\n  But let's be clear. Pizza chains only need to post calories for the \nstandard menu items they list on their menu boards, not every possible \npizza combination. So clearly, California, Vermont, and the City of New \nYork have figured it out.\n  I also took it upon myself to come up with an easy template for pizza \nrestaurants to use and that is free of charge. I am not going to charge \nthem. It shows how easy it is for them to clearly display the calorie \ninformation and account for the different pizza options. You can see \nright here.\n  So we have one slice of cheese pizza. I just made up these calories. \nI think they are way too low. But let's say one slice of cheese pizza \nis 250 calories. God bless them if they can do that. So then, for \nsausage, you would add calories; mushrooms, you would add calories; \npepperoni, add calories; onion. I think it is rather attractive, easy \nto read, and important for consumers.\n  Pizza is undeniably one of the most common menu items in America. On \nany given day, one out of every eight Americans eats pizza--one out of \neight. The United States spends $37 billion a year on pizza, which \naccounts for one-third of the global pizza market.\n  H.R. 2017 still requires chain pizza restaurants to calculate the \ncalories for their menu items; so, clearly, it can't be that difficult \nto come up with this information.\n  Instead, this bill would allow them to present calorie information in \na deceptive manner and restrict customer access to this information, \ndepending on where they place an order.\n  Given how often pizza is consumed, it is critical that consumers have \naccess to accurate calorie information at all points of sale.\n  More and more, people are planning their caloric intake and making \nhealthier decisions for themselves. We should be encouraging this and \nproviding consumers with the information they need to make smart \ndecisions about their health.\n  So I encourage my colleagues to oppose this unnecessary bill that \nonly serves to harm and confuse consumers.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, first, when we looked at the nice menu \nlabeling board that was just presented, it shows why H.R. 2017 is \nnecessary.\n  Because, if you look at just that board, it was simple, but it fails \nto specify the calories listed for each topping or the calories added \nto a single slice.\n  Under FDA regulations and guidance, the menu must specify that the \nsausage, mushroom, pepperoni, and onion calories are added to the basic \npreparation of slices of pizza with the word ``add'' or ``added'' \nspelled out.\n  You can't use the plus symbol, which the FDA has specifically said is \nnot permitted. It fails to declare calories per slice and per topping \nfor each size of pizza slice.\n  The FDA regulations require that calories be declared for each size \nof pizza slice and for each topping as applied to each size. So it \nshows why we need to move forward. It also doesn't say that 2,000 \ncalories a day is used for general nutrition advice, but calorie needs \nvary.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nUpton), my good friend and the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this bill \nH.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  Simply put, this is a bipartisan bill that would impose common sense \nwhere it is sorely needed: the final food labeling rule issued by this \nadministration.\n  We have a classic example of the administration overreaching with a \ntop-down, big government approach. Its impact is wide ranging and will \nnegatively impact your pizza places, convenience stores, grocery \nstores, amusement parks, movie theaters, and ice cream stores, you name \nit.\n  The administration's own estimates state that this regulation could \ncost American businesses as much as $1 billion to comply and 500,000 \nhours of paperwork, all on small businesses. That is a huge chunk of \ntime and money that would be better spent hiring more folks who are \ncreating improved experiences for customers.\n\n  Michigan's own Domino's pizza illustrates just how this rule simply \ndoesn't work. They have literally hundreds and hundreds of different \npotential order combinations: large pizzas, small ones, medium, thick, \nthin, and crispy.\n  Right now they have an online calculator that, in fact, will \ndetermine nutritional information so that, when you order from your \ncomputer or your app, you can see the precise nutrition information on \nthat pizza.\n  When 91 percent of orders are placed online, it doesn't make much \nsense for Domino's to have an in-store menu board that won't provide \nprecise nutrition information for customers on literally hundreds of \ndifferent choices. Yet, that is what the final food labeling rule would \nrequire.\n  We live in an innovative world, with businesses like Seamless and \nUber Eats that bring all kinds of food with the click of a button to \nconsumers' doorsteps. The menu board won't be impactful and is not the \nsolution to menu labeling.\n  The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act prevents these onerous \nburdens and puts in place a framework that actually works for consumers \nand businesses.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman from Michigan an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank, in particular, Cathy \nMcMorris Rodgers and Loretta Sanchez for their bipartisan work to \nadvance a workable, pragmatic solution that focuses on consumers and \nsmall businesses.\n  As was noted, it did pass in our committee 36-12 with one voting \npresent. I look forward to an even stronger bipartisan vote today.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman. \nI also thank my good friend. I will move as quickly as I possibly can.\n  Mr. Chairman, these legislative issues are important to us, and we \nrealize that there is a difference of opinion. So I don't come to the \nfloor harking with great adversity, but I do come with a reasonable \nresponse to my opposition to H.R. 2017 in terms of its overall impact.\n  So I would like to say that it is overly broad in its approach to \naddress narrower concerns from the pizza industry\n\n[[Page H791]]\n\nand other food establishments that are better resolved through \nguidance.\n  The bill will reduce the likelihood that consumers will receive clear \nand consistent calorie information at chain food service \nestablishments, and the bill weakens an important tool intended to help \nAmericans make informed food choices at a time when obesity and other \nnutrition-related health problems are at crisis.\n  Our constituents have gotten used to seeing the calorie content. They \nlook for it. They want transparency. Obviously, Americans eat less than \nthe recommended amounts of vegetables, fruits, whole grains, dairy \nproducts, and oil. Although we are not the Big Brother, we have to \ncreate opportunities for such.\n  I live in communities where there are food deserts. More than 23 \nmillion Americans, including 6.5 million children, live in food \ndeserts, areas that are more than a mile away from a supermarket.\n  In 2008, an estimated 49.1 million people, including 16.7 million \nchildren, experienced food insecurity--limited availability to safe and \nnutritionally adequate foods--multiple times throughout the year. So \nanytime there can be an increased knowledge about the nutrition of a \nfood product, that is crucial.\n  In addition, as the co-chair and founder of the Congressional \nChildren's Caucus, I work on the issues of childhood obesity.\n  Data from 2009 to 2010 indicates that over 78 million U.S. adults and \nabout 12.5 million--16.9 percent--children and adolescents are obese. \nWe need to help those individuals both in terms of their own confidence \nabout themselves, but to eat healthy.\n  So I rise today to oppose this legislation because I believe we can \nfind a better place of guidance.\n  I include in the Record a letter, Mr. Chairman, from the National \nRestaurant Association, which says: ``We are writing to inform you of \nour opposition to H.R. 2017. This legislation would create an unfair \nadvantage between competitors by specifically carving out segments of \nthe food service marketplace from the federal requirement. . . . ''\n\n                              National Restaurant Association,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: We are writing to inform you of our \n     opposition to H.R. 2017. This legislation would create an \n     unfair advantage between competitors by specifically carving \n     out segments of the food service marketplace from the federal \n     requirement to provide uniform nutrition information. We urge \n     you to treat establishments selling restaurant type food \n     equitably. Congress should not provide a competitive \n     advantage for one segment of an industry over another.\n       H.R. 2017 would broadly exempt thousands of chain grocery \n     and convenience stores from providing uniform nutrition \n     information on restaurant type food to customers \n     notwithstanding that each day thousands of customers purchase \n     such meals at these establishments. Such establishments each \n     made strategic decisions to compete directly with their local \n     restaurants. While we welcome their competition, there is no \n     justifiable reason why they should not be held to the same \n     rules as those with whom they have chosen to compete. While \n     we recognize the need expressed by supporters of H.R. 2017 to \n     have appropriate time for menu-labeling implementation, H.R. \n     2017 would outright exempt entities from providing nutrition \n     information, create an uneven playing field, and cast \n     different requirements amongst competitors.\n       The food service industry is a broad but competitive \n     industry that is ever expanding in areas that have not \n     traditionally provided restaurant meals. For example, today \n     there are 54,000 grocery stores and 59,000 convenience stores \n     that offer freshly prepared food and beverages, with annual \n     average foodservice sales of $25 billion dollars. Taken \n     together, these two foodservice segments alone represent 12% \n     of total restaurant and foodservice locations in the U.S. In \n     fact, in recent years, sales in this broad `retail host' \n     segment have grown much faster than the restaurant industry \n     as a whole. Between 2006 and 2011, sales in this sector \n     jumped 31%, compared to a 16% increase in total restaurant \n     industry sales.\n       It is clear that grocery and convenience stores are \n     expanding into the traditional restaurant space and competing \n     for the traditional restaurant customer. Just as a restaurant \n     that decides to sell gas or packaged food would be required \n     to adhere to the laws governing those products, our \n     competitors should follow the rules that apply to restaurant \n     products.\n       Moreover, as with most federal legislation, we recognized \n     the need for a small business protection in the menu labeling \n     requirements. As a result, the law only applies to chains \n     with 20 or more locations that operate under the same trade \n     name and offer for sale substantially the same menu items. \n     Smaller chains and independent operators have the choice to \n     voluntarily provide menu labeling but they are not required \n     to do so under the federal law.\n       Lastly, the menu labeling rule comes at a time when \n     consumers are demanding more information about the food they \n     eat. In providing the nutritional content of restaurant \n     foods, customers will have access to the information they \n     seek. In fact, this information is being met favorably with \n     estimates suggesting 76% of consumers want menu labeling.\n       We appreciate your consideration that establishments \n     offering restaurant food be treated equally under the law. \n     Should you have questions on the final requirements around \n     menu labeling, please feel free to consult our website at \n     www.restaurant.org/menulabeling. If you have any questions \n     regarding this letter, please feel free to contact me at the \n     National Restaurant Association.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                    Dan Roehl,\n\n                                                   Vice President,\n     Government Relations.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                   Trust for America's Health,\n\n                                                 February 8, 2016.\n       Dear Lillie: Trust for America's Health (TFAH), a non-\n     profit, non-partisan organization dedicated to promoting \n     health for all Americans, urges Representative Jackson Lee to \n     oppose H.R. 2017, legislation which would weaken and \n     partially repeal critical Food and Drug Administration (FDA) \n     menu labeling standards. The bill is scheduled to be \n     considered by the House later this week.\n       According to The State of Obesity 2015, obesity remains one \n     of the biggest threats to the health of our children and \n     country. Mound 17 percent of children and more than 30 \n     percent of adults are currently considered obese, putting \n     them at heightened risk for a wide range of health problems \n     such as heart disease, hypertension, type 2 diabetes, stroke, \n     cancer, asthma and osteoarthritis.\n       Today, Americans consume roughly one-third of all calories \n     outside the home. There is no single solution to the obesity \n     epidemic, but without improved information about the \n     nutritional content of their food options, millions of \n     Americans will not have the tools they need to make healthy \n     choices.\n       I urge you to oppose this legislation. If you have any \n     questions, please do not hesitate to contact TFAH's Senior \n     Government Relations Manager Jack Rayburn.\n           Thank you,\n                                                  Richard Hamburg,\n                                        Interim President and CEO.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is the National Restaurant Association.\n  I received a letter from the Trust for America's Health. They, too, \nare a nonprofit, nonpartisan organization. They have asked for us to \noppose this, which would weaken and partially repeal critical Food and \nDrug Administration, FDA, menu labeling. The bill, as I said, is \nscheduled to come, and here we are today.\n  So my final points are this. If we have a problem, let's try to work \nit out, but let's not take a sledgehammer and sledgehammer the \nrequirements that help Americans have transparent information about \ntheir food.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2017, the ``Common Sense \nNutrition Disclosure Act of 2015,'' which amends the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act to revise the nutritional information that \nrestaurants and retail food establishments must disclose.\n  As the founder and chair of the Congressional Children's Caucus, I \noppose this legislation for the following four reasons:\n  1. H.R. 2017 is overly broad in its approach to address narrower \nconcerns from the pizza industry and other food establishments that are \nbetter resolved through guidance;\n  2. The bill will reduce the likelihood that consumers will receive \nclear and consistent calorie information at chain food service \nestablishments; and\n  3. The bill weakens an important tool intended to help Americans make \ninformed food choices at a time when obesity and other nutrition-\nrelated health problems are at crisis levels.\n  The FDA has been responsive to industry concerns and has already \ndelayed implementation of menu labeling by two years, which is more \nthan six years after it was enacted.\n  Moreover, H.R. 2017 states that its goal is to establish that the \nnutrient content disclosure statement on the menu or menu board at \nestablishments that serve prepared foods must include:\n  1. the number of calories contained in the whole menu item;\n  2. the number of servings and number of calories per serving;\n  3. the number of calories per common unit of the item, such as for a \nmulti-serving item that is typically divided before presentation to the \nconsumer; and\n  4. allow nutritional information may be provided solely by a remote-\naccess menu (e.g., an Internet menu) for food establishments where the \nmajority of orders are placed by customers who are off-premises.\n\n[[Page H792]]\n\n  \n\n\n\n                         nutrition and obesity\n\n  Typical American diets exceed the recommended intake levels or limits \nin four categories: calories from solid fats and added sugars; refined \ngrains; sodium; and saturated fat.\n  Americans eat less than the recommended amounts of vegetables, \nfruits, whole grains, dairy products, and oils.\n  About 90% of Americans eat more sodium than is recommended for a \nhealthy diet.\n  Reducing the sodium Americans eat by 1,200mg per day on could save up \nto $20 billion a year in medical costs.\n  Food available for consumption increased in all major food categories \nfrom 1970 to 2008. Average daily calories per person in the marketplace \nincreased approximately 600 calories.\n  Since the 1970s, the number of fast food restaurants has more than \ndoubled.\n  More than 23 million Americans, including 6.5 million children, live \nin food deserts--areas that are more than a mile away from a \nsupermarket.\n  In 2008, an estimated 49.1 million people, including 16.7 million \nchildren, experienced food insecurity (limited availability to safe and \nnutritionally adequate foods) multiple times throughout the year.\n  In 2013, residents of the following states were most likely to report \neating at least five servings of vegetables four or more days per week: \nVermont (68.7%), Montana (63.0%) and Washington (61.8%). The least \nlikely were Oklahoma (52.3%), Louisiana (53.3%) and Missouri (53.8%). \nThe national average for regular produce consumption is 57.7%.\n  Empty calories from added sugars and solid fats contribute to 40% of \ntotal daily calories for 2-18 year olds and half of these empty \ncalories come from six sources: soda, fruit drinks, dairy desserts, \ngrain desserts, pizza, and whole milk.\n  US adults consume an average of 3,400 mg/day [of sodium], well above \nthe current federal guideline of less than 2,300 mg daily.\n  Food safety awareness goes hand in hand with nutrition education. In \nthe United States, food-borne agents affect 1 out of 6 individuals and \ncause approximately 48 million illnesses, 128,000 hospitalizations, and \n3,000 deaths each year.\n  US per capita consumption of total fat increased from approximately \n57 pounds in 1980 to 78 pounds in 2009 with the highest consumption \nbeing 85 pounds in 2005.\n  The US percentage of food-insecure households, those with limited or \nuncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable \nways, rose from 11% to 15% between 2005 and 2009.\n\n\n                                OBESITY\n\n  Data from 2009-2010 indicates that over 78 million U.S. adults and \nabout 12.5 million (16.9%) children and adolescents are obese.\n  Recent reports project that by 2030, half of all adults (115 million \nadults) in the United States will be obese.\n  Overweight adolescents have a 70% chance of becoming overweight or \nobese adults.\n\n\n                          CHILDREN AND OBESITY\n\n  For children with disabilities, obesity rates are approximately 38% \nhigher than for children without disabilities. It gets worse for the \nadult population where obesity rates for adults with disabilities are \napproximately 57% higher than for adults without disabilities.\n  In 2011-2012, 8.4% of 2- to 5-year-olds had obesity compared with \n17.7% of 6- to 11-year-olds and 20.5% of 12- to 19-year-olds. Childhood \nobesity is also more common among certain racial and ethnic groups.\n  In 2011-2012, the prevalence among children and adolescents was \nhigher among Hispanics (22.4%) and non-Hispanic blacks (20.2%) than \namong non-Hispanic whites (14.1%).\n  The prevalence of obesity was lower in non-Hispanic Asian youth \n(8.6%) than in youth who were non-Hispanic white, non-Hispanic black or \nHispanic.\n  Almost 40% of black and Latino youth ages 2 to 19 are overweight or \nobese compared with only 29% of white youth.\n\n\n                       IMPACT OF BILL ON CHILDREN\n\n  Nearly 1 in 3 children, 2-19 years of age living in the United States \nis overweight or obese, putting them at risk for serious health \nproblems.\n  As members of Congress we should be joining with parents, caregivers, \nbrothers and sisters, schools, communities and healthcare providers in \nmaking accurate and easily understandable information regarding the \nnutrient and calorie content of takeout food transparent to the public.\n  Our goal should be to work together to create a nation where the \nhealthy choices in takeout as well as food prepared at homes are \nreadily available.\n  Part of that means information on calorie content and nutrition of \nfood is essential.\n  Food high calorie content, while low in nutritional value, is a \nrecipe for obesity.\n\n\n                  human and financial costs of obesity\n\n  Obesity-related illness, including chronic disease, disability, and \ndeath, is estimated to carry an annual cost of $190.2 billion.\n  Projections estimate that by 2018, obesity will cost the U.S. 21 \npercent of our total healthcare costs--$344 billion annually.\n  Those who are obese have medical costs that are $1,429 more than \nthose of normal weight on average (roughly 42% higher).\n  The annual cost of being overweight is $524 for women and $432 for \nmen; annual costs for being obese are even higher: $4,879 for women and \n$2,646 for men.\n  Obesity is also a growing threat to national security--a surprising \n27% of young Americans are too overweight to serve in our military. \nApproximately 15,000 potential recruits fail their physicals every year \nbecause they are unfit.\n  The medical care costs of obesity in the United States are \nstaggering. In 2008 dollars, these costs totaled about $147 billion.\n  Hunger hurts everyone, but it is especially devastating to children. \nHaving enough nutritious, healthy food is critical to a child's \nphysical and emotional development and their ability to achieve \nacademically.\n  Children facing hunger may perform worse in school and struggle with \nsocial and behavioral problems that impact their ability to learn.\n  16 million children in America face hunger.\n  In 2014, more than 21.5 million low-income children received free or \nreduced-price meals daily through the National School Lunch Program.\n  84% of client households with children report purchasing the cheapest \nfood available, even if it wasn't the healthiest option.\n  H.R. 2017 Removes the Information Needed by Consumers to make Good \nFood Choices\n\n\n                    TEXAS AND CARRYOUT FOOD LABELING\n\n  Nearly 27 million people call the state of Texas home, making it the \nsecond largest and most populous state in the nation.\n  Unfortunately, Texas ranks first as the most obese state in the \nUnited States for children.\n  More than 1 in 3 children and adolescents in Texas is obese, putting \nthem at risk for serious health problems.\n  The story does not end with these statistics.\n  An initiative by state school districts in collaboration with the \nRobert Wood Johnson Foundation is working to address childhood obesity \nin the state of Texas.\n  More than 2,100 schools serving over 1.4 million students across the \nstate of Texas have joined the Alliance's Healthy Schools Program, \ncreating healthier school environments for children to thrive.\n  Since 2007, 136 Texas schools have been recognized with National \nHealthy Schools Awards for their outstanding efforts.\n  I must encourage my colleagues to join me in opposition to this \nunwise and harmful legislation.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Bilirakis), my good friend.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. I thank my good friend from Kentucky.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 2017, the Common Sense \nNutrition Disclosure Act. This bill, as the name suggests, truly is a \ncommonsense bill. H.R. 2017 would lift many of the burdens on small \nbusinesses and help protect establishments from excessive regulations.\n  This summer I visited many Florida food producers, distributors, and \nrestaurants, including one of the local Publix Super Markets, in Land \nO' Lakes, Florida, where employees showed me how current policies and \nexcessive regulations impact their store.\n  However, it was clear that reasonable regulations are needed. This \nbill allows for providing nutritional information to consumers based on \nthe different ways that foods are prepared and sold across venues and \nformats.\n  Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairwoman McMorris Rodgers for sponsoring the \nbill and the committee for their good work. I urge passage of this \ngreat bill, H.R. 2017.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  I am really glad to introduce Mark DeSaulnier, who has experience \nwith this particular legislation.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to express my strong opposition to H.R. 2017. I \ndo this in the context of my background and my professional life, 40 \nyears in the restaurant business.\n  I started as a busboy and a dishwasher. I have worked in chain \nrestaurants and fast-food restaurants and owned multiple fine-dining \nrestaurants in the Bay Area and have done consulting to restaurants \nthroughout California.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I was an author along with a colleague in the State legislature. At \nthat time, the first statewide menu labeling legislation in the country \nwas in California. My colleague had been on the\n\n[[Page H793]]\n\nL.A. City Council, I had been in local government in the bay area, and \nwe had started in local government doing this.\n  We took 2 years, from 2006 to 2008, to work with a Republican \nadministration and a Democratic leadership of both Houses in \nCalifornia. I worked with the California Restaurant Association, which \nI was a longtime member of.\n  At the end of the day, we accommodated all people's interests, \nincluding the stakeholders in the pizza industry. What we had was a \nremarkable piece of legislation that is helping to address what the \nCenter for Disease Control called over 10 years ago a national epidemic \nin this country, a national epidemic of obesity, particularly for young \npeople, for young Americans, of which as many as two-thirds of them \ndeal with obesity every day, or overweight, and obesity-related \ndiseases, like diabetes type 2, has expanded over 300 percent since \n1971, when many of us were younger. This is a national epidemic.\n  When we were doing the legislation in California, we considered cost \nbenefits. We worked, as I said before, with the Restaurant Association. \nAs somebody who spent 4 years in the Restaurant Association--and they \nwere independent restaurants so I understand that this would not apply \ndirectly--but many of those restaurants already started on their own, \nand the consumers responded to it in the context of this national \ncrisis.\n  Here is a piece of legislation that the administration is continuing \nto work in full faith with the stakeholders on. Why not let them \ncontinue. It is a major piece of prevention. It is a major piece of \npublic health.\n  I have been in the restaurant business long enough to remember when \nMothers Against Drunk Driving brought their issues to the restaurant \nindustry and said that we should do something about the epidemic of \ndrunk driving deaths. We did. The restaurant industry put up a struggle \nand thought it would be the end of it.\n  I have been in the business long enough to remember secondhand smoke, \nwhere similarly people said: This will be the end of us.\n  I know how hard it is to keep a restaurant open. It is one of the \nmost daunting things you can do in life. I know the importance of them \nin a community where more and more Americans with two-income households \nrely on restaurants and dining out to provide for their families. \nTherein lies part of our crisis.\n  The restaurant business responded when we had drunk driving issues. \nIt responded again in secondhand smoke. Many of us can remember when \nyou would walk into a restaurant and you were engulfed in smoke. We \nknow what the public health dangers of that were. We know how we have \nreduced that exposure and led the world.\n  Here is another occasion where the United States--and I know in \nCalifornia, we led the world, and it is working. I will say that you \ncan remedy, as somebody with my background, the conflicts between \npublic health.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Curbelo of Florida). The time of the gentleman \nhas expired.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I yield the gentleman from California an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I urge my colleagues--given the experience I have had \nand others, and the urgency of the issue when it comes to public health \nand the future of this country--to vote ``no.''\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, can I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 16\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez), my good friend.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, this is an issue \nthat I care a lot about. Diabetes runs in my family, and I am talking \ngenerations worth.\n  One of the ways that you combat diabetes is through nutrition and \nthrough exercise. I watch everything that I eat. I am very grateful \nthat when I go to a restaurant, they put the calorie count on the \ndifferent pieces on the menu. I am very grateful that when I go into a \n7-Eleven or some other type of convenience store, that there is calorie \ncount and serving size on everything that I buy there. This is very \nimportant to me.\n  But at the same time, I have been a small business woman, I have had \na small business, and I know how difficult it is to make payroll, to be \na small business trying to make a profit. I think that this particular \nregulation, not law, because when we passed the Affordable Care Act we \nsaid: Let's help people make good nutrition decisions, and I agree with \nthat. But then we had a regulatory agency that made these regulations \nthat just don't make sense. That is what this bill is about.\n  Ms. Jackson Lee, one of my colleagues, said: This is easy, let's just \nwork it out. But the reality is we have been at this for almost 2 or 3 \nyears, and we have not been able to work it out at the table. This is \nvery, very important.\n  There was just a letter of opposition put into the Record from the \nNational Restaurant Association. Yes, early on, to this bill, they were \nopposed. But the thing they were opposed to was the 50 percent rule, \nand we have taken that out of this.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. I yield the gentlewoman from California an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. I would like to say that the \nCommon Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015 aims to fix these \nproblems and to help small businesses meet the intention of the law.\n  I think it is very unfair if you walk into a 7-Eleven and because \nsomething is taken out of its package and is put in a toaster oven \nthat, all of a sudden, another place has to put the calories.\n  So I would ask my colleagues, please, let's do the right thing. Let's \nhelp consumers be smart about what they are eating, and let's let \nbusinesses go about their business.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro), the wonderful consumer advocate who has \nbeen fighting issues on nutrition and consumer information for such a \nlong time and who is so knowledgeable about the importance of \ninformation for consumers.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to H.R. 2017, the \nCommon Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015.\n  As many of you know, I have been a longstanding champion of menu \nlabeling, and I have fought to secure its inclusion in the Affordable \nCare Act. In fact, I was the original author of the House menu labeling \nbill.\n  When the Congress passed standardized menu labeling in 2010, what was \nthe goal? To arm Americans with the right-to-know information they need \nto make informed nutritional decisions for themselves and for their \nfamilies.\n  The language was built on consensus and compromise and worked out \nbetween a wide variety of interests, including many industry partners. \nI can find you the quotes from the National Restaurant Association \nwhere we stood together to make the announcement to put calories up on \nmenu boards where people could see them and make the decision about \nwhat they were going to purchase at the point of purchase.\n\n  Now certain sectors of the industry want to tear down the progress \nthat we have made. This bill would weaken and repeal a crucial step to \ncombat the obesity epidemic in the United States. This bill increases \nconsumer confusion and allows restaurants to list deceptive portion \nsizes, listing an entree as multiple servings, even though these items \nare often consumed by one person.\n  For example, a restaurant could list the caloric content of one \nchicken wing, deciding that one chicken wing is a serving size. But \npeople do not eat just one chicken wing. Under the proposed bill, a \nrestaurant would not be obligated to inform a consumer that there are \n12 chicken wings in an order, which can lead to consumers making \nmisinformed decisions based on misleading information, consuming far \nmore calories than they ever realized.\n  This bill would also deny consumers the right to nutritional \ninformation at that point of purchase, even if 49 percent of orders are \nplaced from in-store menus. Food establishments, what they would like \nto do is to bury menu labeling online.\n  Multiple studies have shown that providing calorie menu information\n\n[[Page H794]]\n\ncan help Americans make lower calorie choices. But they cannot do this \nif they do not have the information they need.\n  It also weakens enforcement, consumer protection, and it would \ncompletely remove an establishment's incentive to comply with menu \nlabeling requirements.\n  It also removes the ability of individuals to hold retail \nestablishments accountable for violations to the food labeling law.\n  Many public interest health organizations are concerned about the \nability of citizens to take action on noncompliance to menu labeling \nstandards. Given that the Food and Drug Administration is chronically \nunderfunded, this would be a serious setback.\n  We live in a country where obesity is an epidemic. In March 2015, \nsales at restaurants and bars surpassed spending at grocery stores for \nthe first time ever. On an average day, one out of three Americans eat \nat a fast food restaurant. Americans are eating nearly half of their \nmeals and snacks outside the home. Nutritional information must be made \nreadily available where the consumer is at a point of purchase.\n  Children are especially at risk. Today, more than a third of children \nand adolescents are overweight and obese. Children eat almost twice as \nmany calories at a restaurant than they do at home. The impact on our \nkids alone should be reason enough to oppose a measure that undermines \nthe consumer's ability to make an informed nutrition choice at \nmealtime.\n  The good news is that menu labeling works. A 2015 study at Harvard \nfound that menu labeling could save $4.6 billion in healthcare costs \nover 10 years. It is a popular concept. A national poll found that 80 \npercent of Americans support menu labeling in chain restaurants. Over \n100 nutrition and health organizations support menu labeling, along \nwith trade associations, like the National Restaurant Association, \nchain restaurants such as McDonald's, Chili's, and IHOP.\n  The existing law is flexible. Restaurants with less than 20 \nlocations--a mom and pop small businesses--are excluded. Your local \ngrocery store is excluded.\n  It has been 6 years since the original labeling law passed. There has \nbeen a 2-year delay in its full implementation.\n  The Food and Drug Administration has actually gone almost door to \ndoor to work with the industry to address their concerns. We should let \nthem work through this process rather than complicating it with this \nlegislation, which is just industry's answer to gutting the \nlegislation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I yield the gentlewoman from Connecticut as much time \nas she may consume.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Let them work through the process. We would be undoing \nyears of meaningful, impactful work on menu labeling with a single \nstroke.\n  This is a special interest-driven bill. No one is suggesting that \nevery permutation of a meal has to be changed and listed on a menu \nboard. That is false. That is misrepresentation. You take the standard \nmenu and you put that up there, and the same is true of pizza places, \nthe same is true of the deli counter, and a convenience store. Do not \nlet an industry that doesn't want to provide information to the \nAmerican people about what they are eating and what the calorie content \nis--you know, when we first started this, we talked about calories and \nsodium and a whole bunch of other things, but it was by working with \nthe industry that I did at that time, that said: No, let's just put \ncalories up there. That is reasonable. We don't have to go further than \nthat. They stood side by side with me and we went to restaurants where \nwe saw what the calorie count was on the label, and they were perfectly \nhappy with it.\n  Subsections of this industry have refused to do what the broad-based \nindustry has wanted to do.\n  This is industry-driven. It is not the answer. It would undo over 5 \nyears of progress on menu labeling. It hurts the American public. It \nhurts our children. And I urge all of my colleagues to oppose it.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend, the \ngentleman from Iowa (Mr. Blum).\n  Mr. BLUM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2017, the \nCommon Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  This commonsense, bipartisan legislation would change the FDA's \nburdensome and impractical labeling of prepared food items at grocery \nstores and at convenience stores into a more workable and efficient \nsolution that keeps food costs down for consumers.\n  In the First District of Iowa, many of my constituents stop by local \nbusinesses, like Casey's General Store or the Hy-Vee supermarket, to \nget a hot breakfast or to pick up a convenient meal over their lunch \nbreaks. These stores often use local ingredients and offer specialty \nitems, which means their recipes and nutritional information and \ncontent can vary.\n  Under the FDA's regulation, Casey's, Hy-Vee, and any other business \nthat is impacted by the rule could be penalized for failing to label \naccurately a sandwich that happens to get an extra squirt of mayo or a \nsalad that a customer chooses to top off with bacon bits. H.R. 2017 \nwould fix these issues by providing a menu board that lists nutritional \ninformation for prepared items instead of forcing these businesses to \npass excessive labeling compliance costs on to their customers.\n  Furthermore, as a career small-business man, I know how tough it is \nto compete with massive corporations, and excessive red tape like this \nmakes it even harder. While large corporations can often afford the \nadded costs, it is the smaller businesses that get squeezed out of the \nmarketplace by the extra burden of ever-increasing red tape.\n  Mr. Chairman, the FDA's regulation is just another example of \nWashington overreach that forces businesses to push costs, with no \nadded benefit, onto customers.\n  I am proud to cosponsor this bill, and I urge my colleagues to join \nme in voting in favor of H.R. 2017.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the Common \nSense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  This bipartisan bill would protect small businesses from overbearing \nFDA regulations that harm workers, job creators, our economy, and, oh, \nby the way, personal freedom of choice for individual citizens, who, in \nmost cases, make good decisions and ought to have a choice in America.\n  The FDA's poorly designed menu labeling requirements do not take into \naccount the diversity of restaurants and of food products. That is \nAmerica. The estimated cost for places like delis, convenience stores, \nand pizzerias to comply would be more than $1 billion.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are here today to offer a practical alternative that \nwould rein in and clarify the FDA's burdensome, one-size-fits-all \napproach. This commonsense bill offers an efficient and, I believe, an \neffective solution by giving small businesses greater flexibility to \nprovide nutrition information in a way that best serves their \ncustomers.\n  I urge its passage.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The previous speaker said that this is all about choice. I agree with \nthat. I think it is all about choice and about having the kind of \ninformation to make a proper choice.\n  Let me just give you an example of a menu from a SUBWAY in Montgomery \nCounty, Maryland.\n  This is from SUBWAY, which lists the calories in a standardized way, \nand that is what the original regulations and law required before there \nbeing this confusing change in the legislation. It reads, for example, \nthat a SUBWAY Melt is 380 calories and that a Chicken and Bacon Ranch \nis 580 calories. Now, one would not necessarily assume that a SUBWAY \nMelt, which sounds cheesy and kind of rich, would, actually, have fewer \ncalories--by 200--than a Chicken and Bacon Ranch. I think it is good \nfor me and for many consumers to go in and to be able to see that and \nknow that is going to be the standard way that calories are presented. \nThis legislation would allow such things as this.\n  The covered establishments could make their own decisions about what \nis\n\n[[Page H795]]\n\na serving size. It wouldn't be the same from establishment to \nestablishment. For example, this allows covered establishments to not \nlist the total number of servings for an item on the menu, like a \nplatter of a certain appetizer. For example, an advertiser could list \nthe calories as 400 calories but not disclose that one platter--just \none order--has three servings, for a total of 1,200 calories--400 \nversus 1,200 calories. This presents real confusion and, I would argue, \nmisinformation to the consumer.\n  More and more Americans are eating food outside of the home that is \nprepared by restaurants or by chain grocery stores where they have a \nsection on prepared foods. In order to have complete decisionmaking \npower, it is very important that we have the calories that are there \nand posted.\n  Obviously, this is not overburdening, certainly, small businesses, \nbecause this isn't about small businesses. We have the largest State in \nthe country already having these regulations, operating smoothly. We \nhave got the second largest city in the country--the city of New York--\nand we have the State of Vermont, very different kinds of locations \nthat are being able to comply with the FDA regulations and the law that \nwe want to go into effect next year. We do not need H.R. 2017 to \nconfuse and disarm consumers and not provide them with the information \nthey need.\n  I have another menu from Specialty Pizza: build your own pizza. What \nit has is a range of calories; so it would not be overburdening for \nevery single different iteration of a pizza to have all of the \ndifferent calories. There are options and there is flexibility under \nthe legislation. It doesn't need to be changed and undermined by H.R. \n2017.\n  If we are serious about dealing with one of the most important, \nexpensive, and ubiquitous diseases in the United States of America--\ndiabetes. One of the greatest problems that we face is obesity in \nadults and especially in children--then I think we owe it to our \nfamilies to make sure that we do not pass H.R. 2017, a special \ninterest-driven bill to decrease consumer access to important nutrition \nand calorie information.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUTHRIE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, let me state what this bill is not. It is not doing away with \nthe calorie count or the ability for people to understand what calorie \ncontent, or caloric content, is available in each product. I am one who \nlooks at that. I don't know of anything that has a calorie count on \nanything that I have eaten recently that I haven't looked at. I have \nchecked out the serving sizes so that I know how many chicken wings I \nwant to order. If I can get the calories per chicken wing, I can make \nthat determination.\n  We looked at the menu board that was offered earlier, and it looked \nsimple, but this is the issue: Even if you put ranges, how do you get \nthe information in people's hands? I was just at a restaurant, when I \nwas traveling in my district the other day, that had calories for \ndifferent orders. One was from 400 to 800 on one. So what we want to do \nis to make it available in a way that is efficient, as most people now \nget their information not necessarily on a board where you have to have \nbig ranges, but specific. For instance, at one pizza restaurant alone, \nwe had the pizza slice plus a few toppings; but what if you have five \nstyles of crust, six different cheeses, five sauces, four sizes, and 20 \ndifferent toppings? If you put all of that together, it comes to about \n34 million different combinations, and deviations from the standard \nthat the FDA has put forward could lead to fines and to criminal \npenalties.\n\n  What we are looking at, as my friend from California said, are these \nrules that are incredibly complex, burdensome, and inflexible. What \nthis bill does not do is create exemptions or diminish the amount of \ninformation that must be provided by restaurants or retailers. All it \ndoes is allow for some flexibility, and it clarifies the unworkable and \noverly complex regulations the FDA finalized in November 2014. A lot of \nthings that happen here are overly cumbersome and unworkable. We go to \ndelay, to delay, and we delayed an omnibus, as they said. These are \ngoing to be unworkable 6 months from now and a year from now.\n  So let's fix it so that our businesses know what to provide without \ntheir having the threat of penalty, because they will know what to \nprovide, and so that consumers can make choices. I am one, as I said, \nwho wants that information because I want to be able to make that \nchoice for myself and for my family.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, the bill before us today takes an important \nstep in protecting our nation's small businesses from unnecessary costs \nand regulatory burdens. The Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act \nprovides for flexibility for the food service industry to ensure they \ncan comply with the regulatory requirements as issued by the U.S. Food \nand Drug Administration (FDA).\n  Sadly, the rule issued by the FDA was declared to be the third most \nburdensome regulation proposed in 2010 and could cost American \nbusinesses $1 billion to comply and 500,000 hours of paperwork. The \n400-page rule establishes one-size-fits-all nutritional disclosure \nrequirements.\n  H.R. 2017 is necessary to help small business owners, franchisees, as \nwell as consumers who want easy access to accurate nutrition \ninformation in a common sense way.\n  Without HR. 2017, covered establishments, including pizza delivery \nbusinesses and grocery stores, would be subject to a cumbersome, rigid \nand costly regulatory compliance process to avoid violations and \npossible criminal prosecution.\n  H.R. 2017 improves and clarifies the final rule promulgated by the \nFDA implementing the menu-labeling requirements of Section 4205 of the \nAffordable Care Act (ACA). The concern is that without the relief and \nflexibility provided for in H.R. 2017, the final rule goes well beyond \nwhat was intended by the ACA.\n  The obligations are imposed not only on chain restaurants--including \ndelivery establishments, but also on any other chain retailer that \nsells non-packaged food, such as grocery store salad bars, and \nconvenience stores' meals to go.\n  Small businesses that are not chain restaurants but are indeed \nsubject to the rule will face a dramatic increase in regulatory \ncompliance costs. Consumers most assuredly will see higher food costs, \nand perhaps fewer choices. Some retailers may find it more advantageous \nto stop selling restaurant-type food altogether. So instead of \npurchasing fresh sandwiches, consumers may have to buy pre-packaged \nsandwiches since those will not require the retailer to comply with \nlabeling requirements.\n  Fixing this burdensome regulation will benefit tens of thousands of \nrestaurants, grocery stores, convenience stores and small business \nowners that otherwise would be burdened with regulations that are \ncostly and hurt job creation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation provides clarity, flexibility, and \ncertainty for these companies, and also ensures consumers have access \nto the information they need to make informed nutritional decisions. I \nurge my colleagues to support H.R. 2017.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren).

Pursuant to House Resolution 611, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, the amendment I am offering is a \nclarifying amendment.\n  Current law requires that restaurants and food establishments have a \nreasonable basis for how they determine the calorie count they \nultimately disclose to their customers. The FDA's final rule does not \naccommodate for the variability that is involved when preparing food. \nEspecially when chefs are preparing fresh, custom order items, mistakes \nand variations are inevitable. For example, if someone is making a \npizza and is adding a handful of every topping, chefs' hands are \ndifferent sizes, so people may end up with more or less of each \ningredient.\n  The amendment will provide the added flexibility that we want for \nfood establishments to determine accurate nutrient disclosures by \nallowing for permissible variations, like inadvertent human error, \nwhile also ensuring that businesses and their employees will not be \ncriminally penalized.\n  Now I want to address some of the concerns that were raised by my \ncolleagues from across the aisle about the underlying legislation, H.R. \n2017.\n  This bill is not about the merits of calorie counts. This bill does \nnot remove any requirements for calorie counts on menus. This bill \ncertainly does not make it more difficult for customers to receive \nnutritional information. This bill, at its very core, is about \nflexibility. In trying to create a uniform standard, the FDA's rule \nattempts to impose a one-size-fits-all approach to an industry as \ndiverse as its ingredients.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Every deli and salad bar offering, every possible pizza topping \ncombination will soon have to be calculated\n\n[[Page H797]]\n\nand their calorie count displayed on physical menus.\n  This is problematic for two reasons: First, the made-to-order portion \nof the food industry offers endless, constantly changing combinations \nof ingredients. For some sandwich shops and pizzerias, the possible \nvariations are tens of millions. The FDA wants these restaurants to put \non paper all of these variations and their calorie counts and have it \npublicly displayed in the restaurant. It is unrealistic.\n  Second, digital and online ordering are many customers' preferred \nmethods of ordering. Nearly 90 percent of orders in some restaurants \nare placed by an individual never stepping foot into the restaurant. So \ntell me, why does it make sense to force a restaurant to have a \nphysical menu with calorie listings when 90 percent of your customers \naren't ever going to see it? How does it make sense to force a customer \nto navigate millions of combinations to find the nutritional \ninformation that matches their order?\n  This legislation provides flexibility in how these restaurants \nprovide the nutritional information. It makes it easier for customers \nto actually see and understand the information because it is displayed \nwhere the customer actually places the order, including by phone, \nonline, or through mobile apps.\n  By bringing this rule into the 21st century, customers can trust that \nthey are getting more reliable information in an easy-to-access, \nconsumer-friendly way. It also protects small-business owners and their \nemployees from frivolous lawsuits and criminal actions that could be \nhonest, inadvertent human error. Accidentally putting too many pickles \non a sandwich and increasing its calorie count should not be a criminal \noffense.\n  This bill is about trusting people through their elected \nrepresentatives to make their own decisions and pursue their own \ndreams. It is all a part of the choice that we are offering America as \nwe move forward in 2016.\n  Before I close, I want to thank my colleagues and the stakeholders, \nincluding the National Restaurant Association, which has withdrawn its \nprevious opposition to the bill, for their hard work in this bipartisan \neffort. Thank you, everyone. It has been a team effort, and I \nappreciate your support.\n  Finally, I encourage my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this important amendment and ultimately vote ``yes'' for the \nbipartisan, commonsense Nutrition Disclosure Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record this letter from the National \nGrocers Association.\n\n                                      National Grocers Association\n\n\n                                                     Key Vote,\n\n                                                 February 9, 2016.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker of the House, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Kevin McCarthy,\n     Majority Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Democratic Leader, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Steny Hoyer,\n     Democratic Whip, The Capitol,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan, Leader Pelosi, Leader McCarthy, and \n     Representative Hoyer: On behalf of the National Grocers \n     Association (NGA), I am writing to express our support for \n     H.R. 2017, the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act of 2015, \n     which would provide common sense reforms to the Food and Drug \n     Administration's (FDA) final rule for Nutritional Labeling of \n     Standard Menu Items in Restaurants and Similar Retail Food \n     Establishments (FDA-2011-0172). NGA strongly encourages the \n     House to pass this bill with bipartisan support. We commend \n     House Leadership for bringing this bill to the Floor and the \n     champions of the legislation, Congresswomen Cathy McMorris \n     Rodgers (R-WA) and Loretta Sanchez (D-CA).\n       NGA is the national trade association representing the \n     retail and wholesale grocers that comprise the independent \n     channel of the food distribution industry. An independent \n     retailer is a privately owned or controlled food retail \n     company operating a variety of formats. Most independent \n     operators are serviced by wholesale distributors, while \n     others may be partially or fully self-distributing. Some \n     independents are publicly traded, but with controlling shares \n     held by the family and others are employee owned. \n     Independents are the true ``entrepreneurs'' of the grocery \n     industry and dedicated to their customers, associates, and \n     communities. The independent supermarket channel is \n     accountable for close to 1% of the nation's overall economy \n     and is responsible for generating $131 billion in sales, \n     944,000 jobs, $30 billion in wages, and $27 billion in taxes.\n       As part of the nutrition labeling provisions contained in \n     the Affordable Care Act (ACA), the FDA is requiring the \n     disclosure of caloric information for standard menu items in \n     restaurants and retail food establishments. The provision \n     amended the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (FFDCA) to \n     require restaurants and similar retail food establishments \n     that are part of a chain operating 20 or more locations and \n     doing business under the same name to provide nutritional \n     information for standard menu items, including food on \n     display and self-service food. The original intent of the \n     provision contained in the ACA aimed to provide one federal \n     standard for chain restaurants with highly standardized menus \n     and menu boards from regulatory confusion created by a \n     growing list of state and local laws regarding nutrition \n     information disclosures. Unfortunately, throughout the \n     rulemaking process the FDA greatly expanded the scope of the \n     rule, and has now included companies that have highly \n     specialized menus that vary by location, including \n     supermarkets.\n       H.R. 2017 contains important regulatory fixes that would \n     eliminate confusion and uncertainty in implementation, limit \n     burdensome regulatory costs and provide flexibility to \n     community oriented supermarkets, allowing them to tailor \n     their offerings to the neighborhoods and communities they \n     serve. Importantly, H.R. 2017 does not exempt any entities, \n     including supermarkets from the requirements under the law.\n       Under the FDA rule, independent supermarket operators with \n     20 or more locations would be required to provide caloric \n     information throughout the store, including menus, display \n     cases, booklets, pamphlets or fliers, advertising circulars. \n     For independent supermarkets that provide extensive fresh and \n     local options, freshly baked goods, cut fruit, and salad \n     bars, this creates challenges in terms of how to properly \n     display this information. H.R. 2017 provides important \n     flexibility for supermarkets while also ensuring consumers \n     are provided with the information they desire.\n       Additionally, the rule does not provide flexibility for \n     unique, local items that are sold at only one store within a \n     chain. Many independent grocers take pride in providing fresh \n     and local items that reflect the communities in which they \n     operate, often contracting with local businesses in order to \n     provide one or two items to one location. NGA believes that \n     this provides a large disincentive for independent \n     supermarket operators to continue providing localized \n     options. H.R. 2017 provides flexibility to ensure independent \n     supermarkets can continue to provide these local, unique \n     products.\n       As currently constituted, the final menu labeling rule \n     creates extensive legal liability issues for independent \n     supermarket operators. Due to the fact that the menu labeling \n     rule falls under the FFDCA, failure to comply with the menu \n     labeling rule in any way carries potential felony penalties, \n     including the possibility of jail time. Additionally, there \n     is no grace period or warning system in place for first-time \n     offenders who may be in violation of the rule due to \n     inadvertent human error, such as adding an extra slice of ham \n     to a sandwich, additional pepperoni to a pizza, or simply \n     placing an item in the ``wrong'' bin before placing it in the \n     salad bar. H.R. 2017 protects front line employees who make \n     inadvertent mistakes while also providing establishments with \n     90 days to take corrective action prior to any enforcement \n     action. Additionally, businesses are protected from frivolous \n     lawsuits by prohibiting private rights of action.\n       NGA strongly supports H.R. 2017, and urges the House to \n     pass this common sense bill to provide businesses with \n     regulatory relief from this unworkable rule, while continuing \n     to ensure that consumers receive the nutritional information \n     they require from their local independent supermarket. NGA \n     urges all Representatives to vote in favor of H.R. 2017, and \n     will consider this a ``key vote'' for our scorecard for the \n     114th Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n     Greg Ferrara,\n       Senior Vice President, Government Relations and Public \n     Affairs, National Grocers Association.\n\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment \noffered today by Representatives McMorris Rodgers and Cardenas. This \namendment would further undermine consumer confidence in the nutrition \ninformation they receive from restaurants and retail food \nestablishments. One could call it flexibility, which actually the \ncurrent legislation provides; and others, including me, would call it \nadding confusion.\n\n[[Page H798]]\n\n  Under the Federal menu labeling law, restaurants and retail food \nestablishments are supposed to have a reasonable basis for determining \ncalorie and nutrition information for their menu items. This can be \ndone using a nutrient database, such as USDA's National Nutrient \nDatabase, cookbooks, recipes, nutrition fact labels, or FDA's nutrient \nvalues, among others. Again, the FDA is allowing significant \nflexibility, as it is, in how establishments determine this \ninformation. What is most important to the agency is that this \ninformation is accurate and consistent.\n  Some stakeholders have raised concerns about changes to the nutrition \ninformation based on an employee being too heavyhanded with one \ningredient, like pickles, or perhaps not following the recipe \nappropriately. We can all understand that in cooking, this type of \nflexibility is needed. FDA's guidance addresses the question of how \nclosely standard menu items must match the nutrient values, advising \nthat an establishment ``must take reasonable steps to ensure that how \nyou prepare your product . . . and how you serve your product are the \nsame as those used to determine the calorie and nutrient \ndeclarations.''\n  The McMorris Rodgers-Cardenas amendment further undermines the \n``reasonable basis'' standard outlined in H.R. 2017 and in FDA's final \nrule by permitting any type of variation for any reason from the \nnutrient content disclosed to the actual nutrient content in the \nstandard menu item. Under this amendment, a restaurant would be able to \nchange their recipe or how they prepare the food or swap out one \ningredient for another and not have to change the nutrient information \nthey disclose to account for these variations.\n  This amendment would also allow for further inconsistencies from \nrestaurant to restaurant or grocery store to grocery store, as what \nmight be a permissible variation to one restaurant or one grocery store \nmay not be permissible to others, again, potentially creating an uneven \nplaying field among the industry.\n  It is also important to note that this amendment is inconsistent with \nrequirements for food labeling under the Federal Food, Drug, and \nCosmetic Act. This law requires that food labeling be truthful and not \nmisleading. If nutrient content disclosures can vary for any reason to \nany extent, it would undermine such requirement in the Federal Food, \nDrug, and Cosmetic Act, a requirement that the food industry has long \nhad to meet.\n  As we have said all along, for calorie and nutrition information to \nbe valuable to consumers, it must be accurate and it must be \nconsistent. If consumers have no reason to believe that what is \ndisclosed by a restaurant is accurate, then the disclosure of nutrient \ninformation is rendered meaningless.\n  I believe FDA's guidance has provided a great deal of flexibility for \nhow nutrient content should be disclosed, and I know the agency is \ncommitted to working with covered establishments to meet the \nrequirement of providing accurate, consistent nutrition information in \na way that is feasible for the establishment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Illinois has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, just to clarify, we are not \ngetting rid of the ``reasonable basis'' definition, and it does not \nallow for any variation. What it says is, where there is inadvertent \nhuman error, there would not be criminal penalties attached to that.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, let me make a point. The fact has been \nmentioned that people can go online and they can find their information \nin that way. Forty-nine percent of orders are placed from in-store \nmenus. Food establishments can bury anything online. Not everyone has \naccess to that kind of information. All of the studies have determined \nthat you make your choice at the point of purchase.\n  I want to make one other comment because the National Restaurant \nAssociation has been talked about here this morning. Let me just quote \nto you Scott DeFife, executive vice president of the National \nRestaurant Association, who praised the menu labeling law when the two \nof us stood to introduce this legislation 6 years ago. He said why it \nwas a good thing to do and why he praised it and why the National \nRestaurant Association was foursquare for it: ``It sets a clear \nnational standard across the country.''\n  They were opposed to this bill. They have been all along. God only \nknows what happened in the last 24 or 48 hours to have the National \nRestaurant Association, which we stood shoulder to shoulder as we \npassed this unbelievably record-breaking bill in order to allow people \nto know what they are eating, make their own choice, and to know the \ncalorie content of food, standard-sized menus. The variations are not \nthere.\n  So much misinformation is being peddled on this floor today about \nwhat was a bill to protect the American public.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from Washington \nwill be postponed.\n  The Chair understands amendment No. 2 will not be offered.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Schrader\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in House Report 114-421.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       On page 3, line 24, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       Strike page 4, lines 13 through 22.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 611, the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Schrader) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, though I support efforts to clarify rules \nas they apply to consumers and small business, this bill, as currently \nconstructed, creates an inequity in the industry by creating an \nexception for many menu labeling rules for certain establishments, \nparticularly chain pizza shops and other restaurants that could \npotentially serve a majority of their customers via remote ordering.\n  While I have nothing against these businesses, I believe all \nrestaurants should be treated equally. My amendment merely ensures that \nthe rules are applied fairly by removing this exemption from the bill.\n  Under the terms of the bill, most chain restaurants will be required \nto list calories on menus at the point of purchase. However, pizza \nchains and other establishments where most orders could be placed off-\nsite, will gain an exemption from this rule. They will not be required \nto list calories in their brick-and-mortar locations, even when orders \nare placed on-site. This is an inequitable and unfair exemption. While \nthe vast majority of large chain restaurants will be required to list \nthe calories in their physical location, these folks will not.\n  In addition to being unfair to businesses, it is also confusing to \nthe consumers, whom we are actually trying to protect with this current \nbill. They will see calorie information when they place an order at one \nrestaurant but not necessarily at their local pizza shop.\n  Opponents of the FDA rule argue the provision is necessary because \npizza restaurants offer many menu items and will not be able to comply \nwith the rule. This is simply not true. The FDA rule already allows \nsome variation within menu labels and serving parameters. Generally, I \nagree that one size does not fit all when it comes to rulemaking for \nbusinesses, but not in this case.\n\n[[Page H799]]\n\n  The National Restaurant Association has indicated that most of their \nmembers are preparing to comply with the menu labeling rules. By all \nmeans, the FDA should assist these restaurants with proper guidance, \nbut specifying an exemption to one segment of the industry is unfair, \ninequitable, and confusing to the consumer.\n  You might hear opponents of my amendment argue the exemption allows \npizza chains to post calorie information online rather than in their \nphysical locations. For these Members, I have good news. If my \namendment is adopted, these restaurants will still be able to offer \nthis information online. In fact, many restaurants already do so, and \nthose businesses should be commended for their transparency.\n  Mr. Chairman, we don't need to add unfair and confusing exemptions to \nthe difficult menu labeling rule we already have. The FDA has indicated \na willingness to work with all affected to provide guidance and clarity \nto make compliance easier. This is what our businesses want and need.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in assuring fairness for businesses \nand clarity for consumers. Please reject this bill--it is an unfair \nloophole--and vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, I express appreciation to my colleague who \noffers this amendment; yet I rise in opposition because, in fact, this \namendment undermines a key provision of the Common Sense--I will repeat \nthat--the Common Sense Nutrition Disclosure Act, which is a bipartisan \nbill that makes necessary changes to the FDA's menu labeling \nregulations.\n  If, indeed, as has been stated, the FDA is willing to work and be \nflexible, we wouldn't need this legislation. It is because they have \nshown no real flexibility that this legislation has been offered.\n  Currently, FDA's menu labeling rules remain costly, ineffective, and \noverly burdensome for more than 70,000 restaurants. That is no small \nnumber, Mr. Chairman. For places like pizza shops, where the vast \nmajority of orders are online--and, yes, they are providing a service, \nin most cases, online for their customers--they are voluntarily doing \nit and really doing it in a quality way. It is nearly impossible for a \nsingle menu board to be designed in a way that can provide accurate \ncalorie counts for literally millions of combinations.\n  The FDA sadly ignores the realities of a diverse market and the \ntechnological advances, innovation, creativity, et cetera, by applying \nthe same menu standard as a one-size-fits-all, top-down approach, and \nthat is the reality that is out there with the FDA.\n  If the House accepts this amendment which strips the remote ordering \nprovision from the bill, it would greatly harm a bill that seeks to \nprovide an alternative method for thousands of small businesses to \neffectively share nutritional information with consumers.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  The FDA menu requirements simply do not make sense neither for the \nrestaurant nor for consumers.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, however well meaning, \nand support the underlying bipartisan bill that protects small \nbusinesses from overbearing FDA regulations that harm workers, job \ncreators, consumers, and our economy.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Oregon has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Michigan has 2\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chair, I yield 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Schakowsky), the ranking member.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Chair, there were so many falsehoods, really, in \nwhat my colleague across the aisle said. We have evidence in \nCalifornia, the city of New York, and Vermont that absolutely \nrestaurants can comply. It is not about small businesses, about 20 or \nmore establishments with the same name.\n  This idea of 50 percent online, this is not the vast majority of \ntheir information online. It is 50 percent. We already know that 49 \npercent of orders at these establishments are done in person. What \nabout those people who come in? Are they not entitled to the same thing \nthat is in other restaurants?\n  Mr. Chair, I support the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chair, I will respond just briefly to that. It is \ntruly about making this information meaningful. I watch my wife go \nonline on her iPhone to check calories all the time. She does it better \nthan I do. But consumers are moving in that direction.\n  I have walked through various industries, including Domino's, and \nhave seen the amazing technological advances that they have that are \nputting their consumers first and giving them the ability to know this \nin a far more meaningful way than you can do on a menu board. So I \nreject that argument, absolutely, in defense of the consumer as well as \nthe industry.\n  Mr. Chair, again, I appreciate the concern that my colleague \nexpresses here; yet, I still stand in very strong support of giving \nthis opportunity, making sure that FDA is pushed into a flexibility \nthat I don't believe they are willing to go. This is for the consumer \nin the end. This allows advances to move within the market.\n  I think we will find that all concerns are met and addressed very \nwell, but we don't put unnecessary burdens upon businesses, job \nproviders, and, ultimately, on the choice of citizens to have a better \nopportunity to make better choices. And, oh, by the way, we reaffirm in \nour country the desire to give people personal responsibility and \npersonal choice together.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from \nMichigan's discussion. I want to assure him and everyone out there that \nthe online ordering is still allowed under my amendment so that those \npeople who have technology can do so.\n  But for seniors and some of our less-advantaged folks at home, they \ncan go to the store and also get that information, which is not allowed \nunder this current bill, but would be allowed under my amendment.\n  To the argument that there are too many combinations to be accounted \nfor, the FDA does allow for flexibility in listing calories for menu \nitems so they are accessible in different restaurant types. Pizza shops \nin locations like New York and Montgomery County, Maryland, already are \ncomplying with rules very similar to these.\n  Other restaurants have indicated a willingness to comply, including a \nnational chain that sells coffee, doughnuts, and ice cream: Dunkin' \nDonuts, Baskin-Robbins. They serve 15,000 different ways of coffee, \nsandwiches 3,000 different ways, ice cream sundaes 80,000 different \nways. They can comply under my amendment. Why can't everyone else?\n  The NRA itself, the National Restaurant Association, says it is \ncritical that all businesses that have made the strategic decision to \nsell restaurant food play by the same rules.\n  Furthermore, they talk about that such provisions create inconsistent \nand erratic labeling by putting in these exemptions not only among \nrestaurants, but among restaurants, food service operators, grocery \nstores, convenience stores, et cetera.\n  My amendment removes this unfair exemption. Very simple. Government \nshould not be in the business of picking winners and losers in private \nenterprise. The same rules should apply to everybody.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Schrader).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCHRADER. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Oregon will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, proceedings \nwill\n\n[[Page H800]]\n\nnow resume on those amendments printed in House Report 114-421 on which \nfurther proceedings were postponed, in the following order:\n  Amendment No. 1 by Mrs. McMorris Rodgers of Washington.\n  Amendment No. 3 by Mr. Schrader of Oregon.\n  The Chair will reduce to 2 minutes the minimum time for any \nelectronic vote after the first vote in this series.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mrs. McMorris Rodgers\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The unfinished business is the demand for a \nrecorded vote on the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nWashington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers) on which further proceedings were \npostponed and on which the ayes prevailed by voice vote.\n  The Clerk will redesignate the amendment.\n  The Clerk redesignated the amendment.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The plane crashed less than a \nmile from my house. I will never forget what I saw and the grief of the \nfamilies who lost loved ones that fateful night.\n  Over the past 7 years, Flight 3407 families have been relentless in \nthe fight to achieve one level of aviation safety for all airline \ncarriers, from new training standards to guidelines that prevent pilot \nfatigue.\n  On this seventh anniversary, we remember those who died that night \nand reinforce our commitment to ensure the safety measures these \nfamilies have fought so hard to enact will stay in place.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H803-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         POVERTY AND THE BUDGET\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, the Democratic Whip Task Force on Poverty, \nIncome Inequality, and Opportunity was launched to bring to the \nforefront of Congress' attention the everyday challenges of Americans \nliving in poverty.\n  On Tuesday, the President sent us a budget that invests in meeting \nour greatest challenges: creating opportunity for all, an objective \nthat all of us I think are committed to.\n  The budget expands Pell grants to make college more affordable and \nsupports more apprenticeships and skills training so that young people \nand others can make it in America. It doubles investment in clean \nenergy and R to attract more jobs while tackling climate change.\n  The President's budget expands access to quality child care and paid \nleave for working parents and provides children from low-income \nfamilies healthy meals over the summer months when they are out of \nschool, but are still eating, of course. It makes it easier to save for \na retirement and provides a better backstop for when economic \ncircumstances push careers off track.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, it is up to Congress to craft a budget. I hope \nRepublicans will work with us to provide the opportunities necessary to \nescape poverty, as Speaker Ryan says we ought to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairwoman, Barbara Lee, and her members of \nthe task force for undertaking and focusing on this important effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H803-3", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 RECOGNIZING SECRETARY MICHAEL LUMPKIN\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to recognize \nthe accomplishments of Michael Lumpkin, Assistant Secretary of Defense \nfor Special Operations/Low-Intensity Conflict, and congratulate him on \nhis new position as director of the newly established Global Engagement \nCenter at the Department of State.\n  A decorated Navy SEAL, Secretary Lumpkin has quickly distinguished \nhimself at the Pentagon as a senior adviser to the Secretary of Defense \non all matters related to Special Operations Forces.\n  He has also worked to develop special operations forces partnerships \nwith foreign nations to sustain and improve global counter-terrorism \noperations. His engagement on this issue will ensure that Special \nOperations Forces remain an effective component of defense strategy.\n  Secretary Lumpkin has also enhanced efforts to counter narcotics, \nillicit trafficking, and transnational organized crime. He has been \ninstrumental in guiding counter-narcotics and counterinsurgency \noperations successfully in the Republic of Colombia.\n  I know his expertise will be greatly missed at the Department of \nDefense. I look forward to seeing his accomplishments in his new role \nat the Department of State.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H803-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H803]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPPLEMENTAL NUTRITION ASSISTANCE PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose a Republican bill \nthat was introduced yesterday that would let States use drug testing to \ndetermine low-income Americans' eligibility to receive food assistance \nthrough SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program.\n  This is nothing more than an attempt to demonize poor people and has \nno basis in reality.\n  Similar laws in Florida and Georgia were struck down as \nunconstitutional and only waste thousands of taxpayer dollars to \nidentify very few drug users. In fact, those receiving public \nassistance actually test positive at a lower rate than the general \npopulation.\n  Why aren't my Republican colleagues calling for drug testing for \nwealthy CEOs and oil company executives who receive taxpayer subsidies? \nWhy is it that they always pick on poor people? It is a lousy thing to \ndo.\n  SNAP is intended to help people put food on the table when they are \nstruggling to find work, when their current job is not paying enough, \nor simply when they have fallen on hard times.\n  We should be talking about improving the SNAP benefit so that \nfamilies can afford more nutritious food, not creating more insulting \nhoops for vulnerable families to have to jump through.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H803-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H803-H804]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  PAYING TRIBUTE TO RONALD JASON ADAMS\n\n  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1\n\n[[Page H804]]\n\nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HILL.

Mr. Speaker, five police officers in the United \nStates this week have been gunned down: one in North Dakota, one in \nGeorgia, one in Colorado, and two in Maryland. I am going to talk about \nthe two in Maryland.\n  On February 10, on a bitter winter day, two sheriff's deputies were \ncalled to a disturbance at a shopping center in Abingdon, Maryland. As \nthe deputies were attempting to speak with a disruptive individual, he \nheld a gun to 52-year-old Deputy Patrick Dailey's head and fired, \nkilling him.\n  Deputy Mark Logsdon pursued the assassin, but Logsdon was also killed \nby the criminal's gunfire during this chase. Later, the outlaw was shot \nand killed.\n  Dailey was a life member of the Joppa-Magnolia Volunteer Fire Company \nand spent 30 years defending the public as a sheriff's deputy. He was a \nhero to his two now fatherless children.\n  Forty-three-year-old Deputy Mark Logsdon was a 16-year veteran of the \nforce, leaving behind three children and a wife.\n  Both men had been honored for valor during their careers of \nprotecting and serving the community. Patrick and Mark's lives were \ncoldly and maliciously stolen, ripped away from this world and their \nfamilies.\n  These men behind the badge are a special breed, a rare breed. They \nwork selflessly, maintaining and restoring order in our neighborhoods. \nThey are the best of our Nation.

Roger has been a shareholder and a partner in the firm \nDamrell, Nelson, Schrimp, Pallios, Pacher, & Silva.\n  Roger is most known for being very passionate, not only about his \npractice, but in addressing many different areas within our community. \nWithin his practice, he addressed cases before the U.S. Supreme Court, \nU.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, U.S. District Court, and \nthe U.S. Tax Court of Claims. In addition, he has gone before several \nState and local agencies.\n  Roger was also an active leader in many different local, State, and \nnational organizations. Since 1976, he was a member of the elite group \nout of Santa Barbara, California, the Rancheros Visitadores. He was \nappointed in 1996 by Governor Wilson. Roger served a 6-year term on the \nBoard of Governors of the California Community Colleges. He also served \non the Executive Board of the California State Parks Foundation.\n  Ever since joining the Boy Scouts of America in 1948, Roger has been \ndedicated to the organization throughout the years. The Eagle Scout has \nheld a variety of voluntary positions within the group, including \nserving on the National Executive Board.\n  From 2007 to 2015, Roger was named one of the top attorneys in \nNorthern California by the Northern California Super Lawyers Magazine.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing my good \nfriend, Roger Schrimp, who will be missed by many.

Mr. Speaker, I want to tell the story of Texas \nSouthern University. It started out in Houston, Texas, in the early \n1920s to educate then, of course, the colored or Negro population, and \nthey have grown into the 21st century.\n  In the 1940s, they were expanded because a young man by the name of \nHeman Sweatt attempted to attend the University of Texas School of Law \nand he was prohibited, he was prevented. So by a court, the law school \nwas established which is now named Thurgood Marshall.\n  I really rise to say that this school is a Texas asset, and yet the \nState of Texas publicly has underfunded this university. In 2000, I \nhelped settle a desegregation lawsuit of which that school had sued \nbecause it was discriminated against.\n  Sadly, I rise today to ask for another investigation by the \nDepartment of Education, Civil Rights Division, because the State of \nTexas is now again discriminating against the students and faculty of \nTexas Southern University by not funding them equally with other \nmajority-based institutions. It is sad to rise today to say that. But \nin that school, Barbara Jordan graduated, our colleague; Mickey Leland \ngraduated. Of course, Barbara Jordan was a colleague. Many outstanding \nscientists and doctors.\n  Stop discriminating against Texas Southern University. We need to \ninvestigate it again to make this school whole.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H805-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING THE BEACON PLACE COMMUNITY CENTER IN WAUKEGAN\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD.

These programs help children \nsustain their math and reading skills throughout the summer.\n  I had a great time participating in the learning by reading and \npainting with some of these children, and I saw firsthand the benefit \nthat these resources will have in the Waukegan community.\n  Beacon Place is truly a much-needed and inspiring program, which is \nwhy I am honored to be able to recognize them today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H805-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H805]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BLACK HISTORY MONTH\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we have got our Presidential primary coming \nup in Georgia in the first week of March, and everybody is talking \nabout what it means to be an American and where it is we want America \nto go. I love that conversation. I love that it is happening on the \nDemocratic side of the aisle. I love that it is happening on the \nRepublican side of the aisle. I love that it is happening in every \nhousehold in America.\n  What I don't hear as much conversation about--and I wish that I did--\nis about that rule book for how America is supposed to be run, called \nthe United States Constitution. Folks seem to have a firm grasp on it \nwhen they want to be the President of the United States. They lose that \ngrasp when they get to be President of the United States, because they \nwant to serve. They so badly want to serve.\n  What I have here, Mr. Speaker, are a couple of quotes from President \nObama.\n  He says:\n\n       I taught constitutional law for 10 years, and I take the \n     Constitution very seriously. The biggest problems that we are \n     facing right now have to do with George Bush's trying to \n     bring more and more power into the executive branch and not \n     go through Congress at all; and that is what I intend to \n     reverse when I am President of the United States of America.\n\n  Now, that was at a Pennsylvania townhall meeting, Mr. Speaker, when \nthe President was running for office.\n  As a Senator, he could see clearly that, in article I, the House and \nthe Senate were in charge of passing the laws, and that, in article II, \nthe White House was in charge of enforcing the laws. During the 8 years \nthat George Bush was President, time and time again, charges were made \nthat the White House was taking the people's power from article I and \ncarrying it down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House.\n  Again, I quote from President Obama:\n\n       I taught the Constitution for 10 years. I believe in the \n     Constitution, and I will obey the Constitution of the United \n     States. We are not going to use signing statements as a way \n     of doing an end run around Congress.\n\n  That was at a Montana campaign event back in 2008.\n  The President was absolutely right, and Republicans in this \ninstitution were absolutely wrong, during his 8 years in the White \nHouse, for not holding George Bush more accountable to his article II \nresponsibilities and staying out of Congress' article I \nresponsibilities; but it was hard, Mr. Speaker. It was after 9/11.\n  I will forever wonder what America would have looked like but for \nthat fateful day. The President was off, focusing on his agenda. We \nwere not campaigning on 9/11 issues in that election. We were \ncampaigning on domestic issues, on economic issues. The economy was on \nfire, and then everything changed.\n  I would argue that many of my Republican colleagues--you and I were \nnot here at that time, Mr. Speaker--cut President Bush a lot of slack. \nAmerica was in crisis, and the Nation was under attack; and we said: Do \nyou know what? The Constitution does give the President special \nresponsibilities during these times of national crisis, and I am \nwilling to allow him to adopt a little more authority--I am willing to \nbe a little more deferential--to the President during these difficult \ntimes.\n  President Obama saw that as then-Senator Obama, and he said: That is \nwrong. Republicans are not supposed to be Republicans first. \nRepublicans in Congress are supposed to be Congressmen first. \nRepublicans in the Senate are supposed to be Senators first. Our \nobligation first is to our constituents back home, to the United States \nConstitution, not to someone who may or may not hold the same party \ntitle at the White House.\n  As a candidate, the President saw that clearly, but we all know how \nthat transpired, Mr. Speaker.\n  As President, the President has said this:\n\n       We can't wait for an increasingly dysfunctional Congress to \n     do its job. Where they won't act, I will.\n\n  We can't wait for that Constitution, which was specifically designed \nto be slow and painful, because every act that we pass here, Mr. \nSpeaker, takes freedom or power or money from someone in America and \ngives it to someone else. It was designed to be hard; but as President \nObama says: I can't wait. Where Congress won't act, I will.\n  I continue to quote, Mr. Speaker, from a different speech during a \nCabinet meeting in 2014:\n\n       But one of the things that I will be emphasizing in this \n     meeting is the fact that we are not just going to be sitting, \n     waiting for legislation, in order to make sure that we are \n     providing Americans with the kind of help that they need. I \n     have got a pen and I have got a phone. I can use that pen to \n     sign executive orders and take executive actions and \n     administrative actions that move the ball forward.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, one of my great disappointments in this administration \nis that President Obama had an opportunity to lead America in ways that \nno other President could have led. He had an opportunity when he was \nelected, with all of his personal charisma and popularity, to lead \npublic opinion in ways that no other President could. He was not my \nchoice for President, but when America chose him, America chose \nopportunity to do things that we could not have done otherwise.\n  All we are in this Chamber is a reflection of that public opinion \nback home. All we are the voices of our individual districts back \nhome--435 voices representing millions of constituents back home. The \nPresident could have come and changed the minds of those in this \nCongress. He could have come and changed the minds of the people. \nInstead--do you know what?--he said: I have studied the Constitution \nfor 10 years. It is really hard to move Congress. It is really hard to \nmove public opinion. So I am going to use my phone and my pen, and I am \ngoing to do it alone.\n  This isn't just in the White House, Mr. Speaker. This idea that the \npeople's voice in Congress is a nuisance and gets in the way of getting \nthe real business done permeates the entire administration.\n  I quote from EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy:\n\n       But I will tell you that I didn't go to Washington to sit \n     around and wait for congressional action. I have never done \n     that before, and I don't plan to do it in the future.\n\n  Forbid the thought. Forbid the thought you would be on the Federal \nGovernment's payroll, charged with enforcing the laws of the land, and \nyou might sit around and wait for Congress to pass the laws of the \nland. Forbid the thought. If you have got a phone and if you have got a \npen, just go ahead and rewrite those laws of the land, Mr. Speaker. It \nis dangerous when Republicans do that. It is dangerous when Democrats \ndo that. It is dangerous when Independents do that.\n  We have a Constitution as our rule book for a reason, and that is \nthat changing the law should be hard. Taking power from one group and \ngiving it to another should be hard. Taking money from one group and \ngiving it to another should be hard. The power is not ours, Mr. \nSpeaker. The power is the people's. They allow us to administer it for \na short period of time, and there is a long and difficult process to do \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am going to focus on some EPA regulations today. In \nthe past, Presidents have acknowledged how hard it is to get it done, \nbut they have committed to going out there and getting it done. I will \nremind you, Mr. Speaker, that the EPA was created by a Republican \nPresident. There is no one who cares more about clean water and clean \nair in the great State of Georgia than I do. I am a hardcore, Deep \nSouth Republican, Mr. Speaker, and we play outside a lot. Our kids are \noutside a lot. We are drinking a lot of water, and we are playing in a \nlot of grass. We care about a clean environment. So did President \nRichard Nixon when he created the EPA.\n  He said this:\n\n       The reorganizations which I am proposing afford both the \n     Congress and the executive branch an opportunity to \n     reevaluate the adequacy of existing programs involved in \n     these consolidations.\n\n[[Page H807]]\n\n       I look forward to working with the Congress in this task. \n     Congress, the administration, and the public all share a \n     profound commitment to the rescue of our natural \n     environment and in the preservation of the Earth as a \n     place both habitable by and hospitable to man. With its \n     acceptance of these reorganization plans, the Congress \n     will help us fulfill that commitment.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, President Nixon had a vision of what he wanted to do for \nenvironmental protection in America.\n  He said this is a three-part vision: it is going to involve the \nexecutive branch; it is going to involve the legislative branch; it is \ngoing to involve the American people. I am going to take this idea out, \nand I am going to sell it. We are going to get it passed into law \nbecause I am going to make the American people believe it. We all want \nthe same things: we want an environment that is hospitable to and \nhabitable by man; we want an environment that serves us today and our \nkids and grandkids tomorrow. He went out there, and he sold America on \nthis, and we did it together. By article I, Congress passed it, and the \nPresident signed it into law.\n  With the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, Mr. Speaker, you will \nremember it was a Democrat-controlled Congress and Republican George H. \nW. Bush in the White House.\n  George H.W. Bush said this:\n\n       Upon signing the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990, today, I \n     am signing S. 1630, a bill to amend the Clean Air Act, and I \n     take great pleasure in signing S. 1630 as a demonstration to \n     the American people of my determination that each and every \n     American shall breathe clean air. The passage of this bill is \n     an indication that the Congress shares my commitment to a \n     strong Clean Air Act, to a clean environment, and to the \n     achievement of the goals I originally set forth.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, if you will recall, at the time of the Clean Air Act of \n1990, I was in college. It was a battle in Washington, D.C. It was a \nbattle. Again, the Democrats were controlling all of Congress, and the \nRepublicans were in the White House, trying to decide what our \nobligations were as individuals, what businesses' obligations were, and \nwhat government's obligations would be. It was hard and it was \nimportant.\n  Mr. Speaker, you will remember that was acid rain. That was when they \npanned the camera around to the monuments throughout the city and \nshowed where the facial features were being eroded by acid rain.\n  We said what can we do together to make a difference? It was not \nsomeone with a phone and a pen. It became a national movement. It was \nwhat all laws are supposed to be, Mr. Speaker, which is where we come \ntogether and we talk about our differences; we take steps forward where \nwe can; we take time to sort out the steps we can't take today but hope \nto take tomorrow.\n  In signing that legislation, the President said: This represents my \nvision. This represents my goals. This represents my commitment to \nclean air. Because the people's Representatives in Congress passed it, \nit represents all of the American people as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the way it is supposed to be. It is hard and it \nis slow, and it has been a long time since we have seen that function \neffectively; but let me tell you what the impact of that is.\n  The Founding Fathers were really smart folks, and I am never willing \nto underestimate the wisdom that is in those few founding pages. We \nhave article I in the legislative branch. We have article II in the \nexecutive branch. We have article III in the judicial branch. In these \ndays, where article I and article II are not functioning as they \nshould, article III is wielding more than its fair share of the power, \nand I will tell you that is wrong. I will tell you that is wrong.\n  Decisions about what is the right law of the land are made one of \nthree ways, Mr. Speaker. They get made because the President of the \nUnited States, who was popularly elected, signs a bill into law. They \nget made because the United States Congress, which was popularly \nelected, overrides a veto and implements a new law; or they get made \nbecause nine men and women who are in black robes and are across the \nstreet at the Supreme Court, who have never been elected, sit around \nand think deeply about it and pronounce what the law of the land will \nbe.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I have great respect for the Supreme Court, and I \nbelieve it is critical--again, in the wisdom of our Founding Fathers--\nto have balanced power in that way; but as a citizen, as just a guy \nfrom the great State of Georgia--just one of 300 million--when I have \nto choose who writes the law--the President I have a chance to vote \nfor, the Congress I have a chance to vote for, or the Supreme Court, \nwhich is appointed for life and is never accountable to anyone--I feel \na little bit safer when it is one of the folks who has to be up for \nreelection every once in a while.\n  It is bad for America when the President--with a pen and a phone--\ngoes and implements those things, when we as the legislative branch \ndon't identify ourselves as article I but identify ourselves as \nRepublicans and Democrats--who are divided along those lines--and allow \nthe courts to sort it out.\n  Let me just give you an example, Mr. Speaker: WOTUS, waters of the \nU.S. I had never heard the term ``WOTUS'' until I showed up in this \nChamber, Mr. Speaker. Waters of the United States is an initiative from \nthe President that is going to reregulate who controls and keeps tabs \non clean water in America.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Currently, if it is navigable water, water that you can sail your \nboat on, then it is governed by the Federal Government. If it is any \nother water, it is governed by State government.\n  The little creek in the backyard at the park down the road from my \nhouse, that is governed by the great State of Georgia, and they do a \ngreat job with it. It empties out into the Chatahoochee River, which is \nnavigable, which is regulated by the Federal Government. It goes \nthrough some National Park land, national recreation area, but it \nbegins--where so much of an opportunity to impact pollution and make a \ndifference in water quality--at the headwaters, which is regulated by \nState governments.\n  Well, Jim Oberstar, a Representative in this Chamber back in 2010, \nintroduced a bill that said, since the Federal Government is so \neffective at everything that they do, let's entrust all clean water \ndecisions to the Federal Government instead of to the localities that \nhave been doing it so well for so long.\n  Well, he introduced a bill in Congress, Mr. Speaker, and that is the \nway it is supposed to start. This was H.R. 5088. He introduced a bill \nto expand the definition of water so that the Federal Government could \nregulate everything.\n  Second step, Mr. Speaker, is to have that bill considered. Well, the \nbill never was considered in this Chamber. It could not gather enough \nsupport in this Chamber to even be considered in the committee, much \nless the floor of this House.\n  Well, you have seen it, Mr. Speaker:\n  ``Yes, I'm only a bill, And I'm sitting here on Capitol Hill. Well, \nit's a long, long journey to the Capital City. It's a long, long wait \nwhile I'm sitting in committee . . .''\n  That is ``Schoolhouse Rock,'' a tale of how a bill becomes a law. If \nyou can't get consideration, it expires.\n  Well, the President wanted this regulation, and he couldn't get the \nsupport in Congress to pass it. He didn't want to go out and sell it to \nthe American people, so he went to the Federal Register, Mr. Speaker. \nMost folks don't even know the Federal Register exists. It comes out \nevery day. It is a list of all the regulations that the administration \nis proposing, and it is thick. Every day, it is thick. It is new \nrestrictions on private life in America.\n  In April 2014, the President went out and published this rule and \nsaid: This is what I am going to do. Congress hasn't authorized it. It \nis a dramatic departure from the way America has been governed for the \nlast 200 years, but I have a pen and phone, and I am just going to do \nit.\n  Mr. Speaker, if he wanted to do it, he should have come and sold \nCongress. If he wanted to do it, he should have gone and sold the \nAmerican people, but he didn't. He published it in an obscure \npublication, and, a year later, he announced new rules that would \ngovern all activity affecting water in the United States of America. \nNot one congressional bill had passed authorizing such an action.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the opposite had happened. Congress saw what \nwas going on. Congress saw that the President was way outside of his \nauthority. Congress saw that he was way outside of the mandate given to \nhim by the people, and Congress passed legislation to block those \nrules.\n\n[[Page H808]]\n\n  Now, hear that, Mr. Speaker. The President had legislation introduced \nto implement the rules. It never even got out of committee because \nfolks opposed it. Then he went around Congress, tried to do it on his \nown. Congress passed a new measure that said: Mr. President, that is \nwrong. Don't do it.\n  So Congress--it is not that we failed to act--we acted affirmatively \nand said: Mr. President, that is not okay.\n  It passed the House, Mr. Speaker. It passed the Senate. It went to \nthe President's desk, where he vetoed it. Understand that.\n  The President is outside of his constitutional role. Congress calls \nhim on it, passes it by both Houses--which is rare, these days, as you \nknow. The President, armed with the knowledge that the American people \nare against him on this issue, vetoes that measure. It took him exactly \n24 hours to think through that, Mr. Speaker. Hear that.\n  He knew Congress rejected the measure because he couldn't get it out \nof committee. He implemented it by going around Congress, doing it \nentirely through the administrative branch, which we all know from \nConstitution 101 is not the way laws get made.\n  Congress affirmatively passes a law that says: You cannot do that, \nMr. President; that is outside of your bounds. It takes him 24 hours to \nthink about that before he stamps it with a veto stamp and sends it \naway.\n  So what do you do, Mr. Speaker? What do you do? What do you do when \nyou represent 300 million Americans, you have a democratic process here \non the floor of the House, everybody's voice is heard, you duly pass \nmeasures, and the President says: No, I am not concerned about that?\n  You go to court. You go to court. Mr. Speaker, I hate going to court. \nI hate it.\n  We are the Congress of the United States. We are article I for a \nreason. This is where the power was supposed to reside, distributed \namong all of us across this country.\n  I hate going to the court to solve problems between the White House \nand the President. We ought to be able to solve those on our own, but \nwe haven't been able to. We haven't been able to start that dialogue. \nSo what do we do? We go to the court.\n  Here is what the court says about this waters of the U.S. rule. I am \nquoting from their opinion:\n  ``Even so, a review of what has been made available reveals a process \nthat is inexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid of a reasoned process.''\n  They are not talking about what happened in Congress, Mr. Speaker. We \ndid everything by the book. The court is talking about what happened at \nthe White House and at the EPA, this administrative process that tried \nto craft a brand-new regulatory regime to reregulate all water in the \nUnited States of America: our review ``reveals a process that is \ninexplicable, arbitrary, and devoid of a reasoned process.''\n  Quoting from another section of the decision, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       It appears likely that the EPA has violated its \n     congressional grant of authority in its promulgation of the \n     rule at issue, and it appears likely the EPA failed to comply \n     with the EPA requirements when promulgating the rule.\n\n  That is the requirement that we have some public input on the rule. \nSo not only did we violate our authority to begin with, but even if the \nEPA had had authority, the court says it should have invited more \npublic input, which it did not.\n  Reading, finally, from that decision, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       A far broader segment of the public would benefit from the \n     preliminary injunction because it would ensure that Federal \n     agencies do not extend their power beyond the express \n     delegation from Congress.\n\n  The court said: No, Mr. President, no. You do not have this \nauthority. Congress makes the law. The answer is ``no.''\n\n  So just a recap, Mr. Speaker: a bill was brought in this Congress to \nimplement these rules. It never made it out of committee because folks \ndidn't like it. The President did it unilaterally, and Congress \nresponded by passing a bill out of both Chambers and sending it to the \nPresident's desk, saying: Don't do that; that is wrong.\n  The President vetoes it.\n  America sues, and the court says: You can't do that; that is wrong. \nYou are exceeding your grant of authority under the law.\n  You would think that after all of that, Mr. Speaker, the White House \nmight say: Well, I don't know how we got it wrong, but we got it wrong. \nLet's go back to the drawing board.\n  Not so. The White House continues to march on in this direction.\n  Mr. Speaker, it sounds like inside baseball. It sounds like this is \njust that standard quibbling--Republicans-Democrats-Washington, D.C., \ndysfunction. That is not so. We are talking about water. We are talking \nabout every spigot in America, Mr. Speaker.\n  Let me tell you what folks have said in Georgia. This is our attorney \ngeneral, Sam Olens. He is commenting after the court has prevented the \nimplementation of these waters of the U.S. rules. He says:\n\n       I am pleased the Sixth Circuit has granted a nationwide \n     stay on the burdensome waters of the United States rule. \n     Under this illegal rule, Georgia families, farmers, and \n     businesses would be subject to excessive and intrusive \n     Federal regulation. As the Federal Government continues to \n     issue massive and unconstitutional executive directives at an \n     alarming rate, I remain steadfast in my commitment to protect \n     and defend the interest of Georgians.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't know how it is in your home State. In my home \nState, the attorney general is elected by the people. He is not named \nby the Governor. This is the popularly elected representative for \nconstitutional issues in the State of Georgia talking about Washington, \nD.C., and the White House, talking about illegal rules, \nunconstitutional executive directions coming out at an alarming rate.\n  Again, these are regulations that have traditionally been controlled \nat the local level. I promise you--I promise you, Mr. Speaker--there is \nnot a man or woman in this city who cares more about the streams \noutside of my home than I do; there is not a man or woman in this city \nwho cares more about the water in my district than I do; and there is \nnot a man or woman in this city that knows better about how to protect \nthat order than the men and women in local government back home.\n  This is from the Association County Commissioners in Georgia, Mr. \nSpeaker:\n\n       We feel that this rule has great potential to increase \n     counties' risk of litigation and unnecessary delays and \n     confusion and cause disincentive for adequately constructed \n     and maintained drainage ditches.\n\n  This is where it has come, Mr. Speaker. In the massive power grab \nthat is the waters of the U.S. rule, trying to grab everything and \ncarry it to Washington, D.C., I have county commissioners writing to \nsay this goes even to the drainage ditches in our area, which we are in \ncharge of keeping clean, which we are in charge of water quality. We \nare involved in sediment control.\n  It will also divert critical county resources--those being taxpayer \nresources--from other critical local government services and federally \nmandated Clean Water Act responsibilities at a time when our budgets \nare already under great duress. Hear that. There are already Federal \nmandates on counties for a variety of other issues. They are handling \nit all, even in these tough budget times, and they are saying not only \nare these new regulations going to drain taxpayer resources that would \nhave been going to clean water, but the litigation is going to drain \nthem because we are going to sue and we are not going to allow you to \ndo these unconstitutional things.\n  This is the Georgia Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Speaker:\n\n       As such, the chamber opposes recent attempts by the Obama \n     administration to circumvent the role of Congress in the \n     regulation and management of the Nation's water resources, as \n     well as that of the States. In addition, the chamber believes \n     the proposed rules would violate private property rights and \n     subject business to yet another layer of uncertainty.\n\n  More lawsuits, Mr. Speaker. This is not an issue for courts to solve.\n  The President proposed it. Congress rejected it. Then the President \ntried to implement it, and Congress rejected that, too. Then the \nPresident vetoed that. Now the courts have rejected it, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you have got a good idea, get out there and sell it. \nIf you want to change the law of the land, get out there and persuade \nfolks it is a good idea.\n\n[[Page H809]]\n\n  Look at what the President did on the Affordable Care Act, Mr. \nSpeaker. There is not a man or a woman in America today who believes \nthere should be lifetime caps on insurance policies. They believe, if \nyou are facing the greatest crisis in your life, your insurance company \nought to be there for you. President Obama won on that issue. I agree \nwith him on that issue. That law is never going to change, that segment \nof it.\n  President Obama said, you know, just because you have had cancer \ndoesn't mean you shouldn't ever be able to buy an insurance policy \nagain; just because you were born with a preexisting condition doesn't \nmean you should never be able to buy an insurance policy again.\n  The President was right. Republicans in Congress passed that for \nfederally regulated plans back in 1996. Some States didn't follow suit. \nThat is now the law of the land. The President went out and led on some \nissues and changed America's minds on some issues.\n  He did not do that here. He did it with his pen and his phone. It is \nunconstitutional, and the courts are telling him as much.\n  This is right from my home district, Mr. Speaker. Gwinnett County is \nthe biggest county in the district. I only represent two counties. So \nmany folks live in these two counties, Mr. Speaker.\n\n       On behalf of the Gwinnett County Board of Commissioners and \n     the residents of Gwinnett County, I am writing to encourage \n     continued action by the United States Congress to delay and \n     defeat the proposed EPA rule regarding the definition of \n     waters of the United States.\n\n  The county commissioners, who have enough work to do, Mr. Speaker, \nare taking up for Congress, saying this is way outside of the bounds of \nwhat lawmakers ought to be doing from the White House. It ought to be \nhappening in article I. Do what you can.\n  Quoting from that same county commissioner, Mr. Speaker, the \nchairwoman of our county in Gwinnett:\n\n       This would have the potential to increase costs and cause \n     delays in permitting an operation of needed public works \n     projects. In Gwinnett County, 2,700 miles of roads and 684 \n     miles of ditches within the highway right-of-way would be \n     impacted by this proposed definition if it is adopted, as \n     would 1,400 miles of streams and 1,400 miles of drainage \n     ditches.\n\n  Now hear that, Mr. Speaker. I guess I kind of glossed over that. I \ncalled this the largest power grab that we have seen in water rights in \nAmerican history, but I haven't really tried to enumerate it.\n  One county in the State of Georgia--we have got a lot of counties, \nMr. Speaker. I believe we have the second most counties in the United \nStates of America. So our counties are not that big.\n  In one county, there are 2,700 miles of roads going under Federal \nregulation, 684 miles of ditches in those right-of-ways going under \nFederal regulation, 1,400 miles of streams going under new Federal \nregulation, and 1,400 miles of additional drainage ditches going under \nFederal regulation in one county--one county.\n  To add insult to injury, Mr. Speaker, the Government Accountability \nOffice, the auditor of the United States Government, had this to say in \nDecember of last year:\n  ``The Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, violated publicity or \npropaganda and anti-lobbying provisions contained in appropriations \nacts with its use of certain social media platforms in association with \nits `Waters of the United States,' WOTUS, rulemaking . . .''\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the EPA violated propaganda and antilobbying provisions. \nHear that. I am begging the administration to go out there and sell the \nAmerican people before they act, as is supposed to be done.\n  The General Accountability Office is chastising the administration \nbecause, instead of going out and selling it, they are illegally \nlobbying for it after the fact. We couldn't persuade anybody about it \nahead of time. We didn't bother to involve folks ahead of time. We are \ngoing to go out after the fact illegally and try to change everybody's \nmind.\n  Quoting again from that same report:\n  ``The EPA engaged in covert propaganda when the agency did not \nidentify EPA's role as the creator of the Thunderclap message to the \ntarget audience.''\n  This is one particular campaign that the General Accountability \nOffice is looking at.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got to demand better. President Obama, when he \nwas Senator Obama, was demanding better of the Bush administration. He \nwas right to do so.\n  I am demanding better of the Obama administration. This Congress is \ndemanding better. We are right to do so. Whoever the next President is, \nhim or her, we have to ask more of them.\n  The Constitution was crafted with three branches of government for a \nreason, one branch to create the laws--that is us--one branch to \nenforce the laws--that is the President--and one branch to adjudicate \nthe differences.\n  I will come back to the courts, Mr. Speaker. I have been talking \nabout waters of the U.S. That is just one of dozens of examples of \nadministration overreach.\n  This headline, Mr. Speaker: Supreme Court Deals Blow to Obama's \nEffort to Regulate Coal Emissions. Coal emissions. This is the war on \ncoal that you hear so much about.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President has not come to Congress to sell Congress \non doing away with our number one natural energy resource. The \nPresident has not gone to the American people to sell the American \npeople on doing away with the number one energy resource in America.\n  In fact, if you go into coal country, Mr. Speaker, every single \nDemocrat at the Federal level has been defeated not because they \nweren't doing a good job--they may well have been--but because the \nPresident was declaring a war on coal.\n  Hardworking Americans who work in the coal industry said: Why are you \npicking on me? If you want clean air, let's pass clean air regulations. \nWhy are you declaring war on coal? This ends up in the Supreme Court.\n  Former EPA Assistant Administrator Jeff Holmstead says this: It is \nthe first time the Supreme Court has actually stayed a regulation.\n  This is happening right now. It is happening right now. Mr. Speaker, \nI have got it on the front page of yesterday's National Journal, one of \nthose Washington, D.C., dailies that tracks Federal opportunities and \nregulations. The headline reads: ``Obama's Second-Term Agenda Hits a \nRoadblock: the Supreme Court.''\n  Think about that, Mr. Speaker. The headline, the generally accepted \nconventional wisdom, is the President's agenda hits a roadblock because \nthe Supreme Court says no.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President's agenda hit a roadblock when he decided \nnot to sell it to Congress, not to sell it to his constituents, but to \ngo around us both and do it through administrative action. It is the \nfirst time in American history that the Supreme Court has stayed a \nregulation, so egregious is this action.\n  I go on from The New York Times, Mr. Speaker, just this week: ``But \nthe Supreme Court's willingness to issue a stay while the case proceeds \nwas an early hint that the program could face a skeptical reception \nfrom the justices.''\n  With the Court's four liberal members dissenting, a 5-4 decision was \nunprecedented. ``The Supreme Court had never before granted a request \nto halt a regulation before review by a federal appeals court.''\n  `` `It's a stunning development,' Jody Freeman, a Harvard law \nprofessor and former environmental legal counsel to the Obama \nadministration, said in an email.''\n  A stunning development. What is stunning, Mr. Speaker, is around and \naround and around the President goes, around this body, Republicans and \nDemocrats.\n  It is not a partisan issue. This is a constitutional issue of whether \nor not we should be concerned why it is that the courts are solving the \nissues.\n  Here is a quote from Laurence Tribe, Harvard law professor. In fact, \nhe was President Obama's constitutional law professor when the \nPresident was in law school.\n  Professor Tribe says this: ``To justify the Clean Power Plan''--that \nis this power plan that is implementing the coal regulations that the \nSupreme Court just put a stay on this week--``the EPA has brazenly \nrewritten the\n\n[[Page H810]]\n\nhistory of an obscure section of the 1970 Clean Air Act . . . \nFrustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the \nConstitution overboard to rescue this lawless EPA proposal. . . .''\n  Mr. Speaker, we are supposed to disagree on things. You don't have to \ngo far outside of my congressional district. Hank Johnson represents \nthe south side of the county just beyond me, John Lewis just beyond \nthat.\n  We disagree on all sorts of things. I admire them. I respect them. We \nwork together on issues. It is not surprising that we disagree.\n  What is surprising and, in fact, alarming is that the American \npeople's thirst for results has become such that Presidents think they \ncan just skip the process, that the ends are going to justify the \nmeans.\n  President Obama's law school professor, an undisputed congressional \nscholar, not a conservative by any stretch of the imagination: \n``Frustration with congressional inaction cannot justify throwing the \nConstitution overboard to rescue this lawless EPA proposal. . . .''\n  I need folks to understand, Mr. Speaker, that this is not Republican-\nDemocrat. This is article I, article II. We talked about waters of the \nU.S. We talked about the war on coal. What about Guantanamo Bay, Mr. \nSpeaker? What about the detention facility in Guantanamo Bay?\n  U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch in November of last year--this is \nnot old news; this is right now--said: ``With respect to individuals \nbeing transferred to the United States, the law currently does not \nallow for that. . . . ''\n  The Attorney General of the United States, President Obama's Attorney \nGeneral, the chief law enforcement officer of the land second only to \nthe President, says the law will not allow you to transfer these \nindividuals to the United States.\n  The Secretary of Defense, Ash Carter, just last month: ``There are \npeople in Gitmo who are so dangerous we cannot transfer them to the \ncustody of another government no matter how much we trust that \ngovernment. . . . We need to find another place [and] it would have to \nbe in the United States. So I've made a proposal for the president, and \nhe has indicated that he's going to submit that to Congress.''\n  Hear that. The Secretary of Defense, Mr. Speaker, says the guys in \nGuantanamo are so dangerous, we cannot trust any other government on \nthe planet with them. And so, if we are to close Guantanamo, as the \nPresident has desired for 8 years, we must bring those folks back to \nthe U.S. It is the only way.\n  He's going to have to submit that proposal to Congress, the Secretary \nof Defense says. Why is that? Because it's against the law to establish \nanother detention facility, so, therefore, to get the support of \nCongress.\n  It is against the law. So we have got the Secretary of Defense saying \nthese guys are really dangerous, which would question why we want to \nbring them to the United States to begin with.\n  But you can't transfer them here because it is against the law. We \nhave Loretta Lynch, Attorney General, saying you can't bring them here \nbecause it is against the law.\n  But I challenge anyone in this Chamber to do a news search, a Yahoo! \nsearch, Google search, however it is you get your news, and look in the \nlast 14 days and see if you have seen another statement from the \nPresident saying he is going to bring those folks here.\n  There is no proposal on Capitol Hill to do that. There is no effort \nfrom the White House on Capitol Hill to get that done. In fact, the \nopposite is true. Time after time after time this body, the Senate--the \nPresident has signed it into law--says that you cannot bring these \nfolks back to America, that they are too dangerous. The Secretary of \nDefense agrees. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch agrees. Yet, we go \ndown this road again.\n  Visa waiver reform, Mr. Speaker, I was about to dismiss. Yet another \nissue. We passed a bill that said: Listen, if you have been traveling \nto some of these countries in the Middle East where terrorism is \nrunning rampant today, you are not going to get a free pass into \nAmerica. We are going to want to look at your background before we tell \nyou to come on in.\n  Now, that seems fair, Mr. Speaker, if you are from one of these \ncountries and you have been traveling through these countries where \nterrorism is running rampant, where there is case after case after case \nof terrorists leaving those countries and performing deadly acts around \nthe globe, before we just let you in, which is what the Visa Waiver \nProgram is.\n  It says: Come on in. We are not going to do a background check on \nyou. If you are from England, you are from France, you are from \nGermany, we trust you. Come right on in.\n  We say: If you have been traveling to sites where the terrorist \ntraining camps are, we are going to want to give you a little further \nscrutiny.\n  Congress passed this. The House passed it. The Senate passed it. The \nPresident signed it into law. And then he turned around the very next \nday and said: Well, but I am not going to enforce that because I \npromised the Iranians in my nuclear deal that I wouldn't enforce those \nkinds of rules against Iranians.\n  Well, you can't pick and choose. Veto the bill if you don't like the \nbill. Sign the bill if you do like the bill. You can't pick and choose.\n  I quote from Senator Ron Johnson. He is the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee on the Senate side.\n  He says: ``Congress has every right to expect full compliance with \nthe new provisions.''\n  As the lead sponsor of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and \nTerrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015, I can attest that Congress \nconsidered and rejected expanding the waiver authority in the way the \nPresident proposes because these groups of travelers would be hard to \nverify and any waivers granted would be easy to exploit.\n  This isn't 8 years ago. This isn't 5 years ago. This isn't 3 years \nago. This is happening right now. The President signed language into \nlaw in December, signed language into law in November, in October, in \nSeptember, signed language into law last year and said that this is the \nway it is going to be and has shown up this year and said: Oh, well, I \ndidn't mean it. I am going to do it differently.\n  You have the lead Senate sponsor, the chairman of the Homeland \nSecurity and Governmental Affairs Committee, saying: No. We considered \nthat. We specifically didn't give you that waiver authority. Don't go \ndown that road.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have a chart up here. You can't see it. It says 9-0. \nIt is another Supreme Court decision against the administration, \nsaying: You have gone outside of your congressionally delegated \nauthority. You can't do that.\n  You see a lot of 5-4 decisions out of the Supreme Court, Mr. Speaker. \nYou rarely see a 9-0 decision. These are Justices appointed by \nPresidents of all political stripes, including Justices appointed by \nPresident Obama.\n  They looked at what the President did in the Noel Canning case where \nhe declared that Congress was in recess so that he could put people in \nexecutive positions without having to have Congress' approval.\n  And they said: Nonsense. Nonsense. You can't do that. It is \noutrageous. The Supreme Court rejected that 9-0.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't pick on this issue because it is an example of \ngood news. I pick on it because it is an example of bad news. The \ncourts said the President is overreaching and seizing congressional \npower illegitimately, unconstitutional actions.\n  But when I go to Democrats in the Senate during the time period this \nwas going on, Mr. Speaker, I get this.\n  Senator Tom Harkin from Iowa: ``By appointing these nominees, \nPresident Obama has acted responsibly in order to ensure that workers \nand businesses across this country who rely on the stable functioning \nof this important agency would not be caught in the crossfire of the \nRepublicans' misguided ideological battle.''\n  He has a good reason. He has a good reason for defending the \nPresident. Partisan politics have created gridlock on Capitol Hill, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n\n       So I support the President ignoring the Constitution, \n     seizing authority that is granted only to the Senate, and \n     doing what he wants to do with it.\n\n  This is a United States Senator choosing to be a Democrat first and \ndefending article I second.\n  I am not picking on Senator Harkin. That happens all the time in this \nplace, Mr. Speaker.\n\n[[Page H811]]\n\n  When did that happen? When did it become more important to defend \nyour President than to defend the Constitution? When did it become more \nimportant to be a good Republican than to be a good Congressman? I \nargue we can still turn the tide on that, Mr. Speaker.\n  Representative George Miller from California, ranking member of the \nEducation and the Workforce Committee, which had jurisdiction over \nthese issues in the House, said this: ``President Obama's recess \nappointments will guarantee both employers and employees will have a \nplace to go to have their rights under the law protected and \nenforced.''\n  Well, that would be true except that they were unconstitutionally \nappointed, and, thus, all of the decisions they rendered are now moot. \nNo one is defending article I. Folks are defending their President \ninstead.\n  Senator Harry Reid: ``Since President Obama took office, Senate \nRepublicans have done everything possible to deny qualified nominees \nfrom receiving a fair up-or-down vote. President Obama did the right \nthing when he made these appointments on behalf of American workers.''\n  Mr. Speaker, at 9-0, the Supreme Court said: No. You did not do the \nright thing, Mr. President. In fact, you did exactly the wrong thing. \nIn fact, it is unconstitutional what you did. You do not have the power \nto act in this way. And Democrat after Democrat after Democrat is \ndefending him.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, if I put up these same charts from the Bush \nadministration, I would have Democrats saying the Bush administration \noverstepped its bounds, and Republican after Republican after \nRepublican would be defending them.\n  It has got to stop. It may be too late for this administration, Mr. \nSpeaker. The lines in the sand may have already been dug so deep that \nwe won't be able to cross them, but here in this Presidential primary \nseason we have got to ask of our Presidential candidates: What are you \nfirst? Are you your own leader first? Are you a Republican or Democrat \nfirst? Or, are you the leader of the free world under the restrictions \nof article II first?\n  Are you going to use your pen and your phone? Are you just going to \ngo out there and get it done by yourself? Or, are you going to go sell \nyour boss on the idea--your boss, being 300 million Americans--and then \nare we going to bring ourselves together as a Nation to do these things \none by one?\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got to stop defending or criticizing actions \nbased on which party is involved in it. There is one rule book for this \ncountry. It is not the policy position of the Republican National \nCommittee. It is not the policy position of the Democratic National \nCommittee. The one rule book in this country is the United States \nConstitution, which says Congress writes the law and the President \nenforces it.\n  We have got to expect more of our Presidents--not about the results \nthat they get, but about the leadership they provide. Not the \nleadership to go around the law, but the leadership to change people's \nminds and then change the law.\n  We have got so much opportunity, Mr. Speaker. We have so much \nopportunity. The men and women that I have gotten to know in this \nChamber would rather lose their seat tomorrow--who cares about the \nelection--and they want to make a difference for the country. Don't \ntell me partisan gridlock has rendered self-governance impossible.\n  Gridlock is the natural state of the constitutional government that \nour Founding Fathers created. We have to work with it, not around it, \nand we have to work with the American people, changing hearts and \nminds, not going around the American people and having to rely on the \nSupreme Court to fix those mistakes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H811-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H811]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nPROVIDING FOR A CONDITIONAL ADJOURNMENT OR RECESS OF THE SENATE AND AN \n              ADJOURNMENT OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \nprivileged concurrent resolution (S.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. \nGraves) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week, the \nPresident submitted a budget request to the Congress. That budget \nrequest increases spending by approximately $2.5 trillion over the next \n10 years. It raises taxes by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years. And \nI will say that again. It increases spending by $2.5 trillion and \nraises taxes by $3.4 trillion over the next 10 years.\n  This budget, like every other budget that has been submitted by this \nWhite House, does not ever come into balance. It never comes into \nbalance. It stays in the red. In fact, under this budget, we will see a \n13 percent structural shortfall in funding. The deficit would increase \nthis fiscal year to $616 billion. That is up from approximately $438 \nbillion last year. Either number is unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, with the trajectory that we are on, by 2022, just the \ninterest on the debt--let me be clear: just the interest, not the \nprincipal--is going to result in us spending more money on paying that \ninterest payment than we will spend on all of our defense spending in a \nyear.\n  I will say that again. We will spend more money just paying the \ninterest payment on the debt--not dropping the principal--than we will \nspend on our entire defense budget in the year by 2022, with the \ntrajectory that we are on, increasing this Nation's debt.\n  The debt is going to be more than double what it was at the time this \nPresident took office. It is going to more than double by the time he \nleaves office. It currently exceeds $18 trillion. Yes, $18 trillion is \nour debt today. To break that down, that is approximately $155,000 per \ntaxpayer. This isn't Monopoly money. These are real repercussions.\n  Earlier this week, in this Chamber, I was able to host a seventh-\ngrade class\n\n[[Page H812]]\n\nfrom LSU University Lab School. These are the folks that are going to \npay for it. It is that generation of these seventh-graders and their \nchildren and grandchildren and great children.\n  Mr. Speaker, at some point, this debt is going to be due. The bill is \ngoing to have to be paid. You can see that we are going off this cliff \nof spending to where our interest payments in a short 6 years are \nprojected to exceed all that we are spending in our defense budget in a \nsingle year. This budget adds $6 trillion in debt over the next 10 \nyears.\n  I would like to break it down a little bit in terms of what some of \nthese tax increases are and what the implications are.\n  The President has taken a lot of credit over the past few years over \njob growth. He has talked a lot about these increases in jobs that have \noccurred under his administration.\n  When you actually look at the numbers, where we have actually had job \ngrowth is in the energy sector. It is the one place where we have seen \nthis extraordinary job growth over the last several years.\n  However, just over the last year, we have lost approximately 10,000 \njobs in the energy industry in Louisiana. By some estimates, that is 20 \npercent of our oil and gas workforce. That is 10,000 jobs in the last \nyear tied back to our energy sector.\n  There was a study that just came out that said, at current prices, \noil and gas producers in the United States and Canada are losing \napproximately $350 million every single day.\n  So, I am going to put this in perspective. We have lost 10,000 jobs \nin Louisiana alone. We are seeing a bleeding of energy jobs across this \nNation. You have energy producers that are losing, according to one \nstudy, $350 million every single day.\n  The White House's solution in their budget is to impose more taxes. \nIt makes zero sense. For those of you that are listening, it is not \ngoing to make sense. People are bleeding jobs, they are losing money, \nand let's go ahead and put that last nail in the coffin and increase \ntaxes.\n  We just don't subtly increase taxes. This budget proposes to increase \ntaxes by $10 a barrel. At the barrel prices that ended yesterday, that \nis in excess of 30 percent; in fact, it is approaching a 40 percent tax \nin an industry that is bleeding jobs. It is completely nonsensical. \nObviously, it is not well thought out.\n  The study I referenced earlier projects that, by 2017, approximately \none-third of the companies involved in oil and gas exploration and \nproduction activities will go bankrupt. It is killing American jobs.\n  I want to be clear that it is not going to decrease our demand for \noil and gas, as we have seen prices as low as they are. You are seeing \nmore people buying oil and gas because of the low prices. But what it \nmeans is that we are going to kill our domestic industry and become \nmore reliant on foreign sources. I will say it again: It is \nnonsensical.\n  Further, adding insult to injury is the fact that this administration \nis continuing to move forward on this well control rule, which they \nhave hidden from industry, hidden from Congress, and refused to meet \nwith committees and delegations about what they are trying to do. Yet, \nthey thought it was appropriate to leak it to The Wall Street Journal \nthis week.\n  So, they can't talk to the people that exercise oversight, but they \ncan talk to the newspapers. Even their comments to the newspapers \ncontinue to demonstrate a fundamental misunderstanding of how our \noffshore industry works.\n  A study that was just released indicates that we can see a 35 percent \nreduction in domestic energy production in the offshore as a result of \nthis well control rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to be clear: Like everyone, I support safe energy \nproduction in the United States. What happened in 2010, with the \nMacondo disaster and the loss of those lives was an absolute travesty--\nand it was avoidable--but, as the judge said in that case, it was gross \nnegligence and willful misconduct.\n  The judge didn't say that the Department of Interior was at fault \nfrom flawed rules. He said that the operators were at fault and that it \nwas the result of multiple, multiple mistakes that, in aggregate, was \ngrossly negligent and showed willful misconduct.\n  Since the Macondo spill, industry has taken their own steps to ensure \nsafety. The Department of Interior has taken steps to ensure safety. \nYet, this well control rule is going to result in a 35 percent \nreduction, and I believe it will actually result in decreased safety \nbecause of the fundamental misunderstanding of these regulators of the \nindustry they are attempting to regulate. They are in an ivory tower--\nand it is inappropriate--further attempting to kill the oil and gas \nindustry.\n  Now, here is where the irony comes in even further.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President indicated that the effort to assign this \n$10 a barrel tax is tied back to his environmental agenda, tied back to \nhis efforts to ensure that we are good environmental stewards, which, \nto be clear, Mr. Speaker, I am a strong advocate of the environment and \nensuring that we balance environmental protection, environmental \nsustainability, and ecosystem production with our economic development \nefforts.\n  But in this case, by taking these steps and reducing our domestic \nproduction of energy, particularly offshore, you are reducing the funds \nthat are available for environmental restoration and environmental \ninitiatives. Because it is going to result in a 35 percent reduction in \noffshore energy production, according to the McKinsey study. So, if \nthat is accurate, it is going to result in billions of dollars of less \nrevenue for the U.S. Government.\n  Now, what makes that even worse is that the far, majority of the \noffshore energy production in the United States happens off the shores \nof Texas, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that is your home State, one of those.\n  So, under Federal law, from 2006, those energy revenues are shared \nback with the States so they can carry out efforts to help ensure the \nsustainability of their coasts and resilience of their communities.\n  In the case of Louisiana, my home State, we actually passed a \nconstitutional amendment to dedicate those dollars back to restoring \nthe coast, to preventing floods.\n  So this budget, as submitted, does not include funds through the \nCorps of Engineers for projects like the Morganza to the Gulf project. \nIt doesn't include funds for important projects to prevent repetitive \nflooding, like the Comite project. It doesn't fulfill the President's \ncommitment that he made to Louisiana in 2012, when he walked on the \nstreets in St. John Parish and said he was going to advance the West \nShore project to ensure that we don't continue to see flooding from \nhurricanes and storms in St. John Parish and St. Charles Parish and \nsome of the adjacent areas.\n  He fails to fulfill his own commitment by zeroing out funding for \nthat important project, and again adding insult to injury to insult to \ninjury to insult, by taking away funds in his budget request, \nattempting to repeal these offshore energy revenue-sharing dollars that \nin the State of Louisiana are committed to ecosystem restoration and to \ncommunity resilience efforts to prevent floodwaters, to save FEMA \nmoney, to prevent disasters, to prevent economic disruption, to prevent \ndisrupting our families and our businesses in south Louisiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to close by saying that this budget is \nentirely nonsensical. It talks about reducing spending and saving \nmoney, yet it does completely the opposite.\n  It talks about environmental initiatives, yet all it proposes to do \nis reduce funds available for environmental purposes, and then, in one \ncase, swaps the Louisiana money, or attempts to take the Louisiana \nmoney--excuse me--take the money from the Gulf States and send it up to \nAlaska for a climate initiative on coastal resiliency.\n  And one last note on that, Mr. Speaker. I have been up to the \ncommunities in coastal Alaska. I have been up to Shishmaref and \nKivalina and Kotzebue and Nome and Barrow and Deadhorse. I have been to \nthese communities, and they deserve help. But, Mr. Speaker, to simply \ntrade, or to rob Peter to pay Paul, to rob the Gulf to set up a program \nin Alaska, it is mind-boggling.\n  Mr. Speaker, they all deserve help. They all deserve help. To simply \ntake\n\n[[Page H813]]\n\nmoney from one area and to send it to another one, that doesn't fix the \nproblem.\n  This budget, from a fiscal perspective, is fatally flawed policy. It \nis going to put extraordinary financial burden on future generations. \nFrom an environmental perspective, it is completely nonsensical in that \nit takes money away from environmental restoration and environmental \ninitiatives and community resilience. It is going to result in \nincreasing FEMA disaster spending by leaving these communities \nvulnerable by failing to address these hazards.\n  I urge, Mr. Speaker, that, as we move forward, we move forward with \ncommonsense reforms to reduce spending, to bring the debt under \ncontrol, to begin reducing our national debt, and to make sure that we \nare spending money in places where it makes sense, to fulfill \ncommitments to the people in St. John and St. Charles Parishes, to \nensure that our communities and our economy are more resilient, and not \nto continue mortgaging our future and continue allowing our environment \nto degrade, as it is in coastal Louisiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H813-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H813-H815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LESSONS FROM THE VIETNAM WAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Louisiana, my \nneighbor--wonderful points being made.\n  I also want to call attention, Mr. Speaker, today to the 43rd \nanniversary of the release from imprisonment of American POWs from \nNorth Vietnam, among whom is our friend and hero here in the House, Sam \nJohnson.\n  It was nice of staff to have a little reception for Congressman \nJohnson, and it is important to remember such things and try to learn \nfrom our mistakes. Because once again, in the last couple of weeks, I \nhave heard references to mistakes of the past, like the lesson we \nshould have learned from Vietnam, and then they get the lesson all \nwrong.\n  We really didn't allow our military in Vietnam to win the war in \nVietnam. Our pilots, our military operations, they could have won that \nwar had they been allowed to do so.\n  And the best indication of that is, after 7 years that Sam Johnson \nspent in just the most horrid conditions, horrendous torture, joined by \nother American heroes, like John McCain, who was 3 years at the Hanoi \nHilton, where Sam Johnson was.\n  I know he was shot down 5 years before the release, but it was only \nthe last 3 years that he was placed in confinement there with, I \nbelieve, 10 others in the worst of the worst facilities, so bad that \neven today, after they cleaned up some of the torture chambers and \ntried to dress them up, they still won't let Americans go into the \noriginal Hanoi Hilton where they held 11, including Sam Johnson, in the \nmost horrid of conditions.\n  But the chronology, basically, in a nutshell, Nixon promised that he \nwould, if he was reelected, he would get us out of Vietnam. So after \nreelection, they start the Paris peace talks--and I realize this is a \ngross generalization. They start the Paris peace talks. The North \nVietnamese storm out. So Nixon orders carpet bombing of sites in North \nVietnam that they had never been allowed to bomb before, including the \nareas in Hanoi itself.\n  Sam has related personally that, when they first heard the first bomb \ndrop, they thought: Wow, one might fall here. And then they were \nabsolutely overjoyed that, finally, their country, the United States of \nAmerica, was finally bringing the war to the North Vietnamese leaders. \nThey had not done that.\n  So there was massive bombing for 2 weeks. After 2 weeks, tremendous \nbombing, then the leaders came rushing back to the peace tables: Let's \nwork this out.\n  They got a peace accord agreed to. They agreed to provide all the \nnames, locations of Americans who were killed in action or missing in \naction, provide all of the POWs. Apparently, American officials knew \npretty quickly they didn't give us everybody, and that is another dark \nchapter in our history. But they agreed to release the POWs.\n  As Sam Johnson and others were being released from the Hanoi Hilton, \nhe said probably the cruelest of the officers there was laughing and \nsmirking at the Americans as they were allowed to leave and go to a bus \nand, basically, said: You stupid Americans. If you had just bombed us \nfor one more week, we would have had to surrender unconditionally.\n  Yes, that is right. The lesson of Vietnam should have been that we \nshould never, ever put our military in harm's way without giving them \nall of the equipment and ordnance they need to win and the order to \nwin. If we are not willing to give them rules of engagement that allow \nthem to win, they should not be sent.\n  Yet, since this administration has been in office, there have been \nthree to four times more American military lives lost.\n  I am told by many in the military, because of the rules of \nengagement, because of where they are placed, without being able to \nproperly defend themselves, that, under Commander in Chief Obama, three \nto four times more military members, American military members, have \ngiven their lives, their last full measure of devotion, than were lost \nduring the 7\\1/4\\ years in which the war in Afghanistan raged at its \nhighest under Commander in Chief Bush. The difference is you had one \nCommander in Chief that gave them more authority to win and a second, a \nlater Commander in Chief, that tied their hands behind their backs.\n  So that brings us to where we are today, 43 years after Sam Johnson \nand other American POWs were released from North Vietnam. The real \nlesson of Vietnam still hasn't been learned because we have still got \nAmerican military members being killed abroad, in Afghanistan, without \ngiving them the rules of engagement to protect themselves.\n  And if that were the end of the story, that would be bad enough; but \nit is even worse when our military members have been subjected to the \nexamples of having American military members punished, sent to prison \nif they dared to put the safety and lives of their men as the first \nconsideration of their actions and their orders.\n  So we have a lieutenant in Leavenworth who, when an Afghan on a \nmotorcycle refused to honor the signs, the orders to stop, refused to \nstop or even slow down when shots were fired in his direction, and so \nyou have to give some credit to this administration and the military \nleaders and the orders that make their way from the top down and the \nrules of engagement as to why, just in recent weeks, we have lost \nmilitary members when someone on a motorcycle rode up and exploded \nthemselves.\n  They knew. Our American military that died in that suicide motorcycle \nbombing, they knew what had happened to the lieutenant. All of our \npeople in Afghanistan know what happened when this administration makes \nan example out of an officer who dares to put the safety of his own \npeople uttermost in his mind.\n  It is a sad time in America. Our allies notice that, if we will not \neven take the life, the treasure of our own American military more \nseriously, then how can they possibly put their faith in us that we \nwill keep our word and protect them? They have seen what happened in \nUkraine.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  They didn't really lift a finger to help the Ukrainians against the \nRussian aggression. In fact, after Russian aggression against Georgia, \nPresident Bush put some sanctions in place. Relations got more chilled \nbetween the United States and Russia because of the egregious, unfair \nactions of Russia in Georgia.\n  The first thing this President did was send Hillary Clinton over with \na plastic, red button. They put the wrong interpretation on it. They \nmeant to say a reset button, and they got the wrong language on there.\n  The message was very clear to the Russians: Ah, President Obama and \nHillary Clinton don't care if we violate their allies. They don't care \nif we invade their friends. They don't care. They want a reset button \nand basically have apologized for getting upset that we in Russia \ninvaded Georgia. So Hillary Clinton and President Obama are fine with \nus invading other places.\n\n[[Page H814]]\n\n  What were they supposed to think that this administration would do \nwhen they invaded Ukraine? Well, they guessed right, that this \nadministration wouldn't really do anything about it.\n  Oh, I am sorry, Mr. Speaker. I forgot. This administration did do \nsomething about the Russian aggression. In fact, the President \ndelivered it. He didn't know the microphone was picking him up when he \nsaid, basically:\n  Tell Vladimir that I will have a whole lot more flexibility after the \nelection.\n  So they got the messages. We can pretty much abuse and invade, \nwhatever we care to do. It is outrageous what has happened to American \nreputation abroad.\n  So today is the 43rd anniversary. We salute Sam Johnson and all those \nPOWs that were released today from North Vietnam. I wish we had learned \nthe lesson from the horrors that they experienced.\n  In fact, there is an article here by Anne Bayefsky. It originally \nappeared on FOX News. This was released February 11, 2016, by Human \nRights Voices:\n  ``There is a dangerous scam gaining traction at the United Nations, \nbackstopped by the White House.''\n  That is our U.S. President's House.\n  ``It's called `violent extremism.' Given the U.N.'s long and \nundistinguished history of being unable to define terrorism, and an \nAmerican President who chokes on the words `radical Islamic terrorism,' \npledges to combat `violent extremism' have become all the rage.\n  ``It turns out that the terminological fast one is a lethal \ndiplomatic dance that needs to be deconstructed, and quickly.\n  ``In 1999, the Organization of Islamic Cooperation''--that is the \nOIC--``enemy'' insert parenthetically, Mr. Speaker--the OIC, \nOrganization of Islamic Cooperation, has all of the Islamic nations \nexcept the United States included in it, and they also include the \nPalestinians that are in the nation of Israel.\n  I always get confused whether the OIC has 50 states and we have in \nthe United States 57 States or whether the OIC has 57 states and we \nhave 50. So I shared that with our President when he was running for \nthe Presidency as he got confused whether the U.S. has 57 states--no, \nthat is the OIC--and the United States has 50. It is confusing.\n  The article states: ``In 1999, the Organization of Islamic \nCooperation .  .  . adopted an `anti-terrorism' treaty stating that \n`armed struggle against foreign occupation, aggression, colonialism, \nand hegemony, aimed at liberation and self-determination .  .  . shall \nnot be considered a terrorist crime.'\n  ``In practice, that means it is open season on all Israelis, as well \nas Americans and Europeans who get in the way. Each of the 56 Islamic \nstates''--actually, the OIC is 57 because they claim Palestine--``and \nwhat the UN labels the `State of Palestine,' is a party to this treaty.\n  ``The September 11 terror attacks then launched a growth industry in \nU.N. counter-terrorism chit-chat and paraphernalia.\n  ``Year-after-year, Islamic states have prevented the adoption of a UN \nComprehension Convention Against Terrorism by refusing to abandon their \nclaim that certain targets are exempt.\n  ``In 2001 the U.N. Security Council created the Counter-Terrorism \nCommittee. But it is unable to name a state sponsor of terrorism. In \nfact, from 2002 to 2003, Syria, a state sponsor of terrorism, was a \nmember.\n  ``In 2005 the U.N. Commission on Human Rights, once chaired by \nColonel Qaddafi's Libya, created the U.N. expert on `the promotion and \nprotection of human rights and fundamental freedoms while countering \nterrorism'--as if countering terror is not about protecting human \nrights.\n  ``In 2006 the General Assembly adopted a Global Counter-Terrorism \nStrategy. It manages to cast terrorists as victims. `Pillar Number One' \nstarts by worrying about `conditions conducive to the spread of \nterrorism.' `Youth unemployment,' for instance, purportedly results in \n`the subsequent sense of victimization that propels extremism and the \nrecruitment of terrorists.'\n  ``In 2011 the U.N. established the Counter-Terrorism Center--at the \ninitiative of Saudi Arabia. The Saudis threw $100 million at the \nventure and became chair of the `Advisory Board.' Saudi financing of \nradical charities and `academic' exercises around the world are somehow \nleft out of Center events on investigating and prosecuting terror \nfinancing.\n  ``Integral to the-best-defense-is-a-good-offence routine, has been \nthe constant unsubstantiated allegation of an `Islamophobia' pandemic.\n  ``For the first decade of the 21st century, the Islamophobia charge \nwas hurled in UN resolutions on the `defamation' of Islam or the \n`defamation of religion.' Defamation meant the freedoms of human beings \nshould be trumped by the `rights' of `religion.'\n  ``In 2009 `defamation' was repackaged by the General Assembly as \n`human rights and cultural diversity.' Ever since, the over 100 \ncountries of the `Non-aligned movement' vote against Western states and \ndemand the freedoms of human beings be trumped by `cultural diversity.' \nAnd that's cultural diversity Iran-style. In December 2015, the UN \nresolution praised Tehran's Centre for Human Rights and Cultural \nDiversity--the brainchild of former Iranian President and well-known \nhuman rights aficionado Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.\n  ``In the last six weeks alone, Islamic states have staged two UN \nmeetings focusing on `Islamophobia and inclusive societies,' and \n`countering xenophobia.' Two weeks ago, the servile Secretary-General \nBan Ki-moon couldn't mention `antisemitism' on the anniversary of the \nliberation of Auschwitz without connecting it to `anti-Muslim bigotry.'\n  ``Of course, the Islamophobia drumbeat skips right over the \nxenophobia, antisemitism, and exclusively that is endemic--and \nofficially-sanctioned--in Islamic states.\n  ``This is the substrate from which Ban Ki-moon has now manufactured a \n`Plan of Action to Prevent Violent Extremism.' Introduced in January, \nthe General Assembly is meeting on February 12, 2016 to push the plan \nforward.\n  ``After one mention of `ISIL, Al-Qaeda and Boko Haram,' the Plan \ninsists that violent extremism `does not arise in a vacuum. Narratives \nof grievance, actual or perceived injustice . . . become attractive.' \n`It is critical that in responding to this threat,' stresses the Plan, \nthat states be stopped from `overreacting.' Topping `conditions \nconducive to violent extremism' is `lack of socioeconomic \nopportunities.' ''\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this just shows the ignorance in the U.N. in propagating \nsuch a plan and the sheer naivety, if not outright intentional \nmisleading, of those who would read their report.\n  Lack of socioeconomic opportunities is not what caused one of the \nwealthier Islamists to put together and carry out a plan of attacking \nthe World Trade Center, the Pentagon, and, apparently, this Capitol. He \nwas wealthy. So are many of those who are funding terrorism. It arises \nout of radical Islamic beliefs.\n  Nobody should have to ever say: We know all Muslims don't believe \nthis. It should go without saying. We know that. But for those that do, \nit is sheer idiocy to claim that Islam has nothing to do with the \nradical Islamic terrorism that is occurring.\n  When you have one of the most world-renowned experts on Islam who has \nstudied his whole life on the Koran, the holy Koran, as he would call \nit, the tenets and the pillars of Islam and even has his Ph.D., we are \ntold, in Islamic studies from the University of Baghdad--Mr. Speaker, I \nthink I forgot to mention he is the head of ISIS.\n  The head of the Islamic State is one of the world's foremost experts \non Islam, and he says the Islamic State is exactly what Islam is all \nabout.\n  I know, when I was a judge, people had to put on evidence as to \neducational background and study in an area so that I, as the judge, \ncould determine whether that man or woman was actually an expert in \ntheir field.\n  I would say the head of ISIS, with his educational background and his \nresearch and study, certainly is far more of an expert on Islam than \nour President or Valerie Jarrett or anybody in this administration.\n  The article says: ``Here we go again. The bigots, fanatics and \nkillers are allegedly driven by our annoying insistence on fighting \nback--which the Plan astonishingly calls `the cycle of insecurity and \narmed conflict.'\n  ``As per usual in U.N. negotiations, the Obama administration has \njumped\n\n[[Page H815]]\n\non board while Islamic states are holding out for greater elaboration \nof their grievances and even more `nothing to do with religion or \nIslam' clauses.\n  ``The U.N.'s idea of a win-win is an illusory `global partnership to \nconfront this menace' that allows states to define violent extremism \nany which way they want: `This Plan of Action pursues a practical \napproach to preventing violent extremism, without venturing to address \nquestions of definition.'\n  ``Only U.N. con-artists could present refusing to identify a problem \nas the most practical way to solve it.\n  ``More practically speaking, the latest Palestinian terror wave began \nby pumping bullets into a young mom and dad in front of their little \nkids for the crime of being Jews living and breathing on Arab-claimed \nland. In U.N. terminology, Eitam and Naama Henkin were `extremist \nsettlers.'\n  ``So to all you extremist lovers of liberty: beware the violent \nextremists in U.N. clothing, and the morally-challenged commanders in \nchief bringing up the rear.''\n  Well written. We have got to wake up. We had another bombing. We have \nmore violence. We hear from ISIS leaders that they have been able to \nget some of their best warriors into the United States and into Europe \nposing as refugees. We have the head of the FBI who warns all of us in \nthe House and all of us in the Senate and says we have cases regarding \nthe Islamic State in every State in the Union.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Still, we let the administration get away with turning a blind eye \ntoward the real problem and say we need to welcome more and more \nrefugees. We are told by the people who are in charge of the vetting: \nWe will vet them, but we have no information really to vet them with, \nso, sure, there are going to be some terrorists come in.\n  We have an obligation in this House, and those Senators at the other \nend of the hall, to our Constitution, and we are to provide for the \ncommon defense. We are supposed to provide that defense against all \nenemies--foreign and domestic.\n  For those who don't know the Constitution well enough, there is no \nright by someone illegally in the United States to have a hearing \nbefore an article III Federal District Court. In fact, there is no \nDistrict Court mentioned in article III. The only court mentioned is \nthe Supreme Court. As my old constitutional law professor said, there \nis only one court in the country that owes its existence to the U.S. \nConstitution. Every other Federal Court, every other tribunal, and \nmagistrate in the country owes its existence--that is a Federal \nentity--owes its existence to the United States Congress. We have the \nright to create them; we have the right to remove them.\n  Our own military do not have a right to a United States District \nCourt. Why? Because the Constitution says Congress has the full \nauthority to create disciplinary systems for the military. That is why \nthe UCMJ, the Uniform Code of Military Justice, was created.\n  Why in the world should we have people in this administration \nadvocating for people illegally in this country, people illegally in \nthis country that want to do damage to America, and advocate that they \nhave a right to a U.S. District Court that our own military heroes \ndon't have a right to? The answer is: They don't have that right at \nall.\n  There is an article: Female Suicide Bomber Pair Kill 58 in Nigerian \nRefugee Camp. Having been there and having wept with family members who \nhave lost kids, had kids kidnapped, held, their little girls raped \nrepeatedly for months now, and the best this administration does is \nstart a little social media campaign: Bring Back Our Girls, are you \nkidding me?\n  Give Nigeria all the Intel they need to wipe out Boko Haram. Let them \ndo it.\n  The Taliban was totally defeated between October of 2001 and February \nof 2002. Without one single American life lost, we had embedded \nmilitary in Afghanistan, no lives lost, and the Taliban was totally \nrouted by February. Then we did something that wasn't very smart. We \nbegan basically an occupation of Afghanistan. It hasn't worked out \nwell.\n  Here is an article: CIA Director Says Islamic Group has Used, Can \nMake Chemical Weapons. It quotes Brennan on CBS News and Lara on 60 \nMinutes as saying: The CIA believes the IS group has the ability to \nmake small amounts of mustard and chlorine gas for weapons, and ``there \nare reports that ISIS has access to chemical precursors and munitions \nthat they can use.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we need to have learned our lesson, and we haven't. If \nthis administration doesn't stand up, more lives will be needlessly \nlost.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H815-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Stivers (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nhis duties with the Ohio National Guard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/12/house-section/article/H815-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H815]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
