The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the strange kaleidoscope of this \ncongressional session began with the proposed shutdown of Homeland \nSecurity but moved on to the bipartisan action to fix the vexing SGR-\nMedicare funding formula, the so-called ``doc fix'' to prevent dramatic \ncuts to providers.\n  Yes, it is still hard to overcome deep divisions, philosophical \ndifference, and some real serious politics. The heated rhetoric and \nconvoluted voting on the recent trade package is the latest example. \nWouldn't it be great if we could take a step back and find ways to \nunite us to solve a major problem?\n  Well, we have got a major problem that is staring us in the face \nright now. We are in the midst of the 33rd short-term transportation \nfunding extension that is a result of our inability to pay for 2015 \ninfrastructure with 1993 dollars. That is because of our inability to \nraise the gas tax since 1993.\n  The demands for transportation solutions grow, and the harm inflicted \non families occurs every day. It costs them over $300 a year just in \ndamage to their cars from road maintenance that has fallen apart. We \nare paying a $125-billion-a-year penalty for congestion.\n  Americans, make no mistake, are paying the price for this \ndysfunction, and the people who are partners at the State and local \nlevel and in the private sector are having great difficulty doing their \npart without the certainty of the Federal partnership that has been the \nbedrock, that has been the foundation of national transportation policy \nsince President Eisenhower.\n  Now, there is a little hint of sunshine here because this week, on \nWednesday, we will be having the first hearing on transportation \nfinance since my Republican friends took control of Congress 56 months \nago.\n  What if we took advantage of that daylight to expand the scope of the \ndiscussion? What if we were able to have at the same witness table the \npresident of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, Tom Donohue, and the \npresident of the AFL-CIO, Richard Trumka, who don't much agree on \nanything, but they are united in their firm belief that raising the gas \ntax, getting the transportation funding to rebuild and renew America, \nis absolutely essential?\n  We could be joined by people who understand that hundreds of \nthousands of family-wage jobs would be possible if we met our \ntransportation obligations.\n  We could have representatives from State and local government, \ntransit agencies, the environmental community, safety advocates all \njoined at the same table. We could have the eloquence of Governor Bill \nGraves, who is currently president of the American Trucking \nAssociation, but he was Republican Governor of Kansas, who raised the \ngas tax not once, but twice. He could be joined by the American \nAutomobile Association, which has come out strongly in favor of a gas \ntax to be able to meet the needs of the motoring public. Why wouldn't \nwe want those people there?\n  We could invite State legislators from six very red Republican \nStates--Idaho, Utah, Georgia, South Dakota, Nebraska, and Iowa--that \nall raised the gas tax this year. They didn't just talk about it; they \nacted. Six red States raising the gas tax already in 2015.\n  I am optimistic that we can capitalize on the glimmers of life we are \nseeing. If we can just listen to the people at the State and local \nlevel, the private sector, organized labor, people who build, maintain, \nand use our transportation system, they could be part of that \ndeliberative process. I am confident that we, in Congress, could \ndevelop a united front on an issue that has been controversial in the \npast but is no longer.\n  When people step up, when they accept responsibility and work \ncooperatively, we can do what was done in Idaho, Georgia, Utah, Iowa, \nSouth Dakota, and Nebraska. Congress can do that. And after all the \nacrimony and bad feeling and partisan division that has lingered, \nwouldn't this be the right time to do so?\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4347-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4347-H4348]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PIVOT TO AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Russell) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a chance this week to turn\n\n[[Page H4348]]\n\nthe President's pivot to Asia into a pivot to America. The question is: \nWill we listen to the American people, or will we double down on a \nwatered-down policy that has divided both the Democratic and Republican \nsides of the aisle? To stop the TPA, we must hold firm.\n  Republicans and Democrats all want trade barriers to be removed, but \nwe are at a crossroads because both parties have voiced a lack of trust \nin the President's ability to be able to negotiate what is best for \nAmerica. That is why we are still fighting to stop the trade \npromotional authority, better known as fast track.\n  Fast track will not be the panacea of all ills. In fact, if granted, \nwe could see President Obama move swiftly on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership that will likely not deliver the goods and have harmful \nsecondary effects in multiple areas.\n  Dr. Aurolyn Luykx, from the University of Texas at El Paso, makes \nthis analysis: ``I think the consequences could be very dire. We \nalready saw under NAFTA how so many jobs left the United States and, \nalso, went from Mexico. Then we saw, as well, tens of thousands of low-\nincome Mexican families being put out of work and losing their land, \nand we saw how that drove migration to the United States.''\n  The architects of the TPA in both Congress and the White House claim \nthat with fast track they can lower barriers on U.S. exports among the \n11 other TPP nations in the negotiation, thus, increasing jobs and \nwages.\n  Now to the facts. We already have high-standard, free-trade \nagreements with 7 of those 11 other nations in the proposed Trans-\nPacific Partnership. We are writing the rules in the Pacific. Let's \nwrite them some more with good bilateral agreements.\n  If you don't believe me, how about Simon Johnson, a former chief \neconomist of the International Monetary Fund and a professor at MIT \nSloan. Here is what he says about the myth of needing the TPA to lower \ntariffs among the proposed members of the Trans-Pacific Partnership:\n\n       Almost all tariffs on trade among Canada, Mexico, and the \n     United States are long gone. Under the Australian and \n     Singapore free trade agreements, almost all tariffs on U.S. \n     goods have been eliminated. Goods from the United States have \n     entered Chile without tariffs since January 1 of this year, \n     and most tariffs imposed by Peru have already been phased \n     out.\n       The TPP will amount to a free trade agreement with Brunei, \n     with a population less than Omaha, Nebraska, and New Zealand, \n     with a population less than Louisiana. Encouraging exports to \n     these countries is surely desirable, but the economic impact \n     on the United States is unlikely to be more than a rounding \n     error.\n       That leaves three larger countries where the issues are \n     more complex: Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam.\n       And TPP will also confer special status on foreign \n     investors, allowing them to sue for financial judgments \n     against host-country regulations. Creating a quasi-legal \n     process outside the regular court system just for foreigners \n     can go wrong in many ways.\n\n  I would add, from my own reading of the TPP, without divulging the \ndetails, concerns about private rights in disputes; the transnational \npanel empowered with a living agreement even after the accord is \nsigned; and possible exceptions granted to Brunei, whose legal system \nis not to the same standard as other nations.\n  So, one says, What solutions do you have? Well, here are a couple:\n  First, listen to the American people. If the majority of Americans \ncompletely across the political spectrum have voiced concerns against \nTPA, then our actions this week will truly reflect if we are being \nrepresentative of that voice.\n  Second, the President must demonstrate he can lead on foreign policy. \nHe has yet to do it. Granting fast track to negotiate with 40 percent \nof the world's economy should be based on how well he has handled \nforeign policy. Have we forgotten the handling of Syria, ISIS, Iraq, \nCrimea, Ukraine, and Iran? I can go on, but the question is, Why are \nwe? The President must show us some deeds, not words. He should start \nby negotiating a bilateral agreement with our ally Japan. Intently \nfocus there. Bring that to us, and we will likely approve it.\n  Third, negotiate an interim agreement with China. We still have much \nto do with raising the standards bar on Chinese trade, but China lacks \nlawyers to fight these problems. Well, do we know how to make plenty of \nthose. Negotiate a law school program all across our land's rich \ninstitutions to create Chinese attorneys to help fight these issues.\n  As to goods, China is seeking oil, natural gas, coal, timber, \naggregate, beef, and pork. We have an abundance of these. How about a \ntrade agreement on these narrow products that will immediately benefit \nus all?\n  It is not impossible. We have the resource. We have the technology. \nWhat we need are the guts to do it, a rekindling of the American \nspirit, and the leadership to get it done. It starts by putting the \nbrakes on fast track. We need the right track instead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4348-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4348-H4349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McNerney) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, this afternoon, I am going to talk about \ncampaign finance reform.\n  First of all, though, I want to say that the United States of America \nis the greatest country in the world. You can see by our economic \ndominance, by our cultural dominance, and by our military power. But we \nface some very big challenges. Unless we are able to tackle those \nchallenges, our dominance may be in peril.\n  Some of those challenges are climate change, global competitiveness. \nWe need to make sure our manufacturing is up to par and can compete \nwith any country on Earth. We have a vanishing middle class, which is \nvery devastating to our country. We have a crumbling infrastructure. We \nalso need to work on our educational system. But I can tell you, it is \nvery difficult to attack any of these problems in a serious way with \nthe current system of campaign financing.\n  So let me go over some of the problems with campaign financing in our \ncurrent system:\n  First of all, you can see on the list here, campaign financing makes \nelected officials less effective because of the amount of time that we \nmust spend raising money for the next election, which leaves less time \nto work on the issues that need to move our country forward.\n  The campaign money fuels negative campaign ads that turn off voters \nand suppress vote turnout.\n  Campaign financing causes wasteful government spending on programs \nthat big donors want to see out there.\n  The threat of negative campaign adds--and this is very corrosive--\ncauses elected officials to avoid taking stands and leadership on \nimportant issues, and this reduces the effectiveness of our government \ninstitutions.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Nowadays, even our judicial races are becoming expensive and tainted \nby the influence of money.\n  Next, people have become cynical about the government and \ndisillusioned about the United States of America because, in part, of \nnegative advertising.\n  Next, the super-PACs and dark money coming into campaigns are no \nlonger controlled by the candidates on the ballot.\n  Lastly--and I think this is very important--excessive election \nspending drowns out free speech. If you look at campaign ads, what is \nhappening is that the Big Money comes in, buys all the campaign ad time \non TV, and floods our mailboxes with literature.\n  People are only going to listen to so much campaign rhetoric, so they \nturn it off. The people with the most money are the ones who are \nlistened to, and the ideas of the folks without much money are never \nheard. They don't ever get very far. I think this is a very critical \nissue.\n  We see the problems that we have with the current system; but how do \nwe change it? There are some very big challenges that we face in terms \nof changing the current campaign financing system.\n  First of all, the Supreme Court of the United States of America has \nshown a very strong bias in the last decade or so toward putting more \nmoney in politics. That is right. The Supreme Court has made it so that \nmore money is coming into politics and election campaigns every single \nyear.\n  The Citizens United decision by the Supreme Court ruled that \ncorporations\n\n[[Page H4349]]\n\nhave the same free speech rights as people, allowing corporations to \nuse their treasuries to finance campaigns. I can't think of anything \nthat would be more corrosive to campaigns than to see a plethora of \ncorporate and union money coming in with no controls and controlling \nthe message.\n  In fact, just this year, the Republicans in the House and the Senate \npassed legislation that increases the total that an individual American \ncitizen can contribute to political parties almost by a factor of 10, \ngoing from $35,000 to $300,000, so an individual can donate $300,000 to \na political campaign; yet there is significant public support for \ntaking money out of politics.\n  According to a June 2015 New York Times-CBS poll, 84 percent of \nAmericans say money has too much influence in politics, and 85 percent \nof those surveyed said that the campaign financing system should be \neither completely rebuilt or fundamentally changed.\n  The growth of money in politics represents a threat to our cherished \ndemocratic institutions that were built by our Founding Fathers. This \nis not what the American people want for our democracy. It is critical \nto inform the American public about what is happening and what can be \ndone about the problem. There are reform options of two kinds.\n  The first kind is legislative reform actions, and there are three or \nfour types of those. The first and most important is disclosure and \ntransparency, and then there are constitutional amendments. \nConstitutional amendments are very hard to pass, but they are not \nsubject to be overturned by the Supreme Court. I have a proposed \nconstitutional amendment, H.J. Res. 31, which will do away with PACs \nand super-PACs.\n  I hope the American public will examine those alternatives and decide \nwhat they want to see because our system is in desperate need of \nchange.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4349-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             ABOVE THE LAW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate so much the comments of my \nfriend Mr. Russell, a neighbor from an adjoining State. He is right. \nThe American people have made clear that they did not want the TPA \npassed. They certainly don't want the TAA passed.\n  How ironic that we are told that TPA's passage will create a massive \nnumber of jobs; yet the people who have really looked at it on the \nDemocratic side say, ``Huh-uh, this is going to cost a lot of jobs so \nthat we have got to have more unemployment benefits and more government \nhelp for people who are going to lose their jobs,'' which is what the \nTAA basically does, ``or we can't vote for the TPA''--how ironic.\n  Also how ironic that President Obama seems to have worked harder on \nthis bill than he has on anything since ObamaCare--he has come to the \nHill; he went to the baseball game. He is really pushing people to join \nhim. It is rather ironic because it is just hard to believe that he \nwould be working this hard to limit his own powers. He has never done \nthat before. He has never worked to limit his own powers.\n  It also strikes me as a bit interesting that some of the same people \nwho pushed so hard to pass TARP, the Wall Street bailout, are also \npushing for this. There was a former FDIC Chairman named Isaac, who \ncame to the Hill with the support of many economists, saying: ``Please, \ndon't get into this socialist activity where government partners with \nprivate business. Don't do that and certainly not for $700 billion. \nThere is no justification.''\n  Look, we clearly have more than that, that American individuals and \nAmerican businesses have overseas in banks that they will never bring \ninto the United States. They have already paid a massive amount of tax \non it overseas.\n  A far better, free market approach would be to just pass a bill and \nsay, ``If you want to shore up any asset or any entity, like Goldman \nSachs''--you could have saved Lehman Brothers, AIG, Chrysler, GM; you \ncould have saved any of them if you had just said: ``Bring that money \nin from overseas, no tax.''\n  We could have made it very attractive to do that, and then we \nwouldn't have had to have given the government $700 billion with \nbasically no limits on how the Secretary of the Treasury could spend \nhis money.\n  He couldn't prop up a central bank of a foreign government, but I \nread the bill. I couldn't believe we were going to give that kind of \npower to one person. We have not done that since the Constitution \npassed.\n  It also should be noted, I think, that, if we had not passed that \n$700 billion Wall Street bailout--that giveaway--then President Obama \nwould never have gotten $900 billion. He would never have been able to \npush so much more for bigger government and had gotten it.\n  We would have been able to have stood stronger against that, which \ncould have prevented ObamaCare from even coming up or passing. It had \nterribly damaging effects. Some of the same people who wanted TARP are \nnow wanting TPA and TAA. It is a bad idea.\n  I just want to just finish, Mr. Speaker, by noting that we have the \nSupreme Court taking up an issue--it is supposedly going to come out \nwith an opinion before the end of the month--and ruling in a case \ninvolving same-sex marriage.\n  Neither the Constitution nor the Bill of Rights provides any power \nfor the Federal Government to get involved in the issue of marriage. \nThat has always been a State issue. It should be under the 10th \nAmendment; yet we have the Supreme Court potentially going to weigh in \nand take over that power.\n  We also know that the law is very clear: 28 U.S. Code, section 455, \nsays that any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the United States \nshall disqualify himself in any proceeding in which his impartiality \nmight reasonably be questioned.\n  Two Justices have made clear how they feel. They have presided over \nsame-sex marriage ceremonies. If they do not disqualify themselves and \nif they rule on this case, they have shown a total contempt for the \nlaw. That should lead to impeachment, but America would have to rise up \nto make that known.\n  We will see here, in the 800th year anniversary of the Magna Carta, \nwhen it was made clear that nobody, not even the King, is above the \nlaw, if the Supreme Court will say, 800 years later: ``We are the \nSupreme Court, and we are above the law, and there is nothing you can \ndo about it.''\n  I hope and pray they are not that arrogant in trying to bring down \nthis constitutional Republic. We will see.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4349-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4349]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, it seems like the whole of Washington is \nawaiting the result of a Supreme Court decision in reference to King v. \nBurwell.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me give you the simple truth. As I see it, the \nPresident broke the law. He broke the law, and people are hurting as a \nconsequence.\n  Once this ruling comes down, Congress will be required to put in \nplace mechanisms to keep people from being hurt any further, but the \nfact of the matter remains that premiums have gone up, deductibles are \ncompletely out of sight, leaving many families functionally uninsured. \nWe need to address these problems.\n  Furthermore, power needs to be devolved back to the States. States \ncan do a better job of running their healthcare systems because they \nare closer to the people that they represent.\n  The fact of the matter is this healthcare law was a big mistake. It \nis time that it be fixed, and this will be a first step in the road to \ndo so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4350-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AIRPORT SECURITY ACT\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, our Nation's airports are \neconomic and cultural engines that drive our local, State, and national \neconomy. They are the front door for many of our communities. \nUnfortunately, they are also a known target for those seeking to incite \nfear.\n  Two weeks ago, a man entered the world's busiest airport in Atlanta, \nGeorgia, carrying a loaded AR-15 automatic weapon with an extended \ncapacity 100-round magazine. He did so only to make a point, and that \nwas to show that he was legally able to carry his firearm in the \nairport.\n  Mr. Speaker, actions like this, which follow shootings at airports in \nLos Angeles and Houston, undermine public security in the same way as \nyelling ``fire'' in a crowded theater.\n  Today, I will introduce legislation to prohibit the carrying of \nloaded weapons in our Nation's airports. The Airport Security Act is a \ncommonsense bill, and I urge my colleagues to join me in keeping the \ntraveling public safe.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4350-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            DACA ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Ms. LINDA T.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to \ncommemorate the 3-year anniversary of the Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals program, also known as DACA.\n  Over the past 3 years, DACA has changed the lives of more than \n640,000 young undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United \nStates as children, including an impressive intern in my office named \nMaria. Maria moved to the United States when she was only 6 years old. \nNow, as a college student with a 4.0 GPA, Maria tutors children and is \ngiving back to the country that has helped her reach her goals.\n  As we mark DACA's 3-year anniversary and all that it has accomplished \nto support students like Maria, thousands more DREAMers are waiting for \ntheir opportunity to come out of the shadows. Sadly, the court battle \nover DACA continues.\n  We must rededicate ourselves to fixing our broken immigration system. \nStudents like Maria deserve the chance to live free of fear and \ncontribute their talents to keep our country vibrant and the envy of \nthe world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4350-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4350]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, House Republican leadership is, once again, \nthreatening to bring us to the edge of yet another deadline that \nthreatens American jobs and our very economy.\n  There are just 7 days left for Congress to reauthorize the Export-\nImport Bank, a critical agency that gives American manufacturers and \nsmall businesses the tools and access to capital that they need to sell \nAmerican-made goods overseas. It is how we grow our economy. Letting \nthe Export-Import Bank expire endangers hundreds of thousands of good-\npaying jobs in the United States.\n  In my home State of Michigan alone, 228 exporters with $11 billion in \nexport value are at risk if Congress fails to reauthorize the Ex-Im \nBank. That will all end on June 30--no new support, no new loan \nguarantees, no new loans to help exporters sell goods across the \ncountry and keep Americans at work.\n  It is reckless and it is irresponsible that we are facing another \nfiscal cliff. This is a cliff for our own manufacturers and our own \neconomy.\n  Mr. Speaker, a majority of this House of Representatives supports the \nExport-Import Bank.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie \nBernice Johnson) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arkansas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on H.R. 2131.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arkansas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2131 designates the Federal building and the United \nStates courthouse located at 83 Meeting Street in Charleston, South \nCarolina, as the J. Waties Waring Judicial Center.\n  Judge Waring was born in Charleston, South Carolina, in 1880. After \nbecoming a lawyer, he was in the private practice of law and eventually \nserved as corporation counsel for Charleston, South Carolina.\n  In 1942, after serving as assistant U.S. Attorney, Judge Waring was \nappointed by President Franklin Delano Roosevelt to serve as a judge \nfor the United States District Court for the Eastern District of South \nCarolina.\n  During his tenure on the bench, Judge Waring's opinions had a \nsignificant impact on civil rights. For example, in the case of Duvall \nv. School Board, he ruled that equal pay must be guaranteed for equally \nqualified schoolteachers, regardless of race, and his dissent in Briggs \nv. Elliott stating that ``separate educational facilities are \ninherently unequal'' formed the legal foundation for the Supreme \nCourt's decision in Brown v. Board of Education.\n  This bill is supported by the entire South Carolina delegation. Given \nJudge Waring's dedication to the law, it is fitting to name this \nFederal building and courthouse after him.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. This bill is, of \ncourse, to name the U.S. courthouse in Charleston, South Carolina, \nafter Judge Julius Waties Waring.\n  During Judge Waring's time as a Federal judge in the Eastern District \nof South Carolina, he was a trailblazer in pursuit of justice for \nAfrican Americans. Judge Waring consistently ruled for African American \nplaintiffs in cases involving voting rights, unequal pay, and civil \nrights.\n  Before Judge Waring was named to the Federal bench, he served as \nassistant U.S. attorney and as corporation counsel for the City of \nCharleston.\n  He is most famously remembered for a 1951 landmark school segregation \ncase. Judge Waring wrote in his dissent on a three-judge panel that \nracial segregation in public schools was ``per se inequality.'' He \nbecame the first Federal judge to take that position since Plessy v. \nFerguson ruled for separate but equal. In his dissent, he went further \nto denounce segregation as an ``evil that must be eradicated.'' His \ndissent is commonly understood to provide the intellectual underpinning \nof the Supreme Court outlawing school segregation in Brown v. Board of \nEducation.\n  Because Judge Waring's decisions were considered controversial at the \ntime, he endured threats of violence and was alienated from most of \nCharleston. Soon after Judge Waring's momentous decision, he retired \nfrom the Federal bench and moved to New York, where he later died.\n  Fifty years after his death, this legislation naming the Federal \ncourthouse in Charleston in his honor is appropriate because of Judge \nWaring's courageous judicial service in the face of fierce opposition \nto the bedrock American value of ``justice for all.''\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, again, I would just urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 2131.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2131, a \nbill to designate the Federal building and United States courthouse \nlocated at 83 Meeting Street in Charleston, South Carolina, as the ``J. \nWaties Waring Judicial Center'' and urge my colleagues to support this \nbill. I thank Representative Jim Clyburn for introducing the bill, \nwhich has the full support of our state's congressional delegation.\n  This bill is a reflection of two things: human kindness and bold \nleadership. There is a saying that, ``One of the most difficult things \nto give away is kindness; it usually comes back to you.'' This bill is, \nin some ways, a reflection of that notion. Under the category of human \nkindness, this bill came as a result of a phone call from Senator Fritz \nHollings asking that the name on the courthouse in Charleston named \nafter him be changed to honor the memory of the late Judge Julius \nWaties Waring. Although Judge Waring has a remarkable legal legacy, in \nthe case of Senator Hollings, it all began with human kindness. In the \n1940's, Fritz Hollings was a young attorney in Charleston and practiced \nin front of Judge Waring. What impressed him was that Judge Waring was, \n``damned nice to me. He made sure young lawyers weren't bumfuzzled or \nrun over by senior lawyers.'' If the story stopped there, we probably \nwould not be discussing this bill today.\n  Instead, it is Judge Waring's bold leadership that makes this \ncommemoration particularly fitting. As a federal district court judge, \nJ. Waties Waring ruled on several key cases that set the stage for one \nof the most significant court cases in our nation's history. In the \n1940's, Judge Waring heard and ruled on cases that opened South \nCarolina's ``white only'' Democratic primary and forcing equal pay for \nblack and white school teachers. By 1948, TIME Magazine declared him as \n``The Man They Love to Hate'' in South Carolina. In fact, in 1950, the \nSouth Carolina House of Representatives debated a resolution asking \nJudge Waring and his wife to leave the state and even offered to pay \nfor the one-way tickets. This all came before his dissenting vote in \nthe 1951 Briggs v. Elliott case involving segregated busing in \nClarendon County in South Carolina. In that case, Thurgood Marshall \nargued that black students were being treated unfairly because although \nthere were three times as many black students, funding for \ntransportation was only half. As a result, black students were walking \nup to nine miles to school. The case was decided against the plaintiff \nby a 2-1 vote, with Judge Waring voting in dissent. In his opinion, \nWaring argued that segregation was ``an evil that must be eradicated'' \nand a result of ``unreasonable, unscientific and . . . unadulterated \nprejudice.'' His dissent would travel with the case all the way to the \nSupreme Court, where the Briggs case became one of five cases decided \nwith Brown v. Board of Education, which recognized segregation as a \nviolation of the 14th Amendment.\n  Although Judge Waring left the bench not long after the Briggs case, \nthe impact of his leadership still resides today. I think naming this \nbuilding after Judge Waring is a particularly fitting commemoration of \nhis bold leadership, his willingness to take a stand, and the human \nkindness that's being extended by Senator Hollings back to Judge \nWaring.\n  Mr. CLYBURN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2131, a bill to \nrename the federal courthouse in Charleston, South Carolina in honor of \nJudge J. Waties Waring. This bill is a tribute to two men, two \noutstanding South Carolinians. The first, Judge Waring, for whom the \nbill will name the courthouse, was a federal judge in South Carolina \nduring the 1940s and 50s who made landmark and courageous rulings on \ncivil rights.\n  The second is known to many in the Congress, Senator Ernest F. \n``Fritz'' Hollings whose name is currently on this courthouse, and who \nhas requested it be changed as a long overdue honor to Judge Waring.\n  The son of a confederate soldier, Julius Waties Waring, was born July \n27, 1880 in Charleston, and graduated from the College of Charleston in \n1900. He became an attorney and after practicing in Charleston for \nseveral decades was nominated by President Franklin Roosevelt to the \nU.S. District Court in 1941.\n  While there was little in his background that foretold an evolution \non the issue, soon after ascending to the bench, Waring would become an \niconoclast and an outcast in his hometown because of his rulings on \ncivil rights cases.\n  In the 1944 Duvall v. School Board decision, Judge Waring ordered \nequal pay for teachers, regardless of race.\n  In 1947, in Elmore v. Rice, Judge Waring struck down South Carolina's \nall-white Democratic primary.\n  In 1952, in his most famous opinion, Judge Waring dissented from the \nruling in Briggs v. Elliott, arguing that ``separate but equal'' was\n\n[[Page H4352]]\n\nunconstitutional. While a dissenting opinion at the time, on appeal to \nthe U.S. Supreme Court, his opinion would form the basis of the \nunanimous decision in Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down \nracial segregation in all public schools in America.\n  For my entire tenure in Congress, these words from Judge Waring's \ndissent have been on the wall of my Congressional Office: ``They showed \nbeyond a doubt that the evils of segregation and color prejudice come \nfrom early training . . . and that is an evil that must be \neradicated.''\n  Taking these stands in the 1940s and 50s was not without consequence. \nHis experiences gave currency to the biblical admonition that ``a \nprophet is not without honor save in his own homeland.'' Waring was \nostracized in Charleston and endured harassment and attacks on his \nhome. He retired from the bench in 1952, left his hometown and moved to \nNew York.\n  He had made his mark, however, and his legacy endures. I recall \nattending his graveside services in 1968, which was sparsely attended \nexcept for several of Charleston's African American community and a few \nwhites who stood off at a distance.\n  Thankfully, history has given Judge Waring the favorable recognition \ndenied to him during his life, and passage of his bill will rightfully \nadd to this acclaim.\n  It is often stated that ``the difference between a moment and a \nmovement is sacrifice.'' Judge Waring's sacrifices put him at the \nforefront of a movement. His courage in standing up for what was right, \nwill endure in our nation's memory as a powerful example of \nstatesmanship that must continually be sought, regardless of the issues \nof the day.\n  Of course, none of this today would be possible were it not for \nSenator Ernest Fitzgerald Hollings. Fritz Hollings' record is familiar \nto all of us here.\n  Throughout his career, as Governor of South Carolina when Clemson \nUniversity was integrated and in the United States Senate, when Fritz \nsaw a problem he set about to solve it. When the plight of the poor was \nexposed to him in the late 1960s, he authored the book, The Case \nAgainst Hunger.\n  He led hunger tours to highlight the problem, and ultimately \nchampioned the successful Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for \nWomen, Infants and Children or WIC. As Chairman of the Senate Commerce \nCommittee, he helped usher in a generation of landmark social policy, \nproviding aid of the needy and protecting our environment.\n  He was never afraid to make difficult choices, or to change positions \nwhen he thought it warranted.\n  In the 1980s, Fritz helped secure funding to build the annex to the \nCourthouse that is the subject of this legislation, and the entire \nfacility was subsequently named in his honor.\n  Never content to allow past injustices to go unaddressed, however, he \nhas publicly called on Congress to replace his name on the building, \nwith that of the highly deserving, long unheralded, J. Waties Waring. \nThis selfless act of statesmanship is just the most recent example of \nFritz's visionary leadership.\n  I thank my colleagues in the South Carolina delegation for their \nunanimous support of this bill. I urge its passage by the House to \nhonor this outstanding South Carolinian and great American.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He was awarded the Medal of Honor for \nconspicuous gallantry in action at the risk of his life above and \nbeyond the call of duty.\n  H.R. 2559 is supported by all the local elected officials, community \nleaders, and veterans organizations.\n  I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2559.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH.R. 2559, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This bill designates a 10-mile segment of Interstate 10 between \nmilepost 535 and milepost 545 in Kendall County, Texas, as the PFC \nMilton A. Lee Medal of Honor Memorial Highway. I am pleased to be a \ncosponsor of this bill along with my colleagues from Texas.\n  Private Lee was a hero who tragically lost his life at the age of 19 \nwhile fighting for his country in Vietnam. Milton A. Lee was born \nFebruary 28, 1949, in Shreveport, Louisiana. He later moved to Texas \nand attended Harlandale High School in San Antonio before enlisting in \nthe Army.\n  The actions preceding his death were nothing short of heroic. While \nserving as a radio operator with the 3rd Platoon, Company B, the \nplatoon was surprised by hostile fire by the North Vietnamese Army. \nPrivate Lee moved through the heavy enemy fire to give lifesaving first \naid to his wounded fellow soldiers.\n  As the platoon was advancing to reorganize, Private Lee noticed four \nhidden North Vietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket \nlauncher ready to attack the lead element of the platoon. He selflessly \ncharged through the enemy fire and overran their position, killing the \nattackers and capturing their weapons. His actions saved the lives of \nhis fellow soldiers and were instrumental in the destruction of the key \nposition of the enemy defense.\n  Private Lee died April 26, 1968. He was awarded the Medal of Honor in \n1970 for his gallantry at the risk of his life above and beyond the \ncall of duty.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that we can come to the floor of the House \ntoday and celebrate this young man's courage and conviction by naming a \nportion of Interstate 10 in his honor. This bill is a fitting tribute.\n  Before I close, I would like to remind my colleagues that there are \nonly 23 legislative days left before highway and transit program \nauthorizations expire. Here we are again on the brink of yet another \nextension in the middle of the summer construction season. I strongly \nurge my colleagues to take up the charge to restore our Nation's \ninfrastructure. If we do not act quickly, we will soon not have any \nmiles of road left worthy of naming after any great American. I support \nthis bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith), my good friend.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and \ncolleague from Missouri, Representative Graves, for yielding me time.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a privilege to recognize veteran, patriot, and \nMedal of\n\n[[Page H4353]]\n\nHonor recipient Milton A. Lee today. Earlier this year, I introduced \nH.R. 2559, which designates a portion of Interstate Highway 10 in \nBoerne, Texas, as PFC Milton A. Lee Medal of Honor Memorial Highway.\n  PFC Lee was born on February 28, 1949, in Shreveport, Louisiana. \nWhile he was not born in Texas, Lee entered the Army in San Antonio, \nserved honorably in the Vietnam war, and was laid to rest at Fort Sam \nHouston, which is located in my district.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  PFC Lee served as a radio telephone operator with the 3rd Platoon, \nCompany B, during an intense, surprise hostile attack by North \nVietnamese army fighters. The 3rd Platoon maneuvered to a position of \ncover to treat their wounded and reorganize. Meanwhile, PFC Lee moved \nthrough the heavy enemy fire to give lifesaving first aid to his \nwounded fellow soldiers. During the subsequent assault, PFC Lee \ncontinuously kept close radio contact with the company commander and \nrelayed precise and understandable information to his platoon leader.\n  While advancing toward the objective, PFC Lee observed four North \nVietnamese soldiers with automatic weapons and a rocket launcher lying \nin wait for his platoon. PFC Lee immediately, and with great risk to \nhis own personal safety, passed his radio to another soldier and \ncharged through the barrage of fire. Without hesitation, he continued \nhis attack and successfully overran the enemy position, killing all \noccupants and capturing four automatic weapons and a rocket launcher.\n  PFC Lee continued his one-man assault on another enemy position \nthrough a heavy barrage of enemy automatic weapons fire. Although \nwounded, he continued to press the attack and crawled forward into a \nfiring position to deliver accurate cover fire for his platoon. This \nenabled his platoon to maneuver and destroy the enemy position. Not \nuntil the position was overrun did PFC Lee falter in his steady volume \nof fire and succumb to his wounds.\n  PFC Lee's heroic actions saved the lives of many in his platoon and \nwere instrumental in the destruction of a key position of the enemy's \ndefense. PFC Lee's gallantry at the risk of life above and beyond the \ncall of duty epitomizes the highest traditions of the military service \nand reflects great credit on himself, the 502nd Infantry, and the U.S. \nArmy.\n  So today, I urge my colleagues to support this bill in honor of an \nAmerican hero. In giving his life for our country in such a selfless \nand heroic fashion, PFC Lee is deserving of our naming a portion of a \nFederal highway in his honor.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no further \nrequests for time, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I would also like to urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill. I think what we are trying to do here \nis very fitting.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Graves) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2559.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the \nyeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4353-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4353-H4357]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nURGING IRAN TO RELEASE ALL DETAINED UNITED STATES CITIZENS AND PROVIDE \nANY INFORMATION REGARDING UNITED STATES CITIZENS THAT HAVE DISAPPEARED \n                           WITHIN ITS BORDERS\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to the \nresolution (H. Res. 233) expressing the sense of the House of \nRepresentatives that Iran should immediately release the three United \nStates citizens that it holds, as well as provide all known information \non any United States citizens that have disappeared within its borders.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 233\n\n       Whereas three United States citizens have been held captive \n     in Iran, some of them for multiple years;\n       Whereas one United States citizen disappeared in Iran over \n     eight years ago; and\n       Whereas Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has stated that \n     his government wishes to engage in a constructive interaction \n     with the world: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That it is the sense of the House of \n     Representatives that Iran should release all detained United \n     States citizens immediately and provide any information it \n     possesses regarding any United States citizens that have \n     disappeared within its borders.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, we consider H. Res. 233, expressing the sense of \nthe House of Representatives that Iran should immediately release all \ndetained U.S. citizens as well as provide all known information on any \nU.S. citizens who have disappeared within the borders of Iran.\n  As always, I appreciate the support of the ranking member, Mr. Engel \nof New York, in bringing this resolution to the floor. I also want to \nacknowledge the author of this measure, Congressman Kildee of Michigan, \nas well as those Members who continue to stress how important it is \nthat this body speak out on this issue. These citizens need to be \nallowed to come home now. They are U.S. citizens.\n  In particular, I want to thank Mr. Deutch, who is with us here today, \nwho is a senior member of our committee. He has been consistently \nfocused for many years on the case of his missing constituent.\n  Two weeks ago, the Foreign Affairs Committee held a hearing at which \nthe family members of four Americans--three in prison and one missing \nin Iran for 8 years--testified. This was the first time all four of the \nfamilies came together for such a hearing. We heard and saw the \nexcruciating pain that they are living with day in and day out, not \nknowing if and when they will see their husband, their father, or their \nbrother again. Each of these tragic cases underscores the complete lack \nof justice and, frankly, the brutal treatment that these Americans have \nfaced in Iran.\n  Jason Rezaian is a journalist who was born and raised in California. \nHe had hoped to use his position at The Washington Post to present a \ngreater understanding of the Iranian people. Instead, he has been \narrested on trumped-up charges and has been held for over 300 days at \nthe infamous Evin Prison. Last week, a second closed hearing in his \ntrial was held, which, like all other aspects of his case, was shrouded \nin secrecy.\n  In September of 2012, Iran arrested and later sentenced Pastor Saeed \nAbedini to 8 years in prison for gathering with others to study the \nBible, which, as his wife told the committee, is, in fact, a lawful \nact, even under Iranian law, but one which the regime deemed a threat \nto national security. In jail, his guards have attempted to coerce him \nand torture him to get him to renounce his faith, telling him that \notherwise he will serve an even longer time.\n  In August of 2011, Amir Hekmati, who is a former United States \nmarine, was sentenced to death for alleged espionage. This is someone \nwho went to visit his grandparents. Upon appeal, his sentence was \nreduced, by the way, to 10 years. As his sister described to the \ncommittee, her family was told by Iranian officials not to go public \nwith Amir's imprisonment or he would be put in even greater danger. \nWell, as she described to us through tears, despite\n\n[[Page H4354]]\n\ntheir silence, Amir suffered extensive and repeated torture: beaten on \nhis feet with cables and tasered repeatedly in the kidneys. At home, \nhis father is gravely ill. But locked up, Amir can't travel back to see \nhis father.\n  In 2007, Robert Levinson went missing on Iran's Kish Island. Eight \nyears later, Iran continues to refuse to assist the United States in \nlocating him. As his son testified, his father is now the longest held \nhostage in American history.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House stands in solidarity with each of these \nfamilies. Our hearts break for them, and we share their anger and \nfrustration at the desperate position they are facing.\n  As we approach the deadline for negotiations on a nuclear agreement \nwith Iran--one that, no matter the terms, will require us to have at \nleast some trust in the regime--I have to ask the question: What do \nthese four cases say about the regime we are dealing with? If a \njournalist can be suddenly imprisoned on bogus charges, what treatment \ncan international inspectors expect?\n  But more fundamentally, if top Iranian officials can't be counted on \nto assist these wrongfully jailed American citizens, can they be \ncounted on to honor the commitments they make at the negotiating table?\n  This, by the way, is why verification is such an important part of an \nagreement. But on the question of whether they can be counted on, call \nme a skeptic.\n  I also have to ask why the administration, on the brink of striking a \ndeal in which we would give the Iranians tens of billions of dollars in \nsanctions relief, is failing here.\n  The bottom line expressed in this resolution today is that these four \nAmericans must be allowed home now, and that is a sentiment that all of \nus can support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H. Res. 233, calling for the release of \nAmericans held or missing in Iran.\n  First of all, I want to associate my feelings with the remarks of our \nchairman, Congressman Royce. I think he hit the nail right on the head \nseveral times with his statement. I agree with every word he uttered.\n  It is just ludicrous that at a time where we are weeks away from \nostensibly completing an agreement with Iran, that our hostages--I \ncan't think of any other word for them--are being treated so shabbily \nby the Iranian regime. As far as I am concerned, it casts a pall on any \npotential agreement that we have with Iran on June 30. If this is the \nway they are treating Americans, how can we rely on them or count on \nthem to fulfill their obligations under any agreement we sign with \nthem?\n  It is just ludicrous that here we are at the eleventh hour. You would \nthink the Iranian regime would want to start acting favorably so that \nwe in Congress might favorably look upon any deal that could be \nreached. Instead, they are continuing their old ways and doing just the \nopposite. It just doesn't make any sense. It doesn't help us to trust \nthem, it doesn't help us to believe them, and it only furthers all the \nthings that we have seen and heard and questioned about this rogue \nregime in Tehran.\n  I want to thank Representative Kildee for authoring this resolution. \nHe has been a champion for these four Americans and their families. As \nI said at our hearing, he has been unrelenting in terms of fighting for \nhis constituent and for the others who are held in Iranian prisons.\n  Representative Deutch, the ranking member of the Middle East and \nNorth Africa Subcommittee, who also has a constituent who is a hostage, \nhas also been very vociferous. And Representative Huffman is always \ntalking to us about these issues and always looking to free all these \nAmericans in prison. Also Representative Labrador, and Representative \nKildee has assured that these Americans are not forgotten in Congress.\n\n  As was mentioned, 2 weeks ago, our committee heard from the Hekmati, \nRezaian, Levinson, and Abedini families. Their stories were \nheartbreaking, their pleas heartfelt, and as they made clear in their \ntestimony, their cause is our cause. It is America's cause.\n  We are a few weeks away, as I said before, from an important deadline \nin the Iranian nuclear talks. It is ridiculous that our citizens \nlanguish in Iranian jails while we negotiate. At the same time, as the \nfamilies of the Americans point out, these negotiations have given us \nthe only opportunity to directly raise the cases of the four Americans \nwith the Iranian Government, and we are assured by the administration \nthat at every instance they raise these cases with the Iranian \nGovernment.\n  I am happy they raise the cases. I am grateful that they raise these \ncases. But, of course, if we don't get these people home, it is all for \nnaught. I cannot imagine having an agreement with Iran that doesn't \ntake into account these people, that doesn't release these people. It \nwould just be a dereliction of our duties and responsibility to have an \nagreement with Iran while not bargaining or getting the freedom of \nthese people. We don't want these people used as a bargaining chip, but \non the other hand, we don't want these people to remain in jail after \nthere is some kind of an agreement with Iran.\n  I wish we knew more about the conditions of these four Americans, but \nin these cases, Iran isn't playing by the rules once again. Typically, \nif an American were detained in Iran, Switzerland, the U.S. \n``protecting power'' in Iran, would have access to them for consular \nservices. It is not the case here.\n  In the cases of these three Iranian Americans, Iran doesn't even \nacknowledge their dual citizenship--only their Iranian citizenship. \nThis position runs roughshod over long-established international law.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Without consular access, we cannot judge the health and welfare of \nour own American citizens. This is unacceptable. The United States \nrespects this access for Iranian citizens held here. Reciprocal \nprivileges are the least they could provide.\n  Sadly, Mr. Deutch's constituent--Robert Levinson's whereabouts are \nunknown. I simply don't believe the Iranians have been forthcoming at \nall about his status. If he is, indeed, still a hostage, he is now the \nlongest held hostage in American history. We shouldn't stand for this. \nWe shouldn't sit still while this continues.\n  I will weigh the nuclear deal carefully when it comes to us, but \nIran's leaders could send the American people a gesture of goodwill by \nproviding more information about Robert Levinson and by freeing Saeed \nAbedini, Amir Hekmati, and Jason Rezaian.\n  By the way, Mr. Rezaian is the bureau chief, the Tehran bureau chief \nof The Washington Post, unbelievable that he would be arrested for \nespionage, ludicrous, ridiculous.\n  This is a concern all of us share. It doesn't matter where you come \nfrom in this country or what your political affiliation is. These are \nAmericans, and we all want to see these four Americans come home safely \nto their families.\n  I applaud this resolution, urge my colleagues to support it, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Mr. Engel has shared with you that the government in \nIran refuses to recognize the U.S. nationality for Jason Rezaian. Jason \nwas born in California. He was born a U.S. citizen here in the United \nStates, raised in California; and their position is that, no, he is an \nIranian citizen.\n  He was over there to see his grandmother. No, he was over there \nreporting because he wanted to get an opportunity for greater \nunderstanding of the citizens in Iran.\n  The fact that we allow a situation like this to stand, when American \ncitizens are being held like this and subjected to show trials, is \nappalling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Africa, Global \nHealth, Global Human Rights, and International Organizations, and a \nlongtime critic of the human rights abuses that have occurred in Iran.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank our distinguished \nchairman and thank both he and Eliot Engel for the leadership that they \nhave both shown.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for keeping that focus on all \nissues related to Iran and for doing it so effectively, including and \nespecially the\n\n[[Page H4355]]\n\nhuman rights abuses that are occurring there each and every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, the most important duty of the President of the United \nStates is to keep Americans safe from harm, whether they are at home or \nabroad. Three innocent Americans continue to be brutalized in Iran \nprisons and trapped in a system of sham trials. A fourth American, \nanother innocent man, has been missing from Iran for more than 8 years \nand presumed to also be imprisoned in that country.\n  When Americans have been hostages in foreign lands or on foreign \nseas, Presidents from both parties have prioritized their rescue, \nsometimes even asking the finest from our fighting forces to risk their \nlives to save them.\n  It is an important question why the President has failed to make the \nrelease of our fellow Americans his top priority with the Iranian \nregime. How often have we heard the administration speak out, pressure \nbeing put to bear on the Iranian regime, even as the talks continue on \nthe nuclear issue?\n  It seems to me I will never forget when Nagameh Abedini came and \ntestified at one of Frank Wolf's hearings. She said they told her there \nwas nothing they could do for her husband at the U.S. Department of \nState.\n  Thankfully, a call to John Kerry by Mr. Wolf, chairman of the Lantos \ncommittee at the time, did yield fruit; and they did begin to raise his \nname and his calls.\n  The President seems to think, however, that the Iranian regime can be \ntrusted to keep a nuclear deal and no longer seek to develop and make \nnuclear weapons. I would suggest that a regime that continues to \nimprison our fellow citizens cannot be trusted.\n  A regime that so regularly and violently violates human rights and \nbasic freedoms of its own people cannot be trusted. A regime that \nsponsors terrorism against other countries as a tool of foreign policy \ncannot be trusted.\n  H. Res. 233 makes very clear that Iran should release all detained \nU.S. citizens immediately and provide any information it possesses \nregarding any United States citizens that have disappeared within its \nborders.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must remember the husbands and fathers, sons and \ndaughters, the families, in addition to those who are being exploited \nand cruelly mistreated.\n  I want to thank Chairman Royce for the hearing that he just convened \na few days ago. We heard from the family members. Their plea was \nimpassioned. It was heartbreaking, and it was very, very motivating.\n  Imprisoned since 2012, Pastor Abedini, 35 years old, husband of \nNagameh Abedini--who testified several times before my subcommittee and \nhas been an extraordinary champion for his release--father of two \nchildren, he had returned to Iran to build an orphanage. He had gotten \nprior clearance, told that he could do it. Once he was there, they \narrested him, and they have mistreated him ever since then.\n  Imprisoned since 2012, Amir Hekmati, 31 years old, a former sergeant \nin the U.S. Marine Corps. He had returned to Iran to visit his \ngrandmother and other relatives. They scooped him up, and he has been \nmistreated ever since.\n  Imprisoned since 2011, Jason Rezaian, 39 years old, Tehran's bureau \nchief for The Washington Post, a reporter who publishes what is going \non in that regime, he now is facing a trial, a show trial, a sham \ntrial.\n  Imprisoned since 2014, Robert Levinson, 67 years old, husband, \nfather, grandfather, he has been missing in Iran since the year 2007.\n  Mr. Speaker, Pastor Abedini, Mr. Hekmati, Mr. Rezaian, and Mr. \nLevinson are all Americans, and they are being, right today, subjected \nto abuse and cruelty. They are all prisoners or missing in Iran.\n  We call on the administration to retriple its efforts to secure their \nrelease.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), who has been the staunchest \nsupporter of getting these people free, who has raised this issue so \nmany times, and who is the author of this resolution.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to start by thanking Chairman Royce \nfor his efforts on this resolution and my friend Ranking Member Engel, \nas well, for his efforts, along with the 201 Members of this body who \nhave cosponsored this, most particularly Mr. Deutch, Mr. Huffman, and \nMr. Labrador, who have worked with me and my staff in preparing this \nresolution.\n  I want to speak briefly about Amir Hekmati, my constituent, a young \nman who is an American citizen, born in the United States, raised in my \nhometown of Flint, Michigan, served in the United States Marine Corps. \nHe is a brother; he is a son; he is a Michigander.\n  Back in 2011, for the first time, he traveled to Iran to visit his \ngrandmother, as has been said. He notified the Iranian Government that \nhe was going to Iran. He traveled under his own name. He disclosed his \nhistory as a member of the United States Marine Corps.\n  He was in Iran for almost 3 weeks when he was apprehended. Initially \ntried and convicted and sentenced to death for espionage, that sentence \nwas later set aside, but he continues to languish in Evin Prison, \nserving a 10-year sentence.\n  I want the world to know about Amir. I want people to know his name, \njust as we want the world to know the names of Jason Rezaian, Saeed \nAbedini, and Bob Levinson. These are real people. Amir is a real \nperson. He grew up in my hometown of Flint, like me, played high school \nhockey.\n  It is important that we remember these names. These are individuals. \nThey are not just pawns in a geopolitical struggle between Iran and the \nrest of the world. They are individuals. They are people. They have \nfamilies. They feel pain. They suffer.\n  Amir Hekmati has been in Evin Prison for 1,386 days. It is long past \ntime for him to be reunited with his family. He has committed no crime; \nyet he continues to sit in that prison, in a dark cell.\n  If Iran is serious about rejoining the community of nations, about \nbeing a member of the international community, they will release--\nimmediately release--Amir Hekmati and the other Americans that they \nhold.\n  That is why it is so important that this House pass this resolution \nand speak for the American people with one voice. We have lots of \ndisagreements in this place.\n  There should be no question here in the United States, across the \nworld, but especially within the Iranian Government and among the \nIranian people, there should be no question that this body, this House \nof Representatives, which often disagrees, has no disagreement on the \nquestion of these Americans.\n  If Iran wants to be taken seriously, if anything they do, if any \nengagement that they have with the world, whether it is a nuclear \nagreement or economic engagement, if any of that is to be legitimate, \nthey cannot hold political prisoners; and they need to take action to \nrelease Amir Hekmati and the other Americans that they hold.\n  Now, the fact that the P5+1 negotiations are underway does give us \nspace for something that we haven't had in 35 years, and that is \nbilateral discussion on the sidelines of those nuclear agreements, but \nwhile it does provide the moment, there is one point that I do want to \nmake, and others have spoken to this.\n  It is difficult to imagine taking any agreement with them seriously \nas long as Iran holds these Americans, but it is also important that we \nkeep in mind that we never want to be in a position where, as part of a \ntransaction with Iran, we exchange the freedom of these Americans for a \nconcession at the nuclear negotiating table, a concession that may make \nthe world a less safe place.\n  We don't want that, and I know that Amir Hekmati, through his family, \nhas communicated to us that he does not want to be exchanged for \nanything.\n  I think it is fair, as Members have said, that Congress considers all \nof Iran's behavior when considering any engagement with them, whether \nit is a nuclear agreement or anything else.\n  When I have spoken to the President and the Vice President or Wendy \nSherman or Samantha Power, our U.N. representative, I have made it \nclear to them that, while it is important that we get our Americans \nhome, we don't want to see the world become a less safe place in \nexchange for the freedom of innocent people. They have agreed\n\n[[Page H4356]]\n\nwith that, and they have shared that with the Iranian Government at \nevery opportunity.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank my friend.\n  Simple point, Congress, today, will speak with one voice and say to \nthe Iranian people, say to the world, that these Americans--this \nresolution will say, with absolute clarity, that if Iran expects to be \ntreated as a member of the international community, they will \nunilaterally release these Americans.\n  It would advance their cause, presumably, of joining the global \ncommunity. It would send a strong message to the rest of the world and \nto the United States and to this Congress that they can and should be \ntaken seriously, but it is very difficult to imagine doing that if they \ncontinue to hold Amir Hekmati and the other Americans they hold.\n  I just want to reiterate my gratitude to Chairman Royce and Ranking \nMember Engel and the whole committee, the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nand the whole House for their support of this. The families of these \nindividuals, I know, appreciate it very deeply, and I do as well.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my pleasure to yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Huffman), a Member who has also been \nfighting for his constituent, who has brought this issue up with us so \nmany times, who has been unyielding in trying to get freedom for all \nthe hostages.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I do want to start by thanking Chairman \nRoyce and Ranking Member Engel for moving this bill forward; and a huge \nthanks to my great colleague from Michigan, Representative Kildee, he \nhas been described as tireless and courageous and relentless. He is all \nof that and more in working to highlight the injustice that these \nAmerican detainees are facing in Iran.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  One of these detainees, Jason Rezaian, has been mentioned as having \ngrown up in California. He actually grew up in my district. I have \ngotten to know his family. And in some way, I feel like I have gotten \nto know Jason--at least a little bit--through this tragic situation. So \nI know something about the terrible hardship that he and his family \nhave been going through for this past year.\n  It is with that unconscionable level of hardship in mind that I am \nproud to join with my colleagues in working to make sure that Congress \ndoes everything that it can to secure Jason's safe release and also the \nsafe release of these other unjustly detained Americans.\n  Passing this resolution on a bipartisan basis is one of the most \nimportant things that we can do to reaffirm to the Iranian regime that \nthe whole world is watching.\n  Jason Rezaian was The Washington Post Tehran bureau chief when he was \narrested in Tehran on July 22 last year. He has now been held twice as \nlong as any previous western journalist in Iran.\n  The circumstances under which he has been held are an absolute \nmockery of justice. There has never been any evidence brought against \nhim. For 9 months, there were no charges brought against him publicly. \nJason was denied the most basic rights: denied access to a lawyer for \nmonths, denied bail after he was charged, and held in solitary \nconfinement after his investigation ended.\n  Jason's family members and his fellow journalists have been fierce \nadvocates for his freedom. I hope that the passage of this resolution \ntoday will make the sentiment of Congress very clear: that Iran should \nimmediately release Jason Rezaian and the other detained Americans.\n  Whatever issues or disagreements that we may have about broader \nissues involving Iran, it is important that we are able to speak today \nwith one voice for the Americans who are unjustly detained and for \ntheir families. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, it is now my great pleasure to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Deutch), one of the senior \nmembers of our Foreign Affairs Committee, the ranking member on the \nMiddle East and North Africa Subcommittee, and someone whom I turn to \nvery often for advice and counsel, who has been a clear and effective \nvoice in trying to bring our hostages home.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member, for \nyielding. I thank the chairman. I especially went to thank my friend \nand colleague from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for spearheading this \nresolution and for his tireless efforts to bring back his constituent. \nAnd I want to thank the fellow original cosponsors, Mr. Huffman and Mr. \nLabrador.\n  Each of us here has the solemn responsibility to represent the \nfamilies of these American citizens--in this case, our constituents who \nare missing or held in Iran. Each of us has seen the suffering of these \nfamilies firsthand. We have also seen a remarkable strength of purpose \nas they live this real-life nightmare and do everything they can to \nbring their loved ones home.\n  For the family of Robert Levinson, my constituent, 8 years is 8 years \ntoo long not to have their husband, their father, and their grandfather \nhome.\n  Bob Levinson went missing on Iran's Kish Island on March 9, 2007. \nSince his disappearance, the Levinson family has received proof of life \nin the form of pictures and videos. Iran's leaders have never provided \nany information about Bob's disappearance, despite repeated pledges to \naid in the investigation.\n  As negotiations with Iran have taken place over the past year and a \nhalf, many of us have doubts about the ability to trust Iran to follow \nthrough on the terms of any nuclear deal. We distrust because we have \nseen this regime time and again lie to the international community, \nsupport the world's worst actors and terrorists, destabilize the \nregion, deny history, and chant ``death to America.'' So if Iran wants \nto be taken seriously by the international community, then it must \nstart by dropping the bogus charges and releasing Amir Hekmati, Saeed \nAbedini, and Jason Rezaian; and immediately assist in locating and \nreturning Bob Levinson.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are just weeks away from the June 30 deadline for a \nnuclear deal. We are grateful that the Secretary and the other \nnegotiators have raised this issue inside meetings.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. DEUTCH. But we have enormous leverage right now, and we must use \nit for Jason Rezaian, for Saeed Abedini, for Amir Hekmati, and for my \nconstituent Bob Levinson.\n  If Iran wants the world to believe what it says at the negotiating \ntable, if it expects the world to trust any of the commitments that it \nwill make or promises to make in a nuclear deal, then it should send \nthese Americans home.\n  By passing this bipartisan resolution today, we will show the world \nthat this is an issue that transcends politics. We gather here today in \nthe United States House of Representatives, the people's House, to show \nthat Members of Congress and the American people are united in \ndemanding the safe return of these four Americans. Mr. Speaker, it is \ntime to bring them home.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, again, urge my colleagues to \nsupport this resolution at this critical time.\n  I thank my colleague, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee), for \nhis work on this.\n  We are in the final days of the nuclear negotiations, as has been \nmentioned before, with Iran. And as the families of these Americans \npoint out, when these negotiations are over, if we do nothing, so too \nmay be the chance of the United States to engage directly with Iran \nover the fate of their family members. So we must not let this \nopportunity go to waste.\n  We call on Iran to release Amir Hekmati, Jason Rezaian, Saeed \nAbedini, and Robert Levinson; to live up to their pledge to provide \nfurther information about Robert Levinson; and\n\n[[Page H4357]]\n\nto bring these men home to their families.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As I have made clear before, I have serious reservations about the \ndirection of our negotiations with Iran, and this is based in no small \npart on its treatment of the four Americans we are speaking about today \nand what that predicts going forward.\n  Let's not forget, this is a regime--and we can turn on the set and \nwatch their rallies--where regularly the chant ``death to America'' is \nused to rouse the most fervent supporters of the Supreme Leader. This \nis a regime that has killed its own citizens outright or convicted and \nimprisoned them based on confessions obtained by torture. This is a \nregime that takes U.S. citizens into captivity, tortures them, and then \ndenies them medical treatment, denies them basic legal representation, \ndenies them due process.\n  Last month, just prior to Jason's so-called trial, Washington Post \neditor Martin Baron issued a compelling statement, and I will read part \nof it:\n  ``It's worth recalling what kind of system we're dealing with. Jason \nwas arrested without charges. He was imprisoned in Iran's worst prison. \nHe was placed in isolation for many months and denied medical care he \nneeded. His case was assigned to a judge internationally notorious for \nhuman rights violations. He could not select the lawyer of his \nchoosing. He was given only an hour and a half to meet with a lawyer \napproved by the court. No evidence has ever been produced by \nprosecutors or the court to support these absurd charges. The trial \ndate was only disclosed to Jason's lawyer last week. And now, \nunsurprisingly but unforgivably, it turns out the trial will be \nclosed.''\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot allow ourselves to lose sight of these facts. \nFaced with this, those making the case that Iran will be transparent \nwith the international community on inspections that will be part of \nany nuclear deal seem to be thinking about the Iran they want, not the \none in actuality, the one that is brutalizing Americans.\n  Nuclear deal or not, these Americans deserve to be back with their \nfamilies today.\n  I urge all Members to support this resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in support of H.R. 891, introduced by Representative Henry \nCuellar.\n  H.R. 891 designates the post office located at 141 Paloma Drive in \nFloresville, Texas, as the Floresville Veterans Post Office Building.\n  This excellent bill honors the men and women of Floresville, Texas, \nwho served our country. We are grateful for their service and for the \nservice of all of our veterans and their sacrifices in the service to \nour great Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to support this bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting H.R. \n891, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 141 Paloma Drive in Floresville, Texas, as the \nFloresville Veterans Post Office Building.\n  This legislation commemorates the sacrifices made by the servicemen \nand -women of Floresville, Texas. Whether they served abroad or at \nhome, our military men and women have courageously given their time and \nenergy to defend the many freedoms we Americans hold so dear. \nRecognizing the loyalty and bravery of our veterans by naming this post \noffice in their honor is the least we can do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill \nthat would recognize the honorable service and countless sacrifices \nmade by our veterans and their families. I urge the passage of H.R. \n891, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Cuellar).\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Delegate Plaskett for \nyielding the time to me, and thank you so much also to the majority \nmanager for speaking in favor of this bill. And certainly I also want \nto thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for their \nleadership and support, along with the committee members, for bringing \nthis bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 891, which designates the \nfacility of the United States Postal Service, located at 141 Paloma \nDrive in Floresville, Texas, as the Floresville Veterans Post Office \nBuilding.\n  Floresville is the county seat of Wilson County, Texas, which has \n4,636 veterans currently residing there. Just across the street from \nthis postal facility is the Frank M. Tejeda Texas State Veterans Home, \nwhich currently houses about 154 of our American veterans. It is \nfitting that we provide this acknowledgement to our Floresville \nveterans directly across the street from where many of them live now.\n  There are many stories from veterans all across Wilson County that \nhave served, but I want to highlight a few of those from Floresville. \nLet me start first with Frank Villarreal, who is a veteran who served \nin Vietnam with the U.S. Navy Seawolves helicopter squadron, which \nprovided support for\n\n[[Page H4358]]\n\nthe Navy SEALs. Mr. Villarreal has received 15 awards for his service, \nincluding the Distinguished Flying Cross, the National Defense Service \nMedal, the Vietnam Service Medal with two Bronze Stars, the Vietnam \nCampaign Medal, the Gallantry Cross with Palm and Frame, the Civil \nAction Color with Palm and Frame, and the Combat Aircrewman Insignia.\n  To highlight a couple of other gentlemen also, Pedro Devora and \nRufino Gonzales both served on the same ship in World War II, on the \nUSS Sangamon. They survived a kamikaze attack on their vessel, and they \nwent home to live long lives in Floresville.\n  Additionally, I want to also say that Mr. Devora and Mr. Gonzales \nobtained the medals they earned during their service that they recently \njust got from the Department of the Navy. For Mr. Devora, these medals \nare the World War II Victory Medal, the American Campaign Medal, the \nPresidential Unit Citation Ribbon, the Combat Action Ribbon, the \nHonorable Service Lapel Pin, and the Asiatic Pacific Campaign Medal \nwith the Bronze Star also.\n  For Mr. Gonzales, these medals include the World War II Victory \nMedal, the American Campaign Medal, the Presidential Unit Citation \nRibbon, the Combat Action Ribbon, along with the Asiatic Pacific \nCampaign Medal along with the Bronze Star also.\n  Again, those are only just a few examples of the men and women from \nWilson County--in particular, from Floresville--that have served. So I \nwant to acknowledge the sacrifice of those veterans along with the \nveterans from my 28th Congressional District, individuals who served \nand put their country ahead of self and for whom I am recognizing with \nthe renaming of the Floresville postal facility service.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank also the work of The American Legion \nPost 38 in Floresville and the VFW Post 8555 in Wilson County for the \nwork that they have done in supporting our local veterans. The VFW Post \n8555 in Wilson County has done a great job, and I want to thank them.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, and to our ranking member and our ranking delegate, \nI just want to say thank you so much.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of the bill, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Ferguson Post Office.\n  Born and raised in Mulberry, Florida, Daniel Ferguson was a standout \nathlete at Mulberry High School, where he lettered in five sports, \nincluding baseball, football, and track. After joining the Army in \n1993, Daniel dedicated the rest of his life to the service of our \ncountry. Over the next 20 years, Daniel completed tours in Kuwait, \nIraq, and Afghanistan. Following his final deployment, Sergeant First \nClass Ferguson was stationed as an Army transportation supervisor at \nFort Hood, Texas, beginning in March 2013.\n  On April 2, 2014, Sergeant First Class Ferguson made the ultimate \nsacrifice. Sergeant First Class Ferguson witnessed a shooting rampage \nbreak out on base, and seeing the shooter approaching the room where he \nand his colleagues gathered, held himself against an unlocked door and \nused his body as a shield. Tragically, Sergeant First Class Ferguson \nlost his life that day, but through his courage and selflessness, many \nof his colleagues survived. Sergeant First Class Ferguson is remembered \nby his fiance, fellow soldier Kristen Haley, and all those who knew him \nfor his loyalty, bravery, and heroism. He was awarded the Bronze Star \nand a Meritorious Service Medal, among others, for his military \nservice.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to commemorate the ultimate \nsacrifice made by Sergeant First Class Daniel Ferguson, and to honor \nhis devoted service to the protection of our country abroad, as well as \nhis fellow soldiers at home.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 1326, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am pleased to yield such \ntime as he may consume to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross), the \nsponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from North Carolina and \nmy colleague from the Virgin Islands.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. 1326, to dedicate the \npost office located at 2000 Mulford Road in Mulberry, Florida, after \nSergeant First Class Daniel M. Ferguson.\n  The tragic events of April 2, 2014, when a shooter killed three of \nhis fellow servicemembers at Fort Hood, Texas, shook our military \ncommunity and our Nation.\n  However, some may not remember a story of heroism that came out of \nthat horrific event. Sergeant First Class Daniel M. Ferguson, who was \nstationed at Fort Hood along with his fiance, sacrificed his life to \nsave his fellow soldiers. A veteran of Kuwait, Iraq, and Afghanistan, \nSergeant First Class Ferguson bravely wedged himself against a set of \nunlocked doors to block the attacker's advance. Without his heroic \nactions, those present that day have said there would have been many \nmore casualties and fatalities.\n  Sergeant First Class Ferguson succumbed to the wounds he sustained \nduring this act of violence, leaving behind many heartbroken loved ones \nbut also very many grateful soldiers. Without hesitation, Sergeant \nFirst Class Ferguson gave his own life to protect the lives of his \nfellow men and women in uniform.\n  Sergeant First Class Ferguson was a tremendous soldier and a graduate \nof Mulberry High School who gave the ultimate sacrifice for the love of \nhis country.\n  That is why, in honor of his courageous sacrifice, I am proud to \nintroduce this bill and proud to ask my colleagues to recognize such an \nhonorable American.\n\n[[Page H4359]]\n\n  For Sergeant First Class Ferguson, his family, and the residents of \nMulberry, Florida, I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting such \na worthy cause.\n  Ms. PLASKETT.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As a Virgin Islander living next door to Puerto Rico and as a former \nassistant district attorney in Bronx County, where Mr. Badillo lived, \nit gives me great pleasure to join my colleagues in supporting H.R. \n1350, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService located at 442 East 167th Street in Bronx, New York, as the \nHerman Badillo Post Office Building.\n  Born in Caguas, Puerto Rico, on August 21, 1929, Mr. Badillo went on \nto become America's first Puerto Rican-born Congressman and a prominent \nfigure in New York City politics. The only son of Francisco and Carmen \nRivera Badillo, he suffered the loss of both his parents by his fifth \nbirthday. He was taken in by relatives, and at the age of 11, without \nknowing English, moved to East Harlem, New York. He learned English and \nexcelled in school, working his way through college and law school as a \ndishwasher, bowling pinsetter, and accountant. After graduating with \nhigh honors from City College in 1951, Herman went on to become \nvaledictorian of his Brooklyn Law School class in 1954.\n  Herman Badillo practiced law in New York and won election as Bronx \nBorough president in 1965. He ran for Congress and won in 1970. While \nMr. Badillo was considered a Democrat during his 7 years in this \nChamber, he did not view himself as bound by party loyalties. Mr. \nBadillo served this Chamber with honor and distinction for 7 years \nbefore resigning his seat in 1977 to serve the people of New York as \ndeputy mayor to New York Mayor Ed Koch. Mr. Badillo continued to serve \nthe city of New York and remained involved in education reform until he \ndied at age 85 on December 3, 2014. He is survived by his wife, Gail, \nand his son, David.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill to honor Herman Badillo's \nlifetime of service and dedication to the city of New York and to this \ncountry.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 1350, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano).\n  (Mr. SERRANO asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. SERRANO. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Plaskett for the time, and \nthank both Mr. Walker and Ms. Plaskett for that wonderful presentation \nof the life of one of my predecessors, Herman Badillo. And so rather \nthan get into the details that have already been mentioned, let me just \ntell you personally what it means to me, what he meant to me, and what \nthis loss of his passing means to all of us.\n  Herman came along at a time when Puerto Ricans in New York were seen \nas good, hard-working people, but some people were not crazy about the \nidea of us being in public office or in government, and he showed the \nway. Having been valedictorian at law school, he came and he \nimmediately got involved in local politics. It is said that by the age \nof 18, he was already running for local office in East Harlem.\n  He became the first Bronx Borough president. That is equivalent to a \ncounty executive of Puerto Rican background. Then he ran for Congress, \nbeing the first voting Member of Congress. Let me just explain that for \na second. There has been a Member of Congress from Puerto Rico since \n1998, but none, to this day, has had full voting rights. He was the \nfirst one of Puerto Rican background with full voting rights in 1970.\n  He left this place that he loved so much to become deputy mayor \nbecause he felt that he could make a difference in New York, and he \nserved under the administration of Ed Koch. During the time he was \nhere, he helped to found the Congressional Hispanic Caucus; he helped \nwith issues of education and housing, and just economic development for \nour community.\n  But for those of us who were starting out, he stood as a giant. He \nstood as this tall man, which he was, who was totally bilingual, who \ncould speak well, who could think well, who was so calm yet so \naggressive, and he inspired all of us. I know that on the House floor \nwe don't mention political campaigns, but it can be said that when I \nfirst ran in 1974 for the State assembly, he was at my side. And that \nwas part of who he was.\n  He encouraged young people from the community, from all walks of \nlife, to get involved in politics. I remember he always used to tell \nme, Make sure the same thing everywhere you go. Don't\n\n[[Page H4360]]\n\nplay to that audience and then play to that audience, because, first of \nall, that is wrong and, secondly, you will get caught up in making a \nmistake or telling a lie. So make sure you say what you feel from the \nheart, even if it upsets people.\n  Now in New York, it is very fashionable, although it takes hard work, \nfor Latinos of all different groups to be members of the city council \nand the State assembly and the State Senate and, yes, the Congress. But \nwhen Herman came along, that wasn't the case. He opened up those doors, \nand he inspired all of us to become who we are today. I could not be a \nMember of Congress now had he not shown the way that people like us \ncould, in fact, be a Member of Congress.\n  Part of most of the district I represent used to be in his district, \nso this was a great loss to us. By naming a post office, we can at \nleast always have his name vivid and that respect vivid for this person \nwho came from Puerto Rico and, as was said, who lost both his parents \nbefore the age of 5; who came to New York with an aunt not speaking \nEnglish hardly at all, and yet who excelled in school and became this \nfigure who was nationally known.\n  So, Herman, we thank you for who you were. We thank you for your \nleadership. But most of all, we thank you for putting our community on \nthe political map.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge adoption of this bill, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1350.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4360-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4360-H4361]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1730\n         SERGEANT FIRST CLASS WILLIAM B.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 728, introduced by Representative Blaine \nLuetkemeyer. H.R. 728 designates the post office located at 7050 \nHighway BB in Cedar Hill, Missouri, as the Sergeant First Class William \nB. Woods, Jr. Post Office.\n  Sergeant First Class Woods was a Special Forces senior medical \nsergeant and native of Hermann, Missouri. After graduation from \nNorthwest High School in Cedar Hill, Missouri, he enlisted with the \nUnited States Marine Corps as a rifleman in 1996. Sergeant First Class \nWoods later enlisted in the United States Army, and in 2003, he \nattended the Special Forces qualifications course. Sergeant First Class \nWoods earned the distinguished green beret and was deployed to \nAfghanistan in July 2009 in support of Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  He gave his life for his country about a month later. On August 16, \n2009, in a hospital in Germany, Sergeant First Class Woods died from \nwounds he sustained while conducting a mounted patrol in Ghazni \nprovince, Afghanistan, 2 days before.\n  Sergeant First Class Woods will be remembered not only for his \npersonal accomplishments, graduating from many of the Army's elite \nschools and earning numerous medals, but also as the example of courage \nand sacrifice. I urge Members to support this bill to name a post \noffice in honor of this brave young soldier.\n  I would like to add that Congressman Luetkemeyer was, unfortunately, \nunable to make it this evening for the consideration of his bill, so I \nwill submit for the Record a statement from the Congressman.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in supporting H.R. 728, a bill to \ndesignate the facility of the United States Postal Service located at \n7050 Highway BB in Cedar Hill, Missouri, as the Sergeant First Class \nWilliam B. Woods, Jr. Post Office.\n  Born in Hermann, Missouri, William Woods, Jr., studied photography at \nMontana State University. Following in the footsteps of a long line of \nmilitary men in his family, William enlisted in the United States \nMarine Corps in 1996.\n  There, he served as a scout sniper until joining the U.S. Army \nSpecial Forces as a senior medical sergeant in 2003. He was assigned to \nB Company, 2nd Battalion, 20th Special Forces Group and was stationed \nin Glen Arm, Maryland.\n  Tragically, while serving as a doctor in Ghazni province, \nAfghanistan, Sergeant First Class Woods, Jr., was shot and killed while \non patrol on August 16, 2009.\n  Sergeant First Class Woods, Jr., is survived by his wife, Elizabeth, \nand two daughters, Lily and Ella. He is remembered as an adventurous \noutdoorsman, as well as a dedicated family man, loyal husband, and \nloving father. Sergeant First Class Woods, Jr., received a number of \nawards, including the Bronze Star and the Purple Heart, for his \nservice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill \nto honor the valiant service and sacrifices of Sergeant First Class \nWilliam B. Woods, Jr., and of his family. I urge the passage of H.R. \n728.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I urge the adoption of this bill, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my \nlegislation, H.R. 728, which would designate the facility of the United \nStates Postal Service located at 7050 Highway BB in Cedar Hill, \nMissouri as the ``Sergeant First Class William B. Woods, Jr. Post \nOffice.''\n  SFC Woods was a decorated constituent of the Third district of \nMissouri who dedicated his life to protecting our country. After \ngraduation from Northwest High School in Cedar Hill, Missouri, he first \nenlisted with the United States Marine Corps in 1996 as a rifleman, and \nlater enlisted in the United States Army where he attended the Special \nForces Qualification Course in 2003 and earned the Green Beret. While \nin the U.S. Army, SFC Woods was assigned to the 2nd Battalion, 20th \nSpecial Forces Group (Airborne) and deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 \nduring Operation Enduring Freedom.\n  On August 16, 2009, SFC Woods died in Germany from wounds sustained \nwhile conducting a mounted patrol in the Ghazni Province, Afghanistan \non August 14, 2009. He is survived by his loving wife, Elizabeth, and \ntwo daughters.\n  SFC Woods' many awards and decorations include the Bronze Star Medal, \nPurple Heart Medal, Combat Infantryman Badge, Navy and Marine Corps \nAchievement Medal, National Defense Medal, and Afghanistan Campaign \nMedal with Bronze Service Star, among many others.\n  I am honored to name this post office after SFC Woods. His dedication \nand sacrifices for\n\n[[Page H4361]]\n\nour country should not go unnoticed, and it is the least I can do to \nhonor such a courageous soldier.\n  I want to thank the entire Missouri Delegation for coming together to \ncosponsor this legislation, and Chairman Chaffetz for promptly \nconsidering this legislation in the House Oversight and Government \nReform Committee. It would be an honor to name the Cedar Hill post \noffice in my district after this courageous soldier, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The parents, the \nfamilies, friends, and fans and the entire Eden Prairie community is \nvery proud of these high school athletes.\n  Once again, congratulations to the Eden Prairie Girls Lacrosse Team \non a job well done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4362-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4362-H4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   CONGRATULATING THE NESHANNOCK HIGH LANCERS AND KNOCH HIGH KNIGHTS \n               PENNSYLVANIA STATE CHAMPION BASEBALL TEAMS\n\n  (Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania.

Susan recalls learning about the oil \nindustry from her father and uncle. In 1995, she began work with the \nPenn Brad Oil Museum and eventually served as its president from 2003 \nto 2014.\n  Sherri originally came to the museum for research purposes, but began \nworking at the museum in 2000 and spent 10 years serving the museum in \nvarious roles.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my honor to congratulate these two outstanding \nwomen, and I thank them for their years of dedicated service and \ncontributions to the Pennsylvania oil industry and the Bradford \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4363-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   WE NEED TO SAVE RIVERSIDE HOSPITAL\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE.

This facility is \nformerly the Doctor's Hospital Tidwell in historic Acres Homes \ncommunity.\n  The real value and significance are two things. One, Americans need \naccess to good health care.

On Saturday, I cheered as \nmy grandson Kenan walked across that stage and graduated from Watauga \nHigh School.\n  These new graduates have been blessed with some wonderful teachers. \nThey have learned a great deal--lessons in math, science, history, and \nliterature--but they have also learned lessons in self-discipline, \ncompassion, patience, and understanding.\n  This learning didn't all take place in the classroom. Much of it was \nlearned at home with their families, out with their friends, on the \nfootball field, during summer jobs, and even in brief interactions with \nunexpected people.\n  The choices ahead of them are many, and the road to success will have \nits detours, but they can be anything they want to be by meeting every \nchallenge with integrity and determination.\n  The class of 2015, set your goals and find your dreams. \nCongratulations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4363-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAGNA CARTA'S 800TH ANNIVERSARY\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, today, we celebrate the 800th anniversary \nof the Magna Carta, a document with principles that served as a \ncornerstone in our Nation's founding as the Republic of the United \nStates of America.\n  Eight hundred years ago to the day, following the unyielding and \ncommendable efforts of rebel barons who would no longer accept the \narbitrary abuses under a tyrannical monarchy, King John placed his seal \non this Latin text, subjecting every person, whether he be king or \npeasant, to the rule of law. It was this exact premise on which the \ndocument based its lasting legacy, to be a nation of laws rather than a \nnation of men.\n  This idea is just as important today as it was 800 years ago. It can \nbe no better represented than in the protections guaranteed under the \nFifth Amendment of our Constitution, stating that no person shall be \ndeprived of life, liberty, or property without due process of law.\n  I rise today to honor 800 years of Magna Carta and to show my \nappreciation for all those who have made the tremendous sacrifice to \ndefend the founding principles derived from the ideas of liberty and \njustice.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4363-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4363]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         MAY GOD BLESS THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED SERVICES\n\n  (Mr. CHAFFETZ asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in the hope that we will, as a \nnation, pause and thank the men and women who have served in our armed \nservices.\n  Every day, men and women who wake up and serve their Nation do so at \nthe risk of their own lives. They leave behind loved ones and families \nand brothers and sisters and mothers and fathers and kids.\n  They serve, who knows where? When they enter the service, they don't \nknow where they are going to serve, but they know that they love the \nUnited States of America, and they are willing to put their lives on \nthe line. That has happened throughout generations of time. Millions of \npeople have answered that call to serve.\n  The least we can do as a nation is be grateful and give pause, give \nprayer, and give thanks to these men and women who will serve us in the \nfuture and who have served us in the past.

That agency is the Export-Import \nBank.\n  In my district alone, Ex-Im has supported a total export of more than \n$2.4 billion, and more than half of the companies that work with them \nare local\n\n[[Page H4364]]\n\nsmall businesses. From New York Apple Sales to Imperial Pools, \nbusinesses in New York's capital region and across the Nation have \nbenefited greatly from the work of the Export-Import Bank, and there is \nabsolutely no reason it should fall victim to the same culture of \npolitics and brinksmanship that has cloaked this body for the past few \nyears.\n  There are 1,053 business organizations, including the United States \nChamber of Commerce and the Capital Region Chambers of Commerce, that \nhave urged Republican House leadership to renew Ex-Im.\n  A majority of this House, including 180 of my Democratic colleagues \nwho have signed the discharge petition to reauthorize the Bank, have \nexpressed support to renew Ex-Im.\n  All we need now is a vote.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in search of an answer \nto a very simple question.\n  Assistant Secretary Sarah Saldana, the Director of U.S. Immigration \nand Customs Enforcement, ICE, appeared before the House Appropriations \nHomeland Security Subcommittee on April 15. I serve on the \nsubcommittee, and I questioned the Assistant Secretary about President \nObama's comments he made in February of this year.\n  The President said: ``If somebody is working for ICE and there is a \npolicy and they don't follow the policy, there are going to be \nconsequences to it.'' He was commenting on ICE agents' following his \ndirectives and guidelines.\n  I used this opportunity to tell the Assistant Secretary that, if I \nhad office policies that were contrary to the law, I would understand \nif my employees did not want to follow them. ``I would expect them to \nfollow the law first,'' I said.\n  Director Saldana interrupted me to say: ``That is where you and I \nprobably have a fundamental disagreement.''\n  America was founded on the principle that no person is above the law. \nI take that very seriously. The culture problems at ICE run very deep, \nbut I think they start at the top.\n  My colleagues and I decided this was unacceptable and that we needed \nto investigate her statement and philosophy further, so we followed up \nwith a letter to Assistant Secretary Saldana on May 15, asking for \nclarification.\n  I should note we asked for a response by June 5; yet, 31 days since \nthe request and 10 days since the deadline, we have not seen a response \nfrom the Assistant Secretary. This should be deeply troubling to all in \nthis House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I submit a copy of this letter for the Record.\n\n\n                                Congress of the United States,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 15, 2015.\n     Sarah R. Saldana,\n     Assistant Secretary, U.S. Immigration and Customs \n         Enforcement, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Assistant Secretary Saldana:  We write to request \n     additional information and clarification regarding your \n     recent testimony before the House Appropriations Subcommittee \n     on Homeland Security. We are greatly troubled by this \n     administration's directives attempting to supersede \n     immigration enforcement protocols laid out in federal law. \n     Just as troubling is President Obama's assertion that \n     Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents who do not \n     follow his directives will be held ``answerable to the head \n     of the Department of Homeland Security,'' and ``there will be \n     consequences to it.''\n       When questioned during the hearing about your actions to \n     implement the President's policies, you stated that you have \n     a ``fundamental disagreement'' that ICE agents should follow \n     federal law if a superior has instructed them not to. We want \n     to be clear: your agency is not above the law, and you and \n     your employees are expected to uphold the laws of this \n     country, as you have sworn to.\n       We have heard reports of agents who face retribution or \n     threats for following the law. ICE agents are diligently \n     working to enforce the laws of this nation. They should not \n     be worried about facing disciplinary action for faithfully \n     executing their duty.\n       We write today seeking specific answers to these questions \n     on ICE's actions to implement these policies.\n       (1) We would like to know the legal rationale your agency \n     has used to justify holding executive memos as superior to \n     the plain language of federal statute and how that allows you \n     to punish agents who are following the law.\n       (2) We also request that you provide us with the protocols \n     agents have been instructed to follow dealing with the \n     President's directives and current guidelines on the \n     disciplinary actions that agents face for not following them.\n       (3) To date, has ICE taken any adverse action against any \n     career employee for not following the President's policy and \n     what are the details of that action?\n       (4) Lastly, if these executive actions are ultimately found \n     to be illegal through the current litigation challenging them \n     and struck down by a federal court, how will punished agents \n     receive restitution in full from ICE?\n       You are responsible for making sure these agents are \n     equipped with the resources they need to do this, not \n     threaten them with punishment for it. We ask that you respond \n     to these questions by June 5th.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Young,\n       Member of Congress.\n     John Culberson,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Chuck Fleischmann,\n       Member of Congress.\n     John Carter,\n       Member of Congress.\n     Dr. Andy Harris,\n       Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4364-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4364-H4370]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS: THE MISSING BLACK MALE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Payne) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members be \ngiven 5 days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, let me begin by thanking the members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus who are joining me here tonight.\n  The topic of tonight's discussion is: the missing Black male. \nTonight, as a caucus, we will address the issues affecting Black males, \nincluding incarceration, health, the increasing suicide rate among \nBlack youth, and the missing Black male in our society.\n  It was recently reported by The New York Times that 1.5 million \nAfrican American men are missing. What do we mean when we say 1.5 \nmillion Black men are missing? As we speak, hundreds of thousands of \nBlack men are sitting in prisons throughout this Nation. Others have \ndied from homicide--the leading cause of death for young Black men--and \nfrom diseases that disproportionately impact African American males.\n  Then there are others, like Freddie Gray, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, \nand Eric Garner, who are no longer with us because of excessive force \nby police which has cut their lives short.\n  It is clear that our law enforcement system and criminal justice \nsystem aren't working for African Americans and other minorities. It is \nalso clear that we need a new approach into other areas, including \nreducing health disparities among African American men and boys. \nTonight, we will diagnose the problems behind America's 1.5 million \nmissing African American men and help identify solutions to this \nnational problem.\n  While African Americans make up 14 percent of the U.S. population, \nthey comprise 38 percent of those in the U.S. prison population and 60 \npercent of those in solitary confinement. In 2010, African American men \nwere six times as likely as White men to be incarcerated in Federal, \nState, and local jails.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an issue that is plaguing the African American \ncommunity, as we see a disproportionate number of African American men \nwho are incarcerated in this Nation. We are trying to figure out why \nthey make up 14 percent of the population and 60 percent of those \nincarcerated. It just doesn't add up.\n  Right now, Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce the chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, who has allowed me to anchor this hour.\n  It is my honor to yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nButterfield).\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. First, let me begin by thanking the gentleman from \nNew Jersey for his leadership and for his willingness to lead this \nhour, not only tonight, but for agreeing to do it\n\n[[Page H4365]]\n\nthroughout this year. I thank the gentleman so very much for his \nleadership and for all that he does not only for the people of the \nState of New Jersey, but for America.\n  Mr. Speaker, statistic: for every 100 African American women, there \nare only 83 African American men. This gap equals 1.5 million Black men \nwho are essentially missing from everyday life in America. These \nnumbers are simply staggering. The fact that Black men have long been \nmore likely to be locked up and more likely to die is a problem.\n  Compounded with the deep disparities that continue to impact the \nopportunities afforded to African American males, the gender gap \nleaves, as reported, many households without enough men to be fathers \nand husbands within the community.\n  The statistics show that most African Americans live in places with a \nsignificant shortage of African American men while most Whites live in \nplaces with rough parity between White men and White women. The two \nleading causes of this gap are incarceration and early deaths, with \nhomicide being the leading cause of death for young African American \nmales; but Black males also die from heart disease, respiratory \ndisease, and accidents more often than other demographic groups, \nincluding African American women.\n  This gender gap does not exist in childhood as there are roughly as \nmany African American boys as there are African American girls; yet, as \nthey grow up, an imbalance begins to appear during their teenage years, \nand it persists through adulthood.\n  We now see an increasing number of suicides--yes, suicides--by young \nAfrican American males while the rate for White children has declined. \nWhile any increase is problematic, we have to wonder: What is \nhappening? What is happening with our African American youth that has \nled to this staggering increase?\n  The CBC is committed to reducing the school to prison pipeline so \nthat our kids aren't unfairly profiled and placed in the criminal \njustice system. We are committed to ensuring funding for summer jobs \nprograms and job training programs so that our youth have opportunities \nto develop their skills instead of having idle time during the summer \nmonths.\n  The CBC is committed to increasing resources for families and \nincreasing family engagement. We must support programs and initiatives \nthat will help us provide opportunities for young African American men.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his leadership.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the chairman for \ngracing us with his comments and for demonstrating true leadership in \nthe Congressional Black Caucus.\n  Next, we have a distinguished member of this caucus. She hails from \nHouston, Texas, and has always been on the right side of these issues \nand has brought light to them.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Houston, Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the manager of this hour, Mr. Payne, \nand all of my colleagues and my chairman, who has just spoken and who \nset the tone very eloquently and with deep conviction.\n  In his having served on the supreme court for the State of North \nCarolina, Mr. Butterfield understands the issues of justice, and I \napplaud him for taking this cause up as well. The gentlewoman from New \nJersey and the gentleman from Louisiana, let me thank them as well for \nthe words that they will say.\n  Let me also say that this is a team and that we will work as a team \non our respective committees to be able to bring this issue to a \nproductive solution.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I have always said--as a member of the Committee on the Judiciary for \na number of years now, serving on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations--that we must breathe life into \nchange, and as legislators we must come to a point where we bring \nlegislation for final signature by the President of the United States \nof America. So I thank Mr. Payne for giving us this opportunity.\n  Let me rush quickly through my remarks because one could be here for \na very long time. As I do so, let me take note that this is the 150th \nyear commemoration of the 13th Amendment; that is the freeing of \nindividuals from slavery. It is the 150th year also of the \ncommemoration of Juneteenth, and that is, of course, a regional holiday \nthat the Nation celebrates, which is the acknowledgment that the slaves \nwere freed pursuant to the Emancipation Proclamation issued in 1863. \nTexans, who will celebrate this on June 19th, and many others travel \nthroughout the Nation Juneteenth. I say that because it is a question \nof freedom. When we have the ability, Mr. Payne, to save lives, that is \na question of freedom.\n  I want to thank The New York Times for writing about this research. I \nwant to hold this up. ``Rise in Suicide By Black Children Surprises \nResearchers.'' Researchers did not come predisposed to get this answer, \nbut they got this answer. The opening sentence says: ``The suicide rate \namong Black children has nearly doubled since the early 1990s.'' They \ndid not expect this to come forward, but it contributes to the story in \nThe New York Times: about 1.5 million men are missing. In New York \nalmost 120,000 Black men between ages 25 and 54, missing from everyday \nlife; Chicago, 45,000; and more than 30,000 are missing in \nPhiladelphia. Across the South, from North Charleston, South Carolina, \nGeorgia, Alabama, Mississippi, and up into Ferguson, hundreds of \nthousands more are missing.\n  African American men have long been more likely to be locked up, more \nlikely to die young. A city with at least 10,000 Black residents that \nhas the single largest population of missing men? Ferguson, Missouri, \nwhere a fatal police shooting catapulted this question to the national \nattention.\n  Incarceration and early deaths are overwhelming. Of the 1.5 million \nmissing men from 25 to 54, which demographers call the prime-age years, \nhigher imprisonment rates account for almost 600,000. Let me say that \nagain: higher imprisonment rates account for 600,000. Almost 1 in 12 \nBlack men in this age group are behind bars, compared with 1 in 60 non-\nBlack men in the same age group.\n  Whenever we talk about the shootings in South Carolina, Ohio, \nFerguson, I hear people saying, what about Black-on-Black crime? As if \nwe, as African Americans, run away from facts. We do not. But we \nrecognize that the fight to preserve lives in the African American \ncommunity is societal and holistic. It deals with education and job \nopportunities and health care and mental health care, and it calls upon \nthe Nation to respond. But it does not put aside what we have faced \nover the years by killings of Black men, even from the time of slavery \nand Reconstruction into the 1900s, all through the time of segregation. \nWe found that they were in the eye of the storm.\n  So let's not distract or detour from the crisis of incarceration and \nthe crisis of what happens in the African American community in the \njustice system by suggesting that any of us are ignoring Black-on-Black \ncrime. I am glad that the Congressional Black Caucus wants to look at \nthe holistic issue of how do you solve this problem. It does not take \nthe attacking of the Black community, of ignoring the fact that crime \nis perpetrated there. I think everyone knows that perpetrating crime \nimpacts your neighbors, impacts where you live, just as it does in \nincidents dealing with White crime or White-on-White crime or Hispanic \nor Asian. People usually engage with those who are familiar.\n  So I am looking to work with this very august body to talk about how \nwe can stop the tide of suicide and the incarceration of our young \npeople. Let me cite these examples as I come to a close. Let me just \ngive you the example of Kelvin Mikhail Smallwood-Jones, who was a \ndean's list student with a 4.0 grade point average on a full academic \nscholarship to one of the most respected historically Black colleges in \nthe country. Prior to enrolling in Atlanta's Morehouse College in the \nfall of 2006, he was a football star and homecoming king at his \nWashington, D.C.-area high school. An English sophomore, he dabbled in \nphotography, mentoring at-risk youth in his free time. Last winter he \nwas planning an elaborate birthday celebration, and he was preparing to \naccept a prestigious summer internship. He never made it to either. On \nFebruary 23, 2008, less than 2\n\n[[Page H4366]]\n\nweeks before his 20th birthday, Kelvin shot himself in the head with \nhis mother's gun on the deck of a suburban Atlanta farmhouse that she \nbought to live closer to him.\n  This very statement is hurting, is hurting the family, but it means \nthat we must collectively come together to address the question of the \npain, of the disparate treatment, the disparate treatment in education, \nand to get to the source of Mr. Smallwood-Jones' pain so that we can, \nin fact, find a solution.\n  On the criminal justice--and I realize that criminal justice is not \nthe answer to all, but it is a side parallel effort that we must \ncorrect in order to give dignity to those who may have detoured but yet \ndo not need to be condemned for life. I intend to introduce a number of \nlegislative initiatives besides those which are ongoing, as we are \ndiscussing the mandatory minimums, to focus on the criminal justice \nside of dealing with juveniles: an effective speedy trial, bail reform, \nand a solitary confinement safeguards for juveniles act. Most people \ndon't realize that when these young men are incarcerated, rather than \ngiving them an opportunity, rather than promoting the PROMISE Act of \nour colleague, Mr. Scott, and giving alternatives to incarceration, but \nmore importantly to people's lives, we throw them in jail. Many of us \nknow the tragic story of the 16-year-old who was in solitary \nconfinement for 3 years, was ultimately released, and committed \nsuicide.\n  So we look forward to our colleagues joining in this legislation, an \neffective, speedy trial, bail reform, and solitary confinement \nsafeguards for juveniles act of 2015, to alter the holding of juveniles \nso that they come out whole and ready to be rehabilitated and to be \nwelcomed into society. The Nonviolent Offenders Act, which will \ndiminish the amount of time that African American men serve in a \nFederal prison system that does not have parole. And then we want to \nintroduce the RAISE Act to establish a better path for young offenders \nto ensure that there is a way for judges, even though juveniles are \ntreated differently, to give an alternative assessment in giving them \nor sentencing them when they run afoul of the law.\n  Mind you, they are in juvenile court for status offenses, for truancy \nand others. This young man was incarcerated for taking a knapsack, and \nhe insisted he did not take it. That is why he was still there. He did \nnot take it, but he couldn't get to trial. How horrible a life, 3 years \nof solitary confinement.\n  So, Mr. Payne, let me thank you for leading forward on this august \nday and time, this year of commemorating the 150th year of the 13th \nAmendment, when we were declared free, meaning the ancestors' African \nAmerican slaves. It should be a telling moment that this is also the \n50th year of the commemoration of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. This \nshould be the year that we restore the voting rights to individuals who \nhave detoured. We should restore section 5. We should preach freedom. \nWe should encourage those who want to advocate for fixing the criminal \njustice system, which can incarcerate and enslave and as well deny \nfreedom.\n  This is a time that we can join together in the Congressional Black \nCaucus and free people in the right way and put them on a pathway of \ncontributing to this great country. They are worthy, and they have the \ntalent, the stardom to contribute. I look forward to working with all \nof you for that journey and for those results.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus in this Special Order to speak to the issues that Members \nof the 114th Congress must address.\n  I thank my colleagues Congressman Donald M. Payne, Jr. and \nCongresswoman Robin L. Kelly for leading this evening's Congressional \nBlack Caucus Special Order on ``The Missing Black Male''.\n  We are in a time where the news of young black men being incarcerated \nand losing their lives is all too common.\n  As highlighted in a recent NY Times article, 1.5 million black men \nare missing from everyday life, as a result of incarceration or early \ndeath.\n  In New York, almost 120,000 black men between the ages of 25 and 54 \nare missing from everyday life. In Chicago, 45,000 are, and more than \n30,000 are missing in Philadelphia. Across the South--from North \nCharleston, S.C., through Georgia, Alabama and Mississippi and up into \nFerguson, Mo.--hundreds of thousands more are missing.\n  African-American men have long been more likely to be locked up and \nmore likely to die young, but the scale of the combined toll is \njolting.\n  It is a measure of the deep disparities that continue to afflict \nblack men--disparities being debated after a recent spate of killings \nby the police--and the gender gap is itself a further cause of social \nills, leaving many communities without enough men to be fathers and \nhusbands.\n  And what is the city with at least 10,000 black residents that has \nthe single largest proportion of missing black men? Ferguson, Mo., \nwhere a fatal police shooting last year led to nationwide protests and \na Justice Department investigation that found widespread discrimination \nagainst black residents.\n  It is critical that we look to training that will lead to cohesive \npolicing in areas of minority concentrations.\n  We need to focus on improving relationships between law enforcement \nand communities most impacted by cases of police brutality and \nincarceration.\n  Incarceration and early deaths are the overwhelming drivers of the \ngap.\n  Of the 1.5 million missing black men from 25 to 54--which \ndemographers call the prime-age years--higher imprisonment rates \naccount for almost 600,000.\n  Almost 1 in 12 black men in this age group are behind bars, compared \nwith 1 in 60 nonblack men in the age group, 1 in 200 black women and 1 \nin 500 nonblack women.\n  Higher mortality is the other main cause.\n  Homicide, the leading cause of death for young African-American men, \nplays a large role, and they also die from heart disease, respiratory \ndisease and accidents more often than other demographic groups, \nincluding black women.\n  We also are seeing a shocking and troubling increase in suicide rates \namongst our young black youth.\n  Also noted by the NY Times, the suicide rate among black children has \nnearly doubled since the early 1990s.\n  Between 1993 and 1997 suicide was the 14th cause of death among black \nchildren.\n  Between 2008 and 2012, suicide was the 9th leading cause of death \namong black children.\n  In 2005, when suicide was the 3rd leading cause of death among \nAfrican-American youth--1621 of the 1,992 suicides completed by \nAfrican-Americans were black boys (371 of 1,992 were female).\n  Thus, looking specifically to our young black men with this growing \ntrend of suicide rates, we must highlight the fact that black males are \nsix times more likely to commit suicide than their female counterparts.\n  Increase in Black male suicides is not surprising considering the \n``unique social and environmental stressors, including racism,'' they \nhave to deal with.\n  Interestingly, just 4 percent of the nation's psychiatrists, 3 \npercent of the psychologists and 7 percent of social worker are black.\n  The mental health profession needs to become more culturally \nsensitive to the needs of our black youth and get out the message that \nit's OK to get help and be vulnerable.\n  Noticeably, girls get depressed and gravitate toward friends, family, \nchurch or other social institutions while through social conditioning.\n  Yet, black males are taught to tough it out, stand strong, to get a \ngrip, and ultimately isolate when mental anguish becomes visible.\n  As we saw with the recent and tragic case of Kalief Browder in New \nYork--his plight was ignored and overlooked for far too long.\n  Continued statistics and reports documenting the death and \ndisappearance of our young black males is unacceptable and must be \naddressed.\n  We know that the disappearance of these men has far-reaching \nimplications.\n  We know there is a correlation between the mass incarceration and the \ndestruction of the black home.\n  The absence of black men disrupts family formation and foundation \nbuilding for our young people.\n  This in turn results in vulnerable feelings of little or no self-\nvalue or self-worth and lacking direction or foresight on ways to \novercome dangerous ways of thinking and living.\n  We need to give special attention to families and communities \naffected by incarceration and mental health problems--as we know many \nof our young black men are afflicted with abuse, trauma and unresolved \nstigmas of mental and emotional health.\n  It is time to acknowledge the cracks in our foundation and treat our \nyoung with the attention they deserve.\n  We can no longer ignore gapping deficits that exist for our young \nblack males--namely, in education, health care, mental health services, \nand general opportunities for growth and success.\n\n[[Page H4367]]\n\n  This special order is an opportunity to highlight and raise awareness \nto the stark and tragic reality of young black males in America.\n  Now is the time to change the course and save their lives.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Houston, who \nalways brings clarity to these issues and is a great contributor to the \nconscience of this Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman brings up a lot of good points in \nreference to incarceration and speaking about the young 16-year-old boy \nwho spent that much time in solitary confinement and comes out and ends \nup committing suicide.\n  What we have found in this country, as they have broken down the \nmental health institutions over the years, that what we are doing in \nthis country is warehousing people who have mental health issues in \nprisons, and it is a way to warehouse and get the problem out of the \nway so we don't see it, but a lot of people who are in prison these \ndays have mental health issues and should be dealt with from that \nperspective as opposed to incarceration.\n  It is my honor and privilege to ask my colleague from New Jersey, the \nHonorable Bonnie Watson Coleman, who is known in New Jersey for her \nwork around criminal justice in the State legislature and has joined us \nthis year in the 114th Congress, for her remarks with respect to \ntonight's topic.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nyielding and giving me the opportunity to lend my voice to what I think \nis a crisis that we are experiencing.\n  As my colleagues before me have pointed out, particularly \nRepresentative Sheila Jackson Lee, we are in the midst of an American \ncrisis, shaking the very foundation of the Black community. The word \ncrisis should motivate us to act now. Crisis describes a need for \nimmediate action. Crisis calls for an immediate infusion of resources. \nCrisis requires a meeting of minds to find answers.\n  If thousands of people disappeared in the prime of their lives, their \nfriends, their families, their coworkers having no idea where they \nwent, we would be calling that a crisis. Yet, for years, our young, \nBlack men have disappeared from their homes, their communities, and \neverything that would have been their lives.\n  Violence has taken them. Violence that we could have avoided with \nstronger schools to give youth the outlet that they need. Better jobs \nand job training to prepare these men to be supporters of strong \nfamilies. Prisons have taken these men, prisons that we support through \na legal system that dehumanizes men of color and enforces policies that \nall but ensure these men will enter an endless cycle of recidivism \nwhere more than 67 percent of them will come back into the communities \nwith no preparation, no assistance whatsoever in becoming whole and \nhealthy in their communities.\n  This is a nation that is quick to see these Black men as a problem, \nand this is a nation that seems to continue to ignore and deceive the \nslow, steady disappearance of 1.5 million Black men. This is \ndevastating to our families and to our whole communities. It is past \ntime that we see this for the crisis that it is and invest the \nresources and intellectual power that will end it and save our men and \nour families and our communities.\n  There is a very witty African American comic who refers to the crisis \nof Black men and the need to get them on the endangered species list, \nbecause when we recognize that a species is endangered, we place value \non that species. We place resources in every opportunity to ensure that \nthey continue, that they thrive, and that they live in the habitats \nthat are healthy for them.\n  Well, this is a situation of an endangered species. This is, indeed, \na crisis. So I thank my colleagues for drawing attention to this issue.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I would like to thank my colleague from the Garden State \nof New Jersey. She has come to the Congress and hit the ground running. \nAs great a legislator as she was in New Jersey, she is doing a \nmagnificent job here in the Halls of Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have touched on many different topics, many different \nissues, and it is just really a difficult circumstance that these \nindividuals face, you know; tremendous barriers to reentering society \nand pursuing education and gainful employment.\n  When these men are incarcerated, their children suffer, too. Nearly 2 \nmillion children grow up in homes where one parent is in jail. Of \ncourse, lowering the incarceration rates means we need to reevaluate \nthe war on drugs. One out of every three African American men will be \nincarcerated at some point in their lives. Most of these arrests are \ndrug related. According to the National Urban League, mandatory \nminimums and disparities in crack cocaine sentencing incarcerates \ncountless African Americans for an inhumane length of time, and that \nmade the U.S. the world leader in prison population.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Now, is that something that this country wants to be known for? This \nhas created a modern-day caste system in America. The incarceration \nrate for African Americans convicted of drug offenses is 10 times \ngreater than that of White Americans, even though Americans engage in \ndrug offenses at higher rates.\n  We need to focus on rehabilitating drug users instead of \nincarcerating them and making it nearly impossible to reenter society.\n  Mr. Speaker, with that, I would like to introduce the hero from last \nweek's game between the Republicans and the Democrats where he pitched \na magnificent game. Once again, we were victorious. I don't believe \nthat we have lost since he has arrived in Congress. It is the honorable \ngentleman from New Orleans, the honorable Cedric Richmond, also known \nas ``The Franchise.''\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Richmond).\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey for \nhosting our hour tonight, Congressman Donald Payne, who, like the old \nadage, is ``a chip off the old block.'' His father was an outstanding \nCongressman from the district who did a lot for Africa, did a lot for \nurban cities. I see that Congressman Payne, although in his second \nterm, has taken up the banner and is following in his father's \nfootsteps quite adequately.\n  Tonight we are talking about the missing Black male. The good news \nand the bad news is that I found him, and we know where they are. They \nare incarcerated in prisons, they are in cemeteries, and they are in \nunemployment lines.\n  We know where they are not. They are not in the homes, and they are \nnot providing leadership and mentoring to our young African American \nmale children.\n  The question tonight, I think, why we are here and why we are talking \nabout it is, if you can't talk about the problem and you can't identify \nit, then you will never get to a solution.\n  I come from an area and I was raised by parents who always told me \nthat you can achieve anything you want to achieve. They gave me the \nnurturing and the support and the push up when I needed it, and they \ngave me the swift kick in the rump when I needed that, also. That is \nwhere we are.\n  I had prepared remarks, and I will defer to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Payne) on how he wants to go. But I think there are things \nthat we can learn, and I think there are things that we should focus on \nwhen we talk about the schools, the prison pipeline, when we talk about \nyouth summer employment.\n  You know, it is amazing that we never, ever talk about it, but some \nof the kids in some of our neighborhoods should get the Congressional \nGold Medal just for showing up at school every day, because what they \ngo through when they get home from school and all night until it is \ntime to come to school again are conditions that we shouldn't have \nchildren living in. The good news is that we can overcome all of that \nby doing criminal justice reform and providing another chance for kids \nand for parents who are incarcerated.\n  I had a juvenile court judge a long time ago write an essay and tell \nme a story about the fact that there are so many parents that are in \njail, but the children are doing the time. And we have to make sure \nthat children are not paying for the sins of their parents. That is \nwhere society will come in, and that is why I thank the gentleman. And \nI have more stuff, and it is just you would like to go forward, Mr. \nCongressman.\n\n[[Page H4368]]\n\n  Well, I think it is worthwhile to probably go into a little bit of my \nstory, which is a little bit different from your story. And I think it \nis important for kids around the country and some of our colleagues to \nknow it.\n  My mother is from the poorest place in America. She had 15 brothers \nand sisters. My grandmother was a housekeeper. So the family pulled \ntogether to take care of the 15 children.\n  My mother finished high school, and she went to college at Southern \nUniversity. My father, on the other hand--my grandfather owned a \nfuneral home, owned a farm, and was very well-to-do. My mother went to \nSouthern University, sharing a jacket with her sister. My father went \nto Southern University with a brand-new deuce-and-a-quarter car because \nmy grandfather didn't want him walking around his college campus with a \nbad heart.\n  They meet. They get married. They have two boys, and I am the \nyoungest. My father dies when I was 7 years old of a heart attack while \nI was home. And I don't say that to say I grew up without a father \nfigure and times were hard, because I missed my father and I missed out \non the love and the nurturing, but I had a mother who was there every \nstep of the way as a public schoolteacher. Then I had a grandfather and \ntwo grandmothers who stepped in to also give me guidance.\n  But one of the biggest factors in me developing into what I am today \nis the fact that I lived across the street from a public playground \nthat was well funded. So my mother, who was the teacher, and my \ngrandfather and grandmother who lived in Mississippi, and my other \ngrandmother who lived in Lake Providence, the message was the same: Go \nhome from school; do your homework; and then go across the street to \nthe playground so that you could participate in organized sports.\n  That became very, very important because those men that coached me \nwere role models. They didn't know it, and I didn't know it. But I can \nremember them saying: Cedric, you are too talented. You need to be a \nlittle more serious. You need to get focused.\n  They would do the same thing my parents would do, which was give me a \npush when I needed it and give me a swift kick in the butt when I \nneeded it. And they led me to do and push myself to achieve things that \nI never thought I could achieve.\n  But we don't have that anymore. We have decimated the funding for \nafter-school programs. We have decimated the funding for recreation in \nour urban cities. We have decimated the funding for public schools and \nthe athletics and the extracurricular activities that go along with \nthem.\n  I am not sure about your life, Congressman Payne, but those \nactivities expose kids to things they never thought that they would \never, ever realize. Exposure is very, very good when a mind is \ndeveloping. I don't know if you had those same experiences when you \nwere growing up.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Well, Mr. Richmond, let me just say, and we have discussed \nit in private before, that I am the product of a very blessed \ncircumstance in my life. My mother died when I was 4, and my father \nraised us, my sister and me.\n  All the things you talk about benefiting from, I have benefited from. \nBut I have never lost the sight and was taught: There but for the grace \nof God go I.\n  So I have had circumstances in my life where I have been stopped by \nthe police and have been told by that officer using the N word that if \nI did not find my license, they would throw me so far under the jail \nthey would never find me.\n  Well, I was able to find my license after that and showed it to the \npolice officer, and lo and behold, I become a human being again. \nBecause, you see, my father was a councilman in that town. But prior to \nme showing my identification, there was the potential of someone never \nseeing me again because a police officer decided that that should be my \nfate. So now this police officer becomes nurturing and is parental and \nhe is asking me: Well, don't you know you could get hurt by doing that?\n  I had made a U-turn somewhere as a youngster I shouldn't have. But \ndoes my life have to end because I made a U-turn that I am thrown so \nfar under the jail they will never find me until I become a human being \nbecause my father is a councilman in that city and now there is a \nconcern for my well-being? No.\n  What about the 1.5 million Black males that don't have that \nrecognition that we have? That is why I do what I do every day, to make \nsure that in this Nation, the greatest country in the world, every man \nis playing by the rules, doing what he is supposed to do, has that \nequal opportunity, and the men that need that kick in the rump or that \nextra push get that.\n  So my story is a little different, although it sounds the same.\n  My father lost his mother at a very early age. He was 8. And the \nfamily got together to buy a house, some aunts and uncles and the \ngrandparents, so they could bring my father and his siblings in so they \nwouldn't get bounced around anymore like they were. And I truly believe \nthat is the reason my father never gave my sister and me up because of \nwhat he went through as a child and his experiences.\n  So we have been very fortunate; and your articulation of your \nexperience and us understanding that we have an obligation, being as \nfortunate as we have been and to have this bully pulpit, it is our \nobligation to speak out against the injustices that these 1.5 million \nmissing Black men face every single day.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Well, Congressman, I would tell you, except that, you \nknow, I won't go into any incident that I have had with law \nenforcement. Let's just stipulate and agree that there have been many, \nand each one has made me a better person, some of which were warranted \nand some of which were unwarranted.\n  I will say we have raised an interesting question. And your last \ncomment, I think, when you described your story with your parents, I \nthink, shows how separate all of these issues are, but then how whole \nthey are at the same time.\n  Because one of the things that many people don't talk about--and I \nwish our colleagues on the other side of the aisle, we could stop \ntalking at one another and talk to one another--is that the issue of \nparental lead is so important because, as a bus driver once told our \nleader, every day she sees a parent coming to put their kid on the bus \nwith tears in their eyes because they know that that child is sick and \nthey should be home with that child, but they absolutely cannot lose a \nday's pay because they won't be able to feed that kid or pay the rent \nor pay to keep the lights on at the end of the month. Those are very \nreal circumstances.\n  You have to believe that as America, as the United States of America, \nas the greatest country on Earth, the exceptional country that we are, \nwe are better than that. We are better than making a parent put that \nkid on the schoolbus going to school sick because they can't afford to \nlose a day's work.\n  Let me just give you these statistics in Louisiana, because I don't \nwant people to get the impression that it is just urban or it is just \nsingle-parent families. The Jesuit community at Loyola University in \nLouisiana did a study. One out of three two-parent households in \nLouisiana is economically insecure. Four out of five single-parent \nhouseholds, that is 80 percent of the single-parent households in \nLouisiana, are economically insecure. We have to do better than that.\n  Raising the minimum wage raises 14 million people out of poverty the \nday the President would sign the law. Those things are important.\n  What do those things have to do with the African American male? Well, \nthe young African American male has parents. Too often, it is just a \nsingle mother raising that family. And we have to make sure that they \nhave the means and ability to make sure that that kid can eat every \nday, because you absolutely cannot learn in school if you are hungry or \nif you have had a night where you are sleeping in a car or you don't \nhave heat and all of those things. I think, as a Congress, we ought to \ncome together and look at those very specific issues.\n  Mr. PAYNE. You know, the gentleman is absolutely correct. It reminds \nme of another story of some of those households where the circumstances \nare unfathomable.\n  My sister is a kindergarten teacher of 25 years. I don't know if she \nwould like me telling the length of time, but she had a child in one of \nher classes several years ago, and the child would sleep all through \nclass. You know, once\n\n[[Page H4369]]\n\nor twice, she let it go, but it became a persistent pattern.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  She calls the parents and finds out that the reason that the child \nslept in school was it was the only safe place to sleep because, in the \nevening, the rodents that came out of the walls would bite them at \nnight, and they would stay up most of the night trying to keep this \ncircumstance off of them. When the child got to school, it was the only \nplace that they could rest.\n  In this country, that is unacceptable, absolutely unacceptable. It is \ncircumstances like that--now, how does that child get ahead? They are \nfalling behind already, and this is kindergarten. The deck is stacked \nagainst a lot of these children when they show up to school.\n  Head Start and these programs have shown and demonstrated the upward \nmobility that they have given generations of children that need this \ntype of service; yet our colleagues continue to thwart efforts to \nincrease efforts we know that work--really, just kind of just dismiss \nthat any of these social programs that have been instituted have any \nbenefit.\n  That is not true. It is just not true. We need to continue to bring \nthese stories up and explain to people why we fight every single day \nfor these issues.\n  The whole issue, once again, around mental health issues, people \nwalking the streets that need help and end up doing something that they \nare really unable to control and end up incarcerated--how does that \nhelp them? How does that help the circumstance in this country? Is it \nthat we are just hiding the issue? We don't want to deal with it, so we \njust lock it up?\n  It is absolutely unconscionable, in this country, that we still act \nas if we are in the 1800s in this day and age.\n  Mr. RICHMOND. I am glad you brought up the monetary aspect of it \nbecause, look, Morehouse College, accounting major, I get numbers, and \nI get the concern that we have about the budget, the deficit and the \nnational debt. The other thing that I know from my basic accounting \nclasses is that we shouldn't talk about spending as the only criteria \nfor how we judge things.\n  The conversation in D.C. should be about return on investment. \nAnything that gives us greater than a 1 to 1 return, then we can use \nwhatever is greater than 1 to pay down the debt and the deficit and get \nus to a more balanced country.\n  Let me give you an exact example. You used Head Start, early \nchildhood education. You get a 9 to 1 return on every dollar that you \nspend. Now, I am not chairman of Ways and Means; I am not over the \nBudget Committee; I am not on Appropriations, but in my simple \nhousehold, when I was young, I knew that $9 was greater than $1, and \nthat if you spend $1 and you could get $9 back, you could do great \nthings with that extra $9, like spend $4 of it on reducing the debt, \nspend another $5 on other programs that would give kids the opportunity \nto reach their full development, to also reduce crime, which means not \nonly do you have less people incarcerated, but you have less victims of \ncrime.\n  When we start evaluating the programs that we are talking about, that \nis what we need to focus on.\n  In Louisiana, when I was in the legislature, we paid around $9,000 a \nyear to our public schools to educate each kid, and we were spending \nabout $45,000 a year to incarcerate a juvenile. Now, in my public \nschool education, that $45,000 is far greater than that $9,000, and it \njust doesn't make sense.\n  As we talk about the $6 billion that we spend on incarcerating \njuveniles in this country--any given day, we have 70,000 juveniles that \nare in jail--$6 billion. We could spend that money in better places to \ndo better things to make the country safer and to help them reach their \npotential.\n  That is why I am glad that we are having this conversation tonight \nbecause it is about not just complaining about the problem, but \nidentifying it and figuring out a way to solve it. I think that both \nsides could come together to try to solve this problem because, hey, \nvictims of crime are victims of crime, and we should do everything we \ncan to reduce that number.\n  Also, we need to get back to what I thought and still do think makes \nthis country the greatest country on Earth, is the fact that we care \nand we love our neighbors and we want to see them do well. If we really \nwant to see them do well, then let's invest in those things. Let's put \nour money where our mouth is, and let's do the things that we know we \ncan do.\n  If anybody is interested in really having that conversation, I know \nthat both of us and the entire Black Caucus, we are willing to engage \nin that conversation. It is not all about spending money, but it is \nabout spending it where you get a return and helping families be a \nfamily unit to nurture and push kids to achieve everything they can and \ngive them that swift kick in the butt when they need it to achieve that \nalso.\n  I just want to thank you, Congressman, for allowing me to participate \nin this Special Order Hour tonight to talk about an amazing--well, not \nan amazing problem, but an incredible problem that this country faces \nand the fact that we have the leadership to help solve that problem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe in the adage, ``Education is the only sure way \nfor many children to escape poverty.''\n\n\n            Creating Opportunity for Our Young Men and Boys\n\n  Invest in our economy and infrastructure, 21st century manufacturing, \njob training, and raise the minimum wage.\n  More investments in summer jobs, summer recreation, and summer \ncommunity service.\n\n\n  Criminal Justice Reforms to help give our young men a second chance \n                          after mistakes made\n\n  Better training for our police forces on cultural sensitivity and \nproper respect for our communities.\n  End the school to prison pipeline--pass my bill (see separate \nsection).\n\n\n                     youth opportunity legislation\n\n  To help ensure a strong, coordinated effort to give schools the tools \nthey need to be schools instead of ``pipelines to prison,'' and do more \nto build habits that will lead to success in the future, I have \nintroduced the Student Disciplinary Fairness Act of 2015 and the Youth \nSummer Jobs and Public Service Act of 2015.\n  Juveniles that have been incarcerated are much more likely to become \ncriminals later in life and much less likely to achieve economic \nsuccess but providing employment opportunity increases the likelihood \nof favorable outcomes.\n  All of us who care about building strong, prosperous communities must \ndo everything we can to ensure that involving our youth in the criminal \njustice system is used as a last resort, not as a routine first \nresponse.\n  We must make smart investments in our youth so that they can be \npresent and visible in society and the 21st century economy.\n  Mr. PAYNE. I want to thank the gentleman from Louisiana for his \nremarks, and I appreciate him being involved in tonight's Special \nOrder.\n  I am not surprised that he would be here on such an important topic. \nHe has demonstrated numerous times his commitment to young people and \ntheir aspirations and motivating them to do the right thing and be \nsuccessful, as he has been.\n  One thing that comes to my mind, Mr. Speaker, is as we talk about \nthis issue, what is it that we find these 1.5 million men missing? They \nare human beings. They are Americans. What is the difference about \nthese 1.5 million men, that they are African American? Does it go back \nin our history of 300 years? Does it have something to do with us, as a \nrace?\n  I just wonder, sometimes, what is the difference; but I won't go \nthere.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to thank the members of the \nCongressional Black Caucus here tonight for sharing their profound \ninsights and observations. Your participation was greatly appreciated.\n  Every Monday night in this House, we have a remarkable opportunity to \nspeak about the important work of the CBC to advance full equality and \njustice for African Americans in all communities in this Nation.\n  One of the most significant challenges our communities face is that \nof ``the missing black male.'' Once again, to quote The New York Times: \n``More than one out of every six black men who today should be between \n25 and 54 years old have disappeared from daily life.''\n  Many of these men are incarcerated. Others have died from homicide \nand from disease that disproportionately affects African American \nmales. The consequences of these missing men are\n\n[[Page H4370]]\n\nsevere, not just for the men themselves, but for their families and for \nthe entire society.\n  Strong communities lay the foundation to strong societies, but when \nour criminal justice system emphasizes incarceration over \nrehabilitation, we make it increasingly difficult for those individuals \nto become productive members of society. We need a system that holds \ncriminals accountable, while focusing on rehabilitation of nonviolent \ncriminals.\n  If we are truly to make our communities more secure, we also need to \naddress health disparities among African American men. Health \ndisparities are a burden to African American communities. African \nAmerican men suffer from a number of disease, including colorectal \ncancer, at higher rates than their White counterparts.\n  Part of the problem has to do with stigmas, and this is an area which \nI have been working hard to address in my capacity as co-chair of the \nCongressional Men's Health Caucus.\n  Along those lines, we need to eliminate the stigmas around mental \nhealth and make sure that those suffering from mental illness have the \nresources they need. No one struggling with mental illness should feel \nisolated and that they have nowhere to turn. It is clear that we are \nnot doing enough, as a society, to get them the help they need.\n  We should not be seeing an uptick in the number of African American \nboys dying from suicide, that dreaded suicide rate. For these young \nboys and for others, we need to listen, and we need to encourage them \nnot to be afraid to seek help.\n  The problem of ``the missing black male'' is not going to be resolved \novernight, but closing the gap is a goal we all need to aspire to for \nourselves, for our community, and for our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4370-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4370-H4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           THE PEOPLE'S NIGHT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, before I begin, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of my \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, tonight is a night about accountability, \nabout taking responsibility. Many of my colleagues that will speak here \ntonight were sent by districts of people who wanted to hold this \ngovernment accountable in both the fiscal and social arenas.\n  I think back today, though it was unplanned, on June 15, 1775, 240 \nyears ago this very day, George Washington accepted the position as \ncommander in chief of the Continental Army.\n  Washington was serving in the Second Continental Congress as a \ndelegate from Virginia when his peers voted unanimously to hand him the \nreins of the entire Revolutionary Army.\n  About 100 paces from where I am standing, on the back of these \nChambers, standing in the Capitol's rotunda is the history of how \nAmerica was birthed into existence. It is displayed through the most \nglorious artwork.\n  Of all those paintings in the rotunda, I am most intrigued by John \nTrumbull's work on Washington submitting his resignation in 1783, after \ncompleting his assignment, through struggles and severe setbacks, more \nthan 8 years after accepting the position.\n  Now, while some of these paintings depict those of conquests or \ndiscoveries, this particular work captures the great character of \nWashington. You see, Congress had granted Washington the powers \nequivalent to a dictator; yet the humility and the wisdom of Washington \nunderstood that, for a republic to survive, it must be held accountable \nby the people.\n  His resignation that day stated this:\n\n       I resign with satisfaction the appointment I accepted with \n     diffidence or a lack of self-confidence in my own abilities \n     to accomplish so arduous a task which, however was superceded \n     by a confidence in the rectitude of our cause, the support of \n     the supreme power of the Union, and the patronage of Heaven.\n\n  You see, Washington had resolved that a citizen-ruled government, \nthough different than others in the past, had a chance to do something, \nto be something, something exceptional. Two hundred and forty years ago \ntoday, Washington laid the cornerstone of freedom through \naccountability to the people with a unique blessing from the divine \npower of Heaven.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  That is why we have assembled tonight, to talk about what \nWashington's vision was: a citizen-ruled government that would hold the \nFederal Government and this administration accountable.\n  Tonight I would like to introduce the chairman of the House Oversight \nand Government Reform Committee, a committee that I am privileged to \nserve on, someone who has been a champion on government oversight.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz).\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  And I thank those who are with us tonight because this topic is one \nof, I think, the most important to our Nation. It certainly was key to \nthe foundation of this Nation.\n  And the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) is right, because \nif you go back and you read that farewell address that Washington gave, \nit is one of the most inspirational pieces. He had the power. He had \nthe position. He had the respect of the people. But he did probably the \nmost admirable thing that we have seen in this Nation, in that he \nvoluntarily gave it up because he knew that the power didn't reside in \nthe President. He knew that the power didn't reside in him, as an \nindividual. He understood that the power of this Nation stood with the \npeople. And with that power comes a responsibility. It is a \nresponsibility that all of us hold, as citizens of the United States of \nAmerica. For it is truly a privilege and an honor to be a citizen in \nthis country.\n  I hearken back a couple hundred years ago to those who blazed new \ntrails and decided that this Nation was going to be an inspired nation, \ninspired by God, that we weren't bashful about recognizing that God \nplayed a role in our lives and that the power of prayer was an \nimportant part of our Nation.\n  But also incumbent upon that was that every man, woman, and child--\nevery able-bodied person--do their part, that we all had accountability \nand responsibility not only to take care of ourselves but to also do \nwhat we can to help foster a greater community.\n  You see, this was a new idea. It wasn't that way across the world. \nThere were dictators, and there were others that really wanted to rule \nand control people. But the inspiration that our Founders had in the \nfoundation of our Nation was rooted in this idea that the people--the \npeople--had the power.\n  Fast-forward now to those who serve--whether they serve in the armed \nservices, whether they serve in the Federal Government or the State \ngovernment or wherever they might serve, it should be a recognition \nthat we serve the American people, that we serve them.\n  So as we look at all the issues that face us--whether we are going to \nspend money, whether we should pass this bill or not--let's remember a \ncouple of things.\n  And I would mention this to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nWalker) because I know he knows this. And I know it. But I want my kids \nto know it.\n  As we look at things we do in Congress, as we look at the men and \nwomen who serve our Nation, most do it in a very admirable way. They \nare patriotic. They are hard-working. They care about this Nation. But \nwe have some that don't really meet that standard. And it is probably \nmost fair, most humane, most decent that we hold people to a high \nstandard.\n  One of the things I want my kids to understand about government, \nabout life in general, is that when they talk about the government and \nthey talk about the Federal Government, it is really interesting. We \nwill have this happen in our committee from time to time. We will say, \nwell, whose money is it? And they will say, well, it is the \ngovernment's money.\n\n[[Page H4371]]\n\n  No, it is not. It is the people's money.\n  You see, every time we decide to spend money in Congress, what we are \nreally deciding is, should we pull money out of somebody's pocket--\nshould we pull money out of your wallet, take it over here, and hand it \nto somebody else?\n  Now there are some worthwhile causes for doing that, right? There are \nsome worthwhile things to do: the protection of our Nation, for our \narmed services. I buy that. I get that. But we are spending far too \nmuch money on too many things. We can't be all things to all people.\n  So going back to my original premise here, as I try to teach my own \nkids and try to remember myself, we have to be exceptionally \nresponsible stewards of these assets and resources that aren't ours. \nThey are an individual's.\n  For you see, at the heart of this, it is something that I think \nPresident Washington understood: that the most powerful thing upon our \nNation is the power of the people, and it is their own self-\ndetermination that should rule the day. You limit their self-\ndetermination the more you regulate them and the more you pull that \nmoney directly out of their pockets and give it to somebody else.\n  Now, there is room for regulation. There is room for certain things \nin the public good. But I tell you, most of what happens, most of what \ngoes on in Washington, it is far too much. It is excessive. And we have \nto remember at its core that accountability and responsibility for \nthose of us who are fortunate enough to serve in a public role is \nimperative, but it is also imperative that each individual takes upon \nthemselves their own accountability and their own responsibility.\n  As able-bodied men and women, children, you have got to pull your own \nweight. You have got to carry your own bucket. You have got to do what \nyou have got to do not only to help yourself but to help your \ncommunity, your friends, and loved ones as well.\n  And that is the heart of what I think the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Walker) brings to this body. I know he cares about it \npassionately. It is what we are here talking about tonight. There are a \nhost of examples where we are not holding people accountable, and we \nwant to change that. I hope we are able to talk about that a bit \ntonight. But for the moment, I would say to the gentleman, thank you \nfor allowing me to participate.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Chairman Chaffetz. We are going to talk about \nsome specific egregious behavior.\n  It wasn't long that I was here and serving with Chairman Chaffetz on \nthe House Oversight Committee that we were requested to meet with the \ninspector general of the EPA. It was in that moment, only weeks after I \nhad arrived, that here we have an inspector general, a gentleman \nappointed by the President, who had reached out to us in his tireless \nefforts to even so much as to get the EPA to respond. The arrogance \nthat stems from that agency has been grossly misused and abused.\n  It is my privilege tonight to acknowledge one of my North Carolina \ncolleagues to talk specifically more about the Environmental Protection \nAgency. With that, I yield to the gentleman from the Charlotte, North \nCarolina, area, Mr. Hudson.\n  Mr. HUDSON. I thank you for your strong leadership here in Congress. \nOften a new Member of Congress comes to town and spends a little bit of \ntime learning the ropes, maybe sitting in the back row observing, but \nthat is not true of Mark Walker. Mark Walker has quickly become a \nleader in Congress and particularly on issues such as this.\n  Tonight is the people's night. Government accountability is the \ntopic.\n  I thank the gentleman for bringing up the issue of the EPA. We had a \nhearing Friday in the Energy and Commerce Committee, on which I serve, \nin which we had the acting assistant administrator who oversees the \nClean Air Act. We were looking at this new proposed rule that the EPA \nhas put out having to do with ground-level ozone.\n  Now in 2008, the EPA issued a rule that brought the levels of ground-\nlevel ozone down to 75 parts per billion. Based on that number, many \ncounties in North Carolina and across this country were out of \nattainment.\n  Everyone wants clean air. Everyone wants clean water. Even those of \nus who are concerned about jobs know that if you don't have clean air \nand clean water, you can't attract industry, and you can't have \nbusinesses grow in your community. But you have to look at the real \nscience, and you have to look at the real numbers. And the truth is, \nsince 1980, we have cut ground-level ozone levels 30 percent in this \ncountry. We have done a tremendous job, and that has been driven by \nindustry.\n  This new rule was issued in 2008, but the instructions to States \nweren't issued until March of this year. So in March of this year, the \nEPA finally told the States how to comply with these new levels of 75 \nparts per billion. But now they have come out with a new rule that \nsays, we are going to drop that to 65 or maybe even 60. If that is the \ncase, every county in North Carolina--except one county in western \nNorth Carolina--would be out of attainment.\n  So what does that mean? That means you can't have a road project. It \nmeans you can't build a new home. It means you can't add any jobs to \nany existing industry. It means you can't bring any new industry into \nthe State. And they are doing this at a time when we haven't even \nimplemented the old rule, when we have already cut ground-level ozone \n30 percent.\n  So what I would say is, let's wait and look at the science. Let's \nlook at the real health impacts. Let's see what the results of the \ncurrent regulations are before we rush out with some new regulations \nwhich we are told could cost as much as 270,000 jobs in North Carolina. \nI have seen a figure of 1.3 million jobs in the country. Before we \nbring on this cost, before we threaten these jobs, before we basically \nshut down all growth and development, let's take a look at the actual \nscience.\n  So this is just one example of one agency that is overreaching. We \nhave got other examples. You have got the IRS using ``the dog ate my \nhomework'' excuse to duck responsibility. We have also got the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs failing to provide adequate care for our \nheroes.\n  When he established the VA, President Abraham Lincoln promised that \nour Nation would take care of our men and women in uniform and their \nfamilies who have served and defended our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an understatement to say that today, the VA is \nfailing and falling extremely short of that promise that President \nLincoln made. Our soldiers, sailors, airmen, and marines have endured \ntraumatic experiences on the battlefield and should not have to \ncontinue to fight to receive proper care when they return home.\n  Make no mistake, there are many good and dedicated people at VA \nmedical facilities across the country who do a tremendous job every day \ncaring for our veterans. In fact, many of the folks working at VA \nfacilities are veterans themselves. The problem is, the bureaucracy has \ngotten so massive and so out of control, the resources are wasted and \nthe quality of care delivered to veterans has decreased.\n  This culture of unaccountability has led to long wait times, 10,000 \ndisability claims still in backlog, and millions of our tax dollars \nwasted. Our veterans are being ignored and tragically, in some cases, \nleft to die.\n  It was George Washington who has been talked about by my colleague. \nMr. Walker mentioned the anniversary of him resigning his commission. \nGeorge Washington said: ``The willingness with which our young people \nare likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be \ndirectly proportional to how they perceive how the veterans of earlier \nwars were treated and appreciated by their Nation.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I know we will continue our efforts to reshape the \nculture at the VA, but it is high time this administration takes \nresponsibility and joins those of us who want to give veterans a \nchoice.\n  Every veteran in this country should have the choice to go to any \ndoctor of their choosing, and the VA should not have to preapprove it, \nand the VA should pay for that medical care. That is the proposal that \nI have talked about. I think that is the way that we could finally end \nthese wait times, and we can break down these backlogs.\n  I call on the administration to work with us. It is time for the \npeople to have accountability from their government. It is time for our \nveterans to\n\n[[Page H4372]]\n\nhave accountability from the VA. They put everything on the line for \nour country, for our freedom. It is time for us to do the same.\n  God bless our veterans and their families. It is time to get to work.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Representative Hudson, for the passionate \nremarks regarding our veterans.\n  It is a shame, the abuse that we see sometimes of the veterans. But \nthere has probably been no greater abuse than that of our own Internal \nRevenue system. With 75,000 pages, 8,000 pages that have been added \nunder this administration, we can see why abuse and corruption exist.\n  What better person to speak on that than an economics professor. So I \nnow yield to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Brat), a new Member of \nthe Congress.\n  Mr. BRAT. Thank you, Mr. Walker.\n  Mr. Speaker, earlier this month, more details emerged about the IRS' \ntargeting of conservative groups, where the agency tried to extort \ninformation on donors, find out what Members talked about at their \nmeetings and probe into what Members did in their very free time.\n  We learned this month that the IRS had set up yet another roadblock \nto prevent Congress and the American people from getting to the bottom \nof this scandal.\n  The IRS established a team of hundreds of lawyers to redact \ninformation from the documents Congress had requested for its \ninvestigations. This obstruction makes me extremely concerned for every \nAmerican who voices political beliefs that don't agree with this \nadministration's, whether they are conservative, liberal, green, \nreligious, or agnostic.\n  I am grateful for the organization in my own district that exposed \nthis scandal to the American people. The Richmond Tea Party was the \nfirst in the country to go public with the IRS' abuse. Once it was \nexposed, conservative groups from all over the country came forward and \nrevealed that they were victims of the same IRS tactics.\n  The IRS specifically targeted groups with ``Tea Party'' and \n``patriot'' in their names because of their political positions. The \nIRS targeted them for increased scrutiny, and it delayed processing \ntheir applications for nonprofit status.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Let me go over that again just real slowly so the American people \nunderstand what is going on here.\n  The Tea Party group, the T stands for ``taxed enough already.'' They \nare being targeted by the very government agency tasked with ensuring \nfairness in our tax revenue collections system. The irony could not be \nclearer. The groups were subjected to unprecedented and intimidating \nquestioning. The IRS demanded resumes of board members, lists of all \ndonors, and screen shots of blogs and social media posts to determine \nif their speech was acceptable to the Big Brother government. The \nagency asked some groups for minutes of every board meeting as well as \nlists of positions they took on certain issues.\n  On April 15, 2009, thousands of average Virginians showed up to the \nRichmond Tea Party's first rally in the pouring rain to stand together \nagainst government run amuck and President Obama's promise to \nfundamentally transform America. People became engaged--many for the \nfirst time. After word of IRS targeting broke, people stopped coming to \nmeetings and stopped giving money for fear of being targeted \nthemselves.\n  It has been 2 years since the Justice Department opened its \ninvestigation, and it has been 2 years of waiting as nothing ever seems \nto happen. The IRS has tried to cover its tracks at every turn. It lied \nto the public and to this Congress about its secret targeting program. \nTo this day, document requests submitted by Congress remain \nunfulfilled. The IRS complained it had lost thousands of emails \nbelonging to Lois Lerner. Since then, the inspector general recovered \nmore than 6,000 of them. They were located where anyone would expect: \nin the IRS data backup facility.\n  Congress held Lois Lerner in contempt after she claimed she knew \nnothing about the targeting and refused to answer questions about it. \nYet the Obama Justice Department--the Justice Department--has never \nprosecuted her. This all creates the frightening potential that we \ncould foresee a repeat of this very same behavior in the future. We \nneed this President and this administration to live up to their promise \nof transparency rather than their practice of obstruction.\n  Mr. Speaker, we in Congress can put an end to this kind of \nmistreatment of our citizens by passing a fair tax or a flat tax. \nEither tax system would treat citizens more equally and would take away \nthe IRS' power to discriminate and investigate against Americans who \nhold beliefs contrary to those in power.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, the right to express your political views is so \ncritical to the foundation of a free society that it is enshrined in \nour First Amendment--the First Amendment. Our very freedoms and the \nfuture of our constitutional form of government depend on the ability \nof all Americans to freely exercise that right. That is why it is \nincumbent upon this Congress to put forth every effort to protect that \nprecious right and to hold those who would infringe upon it accountable \nto the fullest extent of the law.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Congressman Brat. I appreciate your shedding \nlight.\n  Mr. Speaker, this administration, from the very beginning, went a \nlong way in promising transparency and accountability. In fact, it was \nPresident Obama himself who expressed: ``My administration is committed \nto creating an unprecedented level of openness in government.'' In the \nsame speech, President Obama went on to say: ``Transparency promotes \naccountability and provides information for citizens about what their \ngovernment is doing. Information maintained by the Federal Government \nis a national asset.'' President Obama said: ``My administration will \ntake appropriate action consistent with law and policy to disclose \ninformation rapidly in forms that the public can readily find and \nuse.'' Well, that is what he said, but it has been the exact opposite \nfor the Department of Justice.\n  Many of us have heard about Fast and Furious, and we may have time to \nget to it. What I want to talk about tonight is Operation Choke Point, \nand here to do that tonight is one of the strong conservatives in all \nof Congress, my colleague from South Carolina, Mr. Mick Mulvaney.\n  Mr. MULVANEY. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina. I thank him \nfor doing this. I think it is wonderful that we are having a night \ndesignated as the people's night. You would think that we would do that \njust every day in here, but I think that more often than not we \nprobably don't, so it is good to be here to talk about things that \naffect the people.\n  Some things that affect the people, Mr. Speaker, back where I live is \nOperation Choke Point. Where I live, people buy guns at gun shows. They \nuse pawnshops. They might go to a payday lender every now and again. \nThey might go and buy ammunition. Because of what has happened in \nOperation Choke Point the last year and a half or so, they are starting \nto lose the ability to do that.\n  I want to explain to people very briefly what Operation Choke Point \nis. This is not some rightwing conspiracy. It is not some Internet \nmyth. This has been acknowledged by the Department of Justice.\n  Several years ago, the DOJ, along with the FDIC, one of the banking \nregulators, set out to attack legal businesses, businesses that were \nperfectly legal and permitted under the law, but they were in disfavor \nwith this administration. Instead of trying to drive those businesses \nout of business by using the law, this administration decided to use \nthe regulatory environment. Instead of going directly after those \nbusinesses, this administration went after their banks and said:\n\n       Look, we know that this pawnshop is a legal business, and \n     we know that you have done business with them for a long \n     time, but we could really make your life difficult if you \n     continue to bank this particular pawnshop. In fact, your life \n     will be much easier if you didn't bank this pawnshop.\n\n  Time and again, Mr. Speaker, what we found was these small \nbusinesses--a woman-owned business in my district--losing their banking \nrelationships. The banks that had 25-year relationships with them would \ncome to them and say:\n\n       Look, we simply can't bank with you anymore. It is too \n     difficult to do. There is too much pressure to stop.\n\n\n[[Page H4373]]\n\n\n  I had a woman-owned business, a pawnshop in my district. She tried to \nexpand the business so that the business was big enough to give to both \nof her sons. She was a single mother. She wanted to get the business \nbig enough to where both boys could inherit part of the business. She \nwent to her local bank where she had more than a 20-year relationship, \nand she was told that, no, that she was now too hot to handle. Not only \ncould they not give her a loan to expand the business, they had to pull \nback on the services they already provided.\n  There is another business elsewhere in the State, a large financial \nconcern, and a little tiny piece of what they do is payday lending. You \ncan say what you want to about it, Mr. Speaker. You may not like payday \nlending. A lot of people don't. But people use it, and people need it.\n  I will never forget when I was in the State legislature, we had a \nhearing on payday lending. One of the witnesses that spoke before me in \nthe senate was an employee of one of the local credit unions. I knew \nwho she was. I walked up to her afterwards and said: You are here to \ntalk in favor of payday lending?\n  She said: Yes.\n  I said: But you work for a credit union.\n  She said: Yes.\n  I said: Why are you here?\n  She said: Because everybody in town knows who I am. I am having a \ntough divorce, and I need a little bit of money. If I go to my local \nbank or I go to my credit union where I work, everybody is going to \nknow about it. I don't want people to know about my business.\n  She needed that particular service. Folks need this service. It may \nnot be the proudest thing we do as a nation, but people need it.\n  This company in Greenville, South Carolina, had a little, tiny piece \nof their business in payday, a 30-year banking relationship for all the \nrest of their businesses. The bank came over one day and said: Look, we \nare under a great deal of pressure. We are going to have to pull all \nour relationships with you.\n  Maybe 5, maybe 2\\1/2\\ percent of their business was payday, and now \nthis large employer in my district is struggling to find financial \nservices.\n  It is so offensive, Mr. Speaker, that a couple of months ago, the DOJ \nfinally acknowledged that it was wrong, and they agreed to stop the \nprogram. The FDIC agreed to stop as well. All I can tell you is that \nwhile the letter went out saying it was stopped, we are still hearing \nstories to this day that it is still going on.\n  My dad told me about a year ago, I had been here 3 years at the time, \nand he started paying attention to politics after I got here. He said: \nDo you want to know the difference, Mick, between government today and \ngovernment when I was your age?\n  I said: What is that, Dad?\n  He said: When I was your age, you might not like what the government \ndid, you might not like the party that was in power, but it never even \noccurred to us to be afraid of the government. It never even occurred \nto us that we might be targeted for what we believe or what we think or \nwhat we do for a living. That is what is different now.\n  Mr. Speaker, people are afraid of their government. And if you are \nhome tonight, you are watching this, and you run an ammunition store in \nUnion, South Carolina, you are legitimately afraid that the government \nis going to try and come and put you out of business. That is a \ndramatic change, Mr. Speaker, and not a change for the better.\n  To that extent, a group of men and women come here tonight at the \ninvitation of the good gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), come \nand just tell people that we think it is wrong, too, we have heard what \nthey have had to say back home, and just deliver the message that they \nare not alone, that there are some men and women here in Washington who \nare just as outraged as they are, and they are dedicated to making sure \nthat when our time here is done, they won't have to fear their \ngovernment anymore.\n  So with that, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina, again, for \nsetting up this Special Order.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, when we talk about accountability, we think \nof great leaders here in the Congress, even people who have reached out \nas mentors. I can think of no one higher that has that honor for my \nrespect than the colleague, the part of our delegation from North \nCarolina, Mr. Mark Meadows, and with that, I yield to him.\n  Mr. MEADOWS. I thank the gentleman from North Carolina for his \nleadership and truly for being willing to be the voice of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to really highlight what so many Americans \nhave a hard time understanding, and that is why we as the American \npeople can continue to allow a government to overreach its true \nauthority and not be reined in, Mr. Speaker. So tonight I want to \nhighlight just a few things.\n  Before I do that, I think it is important that we talk about the \nFederal workers here that work for the American people, the vast \nmajority of which--I would say almost 99 percent of which--are \ndedicated public servants who each and every day give their utmost for \ntheir fellow man, truly, to serve this great country.\n  So tonight, Mr. Speaker, I rise to really highlight some of those \nthat give the rest of those great Federal workers a bad name. For many \nof us, they also give us a reason to pause and say: Wait just a minute. \nHow can that happen in this great land?\n  So tonight I feel like it is important that we identify some of these \nworkers who truly have displaced the trust of the American people. They \nhave taken Federal tax dollars, they have continued to take a salary, \nand yet what we find is they did not uphold their constitutional duty \nto do what is right on behalf of the American people.\n  We know one example is with the EPA, the gentleman who worked to \ndefine the Clean Air Act. We found that, over time, he was not even \nshowing up for work, that he would continue to be paid for years and \nyears and years, that he was paid without showing up. Now, certainly \nhis colleagues would have to know that there was an empty cubicle next \nto them, but yet, for over a decade, we have an EPA employee who \npretended to be a CIA agent.\n  Now, when we start to look at this, here he was not showing up for \nwork. He was traveling all over the world at taxpayers' expense. \nIndeed, what he was continuing to do is pretend like he was an employee \nof the Federal Government, but not showing up.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  So my question is really more about accountability, Mr. Speaker. \nWhere was the management team? Where was the accountability? We can \nunderstand one bad apple, but where was the management?\n  Well, let me tell you where they were. This particular EPA employee \ndecides that they are going to go and they are going to retire, and so \nall the management comes together. They give him a great retirement \nparty. He retires and he says: But wait just a minute. You need to \ncontinue to pay me because I am still working for the CIA.\n  Now, the sad part about it is they continued to pay him for another \n18 months. And, Mr. Speaker, I don't know about you, but that is just \nhard to believe. It is the thing that novels are made of, but yet this \nis not fictitious; it is the truth.\n  We have got other EPA employees that are there that are watching porn \non their government computer over 6 hours a day for 4 years. Where is \nthe oversight there?\n  And yet, when people are willing to blow the whistle and say, ``This \nis not right with some of my colleagues,'' what do they meet with?\n  Well, we heard at a hearing just this last week that a whistleblower \nfor the Department of Homeland Security in their EB-5 program was \npunished because she dared to speak up.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, I think it is time that the American people start \nto hold the management of Federal workers accountable because they are \nentrusted with that trust that needs to be carried out each and every \nday. And so tonight I am here to call out Mr. Mayorkas. Recently, an IG \nreport identified Mr. Mayorkas as doing special favors for political \noperatives--allegedly, the Governor of Virginia; allegedly, the brother \nof our former Secretary of State.\n\n[[Page H4374]]\n\n  What the American people will not stand for, Mr. Speaker, is a double \nstandard. If political favors are going to be given out, the people who \ngive them out should be held accountable. And I appreciate the \ngentleman from North Carolina, his leadership, because not only is this \nservice on Oversight and Government Reform designed to make sure that \nwe get to the truth of it, but he is unrelenting in his willingness to \ngo after those who live by a double standard.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Congressman Meadows. I appreciate your words \ntonight.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a lot of interest these days in the growing \nlist of candidates that we have running for the 2016 Presidential \nelection, and one of the things that drove me to make a decision in \nrunning for Congress to begin with was the great abuses that we have in \nsome of the particular agencies.\n  Three years ago, none were more glaring than the State Department and \nthe actions taken by then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. To this \nday, I can't understand why she could look and even hug a family and \ntell them point-blank that this was about a video. Nine days later, our \nPresident followed up with pretty much the same inaccurate jargon.\n  It is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Colorado, \nRepresentative Ken Buck, my friend, tonight, who is going to talk some \nabout her work and her time. He is a great conservative from the State \nof Colorado.\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman and my friend from North \nCarolina for putting this together and for yielding to me.\n  Many of us know that today marks an important anniversary in world \nhistory. Eight hundred years ago, following a populist revolution led \nby courageous English barons demanding the protections from executive \noverreach, England's King John signed into law a document known as the \nMagna Carta. This ``Grand Charter'' marked the first time that \neveryone, including kings, were subjected to the rule of law, that \neveryone would enjoy the benefits of due process and equal protection \nunder the law.\n  The Magna Carta inspired our Founding Fathers to demand liberty in \nthe Declaration of Independence. Many Magna Carta principles appeared \nagain in the United States Constitution. This one single document \nbecame the basis of our Republic and established one of our greatest \nfounding principles, the rule of law, and the rule of law remains as \nimportant as ever.\n  President Obama is working to fundamentally transform our laws \nwithout consent, granting citizenship to illegal immigrants, making \nrecess appointments to the NLRB when the Senate is not in recess, and \nchanging the healthcare law without an act of Congress.\n  The IRS ignored the rule of law by targeting and harassing \nindividuals based on their political beliefs. And who could forget the \nATF's Fast and Furious program, which allowed U.S. weapons to be walked \nacross the U.S.-Mexico border in hopes of catching Mexican drug lords, \nbut ended with the tragic murder of U.S. Border Patrol Agent Brian \nTerry.\n  It is time to prevent future would-be monarchs from being elected and \nfurther eroding our proud tradition for the rule of law. While the \nClinton family has been known to play by their own set of rules and has \na laundry list of scandals that goes back decades, I am squarely \nfocused on two dubious, dishonest, and dangerous scandals that Hillary \nClinton was involved in while serving as Secretary of State.\n  As the Nation's top diplomat, Secretary Clinton used her position of \npower to create her own set of rules, using a personal email account \nfor official State Department business. She continued to do so even \nafter issuing a memo calling on staff to use official government email \naccounts.\n  Secretary Clinton ignored the rule of law when she deleted over \n30,000 State Department emails from a personal server located in the \nbasement of her Georgetown mansion. What makes this worse is that she \ndeleted these emails even as Congress called for her to release them. \nStoring these emails on a private server violates Federal records law. \nDeleting these emails also raises questions not seen since the IRS \ntargeting investigation. What is she hiding in these deleted emails? \nDid she even consider what might happen if these records fell into the \nwrong hands? Would she even know if her server had been breached?\n  Secretary Clinton proudly stated during a March 10 press conference: \nI fully complied with every rule I was governed by.\n  Americans will never know because she ignored the rule of law. By \nexclusively using a personal email account to conduct State Department \nbusiness, Secretary Clinton put the State Department at a great risk \njust for her personal convenience. The Secretary of State is also not \nallowed to conduct and store official State Department business on a \nprivate, unsecured server. If any other hard-working American conducted \ntheir business this way, they would be out of a job and most likely in \njail.\n  This brings me to the Clinton family's next scandal. While Hillary \nClinton served as Secretary of State, the Clinton family foundation \ncontinued to accept millions of dollars in donations from foreign \ngovernments. All told, seven foreign nations, including Kuwait, Qatar, \nOman, and Algeria, donated money to the Clinton Foundation during the \ntime Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State.\n  These contributions raised questions about Secretary Clinton's \nindependence and ethical judgment. But when some of the $1 million \ndonations in question came from nations like Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the \nUnited Arab Emirates, and Oman, it raises concerns about whether these \nnations were hoping to gain better diplomatic ties to the United States \nthrough sizable donations to the Clinton Foundation. When the Secretary \nof State is playing fast and loose with the rule of law, even ignoring \na memorandum of understanding with the White House regarding a \nquestionable donation from the Algerian Government, it is extremely \ndifficult to trust her judgment or her word when she claims not to have \nbroken any laws.\n  The rule of law has been a core principle since our founding. Brave \nmen and women have fought and died to protect this idea and preserve \nthe liberty we hold so dearly. This is why I find it especially tragic \nthat Secretary Clinton blatantly ignored the rule of law.\n  The Magna Carta's anniversary is a great opportunity to remember the \ncourageous barons who secured the rule of law. We must restore this key \nprinciple and stop the attacks on our founding principles. It is our \njob to safeguard those liberties and protect the America we know and \nlove for generations to come.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Congressman Buck.\n  With that, it is my privilege to yield to the gentleman from Georgia, \nCongressman Jody Hice, my colleague and a former fellow minister.\n  Mr. JODY B. HICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina.\n  Mr. Speaker, I continue to be just astounded at the lack of \naccountability and transparency surrounding the scandal with the IRS as \nit relates to conservative groups and the targeting that the IRS had \ntowards those groups.\n  It is absolutely unacceptable that we have waited now for over 2 \nyears to get answers to this scandal and the targeting of conservative \ngroups. Right at the epicenter of all of that is Lois Lerner. We \nrequested emails some 2 years ago and only right now, 2 years later, \nsome of these requests for emails are coming to light. These documents \nand communications requested should have been brought forth long ago. \nIn fact, we are at the time now in this investigation, we are at the \npoint now that I believe we need to seriously question the process by \nwhich Congress' requests for information from the IRS are being handled \nby the IRS.\n  One example, Mr. Speaker, in the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee, where I have the distinct honor of serving, it came to light \nin that committee that the IRS actually formed a special project team \nin order to deal with the Lois Lerner investigation.\n  According to testimony by Ms. Mary Howard, who is the Director of the \nPrivacy, Governmental Liaison and Disclosure for the IRS, according to \nher\n\n[[Page H4375]]\n\ntestimony, all congressional subpoenas, requests for information, \nFreedom of Information Act requests, and other investigative requests \nwere directed to this special group, this special project team, rather \nthan going through the normal process of investigations that other \nsimilar investigations might go through.\n  According to her testimony, Mr. Speaker, these requests were handled \nprimarily by the IRS Commissioner and the IRS Office of Chief Council \nrather than the normal process. In other words, this special project \nteam handled the issue with Lois Lerner differently than they handle \nother similar investigations.\n  Ms. Howard's testimony further revealed that the IRS, on numerous \noccasions, went away from the standard way of dealing with freedom of \ninformation requests and, if her testimony is true, the handling of the \nFOIA requests not only for Ms. Lois Lerner, but for other 501(c)(3) and \n(c)(4) organizations, and may have gone beyond what is even permissible \nunder the Freedom of Information Act.\n  Following her testimony, Chairmen Chaffetz and Jordan sent a letter \nto the IRS Commissioner, John Koskinen, requesting more information so \nthat the Oversight Committee could better understand the process that \nthey used in dealing with Ms. Lois Lerner. And I am told that, even as \nrecently as this past Friday, the letter received back from the IRS is \ntotally inadequate. It does not answer the questions, and here we are \nstill years removed from it.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is extremely frustrating that now, 2 years later, we \nare still dealing with this issue. It is frustrating that in the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee we are still dealing with the \ndeplorable activities of how the IRS has been handling this.\n  It is up to Congress. We must continue pushing forward for increased \naccountability and transparency in all areas of our government, \nparticularly as it relates to this with the IRS.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. Thank you, Congressman Hice.\n  With that, I yield to the gentleman from the State of Texas, Mr. John \nRatcliffe, one of our sharpest new Members from the State of Texas, a \ndistrict attorney, who we asked specifically to come out to share some \nthoughts tonight specifically about some of the continued abuses.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina \nfor yielding this evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, the most fundamental principle of our criminal justice \nsystem is that we are innocent until proven guilty. Operation Choke \nPoint turns that most sacred tenet on its head.\n  When President Obama and his administration uses agencies like the \nDepartment of Justice and the FDIC to target legal businesses without \ndue process, without any public debate, and when he bases his attacks \nnot on the rule of law but on his own political beliefs, well, that is \na tragic breakdown of the system of checks and balances and separation \nof powers that our Founding Fathers deliberately designed.\n  Mr. Speaker, Operation Choke Point is just flat wrong. Folks all \nacross the Fourth Congressional District of Texas in cities and towns \nlike Bonham, Denison, Sulphur Springs, Texarkana, and Sherman, they all \njust want to run their businesses and enjoy their freedoms without fear \nof persecution from a President that has overstepped his authority time \nand time again.\n  Many of the Texans that I represent are deeply troubled and concerned \nabout Operation Choke Point, an initiative which is pressuring banks \nand others in the financial industry to deny access to financial \nservices to businesses like gun sellers and coal producers.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  My constituents see this operation for what it really is, a blunt \nweapon that targets and stigmatizes entire industries that the Obama \nadministration dislikes, instead of an honest effort to get rid of \nactual bad actors and lawbreakers.\n  Sadly, as a direct result of Operation Choke Point, legitimate \nbusinesses in Texas and across the country have been forced to close \nsimply because the President and his activist bureaucrats have a \npolitical agenda, and they don't like what these businesses are \nselling. When you weaponize your government to go after folks you don't \nlike and when you target your own citizens as political enemies, that \nis the way that Third World governments operate, not the greatest \ncountry the world has ever seen.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the United States of America, and our government \nshould never go after its own citizens for political reasons. This is \nespecially outrageous when the administration does so by targeting the \nBill of Rights, and that is exactly what is happening here.\n  When you specifically target gun dealers and ammunition \nmanufacturers, that is an affront to and an assault upon our Second \nAmendment rights. No President or administration is above the \nConstitution and the Bill of Rights. I have met recently with far too \nmany honest, hard-working, law-abiding folks in the gun industry who \nhave been politically targeted by this initiative.\n  We can't allow this administration to continue to target legitimate \nbusinesses, like gun stores and cigar and pawn shops, through Operation \nChoke Point, just because the President doesn't like what they sell. \nPressuring and forcing banks to stop engaging with legal industries \nneeds to stop. We can't allow unelected bureaucrats to make such a \nbrazen, backdoor assault on legitimate businesses and the hard-working, \nlaw-abiding citizens who own and operate them.\n  In July of 2014, one of the Judiciary subcommittees on which I now \nserve held a hearing on Operation Choke Point, and because of that \nhearing and of the due process concerns raised by the testimony there, \nthe DOJ and the FDIC announced it would rescind its list of so-called \nhigh-risk merchants.\n  That move seemed to be an apparent recognition of the fact that \nOperation Choke Point is wrongfully inflicting collateral damage on \nlegitimate businesses that are losing access to financial services. \nDespite this acknowledgment and admission from those at the top, \ncompanies across my district tell me that the administration's foot \nsoldiers on the ground simply haven't gotten the message yet. The \nharassment is continuing, and this is simply unacceptable.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should stand up for the rights of every American. I \nam saddened to see a President who is so out of touch with what has \nmade this country great, who is so out of touch that he would use an \narmy of unelected bureaucrats to attack businesses that don't toe the \nideological line with his administration.\n  Mr. Speaker, congressional oversight demands that we refuse to step \naside, that we refuse to let this unprovoked attack on our \nconstitutional and fundamental rights go unchallenged. I will continue \nto stand watch against this overreach. My colleagues and I will not \nallow our constituents' rights to be violated or our Constitution to be \ntrampled.\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank Congressman Ratcliffe for his powerful stance.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 2012, one of the bulldogs that has been holding \nthe IRS accountable is the Congressman from central Florida. At this \npoint, I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my friend from North Carolina.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you are a taxpayer and if you become subjected to an \nIRS audit, you have got to prove and justify what you have submitted to \nthe IRS. If you tell the IRS, ``I don't really have those documents. \nThey were destroyed, and there is nothing I can do. Let's just move \nalong,'' I don't think most IRS agents are going to accept that, and I \nthink the taxpayer would likely find himself in hot water.\n  I think it is really unacceptable that the IRS seems to think it \ncould operate under a totally different standard than the standard that \nit imposes on American taxpayers.\n  We have been going through this now since 2013 with Lois Lerner and \nthe targeting scandal in our trying to get more information. Last year, \nbefore Congress, John Koskinen, the IRS Commissioner, said: We are \ngoing to produce Lois Lerner's emails. We will produce all of them. We \nhave nothing to hide.\n\n[[Page H4376]]\n\n  A couple of months later, he said: Actually, most of Lois Lerner's \nemails were destroyed because, you see, they are held on these backup \ntapes, and we recycle the backup tapes. We destroy the tapes, so there \nis just nothing we can do here. We are just going to move along, and we \nare not going to participate in any meaningful way with your \ninvestigation.\n  Most Americans didn't accept that, and it really was not worth the \npaper it was printed on in terms of an excuse. It was, obviously, much \ndifferent than what the IRS would impose on a taxpayer, but it was even \nmore than that. It was more than just a weak excuse; it was false.\n  Once Koskinen said that the emails were destroyed--guess what?--the \nInspector General for Tax Administration in the Treasury Department did \nbasic due diligence and said: Do you know what? I am going to check to \nsee whether Koskinen is telling the truth.\n  What did the IG do? He drove out to West Virginia where they have the \nwarehouse of all of the backup tapes. What did they find? The Lois \nLerner emails on the backup tapes. They were there the whole time. Now, \nthey have pulled thousands and thousands of Lois Lerner emails.\n  These are emails that are, in many cases, different than the emails \nthat the IRS begrudgingly produced to Congress and to the American \npeople. This is a major, major issue. Of course, there is the \ntargeting, but then there are the lengths that the IRS has gone to \nstymie Congress' investigation.\n  Just this week in Federal court, they are fighting Judicial Watch. \nThey don't want to turn over even these new emails that the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration provided to the IRS.\n  They are saying: We can't turn them over to you now in the course of \nthe litigation. We are not going to turn them over to Congress because \nwe need to check to see whether there are any duplicates from the \nemails that we have already turned over.\n  Really? Who cares? Give us the emails. Give the American people the \ntruth. What they are trying to do is to stonewall and drag this out as \nlong as they can, hoping that the American people will forget about it. \nThen, basically, they get away scot-free, with nobody in their \norganization being held accountable.\n  I think it is a test of this institution here in the Congress about \nwhether somebody like Commissioner Koskinen is going to be held to \naccount for misleading Congress, for providing false information to \nCongress.\n  The fact of the matter is, if an American taxpayer were hauled in \nfront of a Federal grand jury or a Federal court and if he gave \ntestimony like that, that was not true, he would face consequences. You \ncan bet your bottom dollar.\n  I think the IRS is kind of the grossest example that we have in \nWashington of really a fundamental problem with how our government \noperates, which is that the people who work and operate in and around \nWashington, D.C.--6 of the 10 wealthiest counties in our country are \nnow suburbs of Washington, D.C. We are not producing shale here. We \ndon't have technology--nothing--in Washington.\n\n  It is all because of the power and growth of government, so people \ninside the beltway are not held accountable. You have people at the \nIRS, and you have people at the EPA, and you have people in all of \nthese different agencies. Essentially, they are allowed to operate \nunder a lower standard of conduct than what an American taxpayer or a \ncitizen would be allowed or permitted to do by the government. That is \nunacceptable.\n  I think that this IRS issue is as important a government \naccountability issue as we are facing in this Congress. I think it is a \ntest for the House as to whether we are going to be serious about this \nand hold these IRS officials accountable.\n  I am glad my friend from North Carolina had the time here today. I \nthink it was very productive to listen to some of the other Members. I \njust want the American people to know that I am committed to getting to \nthe bottom of this and to holding these people accountable not only for \nthe targeting, but for obstructing the investigation when it has been \nobstructed over and over again.\n  Mr. WALKER. I thank Congressman DeSantis.\n  Mr. Speaker, tonight, in closing, we have had an evening which we \nhave called and labeled ``the People's Night,'' one of many that we \nplan on holding. I thank the dozen or so colleagues who have shown \ntheir concern.\n  We talk much about awareness these days, but few times do we get to \nthe accountable and to the action step process. Government has run \namuck. That is why many of us ran to begin with.\n  I sent out an email this afternoon, asking a few of the constituents \nback home what some of the things are they are concerned about. The \npresident of our local women's Republican club sent back two paragraphs \nand listed about 12 or 13 things. Those are the kinds of things we need \nto be calling out.\n  It has been a privilege to be with my colleagues this evening. I \nappreciate their time as they continue to show strong support for these \nwonderful men and women.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4376-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4376]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2596, \n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia, from the Committee on Rules, submitted a \nprivileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Rothfus) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, this evening, I would like to take some \ntime to remind the American people of the nature of a sworn enemy of \nthe United States, whose leaders to this day, as they have for the past \n36 years, continue to chant, ``Death to America.''\n  That enemy, Mr. Speaker, is Iran. Mr. Speaker, the permanent members \nof the U.N. Security Council--the United States, the United Kingdom, \nFrance, Russia, and China, plus Germany, this group known as the P5+1--\nhave engaged in negotiations with Iran in an attempt to halt Iran's \ndevelopment of nuclear weapons.\n  Of significant note, unlike the negotiations that we had with North \nKorea years ago regarding its pursuit of nuclear weapons, those \nnegotiations included the United States and North Korea's neighbors--\nChina, Russia, South Korea, and Japan. Iran's regional neighbors and \nclosest targets, however--Saudi Arabia, Jordan, and Israel--were not \ninvited to participate in these talks.\n  A framework for an agreement with the P5+1 and Iran was reached in \nApril, but that framework is simply inadequate to halt the regime's \nmarch to a nuclear weapon.\n  Iran cannot be allowed to get a nuclear weapon. Such an event would \nset off a destabilizing arms race in a region of the world that is \nalready afire with sectarian hatred. It is a real threat that Iran \nwould use such a weapon against Israel, Europe, or with its continued \ndevelopment of long-range intercontinental ballistic missiles against \nthe United States.\n  Iran's surface-to-surface missile expansion is a threat typically \nleft out of discussions over its nuclear program, but we cannot ignore \nthat Iran has now built itself the largest and most sophisticated long-\nrange missile arsenal in the Middle East.\n  The current nuclear framework agreed to in April represents a \nsignificant shift in U.S. policy regarding Iran's nuclear program. \nUnder the agreed upon framework, Iran's nuclear centrifuges will be \nallowed to keep spinning for the next decade. This is the first \nPresidential administration to\n\n[[Page H4377]]\n\nagree to a deal that allows Iran to continue enriching uranium, thereby \nlegitimizing Iran's entire nuclear program.\n  Importantly, the administration's notion that oversight from \ninternational atomic inspectors can keep Iran from developing a weapon \nis simply not true. For over a decade, Iran has evaded the very \noversight body tasked with conducting inspections and monitoring its \nnuclear stockpiles.\n  If the past 15 years are any indication, we know that Iran will incur \nenormous financial costs and wreck its domestic economy, all to \ncontinue enriching uranium and developing and testing nuclear weapons \nat secret facilities and undeclared sites.\n  In light of the past 15 years, we know Iran will continue to evade \nthe international community just as it did when building and operating \nits Natanz and Fordow facilities in complete secrecy, concealed from \ninternational atomic inspectors.\n  Those who choose can ignore the writing on the wall and whitewash \nIran's previous violations of numerous international treaties while \ncontinuing to operate its covert nuclear program. Those who choose can \nignore the hostile rhetoric that still spews from the mouths of Iran's \nso-called reformers, including so-called moderates, like President \nRouhani, who publicly brags about Iran's ability to deceive the West, \nusing stall tactics at the negotiating table when, all the while, Iran \ncontinues making progress behind the scenes on its nuclear program.\n  Mr. Speaker, many of us have grave concerns about the deal being \nnegotiated in that it will leave Iran on the path to nuclear weapons \nwhile allowing for the complete relief from the sanctions that forced \nIran to the table.\n  I suggest that, even if Iran abandons its path to the bomb, it is \ncompletely reasonable to leave the sanctions in place until Iran stops \nthe terror campaign it has been on for the last 36 years.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  I simply ask fellow Americans to be skeptical of any assurances that \nIran has stopped or will stop pursuing a nuclear weapon. Just 6 months \nago President Obama used these Iran negotiations to silence critics who \noppose his foreign policy. In an interview with CNN, the President \nsuggested that the year-and-a-half of ongoing negotiations with Iran is \nprobably the first time that Iran ``has not advanced its nuclear \nprogram in the last decade.''\n  President Obama didn't stop there. He went on to assure people that \nthis freeze on Iran's nuclear program had been verified by the U.N. and \nthe international atomic inspectors, who acknowledge that Iran has not \nmade progress. Yet, we know now that the opposite is true. In the last \n18 months of negotiations, Iran has not frozen its nuclear program, by \nany stretch, but has actually increased its nuclear stockpiles by 20 \npercent.\n  Iran's nuclear program is a very serious problem. But it is only one \nof the dimensions of the threat that Iran poses to the world. It \nremains only one part of an overall program of terror that has been \ncarried out by Iran for a very long time.\n  I wanted to offer this Special Order about Iran today because it is a \nvery important anniversary. Thirty years ago today Navy Seabee diver \nRobert Stethem was singled out and murdered by Iranian-backed \nterrorists because he was a United States servicemember. He was only 23 \nyears old at that time, the same age that I was. His murder was at the \nhands of Hezbollah, an Iran-funded militant terror group aboard the \nhijacked TWA flight 847. We can never forget the barbaric way in which \nhe was murdered and his body subsequently dropped from the plane onto \nthe Beirut runway.\n  Master chief constructionman Stethem, we will never forget the \nsacrifice you gave for our country, and together we pray for your \nfamily.\n  Robert was born in Connecticut to parents Richard and Patricia \nStethem. Just as his mother and father had done, Robert followed his \nfamily footsteps and signed up to serve in the U.S. Navy shortly before \nhe would celebrate his 20th birthday. He was returning from an \nassignment in Greece aboard TWA flight 847 headed to Beirut when the \naircraft was seized by militants.\n  Bobby Stethem never got to pursue the hopes and dreams that every \nAmerican has: settling down, raising a family, and contributing more of \nhimself to this wonderful, exceptional Nation. His parents lost the \ncomfort and grace of seeing a son grow old, and his siblings lost a \nlifelong friend and companion. And lest we forget, it was Iranian-\nbacked terrorists who put an end to this young life. Bobby Stethem was \none victim of Iran's reign of terror. There have been many more.\n  Iran's hostility toward America emerged in full force in 1979 when it \nfailed to protect the American Embassy in Tehran and allowed radical \nIslamist students to seize the Embassy and take American diplomats and \nmarines hostage, holding 52 of them hostage for 444 days. The attempted \nrescue of the hostages in April 1980 resulted in the deaths of eight \nAmericans, and Iran bears full responsibility for those deaths.\n  Throughout the 1980s, Iran funded terrorists in Lebanon who were \nresponsible for the deaths of hundreds of Americans. To recall some of \nthe events: Between 1982 and 1992, Iranian-backed Hezbollah \nsystematically kidnapped 96 foreign nationals, 25 of them Americans. At \nleast eight died in captivity. Some were murdered, while others died as \na result of inadequate medical attention.\n  On April 18, 1983, Hezbollah bombed the American Embassy in Beirut, \nkilling 63, including 17 Americans. Six months later, on October 23, \n1983, a Hezbollah suicide bomber drove a truck laden with more than \n15,000 pounds of explosives into the U.S. Marine barracks at the Beirut \nairport, killing 241 marines and wounding more than 100 more. Fifty-\neight French paratroopers were also killed.\n  On September 20, 1984, Hezbollah struck again with another bombing, \nthis time carrying out an attack on the U.S. Embassy annex in Beirut, \nkilling 24 people, including two Americans.\n  The reign of terror moved from the 1980s to the 1990s, when Iranian-\nbacked terrorists attacked the Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1996, \nkilling 19 airmen of the United States Air Force.\n  Iran continued its attacks on Americans throughout the 2000s and the \n2010s with its backing of terrorists who killed American servicemembers \nusing IEDs in Iraq and Afghanistan. An article from March 2015 quotes a \nformer U.S. war general who served in Iraq and estimates that Iran was \nresponsible for about one-third of U.S. casualties during the war, \nwhich amounts to approximately 1,500 sons and daughters of America who \nnever came home alive.\n  In addition to its attacks on Americans, Iran-backed terrorists \nattacked other nations around the world. In March of 1992, Hezbollah \ndetonated a truck bomb at the Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires, killing \n29 people and injuring 240 others.\n  On July 18, 1994, Iran bombed a Jewish community center in Buenos \nAires, which took the lives of 85 innocent civilians and injured more \nthan 300. Again, in July of 2012, Hezbollah operatives claimed \nresponsibility after a suicide bomber detonated a bomb on an Israeli \nbus in Bulgaria, killing five Israelis and wounding 30 people.\n  Until Iran stops its export of terror and stops its threats to \nIsrael, the United States, and other nations, no sanction relief should \nbe granted. If Iran does not abandon its nuclear ambitions, sanctions \nshould be increased.\n  I am privileged this evening, Mr. Speaker, to be joined by some \ncolleagues. I would like to yield to my colleague from New York, \nCongressman Lee Zeldin, who represents a part of Long Island. \nCongressman Zeldin is a great addition to this House, serving in his \nfreshman year, and also a veteran of the U.S. Army. I yield to \nCongressman Zeldin.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his leadership \non this issue.\n  Iran is a nation led by a regime threatening the stability of the \nfree world. That is nothing new. Iran has a long history of supporting \nterrorism and working to overthrow foreign governments. Since 1984, \nover 30 years ago, the United States has called Iran a state sponsor of \nterrorism, not only for their direct participation in attacks, but for \ntheir financing and other support for others who pursue terror.\n  Iran has brought instability to the Middle East and does not act in \ngood faith, blowing up mock U.S. warships,\n\n[[Page H4378]]\n\npledging to wipe Israel off the map, developing ICBMs, and chanting in \ntheir streets: ``Death to America.'' The Iranian Government threatens \npeace and democracy all across the globe. Nuclear weapons in the hands \nof our enemies harms the security of our freedoms and liberties that \nAmerica cherishes and has worked so hard to defend.\n  The Iranian Government came to the negotiating table dealt an \nimpossible hand, you would think. In Texas Hold'Em, they call it a 7-2 \noff suit. In 2009, when the economy was doing better in Iran--oil was \n$100 a barrel--millions of Iranians took to the streets to overthrow \ntheir own government. The President of the United States essentially \nmade it out to be just their problem, not ours, and did not engage. Now \nlook at the predicament we find ourselves in here today.\n\n  The President of the United States comes into office, inheriting \npocket aces when he sits down at the table, and pocket aces happen to \nbe the best hand you can have in Texas Hold'Em. The President sits down \nwith the leadership of the Iranian Government and asks to swap hands, \nin the spirit of fairness and equality and good faith. Yes, the pocket \naces earned on the backs of generations of Americans who have shed \nblood--they have fought and died to protect the United States, the \ngreatest nation on God's green Earth--and as a negotiating style, the \nPresident swaps hands with the bad guys.\n  As we inch closer to the June 30 deadline, I want to reinforce that a \nbad deal is worse than no deal at all. Mr. President, you are getting \nplayed at the table. Take a walk; it is okay. It is time to strengthen \nyour hand. Please do not prop up this regime with tens of billions of \ndollars in relief from sanctions. They are using that money to finance \nterror and overthrow foreign governments aligned with America, and that \nis with a bad economy and oil half the price.\n  Don't make a slew of permanent concessions on our side in exchange \nfor temporary concessions on the part of the Iranians. Show strength, \nnot weakness. Too many Americans have shed their blood to make our \ngreat Nation what it is today. We need strength in your voice and an \narticulation of resolve that there will be no death to America.\n  It is not okay for Iran to wipe Israel off the map. We demand the \nrelease of our Americans being unjustly imprisoned in their nation, \nwhich includes a United States marine. Where is the passion to free \nAmir now and the others of our fellow citizens wrongfully kept in their \njails? Play the pocket aces, Mr. President. America's greatness, its \nexceptionalism, its strength is nothing to ever apologize for.\n  About a month-and-a-half ago I was with former President George Bush, \nand a couple things he said then strike me, and I want to reference \nthem here today. One is very simple. He says: The world needs America \nto lead. We can have a different understanding or philosophy on tactics \nof what that means. It is something that we all know to be true. The \nworld needs America to lead.\n  The other was a story about him throwing out the first pitch at \nYankee Stadium right after 9/11. He knew the stadium was going to be \nfilled up. It was the World Series. It was right after 9/11. America \nwas watching, and they were looking for something to be able to \ncelebrate. Now, he was down getting ready to come out of the dugout, \nwearing a bulletproof vest, and he had a conversation with Derek Jeter. \nDerek Jeter asked the President whether or not he was going to throw \nfrom the top of the mound or the front of the mound, and the President \nanswered: ``What should I do?'' Derek Jeter says: ``You have to throw \nfrom the top of the mound or they won't respect you.'' A few moments \nlater, the President is getting ready to walk out onto the field, and \nDerek Jeter said one other last word of advice. His last words were: \n``Don't bounce it. They will boo you.''\n  We need a perfect strike here, Mr. President, from the top of the \nmound, and don't bounce it. Don't bring home a bad deal. The resulting \nboos would be the least of America's problems. Right now is a time for \nstrength and not weakness.\n  For that reason, I once again want to thank the gentleman for \nbringing this important Special Order here tonight.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague for his remarks and reminding us of \nthe stakes. Also, Mr. Speaker, in a recent hearing held by the newly \nformed Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, one expert we \nheard from described the threat posed by just one of the many Iranian-\nbacked terror groups. He told us: Hezbollah remains one of the most \ncapable terror organizations in the world. The group's original aims \nwere to establish a radical Shia Islamist theocracy in Lebanon and \ndestroy Israel. However, in recent years Hezbollah has ``established \ncells and infrastructure in places across the globe, from Latin America \nand Africa to Europe and Asia.'' As a former Hezbollah leader confirmed \nyears ago, ``Hezbollah has been receiving since 1982 all kinds of \nmoral, political, and material backing from the Islamic Republic of \nIran.''\n  We must consider the implications that lifting sanctions could have \non Iran's ability to export terror and finance military operations \naround the world. To this very day, we know that Iran remains the most \nactive and largest state sponsor of terrorism. The wide array of terror \nactivities Iran either supports financially or militarily include but \nare not limited to Hezbollah, Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Hamas, the \nHouthi in Yemen, Shiite militias in Iraq, and militants in Afghanistan, \nwhile also maintaining its own terrorism apparatus, the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps.\n  Notably, many of the terror financing experts we have heard from \nthroughout our terror task force hearings have emphasized their \nconcerns over the Obama administration's willingness to lift sanctions \nand free up billions of dollars for the Iranian regime to use at large. \nMany experts agree that these sanctions have, without a doubt, \ndiminished Iran's ability to support terrorism and proliferation.\n  It is shocking to think that the current administration would provide \nbillions of dollars in a windfall for the Iranian regime in return for \npromises that Iran will limit its nuclear weapons pursuit without \nstringent mechanisms that can guarantee Iran will not use that money to \nsend paychecks to militants or the family of militants who plan to use \nit for attacks against innocent civilians.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Sanctions relief will provide money Iran can continue to use to set \nup and enhance militant training groups for Hezbollah and Hamas and \ngroups in northern Africa. It is money Tehran can continue to send for \ncovert weapons shipments and support terror operations across the \nglobe. Lifting economic sanctions will allow Iran to again use the \ninternational banking sector and make it more difficult to prevent them \nfrom conducting transfers and finding ways to support illicit terror \ngroups.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must wake up and recognize that the Iranian threat is \nmuch greater than the administration would have us believe. The threat \nis complex, multifaceted, and we must be combating the Iranian regime \non multiple fronts instead of providing the regime billions of dollars \nin bonus money, all for agreeing to cooperate and pretend, if only for \na short time, that they will act in good faith and adhere to \ninternational law and norms.\n  I am also joined this evening by my colleague from Florida, \nCongressman Ron DeSantis, himself a veteran of the Navy JAG Corps. He \nhas been outspoken on these issues.\n  I am pleased to yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. I thank my friend from Pennsylvania.\n  I was listening intently to our colleague from New York talk about \nthe President needing to get up on the top of the mound and throw a \nperfect strike here with this deal. I have seen the President throw a \nbaseball, and Lord help us if that is what we need to stop this, \nbecause I think we are in a major, major pickle here, and it has been \nthe result of bad policies from the beginning.\n  Almost 2 years ago, in 2013, this House voted to increase sanctions \non Iran. And we did that with over 400 votes, on a bipartisan basis. \nAnd that was really the obvious thing to do at the time because the \nleadership of Iran, the mullahs, were chafing under the sanctions \nregime that was in place. And the way to deal with a country like Iran, \nwith a leadership that is\n\n[[Page H4379]]\n\ndedicated to militant Islam, is when they are starting to chafe, you \nturn the screws harder.\n  We did that thing. We did the right thing. In the Senate, Harry Reid \nwould not bring that up for a vote. The President decided that rather \nthan that route, he would simply provide unilateral sanctions relief to \nIran, saying: This is a gesture of good faith. Now we want you to \nreciprocate with your nuclear program.\n  Basically, from that time forward, Iran has said: Go fly a kite. We \nare not giving up anything.\n  So the agreement we seem to be on the verge of submitting to the \nCongress allows Iran to keep their entire nuclear infrastructure. The \nunderground bunker at Fordow is fortified for a missile attack. Why do \nyou need to fortify a nuclear facility against a missile attack if it \nis for peaceful purposes? So they get to keep that.\n  They have a heavy water reactor in Iraq that they get to keep. That \nis used to produce plutonium. They don't need it for peaceful purposes. \nThey have advanced centrifuges that they are allowed to keep. Again, no \nuse for those for peaceful purposes.\n  So Iran is basically in a situation where, if you turn back the clock \nalmost 2 years, when this House voted those sanctions with over 400 \nvotes, if you asked Iran and the Iranian leadership what they most \nwanted, they probably said: Well, look, we want to keep our nuclear \ninfrastructure, but we want to get rid of these sanctions.\n  And guess what? That looks to be what is going to happen. And that is \ngoing to be a very, very dangerous and bad deal.\n  I do think it is worth pointing out as much as we can the nature of \nthis regime. They are not only fomenting problems in the Middle East, \nthey are not only dedicated to the destruction of Israel, they are \ndedicated to the destruction of the United States.\n  The most deadly attack on U.S. marines since Iwo Jima was in 1983 at \nthe Marine Corps barracks in Beirut, when Hezbollah, which was \nsupported by Iran, bombed and killed 220 U.S. marines, another 21 \npersonnel. That is a major amount of American blood on their hands.\n  In Iraq, in 2006, 2007, and 2008, they were responsible for killing \nhundreds of our servicemembers through the Shiite militias that were \noperating as their proxy forces, and may have killed as many as 1,500. \nSo, again, that is major, major American blood on their hands.\n  This is a regime that has never, since 1979, showed any evidence of \nchanging or deviating from their ideology-rooted and militant Islam. \nThey are a danger not only to the region, but to the world.\n  We have seen now for some time, since this President has taken \noffice, Iran has steadily increased its influence and power in the \nregion. They are the number one actor in Iraq, by far. They are now \nbattling for Yemen with the Houthis. They are the number one patron of \nHamas on the Gaza Strip. They are the number one patron of Hezbollah in \nLebanon, and they are the number one patron of Assad in Syria. And so \nthis is a massive Shiite crescent throughout the Middle East.\n  And guess what? When Sunni Arabs see our administration bending over \nbackwards to cut deals with Iran, they see the Shiite-backed militias \nthat are backed by Iran and Iraq--the ones fighting ISIS--that makes \nthe average Sunni Arab say: You know what? I am much more likely to \nwant to join ISIS than have to live under Shiite oppression.\n  So the President's policy, I think, has been bad for expanding Iran's \ninfluence, but I think it also has the effect of driving more Sunni \nArabs into the hands of ISIS, and so it is lose-lose policy.\n  I thank my friend from Pennsylvania for having this discussion. I \nhope that this bad deal doesn't happen, but if it does, we need to have \nrobust debate in the House. We need to pick apart the deal piece by \npiece and show how this is not something that is good for security in \nthe world.\n  We can see that already before the deal has even been agreed to \nbecause you see an arms race in the Middle East with the Sunni Arab \nstates that has been underway now for some time. That is a direct \nresult of the bad policies that this administration has engaged in vis-\na-vis Iran.\n  So the regime in Iran is an enemy of the country. We need to \nrecognize that. And we need to make sure that we scrutinize any deal \nthat comes to this Congress that allows Iran to maintain a nuclear \ncapacity and that it is voted down resoundingly.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague.\n  There is plenty to consider as the negotiations continue between the \nP5+1 and Iran as we look forward to what deal will be produced.\n  Again, with the concerns that have been expressed by my colleagues \nfrom Florida and New York, we must be vigilant, particularly when you \nlook at the context of what has been happening with Iran over the 36 \nyears.\n  Again, today we mark the sad anniversary of the murder of Bobby \nStethem at the hands of Iranian-backed terrorists. Bobby is one of many \nvictims that this Islamic regime out of Iran has been responsible for \nover nearly four decades.\n  Going forward, an agreement where Iran would not even be required to \nactually stop enriching uranium merits our grave concern. In light of a \nfinal agreement's far-reaching implications for the security of both \nour allies in the region and our own national defenses, we must be \nextremely vigilant.\n  As a Member who sits on a House committee that has been tasked with \ninvestigating the financial backers that keep international terror \ngroups well-armed and operating, we cannot ignore Iran's leading role \nin international terror financing.\n  As many experts have warned our Committee, once the administration \nagrees to lift all economic sanctions and free up billions of dollars \nto the Iranian regime, there is no guarantee that deepening the \nregime's pockets will not result in increased financing for acts of \nterror that will kill innocent people.\n  In addition, contrary to what has been publicly suggested by the \nPresident, it will be all but impossible to simply slap those economic \nsanctions back into effect should Iran break the terms of a final \nnuclear weapons deal.\n  We must look to the past and consider the present situation. We owe \nas much to all those who were murdered at the hand of the Iranian \nregime and by terror groups who would use Iranian money and weapons to \ntake the lives of innocent men, women, and children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4379-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4379-H4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            PIVOT TO AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nRussell) until 10 p.m.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, Congress has a chance this week to turn the \nPresident's ``Pivot to Asia'' into a ``Pivot to America.'' The question \nis: Will we as Members listen to the people, or will we double down on \na watered-down policy that has divided both the Democratic and \nRepublican sides of the aisle?\n  We often complain about lack of bipartisanship, but in this case, we \nare seeing it stop the trade promotion authority, or TPA, fast track. \nWe must hold firm.\n  Republicans and Democrats have a long history of being for free \ntrade. We all want our goods to go to international markets and for \ntrade barriers to be removed. We find ourselves at a crossroads today \nbecause both parties have voiced a lack of trust in the President's \nability to be able to negotiate what is best for America. That is why \nwe are still fighting to stop the trade promotion authority, better \nknown as fast track.\n  Fast track will not be the panacea of all ills. In fact, if granted, \nwe could see the President move swiftly on the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership that will likely not deliver the goods, potentially binding \nour Nation to an agreement that could circumvent U.S. interests and law \nand have secondary harmful effects in multiple areas.\n  Dr. Aurolyn Luykx, an anthropology professor at the University of \nTexas at El Paso, makes this analysis:\n\n       I think the consequences could be very dire. We already saw \n     under NAFTA how so many jobs left the United States and also \n     went from Mexico. Then we saw, as well, tens of thousands of \n     low-income Mexican families being put out of work and losing\n\n[[Page H4380]]\n\n     their land, and we saw how that drove migration to the United \n     States.\n\n  The architects of the TPA in both Congress and the White House take \noffense at any opposition, leveling the charge that we are being \nprotectionists. The White House claims that with fast track they can \nmove the TPP to lower barriers on U.S. exports among the 11 other \nnations, thus increasing jobs and wages.\n  Now to the facts.\n  Contrary to what we hear, we already have high-standard free trade \nagreements with 7 of those other 11 nations in the proposed Trans-\nPacific Partnership. We are writing the rules in the Pacific. Let's \nwrite them some more, with good bilateral agreements that will allow \nthe American people to have a voice, not some council or transnational \ncommission that sets our fate.\n  If you don't believe me, then how about Simon Johnson, a former chief \neconomist of the International Monetary Fund, a professor at MIT Sloan, \na senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics? \nMaybe he knows something about it. Here is what he says about the myth \nof needing the TPA to lower tariffs among the proposed members of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership:\n\n       Almost all tariffs on trade among Canada, Mexico, and the \n     United States are long gone--that was the effect of the North \n     American Free Trade Agreement. Under the Australia and \n     Singapore free trade agreements as well, almost all tariffs \n     on U.S. goods sold in those countries have been eliminated. \n     Goods from the United States have entered Chile without \n     tariffs since January of this year, and most tariffs imposed \n     by Peru have already been phased out.\n       The TPP will amount to a free trade agreement with Brunei, \n     with a population less than Omaha, Nebraska, I might add, and \n     New Zealand, with a population less than Louisiana. \n     Encouraging exports to these countries is surely desirable, \n     but the economic impact on the U.S. is unlikely to be more \n     than a rounding error.\n       That leaves three larger countries where the issues are \n     more complex: Japan, Malaysia, and Vietnam. And TPP will also \n     confer special status on foreign investors, allowing them to \n     sue for financial judgments against host-country regulations.\n       Why we would want to provide such differential protection \n     to nondomestic companies is a mystery. Creating a quasi-legal \n     process outside the regular court system, just for \n     foreigners, can go wrong in many ways.\n\n  From my own reading of the TPP, without divulging the details, I \nwould add the concern about private rights in disputes, the \ntransnational panel empowered with a living agreement--and yes, it is \nthere; I have seen it with my own eyes--even after the accord is signed \nby member nations.\n  There are also the possible exceptions granted to Brunei, whose legal \nsystem is not to the same standard as the other nations.\n  Of great concern is a stated intention to economically integrate like \nthe EU--Not cooperate, but integrate.\n  So, one says: What solutions do you have? Here are a few.\n  First, we must start by listening to the American people. If the \nmajority of Americans--from socialists to progressives, to liberals, to \nmoderates, to conservatives, to constitutionalists, to the Tea \nParties--have voiced concerns and do not want TPA granted, then our \nactions this week will truly reflect if we are being representative of \nthat voice.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Second, the President must demonstrate he can lead on foreign policy. \nHe has yet to do it. Granting fast track to negotiate with 40 percent \nof the world's economy should be based on how well he has handled \nnegotiations with other nations in his tenure. It is here, in the \nforeign policy arena, he is found wanting.\n  The President's talent for negotiation among nations should be \nmeasured by his foreign policy record. Have we forgotten the line in \nthe sand, the arming of al Qaeda and other nefarious Syrian rebels to \nfight Assad, only to watch them morph into ISIS, then dismiss them as a \nJV team, only to see them tear through Iraq, which fell apart after we \nabandoned it, after we were assured they could stand on their own if we \nleft early, and now, no strategy to fix it?\n  Then, there is the Arab Spring, which has morphed into a potential \nfor nuclear winter with Iran. Let's not forget Crimea and Ukraine. I \ncan go on. The question is: Why are we?\n  As I have said before, like Lucy holding the football, we are told \nthat the President needs the power to negotiate; if we just come and \ntake a kick at it, all will be fine.\n  We cannot take such chances with our Nation; instead, the President \nmust show us some deeds, not words. He should start by negotiating a \nbilateral free trade agreement with Japan, an ally, the biggest nation \nof those that remain and the one that has the greatest economic impact. \nIntently focus there, bring that to us, and we will likely approve it.\n  Third, negotiate an interim agreement with China. We still have much \nto do with raising the bar on Chinese trade due to corruption, piracy \nof intellectual property, standards of goods, and other concerns. We \nmade those same claims with Japan in the 1960s and with South Korea in \nthe 1980s. Today, we no longer have those concerns.\n  China lacks lawyers to fight against these problems. Well, we \ncertainly know how to make plenty of those. Negotiate a law school \nprogram all across our land's rich institutions to create Chinese \nattorneys to enforce the economic benefits of the rule of law.\n  As to goods, China is seeking oil, natural gas, coal, timber, \naggregate, beef, and pork to expand their infrastructure and to feed \ntheir people. We have an abundance of these and hard-working Americans \nthat will gladly produce and send these goods.\n  Instead of making China turn to terrorist states like Sudan and \ntroublemakers like Venezuela to pursue these resources, how about a \ntrade agreement on these narrow products that will immediately benefit \nthe American people, reduce our debt with China, and strengthen our \nfriendly ties?\n  It is not impossible. We have the resources. We have the technology. \nWhat we need are the guts to do it, a rekindling of the American \nspirit, and the leadership to get it done. It starts by putting the \nbrakes on fast track. We need the right track instead.\n  I urge my colleagues, left and right, to stand your ground. It is \ntime for Congress to lead and be the clarion voice of the American \npeople that we represent. That leadership starts this week in the \nUnited States House of Representatives.\n  Let's hold our ground. Let's pivot back to the American people, \ninvest in ourselves, and benefit not just the Pacific, but the entire \nworld, as we have clearly demonstrated we can do in the last 100 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4380-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Rodney Davis of Illinois (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for \ntoday on account of a flight delay.\n  Mr. Kelly of Mississippi (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today \nthrough June 26 on account of mandatory military service with the \nMississippi Army National Guard.\n  Mr. Poe of Texas (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on \naccount of personal reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "15"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/15/house-section/article/H4380-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4380]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker pro tempore, Mr. Thornberry, announced his signature to \nan enrolled bill of the Senate of the following title:\n\n       S. 1568.
