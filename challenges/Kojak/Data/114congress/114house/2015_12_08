The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, late last month President \nBarack Obama signed into law the National Defense Authorization Act of \n2015, otherwise known as the NDAA.\n  Included in the legislation was language directing the United States \nDepartment of Defense to study a mental health assessment for all \nincoming military recruits. This assessment would then be used as a \nbaseline throughout the service careers of our servicemen and -women.\n  This was included in the Medical Evaluation Parity for \nServicemembers, or MEPS, Act, which I introduced earlier this year. \nNow, I believe this assessment is essential in addressing the suicide \nepidemic which has affected our military members and veterans over the \npast several years.\n  Mr. Speaker, when it comes to suicide within the ranks of our \nAmerican heroes, commissioned studies have been implemented by the \nDepartment of Defense in the past.\n  We have found that, for over 60 percent of those individuals who \nattempt or commit suicide while serving in the military, it was not \ntheir first attempt. Their first attempt was before they joined the \nmilitary. This is about pre-existing conditions that have failed to \nhave been recognized.\n  Mr. Speaker, if you are like me and you assume that it is what people \nsee on the battlefield--I have been to Afghanistan. I have been to Iraq \nin the past. It is the horrors of war that drive people, largely, to \nsuicide.\n  But these studies, Mr. Speaker, have found that the large majority of \nthose individuals who attempt or commit suicide while in the military \nnever saw deployment. They were not in combat situations. Again, it \nspeaks to pre-existing conditions that have not been adequately \nidentified and addressed. This is a matter that really has been \nthoroughly examined in recent years.\n  So while I am happy that it is in the National Defense Authorization \nAct, I urge the Pentagon to act quickly to take steps to better assess \nthe mental health of our servicemen and -women at the time of \nenlistment with this commonsense, baseline evaluation.\n  These heroes deserve all the information that we can provide in order \nto make their lives a bit easier.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9027-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9027-H9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  CONGRATULATING THE PORTLAND, OREGON, TIMBERS ON THEIR MAJOR LEAGUE \n                           SOCCER CUP VICTORY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor this morning barely \nable to talk. But not having much of a voice is common in Portland, \nOregon, these days, as fans shouted themselves hoarse after the \nPortland Timbers' stunning victory over the Columbus Crew on Sunday, \nwinning the Major League Soccer Cup.\n  There is no doubt that my hometown of Portland, Oregon, is Soccer \nCity, USA. Fans continue to prove the point with a huge celebration \ntoday.\n  I want to congratulate the Timbers for an amazing season and for \nbeing such a huge part, indeed, of Portland, and all of Oregon.\n  This season had it all: injuries and bumps along the way that made \nSunday's result seem highly unlikely. But under the leadership and \ndirection of Coach Caleb Porter, the Timbers stayed focused and made \ncourse corrections that led them to a national championship, finishing \nwith a flourish.\n  This team has so many heroes that it is impossible, in the time I \nhave, to give them their due recognition. But I want to give special \nmention to new U.S. citizen Darlington Nagbee; Diego Chara; Rodney \nWallace; Jake Gleason; and the old, salty dog, Jack Jewsbury, all of \nwhom have been with the Timbers since our inaugural season.\n  I also want to highlight the Maestro, Diego Valeri; defenders Liam \nRidgewell and Nat Borchers, he of the beard; as well as goalkeeper Adam \nKwarasay for their heroic efforts this season.\n  Merritt Paulson and his management team deserve recognition for their \npassion for the support and their love for our city.\n\n[[Page H9028]]\n\n  Of course, you can't mention the Portland Timbers without talking \nabout, as the song goes, the greatest football supporters the world has \never seen, the Timbers Army. Your dedication to team, town, and country \nis an inspiration and very much in evidence in Columbus this weekend.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me conclude by reminding all of America and several \nplaces in Canada that, in case you didn't get the hint with Timber Joey \nand his chain saw, there is no pity in the Rose City.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9028-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9028]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            DONALD TRUMP MUST END HIS PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDACY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). The Chair \nrecognizes the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to call on Donald Trump to \nwithdraw his candidacy for the White House. We face a security test in \nthis Nation, a national security test. It is a real and audible threat.\n  I have been most critical of the President's foreign policy. It is an \narea that, respectfully, I have the greatest disagreement with this \nadministration. I have begged him in correspondence, and I have used \nthe word ``beg'' to do more to defeat the threat of terror.\n  I believe his Oval Office address Sunday night, frankly, was \nforgettable. He spent 5 minutes suggesting he was going to do nothing \ndifferent to defeat ISIS. He spent 5 minutes lecturing Congress, and he \nspent 5 minutes lecturing the American people.\n  You see, we do face a security test that I believe the President's \npolicies have underestimated. But we also face a test of our commitment \nto religious freedom, one of the basic freedoms upon which our Nation \nwas founded. We are either going to defend that religious freedom or we \nare not.\n  It should be heartbreaking to every American that we have a \nfrontrunner in the Presidential race that suggests there will be a \nreligious test for anybody who wishes to come to our shores. It is an \naffront to the very principles upon which our Nation was founded.\n  We broke from a monarch that suggested all freedom and liberty was \nvested in the Crown and then the Crown would distribute freedom and \nliberty to the people. We founded a Nation based on what Jefferson \ncalled the natural rights of man, that we were, indeed, endowed by our \nCreator with very fundamental rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a born-again Christian. I believe in the saving \ngrace of the Jesus Christ that I call my God. The beautiful thing about \nthis country is I can stand here on the House floor, among my peers and \nin front of the Nation, and declare that faith without fear of any \nreprisal.\n  But if Donald Trump has his way, we may not have the liberty to do \nthat anymore. It is a freedom that has been fought for, from the \nFounders of our country, and generation upon generation of men and \nwomen who have worn the uniform of the Armed Forces and defended it, \nfor the security of our Nation, and for the freedom of people.\n  We are a Nation worried about our security, rightfully so. It is why \nwe are calling on the President to do so much more to defeat this \nterror. It is why we are begging the President for a stronger national \nsecurity test.\n  We must always insist on a security test, but we must never require a \nreligious test.\n  It is time that my side of the aisle has one less candidate in the \nrace for the White House. It is time for Donald Trump to withdraw from \nthe race.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9028-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9028-H9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CONFIDENTIAL INFORMANTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to congratulate \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly) on his statement. I thought that \nshowed some courage. It reflects the values of a lot of people here in \nthis House and in the United States of America. It needed to be said.\n  Mr. Speaker, some of us on both sides of the aisle have been working \nhard to reform our marijuana laws to allow more State flexibility in \nhow marijuana is regulated and treated commercially and medically.\n  What binds us together across a broad ideological spectrum is our \nstrong belief that we must be able to distinguish between marijuana and \nseriously dangerous and lethal drugs: meth, heroin, crack, cocaine, and \nprescription drugs as well.\n  People don't rob corner groceries and liquor stores to get money to \nsupply their habit of marijuana. They do that for meth, crack, cocaine, \nheroin. It is a different, different drug.\n  The movement that is occurring here in this Congress and around our \ncountry is ongoing and growing rapidly, thanks to open minds, common \nsense, and some people having the courage to stand up for things they \nknow are true because they, themselves, their friends, their family, \nand others have smoked marijuana, and they have seen that it is not a \ngreat problem.\n  Sunday night, I and millions of Americans watched a disturbing ``60 \nMinutes'' piece on the issue of confidential informants. Lesley Stahl \nwas the host. It focused on how local law enforcement appears to be \nincreasingly using young people as informants without regard to their \nrights or their safety.\n  It is being done without distinguishing between marijuana and the \ndangerous drugs that affect our society and our safety: heroin, meth, \ncrack, cocaine, opiates.\n  Here is how it works. A young person is cited for violating drug \nlaws, usually possessing a small amount of marijuana and perhaps having \nsold some to a friend, which happens regularly in high school and \ncollege--not that high school kids should be doing it, but it is a \nfact, and so are college kids. The police tell them that, unless they \nagree to wear a wire and implicate a number of their friends, often \nclose friends, they could be sentenced to a long prison term, the \nmaximum permitted by law.\n  They are cornered, frightened. Any person in that situation would \ntake that deal. Most of them do it under supreme duress, and they do it \nwithout the presence of a lawyer or the knowledge that they have a \nright to a lawyer.\n  Most of them seem to do it without even telling their parents because \nthe police tell them: Don't tell anybody. This is just between you and \nme. You need to do this or you are going to prison for a long time.\n  In the case of Rachel Hoffman and Andrew Sadek, it cost them their \nlives. Rachel had dealt a small amount of marijuana. They got her into \ndealing with people that dealt heavy drugs and guns and got her to try \nto make a big purchase. They didn't do a very good job of covering her. \nRachel was murdered.\n  Mr. Sadek was murdered, also, as a confidential informant, without \npolice protecting him.\n  The underpinnings for this counterproductive and dangerous behavior \nby some of our police are the very drug laws that many of us are trying \nto reform. This is wrong. I hope my colleagues will work with me to \nhelp stop it.\n  President Eisenhower warned us about the military industrial complex \nand its effect on our country and our budgets.\n  We need to be warned about the law enforcement-marijuana industrial \ncomplex, which is driven by monies that they get from busts and \nperverts justice and ruins people's lives and takes away their college \nscholarships, their opportunity to have housing, on occasion, and their \nopportunities to get jobs and, indeed, their liberty.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  In the meantime, it is time for the Department of Justice to take a \nclose look at how this behavior not only threatens to ruin young lives \nbut, in some cases, to end those lives.\n  As the Department of Justice, in the aftermath of all too many \ninstances of police overreach and overreaction, works with local \ncommunities to educate law enforcement on more just and humane \npractices, the issue of forcing young people to be confidential \ninformants should be added to its list.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will be working on legislation. I hope we have people \nto join us. This is just part of the scourge that has come across this \nNation, ruining people's lives because of the misunderstanding of \nmarijuana starting in the 1930s with Harry Anslinger and continuing in \nthe 1970s with Richard\n\n[[Page H9029]]\n\nNixon, who used it as a political tool. It needs to stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9029-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9029]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       PHARMACY BENEFIT MANAGERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jolly). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I come here today, as I have on \nmany other occasions, to discuss an issue that is close to my heart, \nbut it is also close to every small community and every large community \nacross the country, and that is the plight of our community \npharmacists. Community pharmacists are struggling to survive each and \nevery day in light of the anticompetitive behavior of pharmacy benefit \nmanagers, PBMs.\n  Let me state up front: I have no problem with a company doing \nbusiness. I have no problem with them playing in the bounds of what is \nfair and what is legal, and PBMs have a role in the marketplace. \nHowever, what we found out just in the last few weeks in the Judiciary \nCommittee in a hearing is there is still a lack of regulation, \nenforcement, and transparency, and it is threatening the very existence \nof our community pharmacists in which the PBMs are acting not as \ncompetitors but, many times, as bullies.\n  To make matters even worse--and this is what was amazing to me--\ncommunity pharmacists cannot even speak out about the appalling \npractices of the PBMs that they are forced to do business with because, \nwhen they do, the repercussions are swift and severe. It has been \namazing to me to talk all across the country to community pharmacists \nwho simply want to talk about what is going on in their business model \nin which they are put at a distinct disadvantage, and yet there are \nmany of them saying: I can't say anything publicly because I know I \nwill be reprimanded or my contract will be changed or my contract will \nbe withdrawn, and I will be out of business.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is just wrong. No matter what is said, we have seen \nfirsthand that in relation to State laws that have been in response to \nthis issue, the States have enacted transparency reform with generic \ndrug prices and reimbursement systems called the MAC transparency laws.\n  In fact, to date, 24 States have enacted such laws. The goals of \nthese laws is to increase transparency and provide structure around the \ngeneric drug pricing and reimbursement system. But when community \npharmacists speak out in support of these reasonable reforms, the PBM \ncommunity has retaliated through business lawsuits against the State \nand even discussing it in the contracts with community pharmacists \nsaying: Well, it would be better if we get these laws repealed.\n  There is just a problem here. When you have the ability to force your \ncompetitors to be audited by you and to be controlled by you to where \nthere is no transparency, where there are issues of community \npharmacists simply barely able to survive, the PBMs are not \nrepresenting the best interests of consumers; the PBMs are representing \nthemselves. If they were truly acting in the best interest of \nconsumers, as they claim, they would not oppose virtually every single \ntransparency reform effort on the State and the Federal level. In fact, \nit is really interesting. They come to Congress and say one thing to \nMembers, and then they turn around and behave however they wish in the \npharmacy marketplace without fear of enforcement or oversight.\n  As I said from this floor a few weeks ago, I will continue this fight \nbecause they can't audit me. They can audit my community pharmacists, \nand my community pharmacists are scared because they know their very \nlivelihood is being put out by those who would come with shiny objects \nand savings that many times never materialize, but at the same time \nfunneling money to their own businesses.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to change, and it is time to change it now. \nWe must preserve pharmacy access for patients, especially those in \nrural areas like north Georgia, and we must put an end to the bullying \nthat seems to be going on.\n  What is amazing is a PBM can make a mistake and say that a pharmacy \nwas not part of the new network, and when called on that, saying that \nwe are part of that new network, they say: Well, we will send out a \nretraction when we get around to it. Pharmacists lose business based on \nthese kinds of letters, and, yet the PBMs say: Oh, well, we will get \naround to it when we can.\n  That is why I am proposing H.R. 244, because community pharmacists \nroutinely incur losses of approximately $100 or more on prescriptions \nbecause PBMs reimburse pharmacies well below their cost to acquire and \ndispense generic prescription drugs, and they have skyrocketed in \nprice. The PBMs may wait weeks or months to update the reimbursement \nbenchmarks they use to compensate pharmacies while drug prices increase \nvirtually overnight. This situation jeopardizes pharmacists' ability to \ncontinue to serve patients because it leaves community pharmacists with \nunsustainable losses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would urge you and other colleagues to cosponsor H.R. \n244. This reasonable legislation would require PBMs to update their \nmaximum allowable cost benchmark every 7 days to better reflect market \ncosts and allow pharmacists to know the source by which PBMs set \nreimbursements for their community pharmacist.\n  Many times we come to the floor fighting for businesses both large \nand small. But this is a time in which we are coming and I am coming to \nthe floor fighting for community pharmacists who many times are the \nmain source of health care in a community. They are the ones that are \ntrusted. They are the ones that are needed. And it is time for this \nbody to stand up for them, against the anticompetitive tactics of PBMs \nand the bullying behavior that has got to stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9029-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9029-H9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       OUR CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, in a conversation that I had recently, \nspeaking about the other body, it was mentioned that that body is the \ndeliberative body. There are opportunities for collaboration between \nMembers, Democrat and Republican. But I am in the people's House, and I \nbelieve that Members also have the duty and commitment to collaborate \nand to be deliberative and thoughtful.\n  This morning, I would like to offer just a number of points about our \nwonderful Constitution.\n  I first want to begin by saying this is Restore the Vote Tuesday, and \nI am wearing a pin that highlights the importance of voting and the \nresponsibilities of our civic constituency. My colleague from Alabama \n(Ms. Sewell) is on the floor, and I join her in recognizing how special \nthis right is and to know that many of us--I attempted to register \nsharecroppers in South Carolina, North Carolina, and Georgia in my \ncollege days, people who were still frightened about voting. I saw what \nthe 1965 Voting Rights Act did, and we need to restore it.\n  We have an election coming up in Houston on Saturday, and I want to \nsay to my constituents that we will do all that we can to prevent any \nprohibitive barriers from voting, from your voting.\n  That is a right, Mr. Speaker, just as it is the right to have the \nright to freedom of expression, freedom of speech, and freedom of \nreligion.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of our Presidential candidates took to the airwaves \nin the last 24 hours to pronounce or announce or demagogue, saying that \nno Muslims should be allowed in this country. Mr. Speaker, I believe \nthat we, as Members of Congress, should be empathetic and sympathetic \nto the concern of the American people. Maybe some are frightened. I do \nnot make light of that.\n  I have been on the Homeland Security Committee since 9/11, and I now \nserve as the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, \nand Investigations Subcommittee. I take these obligations very \nseriously. For any of us who have been to Ground Zero even at that time \nand since that time, it is seared in our minds.\n  I know the people in San Bernardino, those of us reflecting on Paris, \nbut now our own brothers and sisters realize that government must act \nin a way for Americans to feel safe and secure. But I would say that \nhaving met and stood with the Muslim community in my district on \nSunday, late in the afternoon,\n\n[[Page H9030]]\n\nwe stood in front of the Mickey Leland Federal building with Christians \nalike. Arm in arm we prayed. But I just stood back and listened to one \nMuslim representative after another come and proclaim their patriotism \nand denouncing the violence and distortion of their faith.\n  A young imam who had just moved from New Jersey just moved me. He \nbegan to articulate the elements of the Koran: benevolence and love. As \na 25-year-old, he stood up to denounce this violence. That is the kind \nof American partnership that we need.\n  When we concluded that meeting, we had a press conference and vigil. \nWe said that we would form a task force. I encourage Members throughout \nthis body to have task forces on this very issue: How can we help?\n  Then as the President spoke--I want to thank him, for maybe people \nwere not listening--the President was very clear that he is going to \ntake the hunt and hunt down terrorist plotters to any country where \nthey are. The President also indicated he will continue to provide \ntraining and equipment to Iraqi and Syrian forces and work with friends \nand allies to stop ISIL's operations; and with American leadership, the \ninternational community has begun to establish a process and timeline \nto pursue cease-fires and a political resolution to the Syrian war. Our \nPresident is focused. The Congress needs to be focused.\n  Yes, we need to be able to put forward legislative ideas, not \ncontentious. No terrorist should have the ability to get a gun. \nTherefore, we should pass this bill that indicates that any terrorist \non the terrorist watch list should not be able to buy a gun in the \nUnited States of America. I have legislation in the Judiciary Committee \nthat we are preparing to come to the floor: no-fly for foreign \nterrorists, stopping them in their tracks, from wherever they come \nfrom, from getting on any plane coming to the United States of America. \nThat is not hostility. That is saying to the American people we care. \nAs they say in the community: We have got your back.\n  Then we must go back to the alert system, Mr. Speaker. We did it \nafter \n9/11. We understand the Secretary is offering that thought, the red \nalert. It is interesting that I thought about that, to give the \nAmerican people some sense.\n  But let me finish, Mr. Speaker, by simply saying that I love this \ncountry. What a wonderful set of principles in the Constitution. And I \nwant to say to the American people that, with our God, with our faith \nvested in a higher power, and the knowledge of democracy, we are going \nto withstand, survive, fight, and have a better nation. I know that \nthat is the better way, not demagoguery and condemnation of a faith. I \nwould never do that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9030-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9030]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             MASS SHOOTINGS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, last week's shooting in San Bernardino, \nCalifornia, happened to be the second shooting of the day and the 355th \nof the year, equating to more mass shootings than days in the year. The \nsocial media pages of some of the most influential leaders in Congress \nexpressed sympathy, thoughts, and prayers to the victims and their \nfamilies. But what many failed to express was a commitment to act on \nthis issue to make mass shootings and horrendous gun violence a far \nless common instance in America.\n  While no grand solution exists to end all gun violence, we know from \nthe experience of other countries that a combination of small but \npractical policy solutions can severely reduce it. But Congress \ncontinues to choose inaction.\n  Last week, immediately following the devastating news coming out of \nParis and San Bernardino, a majority of Members blocked the House from \neven debating bipartisan legislation to close the outrageous loophole \nthat allows suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list to buy guns. It \nmay be hard for some to believe, but in the U.S., individuals on the \nFederal terrorist watch list are shockingly still not prohibited from \npurchasing firearms.\n  Quite simply, Mr. Speaker, this means you can be on the terrorist \nwatch list, considered by the Federal Government to be a potential risk \nto the national security of the United States and be prohibited from \nboarding a plane, but still have the ability to walk into any Walmart \naround the country and purchase a semiautomatic weapon.\n  Current Federal law prohibits nine categories of dangerous people \nfrom purchasing or owning firearms; suspected terrorists on FBI watch \nlists, however, are not one of them. I don't have to explain to Members \nof the House the growing terrorist threat that this country is facing \nfrom lone-wolf extremists which are often unpredictable and incredibly \ndifficult to thwart. Even just one unsophisticated lone-wolf extremist \nwith a gun can do a remarkable amount of damage.\n  This isn't some sort of theoretical threat either. A GAO \ninvestigation found that individuals on terrorist watch lists \nsuccessfully purchased guns 1,321 times between February 2004 and \nDecember 2010. And that was before the rise of ISIS and their \npersistent social media campaign to recruit homegrown terrorists.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have worked with Congresswoman Lowey in the \nAppropriations Committee on a commonsense amendment to allow the \nAttorney General to deny firearms sales to individuals known or \nsuspected to be involved in terrorism. Unfortunately, our attempts to \npass this amendment in committee have been rebuffed every time. But \nthis week, we have an opportunity to change that. This week, we can \nshow our enemies, intent on destroying Americans and our way of life, \nthat Congress cares more about protecting the safety of its citizens \nthan it does about the gun lobby by finally closing this terror gap in \nour gun laws.\n  The American people, gun owning and not, overwhelmingly support \nresponsible, commonsense gun reforms. If this isn't the definition of \nresponsible and commonsense reform, I don't know what is. There is also \nwidespread support specifically among gun owners for closing the gap. \nIn 2013, a survey found that 80 percent of non-NRA gun owners support \nprohibiting people on the terrorist watch list from obtaining guns. Mr. \nSpeaker, 71 percent of NRA gun owners support prohibiting people on \nthis watch list from obtaining guns.\n  It is naive to think that al Qaeda and ISIS are not paying attention \nto what is happening here in Congress. Fixing this loophole is simple, \nresponsible, and the right thing to do for public safety. Let's not \npass on this critical opportunity to close a dangerous loophole that \nthreatens our national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9030-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9030-H9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n                             HOMEOWNERSHIP\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Loretta Sanchez) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nhighlight an issue that is incredibly important. It is probably the \nnumber one issue going on in my district today. And that is the whole \nissue of housing: housing, and the opportunity to own your own home, to \nprovide a safe haven for your family, to build wealth.\n  You see, owning your own home for almost everybody in our country is \nthe first rung of the ladder of wealth creation. Yet today, that \ndream--and it is a dream for many of our citizens, particularly those \nin the Latino and minority communities--is just that, a dream. Latinos, \nlike all Americans, are committed to building a better and stronger \nfuture for their families and for their communities. It starts by \nbecoming a homeowner, to own a piece of America, to have a real stake \nin America.\n  That is one of the reasons homeownership is so important. It is \nimportant because it creates wealth--as I said, the first rung on the \nladder for people to have an investment. It creates social stability. \nIt creates a haven for the family, for family get-togethers. A home is \nreally one of the most important assets for a family to have. Owning a \nhome has far-reaching consequences in our economy for communities.\n  This fall, I had the opportunity to be a keynote speaker at a \nbipartisan leadership forum on achieving the American Dream, hosted by \nFirst American\n\n[[Page H9031]]\n\nFinancial Corporation, who is headquartered in my district. I was \njoined by many of my colleagues, including Representative Linda \nSanchez, Representative Emanuel Cleaver, former Governor Luis Fortuno, \nindustry leaders, and community activists.\n  The decision to become a homeowner is one of the most important \ndecisions, and it commits a person. It commits a family. It commits us \ntowards getting to the middle class. For people in the bottom 40 \npercent of annual income level, wealth creation is almost exclusively \nin homeownership.\n  According to the National Association of Home Builders, ``the primary \nresidence represents the largest asset category'' in our country, \naccounting for 30 percent of our Nation's total assets. The importance \nof homeownership is even greater for the middle class: 62 percent of \nthe median homeowner's assets and 42 percent of their total wealth lies \nin their home.\n  Not to mention that access to home equity, being able to pull out \nsome of that equity you have built up, provides families with financial \nstability when there are financial stresses going on in the family. It \nis an emergency fund in some cases, and it helps to start a business, \nit helps to fund college for our children. Homeownership is a key to \ncreating stable, economically successful households and to provide \nsecurity for existing and future generations.\n  Households with wealth are able to weather financial shocks and \nincrease upward economic mobility for themselves and for future \ngenerations. In fact, analysis provided by First American's Chief \nEconomist, Mark Fleming, highlighted homeownership trends based on \nhousehold formation rates among Latino and African American \nCommunities. The research identified the importance of homeownership-\nbased wealth formation as the key, the key to wealth creation for \nmiddle- and low-income Americans. Providing Americans with equal \nopportunity to pursue that homeownership is a challenge, and it is very \nchallenging in the Latino, African American, and other minority \ncommunities.\n  This last recession of 5 or 6 years--this really terrible, difficult \nrecession for so many people--saw in the Latino community two-thirds, \n66 percent, of the wealth across our Nation within the Latino community \nwent away.\n  I hope that my colleagues will help us in building back to \nhomeownership for all of our communities in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9031-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9031]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               60TH ANNIVERSARY OF MONTGOMERY BUS BOYCOTT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nAlabama (Ms. Sewell) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in recognition and \nacknowledgement of Restoration Tuesday and to recognize the 60th \nanniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott. There has been, Mr. Speaker, \na renewed and relentless assault on our sacred right to vote in the \naftermath of the Supreme Court's ruling in Shelby County v. Holder.\n  Since elections are held on Tuesdays, my colleagues in the Democratic \nHouse caucus and I have declared that every Tuesday that the House is \nin session shall be declared as Restoration Tuesday. So I stand before \nyou and this august body today in hopes of giving a voice to those who \nhave been excluded from our political process. My hope is that all the \nMembers, Members from both sides of the aisle, will join me and over \n140 Members of this august body in supporting the Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act.\n  This Voting Rights Advancement Act not only restores the Voting \nRights Act of 1965, but it advances it. It gives more protection to \nmore people in more States and is, indeed, what our Founding Fathers \nwould have wanted when they declared that our electoral process would \nbe fair.\n  I think that the events of last week--we celebrated the 60th \nanniversary of the Montgomery Bus Boycott in my district, in \nMontgomery, Alabama, last week. The Montgomery Bus Boycott--the 381 \ndays when people refused to sit and use the buses in Montgomery, \nbreaking desegregation of the bus systems in Montgomery--it stands \nforever as a powerful testimony of the will of disenfranchised people \nto work collectively to achieve extraordinary social change.\n  Sixty years ago, Mr. Speaker, Rosa Parks refused to give up her seat \non a segregated bus, and her bold stand against racial discrimination \nsparked a city-wide boycott. I was in Montgomery to commemorate that \noccasion, along with several Members of this House. I want to thank \nCongressman Butterfield and Congresswoman Corrine Brown for joining me \nlast week in that celebration, along with Congressman John Lewis, who \nforever stands as a beacon, a reminder of what it takes to show \nstrength in the face of discrimination.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say to all of my colleagues, what will we do to \nprogress this wonderful legacy of social change and democracy? So many \naverage, ordinary Americans have stood up for that proposition in the \nface of tremendous adversity.\n  So it is my hope that on this Restoration Tuesday, we will remember \ntheir legacy, the legacy of Americans who stand up for social change, \nand we will do what we know is right to restore the Voting Rights Act \nof 1965. We can do that today, Mr. Speaker, by joining with all of the \n140 or so Members of Congress who have already signed on to the Voting \nRights Advancement Act; by remembering that on Tuesdays across this \ncountry, people go to vote, and they should do so without barriers, \nknowing that their polling stations will not be changed, knowing that \nif they are disabled, they will still be able to get into the ballot \nbox in order to vote. It is so important that we all recognize that \nmodern day barriers still exists to voting, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mere words are not enough to restore the vote to millions of \nAmericans who have wrongly been shut out of the Democratic process. The \nvoice of those excluded cannot be unheard. The Voting Rights \nAdvancement Act that I introduced alongside Representatives Judy Chu \nand Linda Sanchez contains a modern-day formula that will determine \njurisdictions which should have Federal protections, Federal pre-\nclearance requirements.\n  I stand here before you to call on Congress to pass this bill to \nrestore the Voting Rights Act of 1965. We cannot return to the days \nwhere only some votes matter. Indeed, Mr. Speaker, all voices, all \nvotes matter. Our vote is our voice, and our voices must be heard.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9031-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9031-H9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 DENY GUN SALES TO SUSPECTED TERRORISTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Mrs. Lowey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. LOWEY. Mr. Speaker, Federal law prohibits nine categories of \ndangerous individuals from purchasing a firearm. This includes \nconvicted felons, domestic abusers, and the seriously mentally ill. \nYet, while we prevent those on the terrorist watch list from boarding \nplanes, they are welcome in gun stores.\n  The Government Accountability Office found that between 2004 and \n2014, individuals on terrorist watch lists tried to purchase guns or \nexplosives 2,233 times. Of those attempts, 2,043, an astounding 91 \npercent, were approved.\n  Terrorists are knowingly exploiting this gap. In fact, in 2011, Adam \nGadahn, an American-born member of al Qaeda, issued a video urging \nviolent followers to exploit weaknesses in U.S. gun laws.\n  Adam Gadahn was not alone. In 2009, Daniel Patrick Boyd was arrested \nand charged with conspiring to murder U.S. military personnel at the \nMarine Corps base in Quantico, Virginia. Boyd, who was under \ninvestigation by the FBI Joint Terrorism Task Force, had amassed an \narsenal of assault rifles and had even traveled to the Middle East to \nmeet with militants to plan future attacks.\n  It is impossible to hear these facts and not think of the recent \nhorrific attacks in Paris. France has extremely strict gun laws, so it \nis likely that the terrorists in question turned to black market \nsources for the weapons they used. But here in the United States, \nsuspects on the terrorist watch list can legally purchase firearms. It \nsimply doesn't make any sense at all.\n  That is why I am a proud cosponsor of H.R. 1076, the Denying Firearms \nand Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act. This bill, along with an \namendment that I have introduced in the Appropriations Committee, would \ngive\n\n[[Page H9032]]\n\nthe U.S. Attorney General the authority to block suspects on the \nterrorist watch list from purchasing firearms.\n  Given the repeated mass shootings in the United States and the \nongoing threat of terrorism, it is hard to believe that four times, \nRepublicans on the Appropriations Committee have said no to closing \nthis dangerous loophole.\n  In 2011, I introduced my amendment. It was rejected. In 2013, I tried \nagain. It was rejected. Again, in 2014, rejected. Even this year, in \n2015, with the tremendous threats we face as a Nation, my amendment was \nrejected for the fourth time.\n  Even NRA members agree we should pass this commonsense measure. A \n2012 poll found that 76 percent of gun owners, including 71 percent of \nNRA members, support prohibiting people on terrorist watch lists from \npurchasing guns. Yet, the NRA's stranglehold on the majority in \nCongress has prevented my amendment from passing and the bipartisan \nstand-alone bill from even being considered.\n  The time has long since come for us to cross the aisle and work \ntogether to make our country safer. Let's close this glaring loophole \nimmediately and arm our law enforcement with the ability to deny gun \nsales to suspected terrorists.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9032-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9032]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Half our Navy was destroyed, and our \nallies in Europe were on the verge of collapse. It was a terrifying and \nuncertain time to be in the world.\n  The world feels particularly dark these days, too. Things feel more \nuncertain.

Miller's Vets also \ncreated a military honors funeral program comprised of 14 local \nveterans who have been trained to perform honor guard duty at funerals. \nThis program partners with local funeral homes to provide full military \nservice funerals to certain veterans without family or adequate \nfinances to pay for their expenses.\n  Simply put, Mr. Speaker, Miller's Vets restores the honor that these \nmen and women deserve. I am grateful to Miller's Vets for their \ndedication to providing dignity and hope to our bravest and finest.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring Miller's Vets for their \ntireless dedication to helping and honoring our local veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9033-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CLOSING THE TERRORIST GUN LOOPHOLE\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to express my deep concern for \nthe safety of our country and urge colleagues to act today on sensible \ngun safety legislation. Time after time, House Republicans have denied \nany discussion of voting on a measure that will close a dangerous \nloophole that currently allows suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch \nlist to buy guns. Last week alone, House Republicans voted not one \ntime, not two, but three times to block debate on the Denying Firearms \nand Explosives to Terrorists Act.\n  According to a report by the Government Accountability Office, since \n2004, more than 2,000 suspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list have \nsuccessfully purchased weapons in the United States. More than 90 \npercent of all suspected terrorists who attempted to buy a gun walked \naway with the weapon of their choice.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is just common sense: if you are too dangerous \nto fly, then you are too dangerous to buy a gun. We must do all that we \ncan to prevent senseless acts of violence in our communities and bring \nthis legislation to a vote today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9033-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9033]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RECOGNIZING ONE OF MINNESOTA'S FINEST FAMILIES\n\n  (Mr. EMMER of Minnesota asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \n74th anniversary of Pearl Harbor and to honor all Minnesotans and all \nAmericans who served in World War II. I would like to recognize the \nservice of one Minnesota family in particular.\n  In 1885, Carl Nolte moved to Martin County, Minnesota, with his wife, \nLouise. They had 12 children and numerous grandchildren. An impressive \n36 members of the Nolte family joined the Armed Forces and served in \nWorld War II. Fortunately, all 36 family members survived the war. \nHowever, two were wounded during their service.\n  It is often said that those who served in World War II belong to the \nGreatest Generation. I believe that the heroism and the dedication that \nthis family demonstrated proves this to be true.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank this Minnesota family for their \nservice to our Nation, and I would also like to wish one of them a very \nhappy birthday. This week Loren Wessel of Truman, Minnesota, turns 96 \nyears old.

We had a little bit of intervention \nhere. And while there is a chance, Madam Speaker, that this poster was \nfabricated, I assure you that the win that Catholic High had over \nArchbishop Rummel was very, very real, and the values that each of \nthese schools instill upon their students is also very real.\n  I want to congratulate Coach Dale Weiner, Catholic High School Bears \nout of Baton Rouge, and Coach Weiner's over 300 wins in high school \nfootball.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9034-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9034]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                     RENEW THE ASSAULT WEAPONS BAN\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Madam Speaker, just hours before last week's shooting, \nI stood in this very same spot and called on Congress to renew the \nassault weapons ban, which expired in 2004.\n  Shortly after the shooting in San Bernadino, we learned that one of \nthe weapons used was an AR-15, capable of unloading 800 rounds per \nminute or 13 rounds per second. Just a week earlier, a gunman in \nColorado Springs used an AK-47-style weapon.\n  We need to get these weapons of war out of the hands of terrorists \nand criminals. It is easy to say criminals and terrorists will always \nfind a way to get a gun, but certainly we don't need to make it easier \nfor these individuals to get guns capable of killing dozens of innocent \npeople within seconds.\n  There are simple steps we can take today to address this issue \nwithout denying a person's Second Amendment rights. We can start by \nmaking sure someone convicted of a violent crime can't buy a gun by \nexploiting a loophole and prevent someone on the terrorist watch list \nfrom buying a gun. If you are too dangerous to get on a plane, you are \ntoo dangerous to walk into a gun store and buy an assault weapon or any \nother gun.\n  We need to start somewhere to address this epidemic if we have any \nhope of reducing gun violence in this country.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in recognition of \nnational Computer Science Education Week. Established in 2009 to \ncoincide with the birthday of one of the first women in the field of \ncomputer science, Grace Murray Hopper, Computer Science Education Week \nprovides a unique opportunity to connect students with opportunities in \nthe computing fields. The Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts that in \nthe year 2020, there will be roughly 10 million jobs in STEM fields.

Not one of \nthem has ever appeared on a terrorist watch list or been accused of \nterrorism. Yet, Republicans say that for homeland security, we should \nkeep these refugees from Syria out of our country.\n  About 40,000 people in the United States of America are on the \nterrorist watch list right now and they are not allowed to get on an \nairplane. But they are allowed to go into any gun store and buy any \nweapon that they would like, a weapon that looks like this, for \nexample. This is a picture of a Smith & Wesson .223-caliber assault \nrifle. This is the kind of weapon that the suspects fired in San \nBernardino.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to address the very real and \ndangerous threat posed by the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria.\n  For too long, our Nation has stayed on the sidelines, claiming ISIS \nwas a junior varsity threat or that it had been contained. The \nunfortunate reality is that America and her allies are under attack by \nradical Islamic terrorists. Changing the subject or downplaying this \nthreat gives aid and comfort to our enemy, which is bound and \ndetermined to strike innocent people around the world in their comfort \nzones.\n  As we have seen in Paris or in San Bernardino, these terrorists are \nemboldened by the President's failed foreign policy. Weakness invites \naggression, and only through strength will we have peace.\n  This is a time for unity of purpose and strong leadership. We need \nour Commander in Chief to chart a course towards complete destruction \nof ISIS. Congress should quickly debate and authorize the resources \nnecessary and military force to complete the mission.\n  Mr. Speaker, we stand ready and willing to work with the President, \nbut Congress will always put the safety and security of the American \npeople first.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9035-5", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9035]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          VISA WAIVER PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. MOULTON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 158, a bill \nthat would improve the Visa Waiver Program and ensure better \ninformation sharing among intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n  This is separate from the Republican proposal introduced last week \nthat would have effectively halted refugee resettlement. Refugees \nalready undergo the most stringent screening process of any individual \nentering the United States, with an extensive series of background \nchecks.\n  Refugees are victims, not perpetrators of terrorism. Categorically \nrefusing to take them only feeds the narrative of ISIS.\n  In contrast, H.R. 158 strengthens the screening of travelers who \nqualify for the Visa Waiver Program by increasing intelligence and law \nenforcement cooperation and by making it harder for extremists to \nfalsify their identities and enter our borders.\n  Rather than betraying our timeless American values by scapegoating \nrefugees, which only plays into ISIS' hands, we should focus on \naddressing real vulnerabilities to our homeland security.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. 158.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9035-6", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9035-H9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1230\nSUPPORTING THE DENYING FIREARMS AND EXPLOSIVES TO DANGEROUS TERRORISTS \n                                  ACT\n\n  (Mrs. CAPPS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, just last week, another community joined the\n\n[[Page H9036]]\n\ngrowing list of those forever scarred by gun violence just as my \ncommunity of Isla Vista was. It is far past time for Congress to \nrecognize that it has the power to act, and we must.\n  At a minimum, we should pass H.R. 1076, the Denying Firearms and \nExplosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act. This bipartisan bill would \nclose the loophole that allows terror suspects on the FBI's terror \nwatch list to legally purchase a gun. In fact, in the last 11 years, \nmore than 90 percent of all terror suspects who attempted to purchase a \ngun walked away with the weapon they wanted.\n  It is wrong to think we can do nothing to stop the violence. It is \nfactually wrong. It is morally wrong. This bill is an important step in \nkeeping the American people safe. We should all support it. It is the \nleast we can do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9036-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 TERRORIST WATCH LIST AND GUN PURCHASES\n\n  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, the horrific attack in San \nBernardino shows us just how much damage can be done when terrorists \nhave access to firearms; and while we discuss sensible policies that \nmay have prevented this tragedy, I hope we can all agree--certainly, at \nthe very least--that people our government suspects of having terrorist \nties should not be allowed to walk into a store, pass a background \ncheck, and walk out with a gun.\n  So many Americans have been understandably amazed to hear that people \non the FBI's terrorist watch list can legally purchase firearms and \nthat it has happened over 2,000 times in the last 10 years.\n  I know that some have concerns about the accuracy of the watch list \nor worry that this bill may somehow prevent some law enforcement \nofficers from obtaining guns. We should ensure that the watch list is \nas accurate as possible, and we can even start that today. But if we \nare concerned for our law enforcement officers, the least we can do is \nprotect them from the threat of terrorists who are armed with guns.\n  Fixing this loophole is immediate. It is a step we can take to make \nour country safer. It is a commonsense reform that deserves a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9036-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. FARR asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about violence. \nRepublicans may try, but you cannot separate our debate today on \nwomen's health clinic violence from our country's gun violence problem.\n  Since 1993, 11 individuals have lost their lives while seeking or \nproviding health care at women's health care facilities, and 10 of the \n11 were victims of gun violence. Since January of this year, the House \nhas voted 10 times to restrict women's health services. That is one \nvote for every person who died from gun violence at a women's health \ncare clinic; yet there have been zero votes on gun control.\n  Stop this war on women's health and reproductive care, and start a \nsane regulatory process on guns.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9036-3", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9036]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TERRORIST GUN LOOPHOLE\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, it has been said before and it needs to be \nsaid again: It is time to get serious about gun violence in America.\n  Every day, 88 people die because of gun violence. It happens in \nschools, at work, in our movie theaters, and even in our churches. \nMaking matters worse, in the wake of recent attacks in Paris and here \non our own soil, we still have an age-old loophole that allows \nterrorists to legally get their hands on guns. More than 2,000 suspects \non the FBI's terrorist watch list have purchased guns over the last \ndecade.\n  My colleagues, we have an obligation to protect our communities by \nkeeping guns out of the wrong hands. There are many changes that need \nto be made, but let's start by closing the gun-buying loophole for \nterrorists. We have a bipartisan solution in Representative Peter \nKing's and Representative Mike Thompson's bill to close the loophole.\n  How many lives must we lose? Let's take a step in the right \ndirection, and let's make sure terrorists can't slip through the cracks \nand purchase guns.

I also appreciate Chairmen Goodlatte and \nShuster for their cooperation.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your cooperation \n     in allowing the bill to move expeditiously under suspension \n     of the House Rules on December 8, 2015. Because your \n     assertion of jurisdictional interest was raised after the \n     report for H.R. 3842 was filed, the Parliamentarians were not \n     able render an official decision as to any jurisdictional \n     claim the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee may \n     have had.\n       I agree that the absence of a decision on this bill will \n     not prejudice any claim the Transportation and Infrastructure \n     Committee may have had, or may have with respect to similar \n     measures in the future.\n       A copy of this letter will be entered into the \n     Congressional Record.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3842, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Centers Reform and Improvement Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 3842 amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to \nprovide specific authorities for the Director of the Federal Law \nEnforcement Training Centers, or FLETC. I am proud to join Mr. Carter \nin introducing this very important legislation.\n  FLETC, established in 1975 and transitioned from the Treasury \nDepartment to the Department of Homeland Security in 2002, provides \nFederal and other law enforcement agencies with high-quality, cost-\neffective training. Training is carried out by a group of experienced \ninstructors who use modern facilities and standardized course content \nat locations in Georgia, Maryland, New Mexico, and South Carolina.\n  FLETC also has a unique relationship with the Maritime Law \nEnforcement Training Center at the Port of Los Angeles, where together \nthey have developed comprehensive maritime security training for State \nand local agencies. Together, this partnership between FLETC and the \nPort of Los Angeles helps ensure our local law enforcement get the \ntraining they need to protect America's critical ports and waterways, \nparticularly important at a port that accounts for more than 40 percent \nof the goods that enter the United States.\n  H.R. 3842 was reported favorably from the Homeland Security Committee \nwith bipartisan approval last month.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to note that, during the committee's \nNovember 4 markup of H.R. 3842, members unanimously adopted three \nDemocratic amendments to the bill.\n  The first amendment underscores FLETC's responsibility to conduct \nacquisition activities in accordance with existing law and regulation, \nwhich include both a requirement that FLETC's Director evaluate \ncontractors' integrity and business ethics in performance of previous \ncontracts and vests FLETC's Director with the responsibility of \nensuring that a fair proportion of contracting dollars are awarded to \nsmall businesses.\n  The second amendment authorizes strategic partnerships between FLETC \nand local law enforcement agencies, including the existing partnership \nbetween FLETC and the Maritime Law Enforcement Training Center operated \nby the Port of Los Angeles.\n  This amendment also authorizes FLETC to work with the DHS National \nProtection and Programs Directorate to make training available to \nsecurity professionals in the private sector, particularly those \ninvolved with protecting critical infrastructure.\n  The final amendment authorizes FLETC's Director to detail employees \nto various components in the Department to assist in the development of \ncritical Departmental programs and initiatives.\n  The urgency to pass this bill has only grown in the last week. Last \nWednesday a shooting just outside of my district, in an area I \nrepresented as a State senator, in California, San Bernardino County, \naffirmed that our local law enforcement are our first line of defense \nin the fight against terror. We must ensure that they have the most up-\nto-date training as possible.\n  I know firsthand how important this kind of coordination is between \nall levels of enforcement. As a 911 dispatcher for nearly 20 years, I \ncan't tell you how important it is to ensure that our first responders \nhave the tools and resources they need to keep us safe.\n  Earlier this year I held a roundtable meeting with local law \nenforcement, the FBI, Homeland Security, and other Federal officials to \ndiscuss emergency coordination and emerging threats to our communities. \nAs a part of this discussion, our local police stressed the\n\n[[Page H9040]]\n\nneed for additional resources and better information sharing and \ntraining to combat these threats.\n  During last week's attack, we saw San Bernardino law enforcement \nrespond effectively to protect our community, but there is so much more \nwe can do. If our Nation is to address the threat of future attacks, we \nmust ensure that law enforcement personnel throughout the Nation not \nonly have the tools they need to do so, but also the training, to \neffectively address the diverse terrorism landscape.\n  With this in mind, Mr. Speaker, I would commend this bill to the \nHouse for consideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Kildee).\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a Homeland Security bill. We have a \nnumber of these bills coming to the floor today. But it is hard to \nignore the fact that there is a glaring weakness in what is being \nbrought here to the floor when it comes to protecting the American \npeople.\n  Right now at this very moment an individual who is on the FBI \nterrorist watch list could walk into any gun store and purchase the \nweapon of their choice. The American people understand this makes \nabsolutely no sense.\n  In the last 11 years, 2,000 people who are on the terrorist watch \nlist have gone in to purchase weapons and 91 percent of them have \nwalked away with the weapon of their choice. Inexplicably, a piece of \nlegislation authorized by Republican Congressman Peter King is ready \nfor this House to act. It would close this ridiculous loophole.\n  When I have talked to people back home about this, they expect that \nthis is already law. They almost have to have it pointed out to them \nthat, no, this is actually not the case. A person on the terrorist \nwatch list can go to a gun store and purchase a weapon.\n  If we are serious about protecting the safety of the American people, \nit would seem that the commonsense thing to do would be to take up \nRepresentative King's legislation and close this dangerous loophole.\n  So we are coming to the floor with important bills. I don't deny \nthat. Right now we have in our hands the ability to act to take guns \nout of the hands of people who are on the terrorist watch list. If you \ncan't be trusted to fly, you certainly shouldn't be trusted to walk in \nand just get a weapon of your choice.\n  Because of this body's failure to bring up this important \nlegislation, I as a Member of Congress can't sit idly by.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9040-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9040-H9041]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOTION TO ADJOURN\n\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 3859, the HSA Technical \nCorrections Act.\n  This important, commonsense legislation amends the Homeland Security \nAct of 2002, the HSA, by updating obsolete language and by striking \noutdated offices and reporting requirements.\n  In the aftermath of September 11, 2001, Congress passed the HSA, the \norganizing document of the Department of Homeland Security, or DHS, to \nenhance the ability of the Federal Government to prevent future acts of \ndomestic terrorism.\n  The passage of this legislation marked one of the most dramatic \nreorganizations of the Federal Government in decades and introduced a \nnumber of new offices and reporting requirements. In the intervening \nyears, agencies have changed; names, roles, and responsibilities have \nshifted; and a number of reporting requirements have expired. This \nlegislation updates the HSA to ensure it more accurately reflects the \nmission of DHS, and thereby allows Congress to conduct more effective \noversight of the Department.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3859, the HSA Technical Corrections Act of \n2015.\n  Let me, first of all, thank the chairperson and ranking member of the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee on H.R. 3859 and thank the \nranking member, Mr. Thompson, and the chairman of the full committee. \nThe American people are looking for homeland security. They are looking \nfor us to be secure.\n  Before I briefly discuss H.R. 3859, let me applaud the Carter-Torres \nbill, which was just passed, giving further authority to train law \nenforcement all over America. As we can see, law enforcement is a part \nof our first responders on homeland security.\n  H.R. 3859 is a technical corrections bill. It updates and revises the \nHomeland Security Act of 2002 by, among other things, eliminating \nonetime reporting requirements, removing antiquated positions that no \nlonger exist or have evolved, and striking provisions that were \ninserted in 2002 before the Department of Homeland Security was \nofficially constituted in 2003.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to note that during the Homeland Security \nCommittee's November 4 markup of H.R. 3859, members favorably and \nunanimously reported this bill.\n  I acknowledge Mr. Perry for his leadership on these issues as well as \nthe collaboration we have on this committee. With this in mind, I \ncommend this bill for House consideration.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Speier).\n  Ms. SPEIER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentlewoman just referred to H.R. 3859 as a \nunanimous bill that came out of Homeland Security. She spoke about how \nthis measure is going to get rid of reporting requirements and \nantiquated elements regarding homeland security.\n  Meanwhile, Members, we have a travesty on our hands, and we are doing \nnothing about it. We just witnessed the 353rd mass shooting of the year \nin this country. We are all concerned about homegrown terrorists. We \nhad a homegrown terrorist who annihilated 14 people and injured many \nmore just last week.\n  We have a huge loophole in the law that allows persons who are on the \nno-fly list to purchase guns in this country. If we believe that they \nshould not\n\n[[Page H9045]]\n\nhave the right to fly, why should they have the right to own a gun? \nPeople like Faisal Shahzad was already on the no-fly list when he \nattempted to bomb Times Square on May 1, 2010. If he had decided to \nwalk into a gun store that day and purchase a gun, he would have been \nable to do so. This makes no sense.\n  It is time for us to engage in common sense. It is time for the \nHomeland Security Committee to come together in a unanimous fashion and \npass H.R. 1076. There is a discharge petition on the floor. This bill \nshould come before the full House. Vote however you want to, but give \neach and every Member of this House the opportunity to be recorded on \nwhether or not one wants people who are on suspected terrorist lists to \nbe able to buy a gun.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  For those who may be on that list for purposes that are wrong or in \nerror, so they have to wait 3 days before they get the gun. Better to \nhave safety in this country for all Americans, better to have persons \nwho do not belong in a position of owning a gun, but belong on the list \nnot to fly, to not be able to buy a gun.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9045-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9045]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOTION TO ADJOURN\n\n  Ms. SPEIER.

The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say thank you to the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman), my good friend, for the fine work they \ndid on this bipartisan, noncontroversial bill that is common sense and \ndoes the right thing. But, unfortunately, it has been hijacked, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  It has been hijacked for this ruse. They set it aside. They said: \nWell, we have got this discharge petition. We want to get this bill on \nthe floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, they don't have the names to get the bill on the floor. \nFurthermore, I contend they don't even want to vote for it. They don't \nwant to vote on it. They just want to talk about this. These are the \nfolks who tell everybody that they are here to protect your rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, they talk about they want the people on the no-fly list \nto have their right to firearms taken away from them, understanding--\nhopefully, they understand--they have no idea what it takes to get on \nthe no-fly list. These people on the no-fly list have no idea half the \ntime that they are on it.\n  Furthermore, the no-fly list is maintained by bureaucrats, the same \nadministration that persecutes its citizens and has them audited by the \nIRS\n\n[[Page H9046]]\n\nfor their beliefs and what they say at a prayer breakfast.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, I want to congratulate the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Perry), my friend, and the gentlewoman from Texas \n(Ms. Jackson Lee), my friend, for having a bill that would actually \nclean up some problems within Homeland Security.\n  But, as I listen to the debate, including the last gentlewoman who \nmoved for adjournment, I wonder if people who speak on this floor, Mr. \nSpeaker, sometimes listen to themselves. As the gentlewoman pointed \nout--we could have the words read back, but she actually said that the \nTimes Square bomber, the guy that was trying to blow up people with a \nbomb in Times Square, could have gone in and bought a gun. Obviously, \nhe wasn't using a gun.\n  We also know that, as our friends across the aisle have proposed more \nstringent background checks and more extensive gun control laws, that \nnot one of the proposals of this administration would have stopped the \nkillings in Colorado, in Oregon at the community college, or at San \nBernardino. This body ought to be about doing things that make a \ndifference, not doing things for show.\n  As far as the no-fly list, when we have a process that is conducted \nbehind closed doors, a process that was not formulated and voted on by \nthe elected Members of Congress, that puts people on a no-fly list, my \nfriends who support that idea are telling people around the country, \nincluding the 200,000 people buying guns in the last month, that we \nwant an arbitrary process by a President, who a Muslim Brotherhood \npublication in Egypt says is advised by six of their top Muslim \nbrothers, to formulate a list--it is not my words. That is the Egyptian \npublication back in December of 2012. They want that President \nformulating behind closed doors a list of Americans who can never buy a \ngun. This is the same administration that has gone after conservative \norganizations with the IRS.\n  Let me also point out that, before you try to clean out the homes of \nhonest, law-abiding Americans, including a general who is a constituent \nwho keeps ending up on the no-fly list, why don't you get rid of the 72 \nDepartment of Homeland Security employees who were on the no-fly list \nbefore you try to take guns away from law-abiding Americans.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. May I have 30 more seconds?\n  Mr. PERRY. No. I need to keep moving. I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Let me just say this: I am not sure if the gentleman from Texas, a \ndear friend, was asking us to get rid of the no-fly list or the watch \nlist.\n  Our point today, Mr. Speaker, is very narrow. We are just asking that \nterrorists not be able to walk into a gun shop and buy a gun. This is a \nloophole that is most glaring. Eighty percent of the American people \nbelieve that this is impossible; it must not be true. We are trying to \nprevent suspected terrorists from walking into a gun store and buying a \ndeadly weapon.\n  The investigation, tragically, in California is not yet finished, so \nwe don't have the final answer as to what would have prevented that. \nBut it is astonishing that the loophole has allowed more than 2,000 \nsuspects on the FBI terrorist watch list to buy guns in the U.S. over \nthe past 11 years.\n  When I started this debate, I was happy that we had come to the floor \nto deal with Homeland Security bills. The American people want the \nhomeland safe and secure. They don't want demagoguery. They want safety \nand security.\n  Legislation blocking terrorists from getting guns makes America no \nmore safer and secure than apple pie. This is a time when more than 90 \npercent of all suspected terrorists who tried to buy guns in America \nwalked away and bought them. They got the weapon they wanted. This is \nnot criminals, gangs, or others. We are dealing with those individuals \nwho are terrorists. They have the right to get a gun.\n  Can we do something this week, Mr. Speaker? Can we add to the safety \nand security of the American people? As we pass this bill, H.R. 3859, \nwhich I applaud its correcting technicalities, can we join together and \ncan we pass closing the gun loophole that allows terrorists to go and \nbuy a gun to terrorize innocent Americans? I think we can do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for \nyielding.\n  We have talked a lot in the last couple of weeks about the visa \nwaiver program, visas in general, and Syrian refugees. Let me remind \nthis body and the American people that 49 percent of all illegals in \nthis country didn't cross our southern border; they came here with a \npermission slip in their hand, known as a visa. And they chose to \noverstay that visa. Now they are categorized as visa overstays. These \noverstays are people that we trusted by giving them a permission slip \nto come into our great country.\n  There are six words that ought to be brought up as we talk about this \nissue: secure the border, enforce the laws. That is how you keep \nAmerica safe.\n  I want to tell you, national security is at stake here. Americans are \nconcerned. I won't say Americans are afraid, but they are concerned. \nThey expect us to do our job to secure this great Nation. They expect \nus to look into the visa waiver program. They expect us to look into \nthe refugees and the vetting process. They expect us to keep them safe.\n  We ought to talk about securing the border and enforcing the laws. We \nare not chasing footprints in the desert with regard to the visa \noverstays. We know who these people are. They have had an interview at \na consulate or embassy. We probably have a thumbprint, a picture, a \nname. We probably have an address of where they are going.\n  Let's keep our eye on the ball here. Americans expect us to keep them \nsafe, and that is by reviewing the visa waiver program, that is \nconsidering the vetting process, and that is enforcing the law. Let's \nsecure our Nation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I started by saying that the American people are looking \nto us to secure the homeland.\n  As we look at these series of bills that we have on the floor, H.R. \n3859 is a technical corrections bill. This is a bill that should be \npassed. Americans expect clarity from this body. Clarity from this body \nmeans that at the same time as we pass H.R. 3859, we should also be \nconcerned about making sure that we close gun show loopholes so as to \navoid having terrorists buy guns.\n  I believe that that is the appropriate and direct way to handle this \nquestion of securing the Nation. Do the obvious to secure the Nation: \nstop terrorists from getting guns.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 3859, \nwhich is really the issue at hand.\n  Regarding the other issue that is being discussed here, this is an \nissue of failure of foreign policy: an open border and a visa waiver \nprogram that allows terrorists to come into our Nation unfettered. \nOther than the issue at hand, that is the issue that we are really \ntalking about.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 3859, the HSA \nTechnical Corrections Act. Again, it is important, commonsense \nlegislation. It amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 by updating \nobsolete language and striking outdated offices and reporting \nrequirements.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Collins of New York). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Perry) that \nthe House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 3859, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n\n[[Page H9047]]\n\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9047-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9047]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MOTION TO ADJOURN\n\n  Mrs. CAPPS.

Such e-\n     passports should be a combined paper and electronic passport \n     that contains biographic and biometric information that can \n     be used to authenticate the identity of travelers through an \n     embedded chip.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nLofgren) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 158 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that debate on \nthis motion be extended by 10 minutes on each side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement \nand Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\n  The Visa Waiver Program allows nationals of 38 countries to travel to \nthe United States for a maximum of 90 days for business or tourism \npurposes without obtaining a visa. The travelers must present a valid \nmachine-readable passport and meet certain other immigration and \nsecurity requirements.\n  In order to be designated a VWP country, a nation must offer \nreciprocal visa-free travel to U.S. citizens, agree to share security-\nrelated information such as whether citizens of that country traveling \nto the U.S. represent a threat to U.S. security or welfare, agree to \ntimely report lost and stolen passports, and have less than a 3 percent \nvisa refusal rate in the year prior to designation years, among other \nrequirements.\n  The VWP was created in 1986 as a way to promote and facilitate travel \nand tourism to the United States. It has done just that, with hundreds \nof millions of foreign nationals traveling to the U.S. since the \nprogram's implementation. So the positive effects of the VWP on the \nU.S. economy should not be understated.\n  Yet no amount of economic stimulation is worth risking the lives of \nour constituents, and recent events around the world necessitate \nchanges to the VWP in order to help ensure its safety. Of particular \nconcern is the rise of ISIS in the Middle East and the large number of \nEuropeans and other nationalities who have gone to Syria, Iraq, and \nother countries of concern in order to train and fight alongside ISIS \nand the radical Islamist terrorists.\n  With their VWP country passports, those terrorists can board a plane\n\n[[Page H9050]]\n\nbound for the U.S. and can reach U.S. shores with relative ease. In VWP \ncases, there is no in-person interview with a U.S. consular officer, \nand there is no pretravel enhanced screening. So we must help make sure \nthat the VWP is as secure as possible.\n  H.R. 158 takes constructive steps in this direction with provisions \npreventing dual nationals of, or those who have recently traveled to, \nIraq, Syria, or other countries of concern, from visa-free travel to \nthe U.S. Among other security enhancements, the bill requires VWP \ncountries to issue e-Passports to their nationals and continuously \nshare terrorism and foreign traveler data with us.\n  The VWP is only one part of the national discussion that we should be \nhaving. There are Islamist terrorists looking at all aspects of our \nimmigration policy to find any way possible to exploit it. We learned \nthat lesson on 9/11, and we learned that lesson last week in San \nBernardino.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope this body continues to address deficiencies in \nU.S. immigration policy by taking up and passing additional House \nJudiciary Committee bills, including those reported out of the \nJudiciary Committee to reform the U.S. asylum process, to change the \nway unaccompanied alien minors are treated when they cross the U.S. \nborder so that there is no longer an incentive to run across the \nborder, and to finally prevent the interior immigration enforcement \nswitch from being turned off at the whim of whoever resides at 1600 \nPennsylvania Avenue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller) and \nthe chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, as well as their staff \nmembers, for their work on the bill.\n  Much more needs to be done to prevent exploitation of U.S. \nimmigration policy by terrorists, but H.R. 158 is another good step in \nhelping to ensure the safety of Americans, and I support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we come together to address vulnerabilities in our \nVisa Waiver Program to make our country safer.\n  What is the Visa Waiver Program? It was established long before 9/11. \nIn order for a country to be admitted to the Visa Waiver Program, fewer \nthan 3 percent of its applicants for a visitor visa can be denied. \nOften, the denial of a visitor's visa has nothing to do with security. \nRather, it is frequently based on a judgment of whether the applicant \nis likely to return to his home country.\n  It is fair to say that persons who are poor are often judged to be \nless likely to return to their home country than a more affluent \napplicant with extensive financial ties to his or her home. That is the \nreason why there are no impoverished countries in the Visa Waiver \nProgram.\n  Most of Europe, Japan, Singapore, Australia, South Korea, and the \nlike are in the program--38 countries in all. The 38 countries agree to \nshare security information with the United States.\n  The Visa Waiver Program also is reciprocal, allowing Americans to \ntravel to these 38 countries without getting a visitor's visa. For \nthese 38 countries, visitors fill out a form in advance that is then \nchecked against databases. An ePassport is required for travel, but no \nvisa. However, at the point of entry, an intending visitor from a visa \nwaiver country can be turned away if he is not found admissible under \nimmigration law. For example, a visa waiver visitor who reveals he \nintends to study in the United States or to marry and remain in the \nU.S. will be denied entry at the airport by a Customs and Border \nProtection officer.\n  Mr. Speaker, people who do not reside in these 38 countries can still \nvisit the United States, but they have to obtain a visitor's visa to do \nso, and this is exactly the same for those who are ineligible for the \nVisa Waiver Program under this bill.\n  The Visa Waiver Program enables millions of tourists and business \ntravelers to come to the U.S. every year for short trips that \naltogether bring over $190 billion a year in business and tax revenue. \nThis program is important to our economy and the country.\n  At the same time, Mr. Speaker, in the wake of the November 13 \nterrorist attacks, we must review this program to make sure it meets \nour present-day security needs since it was designed prior to 9/11. \nThis bipartisan bill incorporates simple changes to enhance security in \nthe Visa Waiver Program.\n  The most important parts of the legislation provide for specific, \nconcrete changes to ensure better information sharing among \nintelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  It requires screening of all travelers against INTERPOL databases. It \nmakes it harder to falsify identity by requiring fraud-resistant e-\nPassports that contain biometric information. It compels U.S. security \nagencies to conduct more frequent threat assessments of visa waiver \ncountries, something not currently part of the law.\n  For those who have traveled to or are nationals of certain high-\nthreat countries, a visa interview, rather than visa-free travel, will \nbe required. These individuals are not barred from traveling to the \nUnited States.\n  We know that thousands of European citizens have traveled to Syria. \nSome are there on humanitarian missions, like Doctors Without Borders, \nand we thank them. Some went to fight with ISIS. The visa interview, \nconducted by a U.S. consular official, will establish the circumstances \nof the visit. If you are a German citizen who visited Syria last year, \nyou will have the same visa process that every Israeli, every Pole, \nevery Ethiopian, and every Mexican has. None of us has said it is \nunreasonable that people in Thailand, India, or Brazil undergo \ninterviews for visitor visas. And this change in the Visa Waiver \nProgram is not unreasonable either.\n  This visa waiver legislation stands in stark contrast to the \nRepublican-led refugee bill that was rushed to the floor 3 weeks ago. \nThat ineffective and mean-spirited bill would shut down the U.S. \nrefugee program for Syrians and Iraqis fleeing civil war and the \nbrutality of ISIS. And it does so notwithstanding the fact that \nrefugees are subject to 18 to 24 months of thorough screening before \never setting foot on U.S. soil, a more rigorous process than any other \nimmigrant or traveler to the United States is subject to.\n  The refugee bill does absolutely nothing to make us safer, and it is \na betrayal of our values. It would have us turn our back on refugee \nwomen and children and on our proud history as a country that provides \nsafe haven to the world's most vulnerable. I will continue to do \neverything in my power to see that it never becomes law.\n  While the refugee bill showed our country and this body at its worst, \ntoday's bill makes sensible improvements to the security of the Visa \nWaiver Program. I thank my colleagues for working with me and the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the State Department, and the White \nHouse to craft this targeted legislation. I strongly urge its support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMichigan (Mrs. Miller), the chief sponsor of this legislation, who is \nalso the chairman of the House Administration Committee.\n  Mrs. MILLER of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 9/11 Commission said that ``For terrorists, travel \ndocuments are as important as weapons.'' And I couldn't agree more. We \nsimply cannot give people from other countries special access to our \ncountry if we don't have all of the information that we absolutely need \nto ensure that they are not a threat to our national security.\n  I believe that the bill that we are considering today is the first of \nmany, quite frankly, aimed at improving our security protocols. We need \nto have a comprehensive, complete review of all of our visa programs, \nincluding K1 visas, the so-called ``fiance visa,'' which was used by \nthe female terrorist in the San Bernardino attack to enter the United \nStates. As well, the issue of visa overstays also needs to be \naddressed.\n  Today, the House is taking a very important step forward by \nconsidering this bill, which is focused on those traveling to the U.S. \nwithout a visa.\n  As was said, the Visa Waiver Program actually was established back in\n\n[[Page H9051]]\n\nthe eighties to expedite tourism and trade as well, and it has worked \nvery, very well economically for our country. Today there are 38 \ncompanies that participate; and their citizens, although they are \nrequired to have a passport, are not required to go to a U.S. Embassy \nor to a consulate to obtain a visa.\n  Obviously, the world is a much different place today, and our \nsecurity measures must evolve to meet any and all threats, which is why \nI introduced this bill.\n  This bill has gone through regular order. As chairman of the Border \nand Maritime Security Subcommittee, I have held two hearings on this. \nIt actually passed out of the full Homeland Security Committee as well \non a unanimous vote, every Republican, every Democrat. Because before \nwe are anything else, we are all Americans first, and we all recognize \nthe vulnerabilities of our current program.\n  Information sharing, especially with our European allies, is vital, \nabsolutely vital to help combat the threat of foreign fighters bound \nfor the United States. There is absolutely no second for having good \ninformation. We need to be certain that participating countries are \ngiving us all of the information that we need from either their own \nterror watch list or travel manifests, and that all of the information \nprotocols are being shared.\n  As we know, sometimes it is not until after the fact that some of the \nparticipating countries actually provide us the names of individuals \nwho they knew were a terror threat. That is unacceptable.\n  This bill will change that because what this bill does is it gives \nthe authority to the Secretary of Homeland Security to either suspend \nor terminate a country's participation in this program if we don't feel \nconfident that we are getting all the critical information that we need \nto stop terrorists from exploiting this program to travel into the U.S.\n  So, at this time, we still have an information sharing problem with \nsome of our closest allies. And as the 9/11 Commission also accurately \nnoted, we need to move from the mindset of the need-to-know information \nto the need-to-share information.\n  Information sharing must happen, and this bill gives America the \nleverage that it needs to make sure that the information critical to \nour homeland security is being shared appropriately.\n  It will also disqualify anyone who has traveled to Syria, Iraq, \nSudan, and Iran within the past 5 years from participating in this \nprogram. In an abundance of caution, we will now require those \nindividuals to apply for a visa and go through the formal visa \nscreening process.\n  It will also give the Secretary of Homeland Security the discretion \nto designate other countries that have significant terror concerns, or \nbecome terror safe havens in the future.\n  Additionally, we will be requiring all participating countries to \nadopt e-Passports, like we have here in the United States, so that we \nare able to eliminate passport fraud.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Americans, we live in a free and open society, and \nenemies of freedom are looking to use our freedoms against us. This \nbill will stop the enemies' ability to move internationally by \nstrengthening the Visa Waiver Program. It is a critical component of \nkeeping our homeland safe.\n  I want to thank the House leadership for ensuring prompt \nconsideration of this bill on the floor. I certainly want to thank \nChairman McCaul and Chairman Goodlatte for working as well. And I also \nwant to give a special thanks as well to Representative Katko from New \nYork, who is the chairman of the Foreign Fighter Task Force, which \nreally helped make this bill a much stronger product.\n\n  It is my hope that a very strong, bipartisan vote on this bill today \nwill send a message to terrorists that America is prepared to take any \nand all measures to protect our homeland.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers), the ranking member of the full \ncommittee.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, Members of the House, as much as any Member \nin this body, I appreciate the unique situation our Nation is in as we \nstruggle to effectively combat terrorism, while adhering to our \nNation's commitment to freedom and liberty.\n  I fully recognize and appreciate that the bill before us today \nrepresents an effort to craft a more bipartisan response to recent \nterrorist incidents, particularly when compared to the seriously flawed \nrefugee bill that this body voted on only several weeks ago.\n  I commend the office for including many commonsense improvements to \nthe Visa Waiver Program that will improve the system in a neutral and \nnondiscriminatory manner. However, I believe that provisions in the \nlegislation restricting the use of the Visa Waiver Program to \nindividuals who have traveled to Syria or Iraq or are dual nationals of \nthese or other covered nations are discriminatory. I understand that \nthese individuals are not banned from traveling to our Nation and are \nsimply subject to increased questioning and scrutiny before they can \ntravel here.\n  However, history has shown us that arbitrary across-the-board \njudgments based on broad characteristics such as these do nothing to \nenhance our security and only cast a cloud of suspicion over entire \ncommunities here in our country.\n  Equally problematic is the provision's overbreadth. It contains no \nexceptions for journalists, researchers, human rights investigators, or \nother professionals. This will make it harder, not easier, to document \nand respond to human rights violations and other abuses. I also believe \nthe provision should have included a sunset date so that we can assess \nits efficacy. I am further concerned that the new requirement will \nresult in our partner nations placing new limits on travel by United \nStates citizens to their own countries.\n  It is because of these problems that numerous civil rights and civil \nliberties groups have expressed serious concerns or outright opposition \nto the overall legislation, including the American Civil Liberties \nUnion, the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, the NAACP, \nthe American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee, the American \nImmigration Lawyers Association, the Council on American-Islamic \nRelations, the Arab-American Civil Rights League, Human Rights Watch, \nand the League of United Latin American Citizens, among others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters from those groups.\n\n                                                 December 8, 2015.\n     Re: Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorism Travel Prevention \n         Act of 2015, H.R. 158\n\n     U.S. Senate,\n     House of Representatives.\n       Dear Legislator: The Arab-American Civil Rights League \n     (``ACRL'') writes with grave concern regarding H.R. 158, the \n     Visa Waiver Improvement and Terrorism Travel Prevention Act \n     of 2015 (``HR 158''). HR 158 would amend the Visa Waiver \n     Program by mandating that individuals who have traveled to \n     Syria or Iraq in the past five years be barred from \n     participation in the Visa Waiver Program. The ACRL strongly \n     opposes such legislation on the grounds that it is both \n     discriminatory and ineffective--an ill-conceived legislative \n     backlash to recent tragedies.\n       HR 158's blanket ban upon persons who have visited the \n     countries of Iraq and Syria in the past five years will only \n     harm those who have legitimate reasons to visit the United \n     States, and will not effectively deter or prevent terrorists \n     and criminals from seeking to enter this country and do us \n     harm. Simply put, nefarious individuals seeking to enter the \n     United States to commit illegal acts of terror, will not be \n     dissuaded by federal law. It is nothing less than absurd to \n     think that an individual trying to enter the United States to \n     commit acts of terror will abide by our laws.\n       On the other hand, HR 158 will ban individuals who have \n     visited Syria and Iraq for legitimate reasons in the last \n     five years, for no other reason than their physical presence \n     in said countries. Consider the types of individuals that \n     would be banned: journalists, members of the clergy, family \n     visitors, and myriad others. HR 158 targets and punishes \n     entire swathes of people who have done nothing wrong, while \n     failing to effectively target those who seek to harm this \n     country. In all essence, HR 158 presumes that there are no \n     reasons for people to visit Syria and Iraq, and that anyone \n     who has been to those two countries should be suspected of \n     terrorism.\n       Far from enhancing our safety and security, HR 158 will \n     only further isolate and alienate people of Arab, Middle \n     Eastern, and South Asian descent. In this sense, HR 158 is a \n     victory for the terrorists, whose true goal is to disrupt our \n     society through acts of shocking violence and barbarism. Far \n     from playing into their hands, we should reaffirm our \n     national commitment to liberty, and continue to embrace \n     pluralism. At our core, we remain a nation of many cultures,\n\n[[Page H9052]]\n\n     ethnicities, and faiths, and are far stronger when we defend \n     our core values and refuse to act in fear. Federal policy \n     must be carefully drafted and deliberated given its wide-\n     ranging scope and effect. As we have seen in the past with \n     other pieces of national security legislation, such \n     legislative acts can lead to slippery slopes. We at the ACRL \n     urge you to oppose HR 158, and specifically its mandatory \n     exclusion provisions, because they are ineffective, ill-\n     conceived, and un-American.\n           Respectfully submitted,\n                                               Arab-American Civil\n     Rights League (ACRL).\n                                  ____\n\n\n  AILA: Congress Should Reject H.R. 158 Until Its Visa Waiver Program \n                   Changes Are More Carefully Weighed\n\n       Washington, DC.--The American Immigration Lawyers \n     Association (AILA) expressed concerns regarding the Visa \n     Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Prevention Act, H.R. \n     158, and recommended Congress vote ``NO'' on the bill unless \n     modifications and clarifications are made.\n       ``Protecting our nation from terrorists is absolutely \n     essential, and AILA understands and supports efforts to \n     strengthen the Visa Waiver Program, but Congress must \n     consider any legislative proposal carefully, and this bill is \n     getting rushed to the House floor without ever being reviewed \n     in Committee. In fact, the bill was not even made public \n     until just a day or two ago,'' said AILA President Victor \n     Nieblas Pradis.\n       ``AILA has serious concerns that H.R. 158 would broadly \n     target descendants of Syrian or Iraqi nationals, or those \n     from other countries alleged to be supporting terrorism, who \n     may have little or no connection to those countries except by \n     parentage,'' Mr. Nieblas continued, referring to the bill's \n     blanket termination of participation in the Visa Waiver \n     Program (VWP) for anyone who is a ``national'' of Iraq or \n     Syria, or other designated countries. ``As written, the bill \n     could result in discrimination that will exclude people \n     without consideration of legitimate risk factors. For \n     instance, a child who has never been to Syria, but was born \n     in France to Syrian parents, would be ineligible for the \n     VWP.''\n       H.R. 158 also excludes from the program anyone who \n     travelled to countries alleged to be supporting terrorism \n     within the past five years, without sufficient authority to \n     waive revocation for those who clearly pose no threat. ``This \n     per se ban will hurt humanitarian workers and journalists who \n     are traveling to Iraq and Syria or other designated countries \n     to do life-saving work or to report on international events. \n     The bill's waiver will not help any of these people who have \n     visited for legitimate, even compelling reasons,'' Mr. \n     Nieblas noted, referring to a provision that allows the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security to waive the exclusion if the \n     waiver is in the interest of law enforcement or national \n     security, but makes no mention of humanitarian or other \n     grounds.\n       ``History has shown overbroad programs that target people \n     based on nationality, race, ethnic origin or religion are not \n     effective at combatting terrorism. After 9/11, our government \n     forced thousands of people from Middle-Eastern countries, and \n     countries with predominantly Arab and Muslim populations, to \n     undergo special processes to register themselves with the \n     federal immigration authorities,'' Mr. Nieblas said, \n     referring to the 2002 special-registration program under \n     National Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS). \n     The U.S. government described special-registration as an \n     ``inconvenience'' in the same way some are now justifying \n     H.R. 158's exclusion from VWP. He continued, ``Not a single \n     known terrorism-related conviction ever came out of NSEERS. \n     NSEERS is a stain on our nation's history that we should \n     never repeat.''\n       H.R. 158 would also establish additional reporting \n     requirements to Congress regarding use of the program, \n     additional eligibility requirements for VWP countries, and \n     enhancements to the Electronic System for Travel \n     Authorization (ESTA). The agencies involved in the VWP have \n     sought to continually improve and adapt the program as \n     circumstances change. As Congress aims to enhance the \n     program, it is essential that any changes are both workable \n     and effective.\n       ``Standing by our founding principles of freedom and \n     liberty is what keeps us strong. AILA urges Congress to show \n     leadership by ensuring any legislation it passes is \n     consistent with our values as a nation, and is crafted in a \n     way that is workable, sensible, and based on good policy, not \n     political expediency,'' Mr. Nieblas concluded.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      The Leadership Conference on\n\n\n                                       Civil and Human Rights,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n     Oppose H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement Act of \n         2015\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference \n     on Civil and Human Rights, a coalition of more than 200 \n     national civil and human rights advocacy organizations, we \n     urge you to oppose H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver Program \n     Improvement Act of 2015. Section 3 of H.R. 158 would open the \n     door to the use of profiling on the basis of national origin, \n     while doing little, if anything, to promote national \n     security.\n       While H.R. 158 calls for a number of bipartisan \n     improvements to the visa waiver program (VWP), Section 3 \n     would make two significant and unhelpful changes. First, it \n     would bar travelers from utilizing the process if they are \n     dual nationals of a VWP country and also of Iraq, Syria, or \n     other countries that are named as state sponsors of \n     terrorism. Its overly-broad language would apply to nationals \n     of those countries even if they have never set foot there, \n     and are only dual citizens because of the nationality of \n     their parents.\n       Second, it would exclude visitors from the VWP if they have \n     traveled to Iraq, Syria, or other designated countries, even \n     if they did so to provide medical or humanitarian assistance \n     or many other legitimate purposes. The effect of this on \n     national security is negligible at best, because it would \n     only affect people who entered those countries through \n     legitimate channels and accurately reported their travels--\n     not those who snuck in through the poorly-secured borders in \n     those countries to work with terrorist groups. In other \n     words, it would simply penalize travelers for being honest.\n       While Iraqi or Syrian dual nationals, or people who have \n     visited those countries, could still apply at a U.S. \n     consulate for a nonimmigrant visa, they would be subjected to \n     a process that raises concerns about ethnic and national \n     origin profiling and other arbitrary practices. Under current \n     procedures, consular decisions are not reviewable, which \n     raises the likelihood that low-risk individuals would be \n     barred from traveling to the United States altogether, while \n     high-risk individuals would simply find other ways of doing \n     harm.\n       We would support amendments to Section 3 that add due \n     process protections for affected travelers. Because the bill \n     is coming up on the suspension calendar, however, no such \n     amendments will be allowed. We recognize that Congress is \n     highly motivated to enact greater national security \n     protections in the wake of the Paris and San Bernadino \n     terrorist attacks, but we hope that you will reject this bill \n     in its current form and demand that it be improved.\n       Thank you for your consideration. If you have any \n     questions, please contact either of us or Rob Randhava, \n     Senior Counsel.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                 December 7, 2015.\n     Re ACLU Concerns With the ``Visa Waiver Program Improvement \n         and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015'' (H.R. 158)\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American Civil \n     Liberties Union (ACLU), we urge you to amend the ``Visa \n     Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention \n     Act of 2015'' (H.R. 158).\n\n\nI. H.R. 158 arbitrarily discriminates against nationals of Iraq, Syria, \n   Iran, or Sudan who are citizens of visa waiver program (``VWP'') \n          countries--based on their nationality and parentage.\n\n       The VWP is a long-established program that permits \n     nationals of certain countries to enter the U.S. as visitors \n     (tourists or business) without a visa, for up to 90 days. \n     H.R. 158 terminates travel privileges for all citizens of VWP \n     countries who are dual nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran, or \n     Sudan. This revocation of VWP privileges would apply to all \n     nationals of Iraq, Syria, Iran, or Sudan even if they have \n     never resided in or traveled to Iraq or Syria. By singling \n     out these four nationalities to the exclusion of other dual \n     nationals in VWP countries, H.R. 158 amounts to blanket \n     discrimination based on nationality and national origin \n     without a rational basis.\n       There is no sufficient reason to justify the differential \n     treatment of VWP citizens who are nationals of Iraq, Syria, \n     Iran, or Sudan. There is no evidence to support assertion \n     that citizens of VWP countries, who are dual nationals of \n     these four are more likely to engage in terrorist acts \n     against the U.S.\n       Not only is H.R. 158 discriminatory, it is arbitrary. \n     Unlike the U.S. which grants citizenship to all children born \n     on U.S. soil, birth within Syria does not automatically \n     confer citizenship. Rather Syrian citizenship is conferred by \n     naturalization or descent. With respect to descent, Syrian \n     citizenship is conferred to children ``born of a Syrian \n     father, regardless of the child's country of birth'' or \n     children ``born of a Syrian mother and an unknown or \n     stateless father.'' The proposal would yield the untenable \n     result of folding such gender-based distinctions into U.S. \n     law.\n       Therefore, if H.R. 158 were to become law, the following \n     types of travelers would automatically lose their VWP \n     privileges, even if they have never been to Iraq or Syria:\n       Dual-national French citizen (born to Syrian father) \n     traveling to U.S. for business conferences and meetings;\n       Dual-national German citizen (born to Syrian father) \n     traveling to U.S. with vacation tour group;\n       Dual-national Austrian citizen (born to Syrian father) \n     traveling to the U.S. to take care of grandchild.\n       It is wrong and un-American to punish groups without reason \n     solely based on their nationality, national origin, religion, \n     gender, or other protected grounds.\n\n\nII. H.R. 158 would end VWP privileges for all recent travelers to Iraq \n or Syria, including those who traveled there for professional purposes\n\n       H.R. 158 would terminate VWP travel privileges for all who \n     have been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or after \n     March 1, 2011. This broad travel restriction contains a very\n\n[[Page H9053]]\n\n     narrow exception for certain military personnel and \n     government officials. All other travelers would automatically \n     lose their VWP privileges. Affected travelers would include \n     journalists, scholars, refugee caseworkers, humanitarian aid \n     workers, human rights investigators, and many others.\n       Under H.R. 158, the following types of travelers would \n     automatically lose their VWP privileges based on their travel \n     to Syria or Iraq since March 2011:\n       British citizen, working as a reporter for the London-based \n     Daily Telegraph who traveled to Syria to cover the civil war;\n       Swiss citizen, working as a social worker in a Kurdish \n     refugee camp in northern Iraq;\n       Belgian citizen, working as a human rights investigator to \n     document abuses committed by ISIL against Syrians.\n       Many of these VWP travelers have gone to Syria or Iraq for \n     professional purposes and are producing reports and providing \n     services that the U.S., indeed the whole world, depends upon, \n     now more than ever. They should not lose their VWP travel \n     privileges for their work in Syria or Iraq.\n\n\nIII. Congress must place a time limit on measures to revoke VWP travel \n                               privileges\n\n       When Congress created the VWP years ago, Congress \n     authorized the Attorney General, in consultation with the \n     Secretary of State, to designate certain countries as VWP \n     countries. Congress has never codified any nationality-based \n     prohibitions for VWP program designation. If the House passes \n     this bill, it will be enshrining into statute that VWP \n     citizens, who happen to be Iraqi or Syrian nationals, are \n     categorically ineligible for VWP travel privileges even if \n     they have never been to Iraq or Syria.\n       In view of this extraordinary discriminatory measure, \n     Congress should limit the duration of this VWP restriction \n     and place a two-year sunset on this travel restriction. A \n     sunset provision would require Congress to reassess in two \n     years whether nationals of Iraq and Syria warrant such \n     selective targeting for VWP travel restriction purposes.\n\n\n                             IV. Conclusion\n\n       While the ACLU recognizes the importance of a Congressional \n     response to the increase in recent terrorist attacks, we urge \n     Congress to exercise caution and to avoid passing legislation \n     that would broadly scapegoat groups based on nationality, and \n     would fan the flames of discriminatory exclusion, both here \n     and abroad. We, therefore, urge the House to amend H.R. 158 \n     by: (1) Deleting the langpge that categorically strips VWP \n     privileges from all Iraqi and Syrian nationals; (2) Expanding \n     the exemption to include journalists, researchers, human \n     rights investigators, and other professionals; and (3) \n     Inserting a two-year sunset date to the travel restrictions \n     on the use of VWP.\n       In the absence of such changes, we have grave reservations \n     about this proposal.\n       For more information, please contact ACLU Legislative \n     Counsel Joanne Lin or Policy Counsel Chris Rickerd.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karin Johanson,\n       Director; Washington Legislative Office.\n     Joanne Lin,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n     Chris Rickerd,\n       Policy Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                 December 7, 2015.\n     Re Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel \n         Prevention Act, H.R. 158.\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the American-Arab Anti-\n     Discrimination Committee (ADC), I write to strongly urge you \n     to Vote No on the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and \n     Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, H.R. 158. We have serious \n     concerns on the application and enforcement of this bill if \n     it were to become law, specifically Section 3 which 1) \n     imposes a mandatory and categorically bar to the Visa Waiver \n     Program (VWP) on any individual who is a dual citizen of \n     Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and Iran; and 2) prohibits any person \n     whom has traveled to Syria, Iraq, Iran, and Sudan since March \n     1, 2011.\n       We understand that the U.S. House of Representatives may \n     push forward H.R. 158 through the omnibus appropriations \n     bill, and strongly request you to Vote No to H.R. 158 and/or \n     its inclusion in an omnibus bill because H.R. 158 is: 1) \n     ineffective to actually secure safety; and 2) intentionally \n     discriminates and profiles persons based on their national \n     origin.\n       Section 3's blanket exclusion of visitors to Iraq and Syria \n     would not be an effective security measure as it relies on \n     self-reporting accurate tracking of who visits those \n     countries that could be circumvented by someone intending to \n     do harm--the persons who are intent on engaging in terror \n     activities are not getting their passports stamped, they are \n     sneaking into Syria and Iraq. The provision is more likely to \n     screen out health and aid workers, clergymen, journalists, \n     teachers, military personnel, translators, family visitors \n     and others who are helping protect Americans or have \n     legitimate or completely innocent reasons to visit Syria or \n     Iraq--essentially penalizing them for their honesty and \n     performing humanitarian work.\n       It is not black and white, nor simple to suggest that H.R. \n     158 just requires individuals to get a visa. H.R. 158 is not \n     just a visa requirement, H.R. 158 is discriminatory. Section \n     3 imposes a mandatory bar to all persons whom are dual \n     citizens of Syria, Iraq, Sudan, and Iran is blatant profiling \n     on its face. Only nationals of particular countries \n     regardless of whether they have traveled to a terrorist \n     support country or not, have to meet additional requirements \n     they would not otherwise have to go through if they were not \n     Arab. It is premised on the unreliable assumption that Arabs \n     are more prone to terrorism and to commit terrorist acts, and \n     further perpetuates stereotypes that Arabs are terrorists. \n     There is no separate assessment and/or security review is \n     done that determines that specific person on a case by case \n     basis is a security threat, non-related to their identity, \n     place of birth, or country of national origin.\n       The fact is that terrorism is not limited to one particular \n     race, country of national origin, or religion, nor bound by \n     country borders. However, this bill paints Arabs as the \n     enemy, and makes VWP Arab nationals second class citizens in \n     their own country--they are not afforded the same benefits as \n     their fellow nationals. Many VWP nationals will be \n     arbitrarily denied entry by Customs and Border Patrol with \n     little to no notice of change in VWP requirements and no \n     review if that person actually presents a threat to national \n     security. Currently, Arabs face enormous scrutiny and \n     security checks to enter the U.S. and many have been denied \n     entry even with valid non-immigrant and immigrant visas, \n     based on no other reason but their national origin. You \n     should not support the further arbitrary exclusion of a group \n     of people based on nothing but that person's national origin.\n       Historically programs with sweeping powers to exclude \n     people based on nationality, race, ethnic origin or religion \n     have proven to be ineffective. In 2002, the U.S. government \n     established the special-registration program under National \n     Security Entry-Exit Registration System (NSEERS) requiring \n     heightened registration and scrutiny of people in the U.S. \n     who came from mostly Arab and Muslim countries. NSEERS was \n     initially portrayed as an anti-terrorism measure which \n     required male visitors to the U.S. from 25 Arab and Muslim \n     countries to be fingerprinted, photographed, and questioned \n     by immigration officers. Many whom complied with registration \n     were arbitrarily detained and deported. NSEERS proved to be \n     an ineffective counter-terrorism tool, and has not resulted \n     in a single known terrorism-related conviction. We also \n     should not forget the detrimental ramifications of blanket \n     immigration exclusion and discrimination against Asians with \n     the Chinese Exclusion Act.\n       Rather than imposing an ineffective ban from VWP on people \n     who set foot in Syria and Iraq and excluding groups of people \n     based on their national origin, Congress should consider \n     other security measures that would more effectively enhance \n     the Department of Homeland Security's screening process \n     overall. We must also be weary of how VWP countries will \n     treat Americans of Arab and Middle Eastern background, and \n     may single out and exclude our citizens from entry in their \n     respective immigration processes.\n       ADC strongly urges you to Vote No to H.R. 158 and stand up \n     against profiling. The automatic exclusion of dual citizens \n     of VWP countries and the designated Arab countries, and \n     recent visitors to Iraq and Syria is discriminatory. The \n     reactionary government actions following the Pearl Harbor \n     attack--Japanese Internment camps and 9/11--arbitrary \n     detention and surveillance of Arabs--are cautionary tales \n     that we must heed to now and remember that we cannot let fear \n     erode respect and protection of civil and human rights.\n       Respectfully Submitted,\n                                               Samer Khalaf, Esq.;\n     ADC National President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                                 December 4, 2015.\n     Re Visa Waiver Program Security Enhancement Act, S. 2337.\n\n       Dear Representative: The undersigned organizations write to \n     express our concern regarding the Visa Waiver Program \n     Security Enhancement Act, S. 2337, specifically Section 2 of \n     the bill which imposes a mandatory and categorical bar to the \n     Visa Waiver Program (VWP) on any individual who has traveled \n     to Syria or Iraq within the previous five years. We \n     understand that the House of Representatives may look to S. \n     2337 as it related to pushing forward on H.R. 158, the Visa \n     Waiver Program Improvement Act. In any discussions regarding \n     reforms to the VWP, including the omnibus appropriations \n     bill, we urge you to remove provisions that specifically \n     target people who visit or are from Syria or Iraq.\n       The bill's blanket exclusion of visitors to Iraq and Syria \n     would not be an effective security measure as it relies on \n     self-reporting accurate tracking of who visits those \n     countries that could be circumvented by someone intending to \n     do harm--the persons who are intent on engaging in tenor \n     activities are not getting their passports stamped, they are \n     sneaking into Syria and Iraq. The provision is more likely to \n     screen out health and aid workers, clergymen, journalists, \n     military personnel, translators, family visitors and others \n     who are helping protect Americans or have legitimate or \n     completely innocent reasons to visit Syria or Iraq \n     essentially penalizing them for their honesty.\n       The provision is premised on the unreliable assumption that \n     people from those countries are more likely to commit \n     terrorist acts, and\n\n[[Page H9054]]\n\n     it makes anyone who visits those countries automatically \n     suspect of terrorism. While the draft legislation on its face \n     applies to all persons who have traveled to Syria or Iraq, in \n     reality the legislation will have a disparate impact on \n     people of Syrian and Iraqi descent. Historically programs \n     with sweeping powers to exclude people based on nationality, \n     race, ethnic origin or religion have proven to be \n     ineffective. In 2002, the U.S government established the \n     special-registration program under National Security Entry-\n     Exit Registration System (NSEERS) requiring heightened \n     registration and scrutiny of people in the U.S. who came from \n     mostly Arab and Muslim countries. NSEERS proved to be an \n     ineffective counter-terrorism tool, and has not resulted in a \n     single known terrorism-related conviction. Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) suspended NSEERS in 2011.\n       Rather than imposing an ineffective ban from VWP on people \n     who set foot in Syria and Iraq, Congress should consider \n     other security measures that would more effectively enhance \n     the Department of Homeland Security's ability to identify and \n     screen out terrorists and dangerous individuals who pose \n     threats to our nation.\n       The automatic exclusion of recent visitors to Iraq and \n     Syria is discriminatory and will alienate Americans of Arab, \n     Muslim, Middle Eastern and South Asian descent. The better \n     way to combat terrorism in the U.S. is to ensure strong \n     relations with these communities. With respect to Syrian \n     refugees, former Sec. of State Madeleine Albright said ``Our \n     enemies have a plan. They want to divide the world between \n     Muslims and non-Muslims, and between the defenders and \n     attackers of Islam. In the aftermath of recent terrorist \n     attacks, America must show its leadership by ensuring we \n     remain an open society that welcomes people of all \n     nationalities, faiths and backgrounds.\n           Respectfully Submitted,\n       American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC), American \n     Immigration Lawyers Association (AILA), Asian Americans \n     Advancing Justice (AAJC), Asian Law Caucus, Council on \n     American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), Human Rights Watch, Iraq \n     Veterans Against the War, Just Foreign Policy, League of \n     United Latin American Citizens (LULAC), The Leadership \n     Conference on Civil and Human Rights, NAACP, National \n     Immigration Law Center, National Network for Arab American \n     Communities, Student-Led Movement to End Mass Atrocities \n     (STAND), SustainUS.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, while there are many positive aspects to \nthe legislation, I believe, in the end, we cannot countenance anything \nin our laws that judges individuals based on their nationality rather \nthan their character.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and \nChairman Miller for their leadership.\n  I rise in support of this bill, the Visa Waiver Program Improvement \nand Terrorist Travel Prevention Act.\n  Our Nation faces the highest terror threat environment since 9/11, \nand we must do everything possible to shut down terrorist pathways into \nthis country. We are working hard to do just that with this bill. Last \nmonth, the House voted overwhelmingly to pass bipartisan legislation I \ndrafted to prevent terrorists from entering the United States posing as \nrefugees.\n  They have already done this to attack Paris. And this year, the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence warned me that the \nNational Counterterrorism Center has identified individuals with ties \nto terrorist groups in Syria attempting to gain entry to the U.S. \nthrough the U.S. refugee program.\n  I am concerned that terrorists are attempting to exploit the U.S. \nrefugee program to enter our country and that we currently lack the \nability to confidently vet Syria refugees to weed out individuals with \npotential terrorist ties. Top law enforcement and intelligence \nofficials have testified before my Committee that terrorist groups have \nexpressed a desire to infiltrate refugee programs to enter the United \nStates and Europe, and ISIS has said in their own words that they \nintend to do so. In Paris, we saw them follow through on those pledges, \nsneaking at least two operatives into Europe posing as refugees. It \nalso appears that individuals with extremist links have already tried \nto gain entry to our country as refugees. This year the Office of the \nDirector of National Intelligence informed me in writing that the \nNational Counterterrorism Center has identified ``. . . individuals \nwith ties to terrorist groups in Syria attempting to gain entry to the \nU.S. through the U.S. refugee program.'' This is deeply troubling. At \nthis time, I am concerned that serious intelligence gaps preclude us \nfrom conducting comprehensive screening to detect all Syrian refugees \nwith terrorist ties, and as a result I have proposed adding additional \nnational security checks to the process before the United States \napproves any further admissions. Naturally, the States are concerned \nthat the refugees being resettled in their communities may not have \nbeen effectively screened--especially given the volume of refugees the \nAdministration has committed to accepting. Refugee resettlement is \nwithin the purview of the federal government. However, the \nAdministration must be transparent in sharing information with the \nStates about the people being resettled within their borders. The \nRefugee Act of 1980 requires that the federal government ``shall \nconsult regularly'' with state and local governments and private \nnonprofit voluntary agencies concerning the intended distribution of \nrefugees. In Texas, it appears the federal government has not fully \nheld-up its end of the bargain.\n  But we must go further. More than 30,000 individuals from 100 \ncountries have gone to Syria to join jihadist groups, and 5,000 of them \nhave Western passports. This includes several of the Paris attackers, \nwho could have traveled to the United States without a visa.\n  That is why this legislation is so important before us here today. It \nwill close security gaps in the Visa Waiver Program to keep terrorists \nfrom entering our country undetected. It also includes several \nrecommendations from the bipartisan Task Force on Combating Terrorist \nand Foreign Fighter Travel, which I created earlier this year.\n  This Member-led panel uncovered gaping security weaknesses overseas, \nincluding the fact that some countries are not sharing intelligence on \nterrorists, many are not screening travelers against critical \ncounterterrorism databases, and too few of them are cracking down on \npassport fraud.\n  This bill would help close those security gaps to keep terrorists \nfrom crossing borders. And it would implement several of the task \nforce's top recommendations to ensure Visa Waiver Program countries are \nliving up to their obligations and ramping up security.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee. I also want to thank those on the other side of the aisle \nfor working in a bipartisan spirit, in a cooperative nature on what I \nconsider to be one of the biggest security gaps we have facing this \ncountry after the Paris attacks and after San Bernardino. And I want to \nthank our colleagues on the other side of the aisle.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a member of the Judiciary Committee as well as \nof the Homeland Security Committee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentlewoman for her leadership. As \nwell, I thank the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson), the \nchairman of the Border and Maritime Security Subcommittee, of which I \nam a member--Chairman Miller--and Messrs. McCaul and Goodlatte.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I have indicated, in my having been on the floor \ntoday, America is looking for the homeland to be secure, and they are \nlooking for it to be done in a thoughtful manner.\n  Just a week ago, I did not vote for a bill that would have stopped \ninnocent refugees who had been in camps for 2 years or more--mothers \nand fathers and seniors and children--because I knew there was a 21-\nlist vetting system that would ensure that those refugees who had \nlanguished in refugee camps and who had been suffering would be a small \nnumber--an infinitesimal number--coming into the United States.\n  We heard debate earlier today about another loophole that could be \nended, and that is to stop terrorists from getting guns--a thoughtful \nproposal. Most Americans didn't realize the loophole existed.\n  Now we come to a program that is, likewise, a thoughtful program. It \nhas nothing to do with refugees. It has nothing to do with ending the \nVisa Waiver Program of 38 nations. What it has to do with is, if you \nhave been in the areas where the caliphate is, where the fight has been \ntaken to, Syria and Iraq, we just ask for an added interview. I might \nimagine that, in the course of that, there will be human rights \nactivists and journalists. I would imagine, as well, that our officials \nwho will be doing the interviews will be sensitive to the fact of \nlegitimate journalists who have gone to do their reporting.\n\n[[Page H9055]]\n\n  I think it is very important that the American people know that we \nare working to craft a thoughtful approach. This is a thoughtful \napproach. It simply asks for individuals to go for an interview who are \npart of the Visa Waiver Program in the countries that they have them or \nwho are dual nationals.\n  Likewise, I have introduced legislation, H.R. 48, No Fly for Foreign \nFighters, that asks for an added vetting for the terrorist watch list \nto make sure that no one on that list who is coming from overseas gets \non an airplane. This will protect the American people.\n  In the course of trying to be constructive, I think the hearings that \nwe had in Homeland Security indicated another layer, another level, of \njust making sure that those who are trying to use the Visa Waiver \nProgram are not abusing the Visa Waiver Program. That is our effort \nhere today, that they not abuse it and, by some ill fate, allow someone \nwho comes to this Nation to do us harm. Homeland security, protecting \nthe national security, is a layer that is constructive and \nconstitutional. This is constructive, and it is constitutional.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this has been a stressful year in our country and our \nworld with past senseless gun violence and terroristic acts against \nAmericans and citizens the world over.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 158--the Visa Waiver Program Improvement \nand Terrorist Travel Prevention Act'' because it facilitates a rigorous \nvetting of tourists seeking to enter into our country.\n  In addition to the steps laid out by the President, I also believe \nthere are additional steps the Congress should take, including bringing \nto the floor for debate and vote H.R. 48, the ``No Fly for Foreign \nFighters Act,'' that I introduced earlier this year.\n  My legislation would require the TSA to check the Terrorist Screening \nDatabase and the terrorist watch list used in determining whether to \npermit a passenger to board a U.S.-bound or domestic flight and to take \nappropriate steps to ensure that those who pose a threat to aviation \nsafety or national security are included in the Terrorism Database.\n  From San Bernardino to Paris, to Nigeria, to Mali, to Beirut, the \ncarnage of violence has been perpetrated on the human family by those \nwho should never be in possession of violent weapons or power.\n  But we cannot allow these atrocities to dissuade us from interacting \nwith and welcoming those interested in traveling to and learning more \nabout our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a Member of Congress and senior member on the \nhomeland security and ranking member on the Judiciary subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism and Homeland, my top priority is the safety of the \nAmerican people.\n  In times of conflict and stress and trauma, our natural inclination \nis to point fingers and seek to cast blame as we have seen Mr. Donald \nTrump do.\n  But we all know that deep down, this does us no good and that it runs \nafoul of our American ideals.\n  What we must do is focus our efforts on the most likely security \nthreats to our homeland and not scapegoat the thoroughly screened \nindividuals who seek to come to the U.S. through the Waiver Program.\n  We cannot throw a net of suspicion over an entire nation, even as the \nUnited States accepts more refugees--including Syrians.\n  Our system facilitates the most rigorous screening and security \nvetting of ANY category of traveler or immigrant to the United States \nbefore the refugee sets foot on U.S. soil.\n  Indeed, the Republican bill, H.R. 4038, that passed the House in \nNovember would immediately shut down refugee resettlement from the \nSyria and Iraq region and severely handicap refugee resettlement in the \nfuture.\n  To date, there is no reliable evidence that the individuals who \ncommitted the heinous attacks in Paris on November 13th were refugees.\n  Currently, the Visa Waiver Program allows citizens from 38 countries \nfrom around the world, including the United Kingdom, France, Belgium \nand Japan, to enter the United States without a visa.\n  One of the main intents of the Visa Waiver Program is to stimulate \nthe U.S.' economy by encouraging tourism, cultural exchange, business, \nand job growth between the United States and our international \npartners.\n  The travel industry estimates that the VWP contributed $190 billion \nto our economy in 2014.\n  It should be noted that Visa waiver travelers cannot simply grab \ntheir passports and hop on the next flight to the United States.\n  Rather, under current law, citizens from participating Visa Waiver \nProgram countries are required to complete a U.S government online \nsecurity screening form prior to their admission to the United States.\n  These participants also undergo an additional level of screening at \nthe port of entry by a Customs and Border Patrol official.\n  This bipartisan bill provides for specific, concrete changes that \nwill ensure better information-sharing among intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies.\n  The Program requires screening of all travelers against INTERPOL \ndatabases to identify high-risk travelers.\n  The Program makes it challenging for extremists to falsify their \nidentities by requiring fraud-resistant e-passports that contain \nbiometric information.\n  The Program compels U.S. security agencies to conduct more frequent \nthreat assessments of VWP countries.\n  The bill also requires nationals of Iraq, Syria, and other designated \ncountries, or those who have visited such countries, to have an in-\nperson interview with a U.S. Department of State Consular official and \nundergo more lengthy screenings prior to travel to the United States.\n  This bill employs intelligent measures to enhance the security of the \nAmerican people by improving information sharing between VWP country \npartners and the United States, including a requirement that WP \ncountries report theft/loss of their citizens' passports to the United \nStates within 24 hrs.\n  This bill is a more appropriate response than the Republican drafted \nthe ``American SAFE Act of 2015.''\n  It deserves a vote in the House.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank my colleague from Virginia for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this important legislation \nby the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller).\n  To defeat ISIS, it is going to take strong leadership, and it is \ngoing to take a strong strategy. I think it is clear that the \nPresident's approach isn't working. In fact, our intelligence officials \ntell us that ISIS is not only not being contained, but now we are \nseeing that they are coming to America, that they are attacking \nAmerica, and that has been their stated goal. It is incumbent upon us \nto do everything we can. Frankly, the American people deserve to know \nthat their government is doing everything in its power to protect them \nfrom the threat of terrorists. These are very real threats.\n  In the House, we have been taking decisive action. We have already \npassed a bill to address the problems of the lack of vetting in the \nrefugee program, a program that ISIS, itself, has said it plans to \nexploit in order to bring terrorists into America. The FBI Director has \neven confirmed those concerns that we have expressed, and we have \npassed legislation to address that.\n  Today, Mr. Speaker, we are bringing forth strong, bipartisan \nlegislation to reform the troubled Visa Waiver Program. We have seen \nthat thousands of people with Western passports, including from the \nVisa Waiver Program nations, have been going to some of the troubled \nregions, like Syria, like Iraq, like other countries. There ought to be \na higher level of scrutiny. This bill requires the Department of \nHomeland Security to work with those nations in order to have a higher \nlevel of scrutiny so as to ultimately lead to a more secure United \nStates of America.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to pass this legislation. Let's \ncontinue to do what we need to do in the House of Representatives to \nprotect the American people from the real threat that ISIS poses.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Thompson), the ranking member of the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. I thank the gentlewoman from California \nfor yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 158, the Visa Waiver \nProgram Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\n  This bipartisan legislation will help better secure the Visa Waiver \nProgram, which facilitates travel to the U.S. for 20 million visitors \nfrom 38 participating countries for both business and pleasure.\n  While the program provides important security benefits through \ninformation-sharing agreements between participating countries and \nsignificant\n\n[[Page H9056]]\n\neconomic benefits from tourism, the potential security vulnerabilities \nof this program have been a concern.\n  I was a primary author of provisions in the Implementing \nRecommendations of the 9/11 Commission Act of 2007, which bolstered the \nsecurity of the Visa Waiver Program by requiring an Electronic System \nfor Travel Authorization, called ESTA. Through the ESTA program, Visa \nWaiver travelers are vetted prior to their departure to the U.S.\n  I applaud the Department of Homeland Security for its recent efforts \nto make further enhancements to the ESTA program. These improvements \nwill better secure the Visa Waiver Program, but Congress needs to do \nits part. That is why I am pleased to support H.R. 158. The bill was \nreported unanimously by voice vote from the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity earlier this year, and additional security-related provisions \nwere added on a bipartisan basis in recent days.\n  H.R. 158 would strengthen passport requirements for Visa Waiver \ntravelers and require Visa Waiver participants to report lost or stolen \npassports within 24 hours. Enhanced information-sharing requirements \nwould also be in place for Visa Waiver countries. In addition to that, \nit would mandate that Visa Waiver countries screen arriving and \ndeparting noncitizens against INTERPOL databases. Mr. Speaker, this is \na good bill. Its time has come.\n  I thank Mrs. Miller of Michigan for her diligence in bringing it \nbefore our committee, and I thank Ms. Lofgren for her work in this \neffort. I look forward to the passage of this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, we all know that ISIS is not \ncontained. ISIS, in fact, is expanding its reign of terror. Its \nfighters hold passports from different countries around the world. We \nknow they are embedded in Western countries, are able to travel freely, \nand are hard to track down--and they want to do us harm.\n  Under the current Visa Waiver Program, individuals from 38 countries \nare exempt from the standard vetting process to get a visa and come to \nAmerica. Hold a passport from one of these 38 countries, and you can \njust jump on a plane and come here. Those 38 countries are supposed to \nshare their watch lists with us, but some of them don't. That makes it \neasier for the bad guys to fly to America.\n  So this bill fixes that real loophole in the current system. Those 38 \ncountries will now be required to share their watch lists with us. If \nthey don't, they are prohibited from being in the Visa Waiver Program. \nForeign citizens who have recently traveled to Iraq and Syria will also \nbe required to go through additional screening.\n  Mr. Speaker, terrorist fighters have America in their hateful, evil \nsights. We must do all we can to stop them from coming here, and the \nstatus quo just won't keep us safe. As chairman of the Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, I totally support this commonsense legislation.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMaryland (Mr. Hoyer), our whip.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Bennie Thompson, Ms. Lofgren, who \nworked very hard on this, and Democrats on the Homeland Security \nCommittee and on the immigration policy and enforcement Judiciary \nsubcommittee for their hard work to ensure that this bill will protect \nAmericans from the threat of terror while we remain true to our highest \nprinciples and ideals.\n  House Democrats and House Republicans have no greater priority than \nkeeping Americans safe. That is neither a partisan issue nor is it a \npartisan difference.\n  Many Americans are frustrated with the pace of progress against ISIS \nin Iraq and Syria. I want to see the administration and Congress \nworking together to protect our Nation. The reforms in this bill are an \nexcellent start. What we have before us today, Mr. Speaker, is an \nexample of what we can achieve when both sides work together to craft \nresponsible reforms in a spirit of unity and common purpose, which is: \nin the face of the threats we challenge, we ought to summons.\n  I want to thank the majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, for working with \nme and our side of the aisle, and I want to thank those on the \nRepublican side of the aisle for working together to get this bill \ndone.\n  The Visa Waiver Program has long been a tool to promote business ties \nand tourism, both of which are vital to our economy. We cannot--nor \nshould we--simply shut our doors to the world if we want to continue to \nlead the world. This legislation will make it easier for law \nenforcement to vet those visitors who are coming from Visa Waiver \ncountries, such as in Europe, to ensure that we are not admitting those \nwho have traveled to places like Iraq and Syria and link up with ISIS.\n  This is now the third major bipartisan piece of legislation to come \nto the floor in the past 2 weeks after the highway bill, which included \na provision to reopen the Export-Import Bank, and the Elementary and \nSecondary Education Reauthorization Act. I hope--and I think the \nAmerican people would expect--again, in light of the challenges that \nconfront us, that we can build on this progress and complete a \nbipartisan agreement to keep government open before the week is done.\n  I want to thank, once more, Ranking Member Zoe Lofgren, who knows so \nmuch about this issue and who has been so faithful in her attention to \nboth our values and the protection of the American people. I thank \nBennie Thompson as well, the ranking member of the Homeland Security \nCommittee, on our side of the aisle. I also want to thank the chairman \nof the Judiciary Committee for his leadership on this issue as well as \nall of those who have worked on a number of issues.\n  This will not be the last word, but it is a good word, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNew Jersey (Mr. Lance).\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of the Visa \nWaiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act, which \nwill strengthen the Visa Waiver Program in order to help prevent \nforeign terrorists from entering the United States.\n  This legislation comes at a critical time. The heinous acts of terror \nand mass murder perpetrated in Paris and San Bernardino demonstrate the \nalarming strength and reach of ISIS and its allies.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  This threat is certainly not contained, and our fight against radical \njihadists at home and abroad must be the Nation's most pressing issue.\n  Passing H.R. 158 will close a dangerous loophole that we know \nterrorists will exploit to carry out acts of terror here in the United \nStates. Terrorists such as the September the 11th so-called 20th \nhijacker, Zacarias Moussaoui, and the shoe bomber, Richard Reid, both \nused a Visa Waiver Program to enter the United States.\n  We must be ever vigilant in the face of these great threats. I urge a \n``yes'' vote on H.R. 158.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member of the Intelligence \nCommittee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 158, the Visa \nWaiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act.\n  The Visa Waiver Program is overall an excellent program that \nfacilitates the travel of more than 20 million people to the United \nStates each year, travelers who encourage cultural exchange and \ncontribute significantly to our economy through tourism and job growth.\n  The overwhelming majority of travelers who utilize the program are \nnot a threat in any way. However, even a small number of individuals \ncan do us grave harm. Among those of greatest concern are European \ncitizens who return to countries like France and Belgium after \ntraveling to Iraq and Syria to train with terror forces.\n  It is incumbent upon us to take every precaution to ensure these \nindividuals cannot exploit the Visa Waiver Program to enter the United \nStates.\n\n[[Page H9057]]\n\n  The reforms we are voting on today are reasonable, and they are \nappropriately targeted improvements to this important program. \nSpecifically, they will require that nationals of Iraq and Syria as \nwell as other designated countries and those who have traveled to these \ncountries since 2011 undergo an in-person interview with a U.S. \nofficial and more rigorous security screening processes prior to \ntraveling to the United States. It will also require DHS to strengthen \nits background check procedures and ensure improved information sharing \namong intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n  In the wake of the recent terror attacks, we must continue to review \nour existing security efforts to ensure we are doing all we can to \nprotect the country. Rather than focus on the refugee resettlement \nprogram, which is the most heavily screened and lengthy process to \nenter the United States, Congress should focus our energy on closing \nknown vulnerabilities that could allow those who mean us harm to enter \nthe United States quickly and with little scrutiny. This bill does just \nthat.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIowa (Mr. King), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for working \ntogether with others to bring this bill forward.\n  I rise in full support of H.R. 158, which is the Visa Waiver Program \nImprovement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\n  We all know that it takes a lot of pieces of legislation to fill some \nof the holes that exist, but I am pleased that this bipartisan effort \nhas come to the floor of the House of Representatives, Mr. Speaker.\n  I will say that, as I look at the language that is in here and the \npieces of it, to recognize that as the tighter scrutiny to the Visa \nWaiver Program, which I have had some concern about over the years, 38 \ncountries enjoy the relationship with the United States of a Visa \nWaiver Program.\n  The way it functions is, if an individual of one of the participating \ncountries has a valid passport from their own country and they sit down \nin front of the Internet, they can input that information and \nessentially clear themselves to be able to travel to the United States \nwithout further bureaucracy.\n  That is a good thing on balance, but a bad thing when we have people \nthat have dual nationalities or people who give indicators, such as \nhaving traveled back and forth to some of the countries that we have \nconcerns about as being those countries where terrorists are, let's \nsay, radicalized or sponsored.\n  I am a little concerned that our list isn't a little longer than \nthis. The countries that are covered with this bill are Iraq, Syria, \nand, by definition, Sudan and Iran. I am hopeful that the Secretary of \nHomeland Security will take a look at some other countries to tighten \nthis up a little bit more.\n  I just returned from that part of the world, Mr. Speaker, probably \nabout a month ago, perhaps a little less. I traveled into Turkey, into \nIraq, into the Kurdish region, Erbil, and then west as far as I could \ngo up towards the ISIS lines.\n  I visited a refugee camp there and then back into Turkey, up to \nHungary, down to Serbia, into Croatia, back out of there again, and \nthen determined to skip Germany and Austria this time, but traveled up \nto Sweden to look at the other end of this.\n  There I sat with a briefing of our State Department. Some of that in \nthat room is confidential, but we are working with these countries to \ntighten up our security. We are offering the expertise that we have \ndeveloped here because we deal with a lot more people and a lot more \ntravel than they do. I am hopeful that we will be able to share more of \nour intelligence also with the countries that are participating in a \nVisa Waiver Program.\n  This will help tighten it up. Mr. Speaker, it will identify those who \nhave traveled to some of these terrorist-sponsoring countries, and it \nwill also require that they exchange information with us so that we can \nmonitor them more closely.\n  If someone travels and essentially lies about their travel--if they \nhave, say, traveled to Iran, traveled to Iraq, maybe Sudan or Syria, \nand they apply for a visa waiver--we will either have a software \nprogram that will kick that out because it shows up on their passport \nor we will catch up with that and cancel their visa waiver. In any \ncase, it is heightened scrutiny and heightened security for us. We need \nto do a lot of things to tighten this up, and this is one.\n  It is one also that respects our relationship with the visa waiver \ncountries, those 38. It is prudent. It is careful. It puts authority \ninto the hands of the Secretary of Homeland Security. It is the right \nbill. It is bipartisan. I urge its adoption.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to my good friend from \nMinnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I do support the fact that we are looking \nat the Visa Waiver Program. However, after scrutinizing this bill, I \nthink that it is not the right bill and I don't plan on supporting it.\n  It is not that I can't support any part of it. There are key things \nthat I cannot abide, but I urge the parties to keep on working on it \nbecause I think the effort is proper.\n  Here is what I think is specifically wrong with this. If it were to \nchange, I might reconsider my position. The categorical stripping of \nthe Visa Waiver Program privileges from all Iraqi and Syrian nationals \nI think is problematic. I think it is overbroad. I don't think it is \nnecessary.\n\n  Number two, I think there should be exemptions for people who do \nclearly recognized legitimate work, such as journalists, researchers, \nhuman rights investigators, and other such professionals.\n  Number three, I think the 5-year sunset is too long. I think it \nshould be shorter. I do think 3 years would work just fine.\n  I just want to say that the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and \nTerrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 does contain, as we stand here, \ndiscriminatory elements, which I don't believe will effectively stop \nterrorism. In fact, I think it sends a wrong message to dual nationals \nand Iraqi and Syrian tourists.\n  This bill bars people who are dual nationals from Syria, Iraq, Iran, \nand Sudan from participating in the Visa Waiver Program even if there \nis no evidence that they are a security risk. I think our focus should \nbe on behavior, not just country of origin.\n  This bill would also end visa waiver eligibility for people who \ntraveled to Iraq or Syria in the last 5 years. For example, this bill \nwould make an elderly French citizen who is a dual national of Syria go \nthrough an often lengthy visa approval process simply because she \nwanted to travel to the U.S. to attend a wedding or a birthday or \nsomething. What does this provision mean for a Swiss doctor who \ntraveled to Iraq to work in a refugee camp providing medical care, but \nwants to come to the U.S. for a conference or something like that?\n  While this bill does not restrict entry to the U.S., it creates \nadditional barriers. It should be worked on a little more to fix these \nproblems. I do thank the parties for working in a bipartisan way to \nbring greater safety to our country.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. McSally), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Emergency \nPreparedness, Response, and Communications of the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairwoman Miller for this \nthoughtful legislation. I rise today in support of H.R. 159.\n  I was a proud member of the Committee on Homeland Security's task \nforce on combatting terrorists and foreign fighter travel. The task \nforce bipartisan report, which was a culmination of 6 months of \ninvestigative activities, contained many troubling findings related to \nthe ease with which foreign fighters from Visa Waiver Program-\nparticipating countries could seek entry into the United States.\n  Of the estimated 30,000 foreign fighters that we are aware of, at \nleast 4,500 hold western passports. This is made even more alarming by \nthe fact that 30 of the 38 Visa Waiver Programs are in Europe.\n  I am pleased that this legislation that we are considering today \ntakes\n\n[[Page H9058]]\n\nsteps to address many of the task force's findings related to this \nprogram. The bill prohibits individuals that travel to Iraq and Syria \nfrom using the program. It requires termination of a participating \ncountry for failing to screen against INTERPOL's criminal and terrorism \ndatabases. It authorizes the Secretary of Homeland Security to suspend \nparticipating countries when it is determined that they pose a high \nrisk to the national security of the United States.\n  ISIS has better resources and is more brutal and more organized than \nany terrorist organization to date. We must use all the tools at our \ndisposal to defeat them. I am particularly pleased that this bill \nrecognizes the need to continually update and secure the Electronic \nSystem for Travel Authorization, or ESTA, a key task force \nrecommendation.\n  As part of this effort, we must leverage new and innovative \ntechnologies. The bill requires the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nexplore opportunities to incorporate technology into ESTA that will \ndetect deception and fraud.\n  A number of promising deception detection technologies have been \ndeveloped, including one developed at the University of Arizona in my \ndistrict. Deception can be difficult to detect when you are \ninterviewing an individual face to face. It is even more difficult to \ndetect the deception in online forums like ESTA uses.\n  The technology developed at the University of Arizona called Neuro-\nScreen identifies typing, scrawling, and other computer-use patterns to \ncapture motor nervous system signals associated with deceptive and \nsuspicious behavior. We must leverage technology, such as Neuro-Screen, \nto enhance screening programs like ESTA.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all want to ensure that people from around the world \ncan travel here to experience all the wonders and the freedoms of the \nUnited States. As we welcome travelers here, we must do so in a way \nthat keeps us safe.\n  That is why I support H.R. 1158. I urge all our Members to support \nthis thoughtful bipartisan legislation.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Nevada (Ms. Titus).\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, as the Representative from Las Vegas, one of \nthe world's greatest tourist and business travel destinations, I, too, \nrise in favor of H.R. 158.\n  This bill strengthens the Visa Waiver Program to help ensure that \npotential terrorists are not able to abuse it to bypass security checks \nand come to the U.S. to do us harm.\n  We must remain cognizant, however, of the fact that the VWP program \nis not only a significant aspect of our Homeland Security, but it is \nalso critical to expediting and welcoming tourists and business \ntravelers to the United States.\n  In 2014, more than 20.4 million visitors arrived in the U.S. through \nthe VWP, representing almost 60 percent of all overseas visitors. These \ntravelers stayed an average of 18 nights and spent $4,400 per visit, \ngenerating $190 billion, which supported nearly 1 million jobs. In Las \nVegas, 20 percent of our visitors come from foreign countries, many of \nwhom use this program.\n  So, in short, yes, we must be cautious. We cannot afford to \nunnecessarily crush the growing tourism industry or risk retaliatory \nmeasures by other countries, which would make it difficult for \nAmericans to travel abroad for business or a holiday.\n  I believe H.R. 158 strikes the right balance between security and \naccommodation. I urge my colleagues to support it. I also caution \nagainst carrying xenophobia too far.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE: Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Royce), the chairman of the Foreign Relations \nCommittee.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I am recently back from London, where I had \nan opportunity to speak to British authorities about the challenge that \nEuropeans find themselves in at this point in time. There are literally \n5,000 Europeans who have gone to fight in Syria and in Iraq and have \ncome back. Part of the problem here is a manpower problem of managing \nto be able to have a handle on that.\n  Now, we cannot have people automatically coming to the United States \nwithout being vetted. They should not be allowed to just get on a plane \nand fly here. This bill is going to bolster our defenses because what \nit is going to do is to ensure that those who have traveled to a terror \nhotspot, like Syria, and then come back into Europe or another Visa \nWaiver country will get that thorough investigation before they are \nbeing cleared to travel. That will allow our authorities to prevent \nthat travel.\n  It is going to give our law enforcement a new tool as well in terms \nof detecting fraud and stolen passports. You also saw the story in \nHonduras of five Syrians with stolen passports trying to get into the \nUnited States.\n  So the Visa Waiver Program is good for America's economy and good for \nour leadership overseas. We can strengthen it. Let's urge our \ncolleagues in the Senate to get this soon to the President's desk.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California has 6\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Quigley), a former member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, the Visa Waiver Program plays an absolutely \nessential role in growing the American economy. If we don't have \nforeign travel, it is just going to be Michigan competing against \nWisconsin, Las Vegas competing against Orlando; and while Chicago has \nno peer, we are really not being productive. Also, over the last \ndecade, we have successfully used the incentives of this program to \nrequire participating countries to implement the strictest security \nstandards and increase vital intelligence sharing with U.S. law \nenforcement.\n  As a member of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \nI can't stress enough the value of intelligence we gather from the 38 \nVisa Waiver countries in thwarting terror plots and preventing attacks \non our homeland. That is why I have been a longtime supporter of the \nVisa Waiver Program and for including important allies like Poland. But \nI have also led the effort to strengthen the security requirements of \nthe program to respond to the evolving threats we face.\n  The bipartisan JOLT Act, sponsored by myself and Mr. Heck, includes \nmany of the security programs and reforms included in this bill we are \ndebating today. It will also strengthen the security of the program and \nreduce fraud and also provide the U.S. with greater intelligence \ncapacity.\n  As policymakers, we must continuously reevaluate the reforms that are \nnecessary to respond to keep America safe. The bill before us provides \nthat proper balance by making the Visa Waiver Program even more secure \nand reaffirming our commitment to the program for the future.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Katko), the chairman of our Foreign Fighter Task Force.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 158, the Visa \nWaiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015.\n  This bill, which I cosponsored, will close a critical gap in our \nNation's security that is vulnerable to exploitation by terrorists and \nother nefarious actors seeking to do us harm. This bill strengthens the \nsecurity of the Visa Waiver Program by requiring participating nations \nto increase counterterrorism information sharing, screen travelers \nagainst INTERPOL's databases, and enhance passport security features.\n  As chair of the Committee on Homeland Security's Foreign Fighter Task \nForce, I spent countless hours with my colleagues examining weaknesses \nin our Nation's defenses against the threat posed by foreign fighters. \nThe provisions in this bill address several of the key findings in that \nreport. I thank Mrs. Miller for her leadership on this important issue.\n  I also want to thank and note the continuing bipartisan cooperation \nthat is part of the Committee on Homeland Security. I commend my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle for their continuing good \nwork on that committee.\n  In closing, I would like to urge my colleagues to support this \nimportant legislation.\n\n[[Page H9059]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, there are some 6 billion people in the \nworld who aren't from one of the 38 favored countries and have to go \nthrough an in-person interview to visit the United States. It is not \nunfair for us to impose the same requirement on those Europeans who \nhave visited ISIS-infested areas.\n  This bill will do some good, but it is mostly evadable. Most ISIS \nforeign fighters go to Turkey. Their passport is stamped in Turkey, and \nthen they walk into Syria. ISIS does not stamp their passport, and so \nthey are free to say that they never went to Iraq or Syria. This bill \nwill make sense only if it applies to those who visited Turkey.\n  Even if they did get their passport stamped, say they flew to \nBaghdad, got it stamped by the Iraqi Government, all they have to do is \ngo back to Europe and say, ``I want a new passport. My hair style has \nchanged, I want a different picture.'' They get a new passport. Their \nold passport, holes are punched in it. It is returned to them, and so \nthere is no record that they ever visited Iraq.\n  Most of our European friends don't have a list of which of their \ncitizens have visited Syria, Iraq, or Iran. If they did have such a \nlist, they wouldn't share it with us because they have privacy laws. \nNow, they will cooperate with us on individual suspects, but not a list \nof tens of thousands of people who have visited Iraq, Syria, or Iran, \nand certainly not the millions who have visited Turkey. So they don't \nhave a list. They won't share a list.\n  Looking at a passport only tells you that somebody got a new \npassport. Seeing that it was stamped only in Turkey but not stamped in \nSyria just shows you that they walked into Syria and ISIS didn't stamp \ntheir passport.\n  I look forward to passing this bill, and then getting serious on a \nbill that will accomplish its purposes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 158. In order \nto protect our national security and the safety of Americans, we must \nalso adapt our policies to prevent terrorists from entering U.S. soil.\n  As we have heard earlier, approximately 5,000 Europeans have traveled \nto Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, many of whom are from countries that \nparticipate in the Visa Waiver Program. Many of these countries fail to \nprovide the U.S. intelligence community with critical information \nneeded to ensure those traveling under the program are not a threat to \nthe U.S. Today's legislation addresses and helps fix the \nvulnerabilities of this program.\n  Before an individual is permitted to enter the United States, \nadditional vetting is required. This includes enhanced screening of \nindividuals who have visited or are citizens of Iraq, Syria, and \nterrorist hotspots like Iran and Sudan, or other nations that have seen \na rise in significant terrorist activities.\n  It strengthens intelligence and information sharing with our allies. \nIt cracks down on passport fraud by requiring Visa Waiver countries to \nupgrade to biometrics and electronic passports and forces Visa Waiver \ncountries to ramp up counterterrorism screenings of travelers.\n  As our enemies continue to evolve, we must do the same to protect the \nAmerican people from the risks posed by this threat. I thank \nCongresswoman Miller for her hard work on this important piece of \nlegislation.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairwoman Miller for introducing \nthis legislation to address the serious security gaps in the Visa \nWaiver Program, and I thank Congresswoman Lofgren for putting our \ncountry's security over partisanship to advance this commonsense \nmeasure.\n  I am a cosponsor of this legislation because it makes sensible, \nbipartisan changes to address the security gaps in the Visa Waiver \nProgram and prevent Islamic State and other terrorist networks from \nusing the program to gain access to the United States.\n  The Islamic State is one of the world's most violent and dangerous \nterrorist groups. To keep our country safe, we must be one step ahead \nof them, preventing them from entering the United States and stopping \ntheir efforts.\n  The Visa Waiver Program allows travelers from approved countries to \nvisit the United States for up to 90 days without a visa. This program \nis an important tool that grows our economy and supports ease of travel \nfor American citizens.\n  The reasonable changes included in this bill strengthen the Visa \nWaiver Program. This bill requires partner nations to issue electronic \npassports, strengthening the screening process of program participants.\n  It also addresses the concerns raised by my bill, H.R. 4122, \nintroduced with Congressman Matt Salmon, to suspend the Visa Waiver \nProgram for individuals who have traveled in the last 5 years to Syria \nand Iraq, to countries that are state sponsors of terrorism, or to \ncountries with active terrorist networks. I thank Chairman Miller for \nincluding this important provision. I thank Congresswomen Miller and \nLofgren for advancing this important legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining \non each side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Virginia has 5\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentlewoman from California has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, this legislation is a step \nin the right direction. The changes that I like particularly to the \nVisa Waiver Program are a requirement to share counterterrorism \ninformation with the United States and that all visa waiver countries \nmust submit lost and stolen passport information to INTERPOL's database \nwithin 24 hours.\n  In May of 2014, a foreign fighter, radicalized on the battlefield in \nSyria after 1 year, traveled back to Europe. He traveled through Turkey \nand through Germany. It is believed that Germany had information on \nthis individual, but it failed to share that information with its \nneighbors France and Belgium. He arrived in Brussels. In a 90-second \nattack with an automatic weapon on a Jewish museum, he killed 4 people \nbefore fleeing to France, making it all the way to the south of France, \nto the city of Marseille, where he hoped to cross the Mediterranean and \ndisappear into the African continent.\n  Why do I tell you this story? It is because of the freedom of travel \nin the Schengen region, or the open borders region in Europe, the \nradicalization of foreign fighters joining ISIS on the battlefield and \nhaving the ability to travel back to Europe and possibly, being \nundetected, travel to the United States under the Visa Waiver Program \nif the countries don't share the information.\n  In addition, in the last 30 days, we have seen numerous instances \nwhere stolen or fraudulent passports have been used by migrants and \nterrorists to travel throughout Europe as well as across Latin America.\n  Just recently, five Syrians traveled through the tri-border region, \nwhich is Argentina, Brazil, and Paraguay. It is a region in the \nnorthern area of Argentina. They traveled there from Syria on stolen \nIsraeli passports, and then they purchased, in the tri-border region, \nGreek passports and were able to transit Latin America into Honduras, \nwhere they were stopped with those false passports.\n  These are real examples of real issues, and it is why I support what \nwe are trying to do today.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire if the gentleman has \nadditional speakers.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I am the only remaining speaker.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Then I will close on our side.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  A lot of things have been said today that will be very helpful, but I \nthink clarifying some of these issues might be useful for Members.\n  It has been said that there is discrimination in this bill. It is \nimportant to note that the Visa Waiver Program discriminates on the \nbasis of nationality. That is why there is only one country, Chile, in \nLatin America that is in the Visa Waiver Program. Everybody else has to \ngo in for a visa interview.\n\n[[Page H9060]]\n\n  There are no countries in Africa that are eligible for the Visa \nWaiver Program. Everybody in Africa has to go in for an interview to \nget a visitor's visa.\n  There are only four sites--Singapore, Taiwan, Japan, and South \nKorea--in Asia that are eligible. Everybody else has to go in for a \nvisa interview.\n  So a visa interview is not a terrible thing. It helps us understand \nwhat people are about.\n  I include for the Record a letter from the U.S. Travel Association in \nfavor of this bill. It is signed by a large number of groups, including \nthe Asian American Hotel Owners Association and The Travel Technology \nAssociation.\n\n                                      U.S. Travel Association,\n\n                                 Washington, DC, December 8, 2015.\n       Dear Members of the House of Representatives: On behalf of \n     the 14.6 million American workers whose livelihood depends on \n     safe international travel to the United States, we are \n     writing in support of H.R. 158, legislation to strengthen \n     homeland security in the wake of the recent terrorist \n     attacks.\n       The horrific attacks in Paris underscore the need for every \n     possible measure to protect public safety. And no one \n     advocates for security precautions more vigorously than \n     travel professionals. Without public confidence in air \n     security, worldwide commerce will be crippled. The Visa \n     Waiver Program (VWP), originally created to facilitate \n     travel, today is one of our most effective tools against \n     global terror. Because of VWP, governments around the world \n     now are working cooperatively at the highest levels of law \n     enforcement to identify risky travelers--both before boarding \n     flights and upon arrival in the United States.\n       For the 38 countries that are currently VWP members, the \n     U.S. has unparalleled authority to inspect their counter-\n     terrorism, border control, aviation and travel document \n     security methods and facilities. VWP protocols require \n     participating nations to issue machine-readable passports \n     that are difficult to forge; promptly enter data on all lost \n     and stolen passports into a central INTERPOL database; and \n     collaborate with the United States law enforcement under \n     essential information-sharing agreements. Since this system \n     was established in 2008, we have denied entry to over 4,300 \n     would-be travelers known or suspected of posing a threat. For \n     the many nations that hope to someday become a VWP member, \n     just that aspiration offers a strong incentive to raise \n     security standards unilaterally, even in advance of their \n     admission. The VWP is a rare, exemplary government program \n     that delivers both security and economic benefits.\n       Even successful programs such as VWP can be improved. In \n     our view, the battery of reforms proposed in H.R. 158 will \n     help make us all safer. We support its provisions to add \n     additional layers of protection, including by increasing \n     preclearance and immigration advisory programs, working with \n     other governments to strengthen their watch lists and vetting \n     systems; and expanding Global Entry to enroll more rigorously \n     screened, trusted travelers. These are thoughtful, effective \n     reforms--and we especially commend bipartisan House leaders \n     for working together toward enacting H.R. 158. As this bill \n     makes its way through the legislative process, we will \n     continue to work constructively with its sponsors.\n       This is a moment when the United States and our allies can \n     send a global message about the seriousness of our air \n     security protocols and our capacity for bipartisan consensus \n     on matters of national security. Thank you in advance and \n     please call on us if we can serve as a resource for your \n     deliberations.\n           Sincerely,\n       U.S. Travel Association,\n       Airlines for America,\n       American Gaming Association,\n       American Hotel & Lodging Association,\n       American Resort Development Association,\n       American Society of Travel Agents,\n       Asian American Hotel Owners Association,\n       Atlanta Convention & Visitors Bureau,\n       Dallas Convention & Visitors Bureau,\n       Destination DC,\n       Destination Marketing Association International,\n       Expedia, Inc.,\n       Hilton Worldwide,\n       International Association of Amusement Parks and \n     Attractions,\n       Los Angeles Tourism & Convention Board,\n       Las Vegas Convention & Visitors Authority,\n       Loews Hotels and Resorts,\n       Marriott International, Inc.,\n       National Retail Federation,\n       National Tour Association,\n       PSAV ,\n       Sabre Corporation,\n       The San Diego Tourism Authority,\n       Starwood Hotels and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.,\n       The Travel Technology Association,\n       U.S. Tour Operators Association.\n\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Why? Because it is important for our country that this \nprogram, this Visa Waiver Program, be tightened up, that we are assured \nthat it is being operated in a safe and secure manner.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  I am happy that we can work together on a bipartisan basis to do \nthis, because we are at a time in our country when reckless and racist \nthings are being said about some of our fellow Americans--people who \nare saying that if you are of the Muslim faith, somehow you are a \nthreat to the United States. That is not true. And it is important for \nus to stand up against that rhetoric, to stand up for all Americans and \npeople of all faiths, but also to work together on sensible, modest \nreforms to the VW Program.\n  I am glad that we will, hopefully, stand together in the face of \noutrageous racist rhetoric and that we will also stand together \nsupporting this modest reform to the program.\n  I would note also the suggestion that the bill does not solve all the \nproblems. As I said in my opening statement, the most important part of \nthis program is the database provisions. If countries do not want to \nshare their data, they can't be in the Visa Waiver Program. I think \nthat, as we move forward, more and more countries will understand we \nneed to collaborate together, and I urge support for the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a good bill. I want to thank everybody on both \nsides of the aisle who have worked together to bring us to the point \nwhere we can pass this bill through the House. I hope it is taken up \nand passed in the Senate. I hope it is signed into law soon.\n  It will do some good in stopping people who have ill intent from \nbeing able to abuse our immigration system and enter our country. But \nthis bill is just one of many, many things with regard to our \nimmigration system that need to be examined. Other legislation that has \nalready passed out of the Homeland Security Committee and the Judiciary \nCommittee needs to be brought to the floor of the House for \nconsideration.\n  We also need to examine our visa programs and the interview process, \nwhich may be called into question following the tragedy in San \nBernardino. We also need to make sure that our borders--particularly \nour southern border, but all of our borders--are secure. People are \ncrossing into our country undetected, and they are not just from South \nAmerican and Central American countries. They are from all over the \nworld, including from the country that we have been talking about here \ntoday.\n  We need to make sure that our asylum program is not as rampant with \nfraud as it is today. We need to pass legislation introduced by \nCongressman Chaffetz of Utah that addresses that problem.\n  We need to make sure that when people cross into our country \nillegally, no matter where they are from, they are apprehended and that \nthey are not released into the interior of the country with the hope \nthat they will someday reappear for a hearing. Congressman John Carter \nhas legislation that addresses that problem.\n  We need to make sure that when people enter the United States, for \nwhatever purpose, they do so lawfully, and they not take jobs away from \nlaw-abiding American citizens. We need to make sure that our electronic \nverification of employment program is made mandatory, as legislation \nintroduced and passed out of the committee, introduced by Congressman \nLamar Smith, would do.\n  We need to make sure that we are utilizing all of our law enforcement \nresources across our entire Nation to keep this country safe, including \nbetter cooperation between the Federal Government and our State and \nlocal governments on law enforcement issues and on immigration \nenforcement issues. I hear from judges and sheriffs and other law \nenforcement officials in my district about the messed up way that our \ncurrent program is working. We need to have a clear, statutory role for \nState and local governments to participate in the enforcement of these \nlaws.\n  All of these things need to be brought to the floor of this House to \nmake sure that our immigration programs are working properly, are \nworking fairly, and are making this country safer than it is today. I \nurge my colleagues to support this legislation, which is a very good \nstep in the right direction.\n  I commend the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. Miller), who is leaving\n\n[[Page H9061]]\n\nat the end of this Congress. This is a good note to end this debate \nupon. I thank her for her good work in making sure that we are keeping \nthis country safe by improving the Visa Waiver Program. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Phyllis Eason Galanti, a tireless advocate for the \n     rights of prisoners of war from the United States during the \n     Vietnam War and a beloved member of the Richmond, Virginia, \n     community, died on April 23, 2014.\n       (2) Ms. Eason graduated from the College of William and \n     Mary in 1963 and shortly afterward was married to Paul Edward \n     Galanti, a pilot with the United States Navy, at the Chapel \n     of the Centurion in Fort Monroe, Virginia.\n       (3) In June 1966, when Mr. Galanti was shot down over North \n     Vietnam, captured, and held prisoner, Phyllis E. Galanti \n     became active in the National League of Families of American \n     Prisoners and Missing in Southeast Asia, soon becoming chair \n     of the organization.\n       (4) Mrs. Galanti spearheaded the Let's Bring Paul Galanti \n     Home project as part of the national Write Hanoi campaign--\n       (A) to raise awareness;\n       (B) to secure the return of more than 600 soldiers from the \n     United States who were missing in action or held as prisoners \n     of war in Vietnam; and\n       (C) to ensure that prisoners of war were treated in \n     accordance with the Geneva Conventions.\n       (5) The efforts of Mrs. Galanti under the Let's Bring Paul \n     Galanti Home project, the most successful of many such \n     campaigns, resulted in more than 1,000,000 letters that were \n     personally delivered to the North Vietnamese embassy in \n     Stockholm, Sweden, in 1971.\n       (6) Mrs. Galanti became known as ``Fearless Phyllis'', \n     traveling to Versailles, France, seeking an audience with \n     North Vietnamese leaders, and giving hundreds of \n     presentations to policy leaders in the United States, \n     including President Richard Nixon, National Security Advisor \n     Henry Kissinger, and Virginia Governor Mills E. Godwin, Jr., \n     who said of her in 1975, ``One dedicated woman and a handful \n     of others had more influence on the communist world than \n     legions of armies and diplomats.''.\n       (7) After more than seven years apart, Mrs. Galanti was \n     reunited with her husband Paul Galanti at the Naval Air \n     Station in Norfolk, Virginia, on February 15, 1973.\n       (8) Mrs. Galanti spent decades confronting the issue of \n     prisoners and hostages from the United States, not only in \n     Vietnam but also in the Soviet Union and Iran.\n       (9) Mrs. Galanti actively supported the Virginia Home, \n     Theatre IV, and the Virginia Repertory Theatre, visited \n     schools, and continued to meet with lawmakers until she died \n     on April 23, 2014, at age 73, from complications with \n     leukemia.\n       (10) The work of Mrs. Galanti earned her the American \n     Legion Service Medal, and the Paul and Phyllis Galanti \n     Education Center at the Virginia War Memorial was named in \n     honor of her and her husband.\n       (11) The leadership at the Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical \n     Center in Richmond, Virginia, including Director John \n     Brandecker, seeks to recognize Mrs. Galanti by naming the \n     arboretum at Hunter Holmes McGuire VA Medical Center in her \n     honor.\n       (12) It is a fitting tribute that Congress name the \n     arboretum after such an outstanding advocate for members of \n     the Armed Forces of the United States and veterans.\n\n     SEC. 2. PHYLLIS E. GALANTI ARBORETUM AT HUNTER HOLMES MCGUIRE \n                   VA MEDICAL CENTER IN RICHMOND, VIRGINIA.\n\n       (a) Designation.--The arboretum at the Hunter Holmes \n     McGuire VA Medical Center in Richmond, Virginia, shall after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act be known and designated \n     as the ``Phyllis E. Galanti Arboretum''.\n       (b) References.--Any reference in any law, regulation, map, \n     document, paper, or other record of the United States to the \n     arboretum referred to in subsection (a) shall be considered \n     to be a reference to the Phyllis E. Galanti Arboretum.\n\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, was read \nthe third time, and passed, and a motion to reconsider was laid on the \ntable.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9063-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9063]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

evaluations, ex-post evaluations, or other methods as \n     appropriate, that clearly define program logic, inputs, \n     outputs, intermediate outcomes, and end outcomes.\n       (D) Disseminate guidelines for the development and \n     implementation of monitoring and evaluation programs to all \n     personnel, especially in the field, who are responsible for \n     the design, implementation, and management of United States \n     foreign development and economic assistance programs.\n       (E) Establish methodologies for the collection of data, \n     including baseline data to serve\n\n[[Page H9064]]\n\n     as a reference point against which progress can be measured.\n       (F) Evaluate at least once in their lifetime all programs \n     whose dollar value equals or exceeds the median program size \n     for the relevant office or bureau or an equivalent \n     calculation to ensure the majority of program resources are \n     evaluated.\n       (G) Conduct impact evaluations on all pilot programs before \n     replicating wherever possible, or provide a written \n     justification for not conducting an impact evaluation where \n     such an evaluation was deemed inappropriate or impossible.\n       (H) Develop a clearinghouse capacity for the collection and \n     dissemination of knowledge and lessons learned that serve as \n     benchmarks to guide future programs for United States \n     development professionals, implementing partners, the donor \n     community, and aid recipient governments, and as a repository \n     of knowledge on lessons learned.\n       (I) Distribute evaluation reports internally.\n       (J) Publicly report each evaluation, including an executive \n     summary, a description of the evaluation methodology, key \n     findings, appropriate context (including quantitative and \n     qualitative data when available), and recommendations made in \n     the evaluation within 90 days after the completion of the \n     evaluation.\n       (K) Undertake collaborative partnerships and coordinate \n     efforts with the academic community, implementing partners, \n     and national and international institutions that have \n     expertise in program monitoring, evaluation, and analysis \n     when such partnerships provide needed expertise or \n     significantly improve the evaluation and analysis.\n       (L) Ensure verifiable, valid, credible, precise, reliable, \n     and timely data are available to monitoring and evaluation \n     personnel to permit the objective evaluation of the \n     effectiveness of United States foreign development and \n     economic assistance programs, including an assessment of \n     assumptions and limitations in such evaluations.\n       (M) Ensure that standards of professional evaluation \n     organizations for monitoring and evaluation efforts are \n     employed, including ensuring the integrity and independence \n     of evaluations, permitting and encouraging the exercise of \n     professional judgment, and providing for quality control and \n     assurance in the monitoring and evaluation process.\n       (d) Presidential Report.--Not later than 18 months after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the President shall \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     that contains a detailed description of the guidelines \n     established under subsection (b). The report shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but it may contain a \n     classified annex.\n       (e) Comptroller General Report.--The Comptroller General of \n     the United States shall, not later than 1 year after the \n     report required by subsection (d) is submitted to Congress, \n     submit to the appropriate congressional committees a report \n     that analyzes--\n       (1) the guidelines established pursuant to subsection (b); \n     and\n       (2) a side-by-side comparison of the President's budget \n     request for that fiscal year of every operational unit that \n     carries out United States foreign development and economic \n     assistance and the performance of such units during the prior \n     fiscal year.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will \ncontrol 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Madam Speaker, I want to thank Chairman Royce and the ranking member, \nmy cosponsor on this legislation, Mr. Connolly from Virginia, for this \nlegislation being brought to the House floor tonight.\n  The Foreign Aid Authorization Act first passed Congress in 1961. If \nyou mention foreign aid to many Americans, Madam Speaker, it raises \ntheir blood pressure. Members of our communities often are concerned \nabout foreign aid to other countries because they are just not quite \nsure where that aid is going and what that aid is accomplishing.\n  It is important that we, as Members of the House of Representatives, \nlegislatively communicate to America how America's money is being spent \nin foreign countries. It is important that we are accountable and that \nthat money, that aid, is accountable to the taxpayers.\n  It may shock you, Madam Speaker--maybe it won't--but Congress has \nnever passed a law requiring transparency and accountability of foreign \naid. I will use a different phrase. We have never audited our foreign \naid to see if it is working and to see what it is doing so people can \nsee whether it is successful or not.\n  The American public is uninformed about how much we spend and why we \nspend that money. A recent Publish What You Fund study rated half of \nU.S. agencies in the ``poor'' category when it came to transparency of \naid. Transparency is important because it sheds light on where the \nmoney is spent. It is a lot harder to steal money if everybody knows \nwhere the money went and what it was for.\n  The American people have a right to know what we are doing with their \nmoney. There are a lot of success stories, but many Americans don't \nknow about them. So it is important that we post that information and \nthat the agencies that help in foreign aid assistance post that \ninformation on the Web so we know who is getting the money and what \nthey are doing with that money.\n  Transparency will help foreign aid. It will make it harder for bad \nactors to steal that aid. It will make those who implement our programs \nwork more vigilantly knowing the information will also be posted \nonline. It will educate the American public about all the ways our \ncountry is helping other people around the world. As I said, Madam \nSpeaker, there are a lot of success stories where people are better off \nbecause America is helping them.\n  Transparency by itself, however, won't save all of foreign aid's \nproblems, but without transparency, those problems will not be solved. \nWe also need to evaluate our foreign aid program so we know what works.\n  The key portions of this bill are transparency of the aid and \nevaluation of the aid: evaluate that aid to see if it is working, and \nif it is working may continue to do that aid; evaluate aid--if it is \nnot working, then we cut it off and do something else.\n  We have all heard about the boondoggles of foreign aid. Big \ninfrastructure projects are especially prone to waste and \nmismanagement. That is why it is so critically important that, as part \nof this bill being implemented, licensed engineers who know how to do \nthese infrastructure projects are more involved with their expert input \nand operational skills.\n  Let me give you some examples of where foreign aid has been \nmismanaged. Schools are being built by Americans overseas, but some of \nthose schools never had a student attend them. The Special Inspector \nfor Iraq Reconstruction found out that at least $8 billion in American \ntaxpayer dollars was lost to fraud, waste, and abuse. $44 million was \nspent on a residential camp to house international police trainers. The \ncamp included an Olympic-sized swimming pool. The problem is, swimming \npool and all, it was never used.\n  The $43 million natural gas station in Afghanistan was built by the \nDepartment of Defense when it built the same kind of gas station for \n$500,000 in Pakistan. Let me explain that again. American taxpayers \nbuilt a $43 million natural gas station. Besides the enormous, \noutrageous cost, nobody ever used the gas station in Afghanistan.\n  So rigorous evaluations of our foreign aid are important because they \ncan tell us whether or not we are really making a lasting impact. We \nhave a long way to go, and the State Department really doesn't have a \nsystem in place to keep track of the dollars spent on evaluation of \nthose projects.\n  The State Department can only tell how much it plans to spend in the \nfuture, but as soon as it spends that money on evaluations, it has no \nway of tracking where the money went. So the State Department can't \neven tell how many evaluations were even done last year on the aid that \nwe are already spending. Even in its policy, the State Department is \nmoving in the wrong direction. Its new evaluation policy lowers the \namount of evaluations that must be done.\n  USAID has some troubling signs as well. USAID spent less money on \nevaluations in 2014 than it did in 2013. To solve some of these \nproblems with transparency and with accountability of our foreign aid, \nRepresentative Connolly and myself have introduced H.R. 3766, the \nForeign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act. This bill requires the \nPresident to issue guidelines requiring tough evaluations. And on \ntransparency, it codifies what is already being done and increases the \namount of information required to be posted online, including actual \nexpenditures and evaluations so everyone knows what we are doing and \nwhether it is working or not.\n  We need to be reporting on more foreign aid in a more understandable \nway. The American people want to know where their aid is going, what it \nis for, and if that aid is effective.\n  Transparency and accountability for our foreign aid: this is a \ncommonsense bill, and it doesn't cost any money, Madam Speaker.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  First of all, I want to thank Congressman Poe and Congressman \nConnolly for all their hard work on this bill. Enhancing transparency \nand accountability in our foreign assistance spending is something with \nwhich we can all agree. And it is important that we get our foreign \nassistance right. Our foreign aid represents just a tiny sliver of the \nFederal Government's annual budget--less than 1 percent. But if it is \nput to the right use, it is an investment that pays huge dividends.\n  Why is that? Because when we support the construction of a water \ntreatment facility in an overcrowded city or train teachers in a rural \nvillage, we are doing more than just directly helping those affected. \nWe are helping to bring stability and prosperity to entire communities \nand populations. And when we have stronger partners around the world, \nit helps enhance our own security and advance our own interests.\n\n  So, as I like to say, foreign assistance is the right thing to do for \nthose who are in desperate need, and it is also the smart thing to do \nin terms of American foreign policy and national security. But it is \nimportant that we are spending our limited foreign assistance dollars \nefficiently and effectively.\n\n[[Page H9066]]\n\n  The Obama administration is taking important steps to enhance the \nmonitoring and evaluation of our foreign assistance programs. When she \nwas Secretary of State, Hillary Clinton was at the forefront of those \nefforts.\n  This legislation, the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability \nAct, would build on the great progress already made by the \nadministration. It would write into law many of the steps they have \nalready taken, making these efforts permanent for future \nadministrations.\n  This will help ensure that our investments are as effective as \npossible by requiring measurable goals and plans for monitoring and \nevaluation.\n  Madam Speaker, this important legislating will help all of us to \nbetter understand how our foreign assistance programs help promote \nstability, prosperity, and democracy around the world, and how these \ninvestments advance our own security interests.\n  I am for accountability, so I strongly support this bill. I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Madam Speaker, I rise today with strong concerns over \nPresident Obama attempting to unilaterally bypass Congress once again \nand enter the United States into the so-called ``Paris Protocol'' on \nglobal warming.\n  As the proud Representative of the 36th Congressional District in the \nState of Texas, I can tell you that my constituents want nothing to do \nwith this expensive, ineffective, and unnecessary proposal.\n  According to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the \nParis Protocol will reduce U.S. gross domestic product by an average of \n9.1 percent, or $5 trillion per year. And consistent with this, NERA \nEconomic Consulting states this will cost U.S. taxpayers approximately \nmore than $30 billion per year.\n  Aside from the constitutional issues of the President bypassing the \nSenate and not submitting this proposal as a treaty, and the outrageous \ncosts, these negotiations will not even accomplish their end goal of \nsubstantial climate benefits.\n  A U.S. pledge to the U.N. is estimated to prevent only one-fiftieth \nof 1 degree Celsius temperature rise over the next 85 years.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Simply put, our planet will see no measurable benefit at all, but our \neconomy will be wrecked by this accord.\n  This is just another example of the terrible leadership that we have \nseen from this administration and of the important role that Congress \nmust play in standing up and fighting back on behalf of the American \npeople.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thought we were debating Mr. Poe's and Mr. Connolly's bill. I \ndidn't realize that climate change was on the agenda. Let me say that \ntoday, Secretary Kerry met with a bunch of businesspeople and led a \nmeeting, and they talked about climate change because climate change is \nreal.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nConnolly), a valued member of the Foreign Affairs Committee and an \nauthor of this legislation.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Madam Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, \nthe distinguished ranking member of the House Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, for his great leadership and for always being supportive of \nall of our work.\n  I also want to thank my dear friend from Texas, Ted Poe. He has been \na wonderful partner and initiator of reform and of thoughtful \nlegislation on our committee. It has been my privilege to cosponsor a \nlot of legislation with Mr. Poe to try to make things better.\n  Today, I rise in support of another such example, the Foreign Aid \nTransparency and Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Madam Speaker, this bill is a project I have worked on with Judge Poe \nfor a number of years now. In the 112th Congress, a previous iteration \nof the bill passed this body by a unanimous vote. We hope for a similar \noutcome in this Congress and for quick Senate consideration and \npassage.\n  The bill directs the President to establish monitoring and evaluation \nguidelines for the 22 Federal agencies that are charged with \nimplementing some piece of development and economic assistance.\n  The guidelines will require M plans as part of the project \ndevelopment process, and agencies will be encouraged to incorporate the \nfindings of evaluations and impact studies into subsequent foreign \nassistance programs. This feedback loop will include measurable goals, \nperformance metrics, and a clearinghouse for lessons learned on U.S.-\nled aid projects, something long overdue after 60-plus years of foreign \naid. Additionally, the legislation requires that the documents and \nreports created under this M regime be made available to the public \non foreignassistance.gov.\n  This administration has developed an encouraging record on foreign \naid transparency. The Foreign Assistance Dashboard, which was created \nin 2010, is a great example of demonstrating a promising inclination \ntoward disclosure that we hope to enshrine in this law. This measure \nwill strengthen and codify those transparency best practices to ensure \nthat they exist as agency policy under future administrations that \nmight not be as accommodating of the aid community's demand for this \ninformation.\n  Aid programs that are held accountable for their performance and \nresults can be made more effective, and their impact on communities and \ncountries abroad can be more easily demonstrated. Perhaps, with more \ninformation, we can dispel the commonly held belief that 26 percent of \nour budget goes to foreign aid, when, as my friend Judge Poe pointed \nout, it is actually less than 1 percent.\n  The U.S. foreign assistance operation does not lack passion. The men \nand women who put themselves in harm's way overseas and who take their \nfamilies to remote areas of the world, often dangerous, in the interest \nof helping vulnerable populations, are certainly not seeking fame, \nglory, or fortune. They do it because they can envision a path to \nprosperity in even the most poverty-stricken areas of the world, and \nthey see the promise of democracy in the face of the most repressive \nand authoritarian regimes.\n  While our passion is well-defined, our mission and metrics are not.\n  Regarding our mission, I was a staffer on the Senate Foreign \nRelations Committee the last time Congress actually passed a foreign \naid authorization bill in 1986. The original Foreign Assistance Act of \n1961, which Judge Poe cited, listed five principal goals for foreign \naid. Today, we have more than 260. Some are competing and some are \nredundant.\n  What is our core mission today?\n  Until January 2014, USAID's mission statement read as follows: \n``USAID accelerates human progress in developing countries by reducing \npoverty, advancing democracy, building market economies, promoting \nsecurity, responding to crises, and improving quality of life. Working \nwith governments, institutions, and civil society, we assist \nindividuals to build their own futures by mobilizing the full range of \nAmerica's public and private resources through our expert presence \noverseas.''\n  That is not a clear mission statement. I am hopeful this bill will \nhelp us focus on the foreign assistance operations.\n  While I think we have some distance to travel in streamlining the \nlegislative construct for foreign assistance and clearly articulating \nour mission, we have an opportunity today to make immense progress \ntoward establishing badly needed metrics for aid programs with the \npassage of this bill. It is time to apply a data-driven approach to \nconstructing an assistance operation that has the support of both this \nCongress and of a well-informed public.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Again, I particularly thank my friend, Judge Poe, for his leadership, \nfor his initiative, and for his vision with respect to this subject. I \nknow it is going to actually make U.S. foreign assistance investments \nin the future a lot more effective and a lot more accountable.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentleman from Virginia for his comments. A couple of \nthings that he mentioned are worth mentioning again, I believe.\n\n[[Page H9067]]\n\n  This very bill that we have been working on for a long time passed \nunanimously in this House of Representatives 4 years ago in December. \nWhy didn't it become law? Because, in the Senate's rules, one Senator \nwas able to block the legislation from even being voted on in the \nSenate. So here we are again, 4 years later, trying to get this \nlegislation passed.\n  My friend mentioned USAID and their mission statement. Nothing in the \ndefinition of ``assistance'' in this bill precludes USAID from \nreporting on data fields that it currently reports on for the Green \nBook and for OECD. So, if they are already making reports, this \nlegislation, to be very clear, does not prohibit them from also making \nthose other reports, but they will comply with the legislation in this \nbill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), a valued member of the House Foreign \nAffairs Committee.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. I thank the distinguished gentleman from New York for \nyielding time.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3766, the Foreign Aid \nTransparency and Accountability Act.\n  I want to begin by recognizing my colleagues, the distinguished \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly) and the distinguished gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe), for all of the work that they have done to get \nthis important bill to the floor and to thank them for working, as they \nalways do, in a bipartisan way on behalf of the members of our \ncommittee.\n  I also thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for their \nleadership on this bill and for their creating an environment on the \nForeign Affairs Committee, where we work together in a bipartisan way, \nand this legislation is a product of that work.\n  Madam Speaker, the Foreign Aid Transparency and Accountability Act \nwill enhance the transparency and effectiveness of U.S. foreign \nassistance by requiring a framework for monitoring and evaluating \nforeign development and economic programs and for publicly disclosing \nthe data and results.\n  The United States carries out a wide variety of assistance programs \noverseas, and it is important that there is a clearly articulated \nstrategy and monitoring apparatus for our assistance. It is just as \nimportant that the American people have access to the information about \nwhat activities their tax dollars are funding. This is critical to \nsustaining public understanding and support for our diplomatic work and \nour foreign assistance.\n  I also want to take a moment to commend the Obama administration for \nmaking much of this information publicly available online on their \nForeign Assistance Dashboard.\n  I hope that my colleagues support this legislation so that we can \ncontinue to increase efficiency and accountability in our foreign \nassistance programs. The American people deserve this, and it will make \nour foreign assistance better understood and more impactful. I urge my \ncolleagues to support this excellent legislation.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, as I have no further requests for \ntime, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, let me, again, thank Chairman Royce for bringing this \nbill forward and thank Representatives Poe and Connolly for their hard \nwork.\n  Our foreign assistance helps improve the lives of countless people \naround the world, and it helps advance American interests and American \nvalues. Foreign assistance deserves the continued support of Congress. \nAt the same time, we need to know that our foreign assistance dollars \nare being put to the best use possible, that we are getting the biggest \nbang for our buck. The American people expect no less when it comes to \ntheir tax dollars, and they are right.\n  So let's stand up for foreign assistance and for transparency and \naccountability by passing this bill. I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I congratulate Judge Poe and Mr. Connolly.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Madam Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I want to thank Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, and, of course, \nmy friend, Mr. Connolly from Virginia, for their support on this bill.\n  Madam Speaker, the Foreign Affairs Committee is probably more \nbipartisan than any committee in the House of Representatives. Almost \neverything that we do and the legislation we bring to the floor, the \nvast majority of Members support. Sometimes every Member supports the \nlegislation. This is another one of those pieces of legislation that is \ngood for the country and is really good for the whole world.\n  Transparency and evaluation is what this bill is about. As I started \nout in my comments, many Americans don't know what we do with their \nmoney. Let me just give a few examples:\n  Because of American aid, there are now millions of girls in other \nparts of the world who are getting an education. Because of Americans \nand their interest, half of the AIDS epidemic in Africa has been cut. \nIt has been cut in half, the epidemic of AIDS in Africa. The life \nexpectancy of people in Afghanistan, because of American aid, has grown \n20 years. When it comes to the youth, many children throughout the \nworld are dying because they have dirty water. It is not clean. Because \nof USAID and their help, that number has been cut in half. The children \nare now living because they are getting clean water.\n  Those are just a few things that are being done. We should be proud \nof those accomplishments.\n  We also want to make sure that those accomplishments and what we are \ndoing with American money is transparent. We want to continue to \nevaluate it to see if it is working. If it is working, let's continue \nit, and if it is not working, then let's do something else.\n  I do want to thank those involved for their support, especially the \nchairman and the ranking member.\n  H.R. 3766 will give us the tools to make foreign aid programs \nefficient and effective, two words that sometimes aren't used with \n``government.'' I strongly support this legislation.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3766, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9067-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9067]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      LaSALLE LANCERS DID IT AGAIN\n\n  (Mr. CHABOT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. CHABOT. Madam Speaker, they did it again.\n  The LaSalle Lancers won the Ohio Division II State football \nchampionship for the second year in a row, and they won it \nconvincingly, as they did last year, 42-0, this time over Massillon \nPerry.\n  One reason LaSalle was ready to compete and prevail for the State \nchampionship was they were challenged throughout the season by other \ngreat Cincinnati high school football programs. There is a saying, what \ndoesn't kill you makes you stronger. Having to play Cincinnati \npowerhouse teams like Colerain, Elder, St. X, and Moeller didn't kill \nLaSalle, but it certainly made them stronger.\n  I am proud to say that LaSalle has been an important part of my life. \nI got my start in politics there by getting elected to the student \ncouncil, and I played football, starting on the defensive line. Ten \nyears later, my younger brother, Dave, also played defensive back for \nLaSalle. Of course, there is another saying, the older I get, the \nbetter I was.\n  So congratulations to LaSalle's players, coaches, students, teachers, \nparents, and supporters. Well done.\n  Lancers, roll deep.

Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) is recognized for\n\n[[Page H9068]]\n\n60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the topic of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I want to take a little time this evening to take a \ndifferent look at American energy, Mr. Speaker. As many of you know, \none of my core convictions is the importance of upholding the dignity \nof human life. Our task here in Washington should be to promote ideas \nand policies that allow people to live longer, healthier, and more \nrewarding lives.\n  It is in that spirit that I have joined with my fellow Pennsylvanian, \nRepresentative Kelly, and like-minded colleagues to host tonight's \nSpecial Order.\n  Starting last week, world elites gathered in Paris to negotiate \nclimate change commitments and promises that, if enacted, could undo \ngenerations of human progress, progress that has provided us with the \naffordable and reliable energy necessary for humans to truly flourish.\n  I am here tonight to tell another side of the story, one that \nabandons the dogma of scarcity put forward by elites in Paris and \nclimate change zealots in Washington. I want to shift this debate to \nfocus on the remarkable story of human abundance. Affordable, reliable \nenergy has been responsible for helping to improve and prolong the \nlives of billions of people around the world.\n  Energy powers our businesses. It keeps the lights on in our homes. It \nallows us to have fresh food and clean water. It powers our schools and \nour hospitals. Energy is in many respects a life or death matter. It is \na moral issue, and it deserves more careful consideration than it has \nbeen given by the President.\n  I would like to highlight a little bit, just taking a look at some \ncharts. In taking a look at what has been happening with the use of \nenergy, a lot of the energy we get is carbon-based fossil fuel energy, \nwhether it is coal, oil, natural gas. Yes, it has increased in recent \nhistory.\n  What also has happened in recent history? As CO2 emissions \nhave gone up, so has the wealth of this world and of this country. As \nthe population has gone up, so has energy use. What is really striking, \nMr. Speaker, is taking a look at how the increase in life expectancy \nhas coincided with this energy revolution as well. As you can see, for \nmuch of human history, our lives were short, miserable, and lacking in \nfulfillment.\n  Consider that, until the industrial revolution, people lived 27 \nyears, on average, earned little money, and faced limited \nopportunities. Again, though CO2 has increased, so has \nincredible wealth, lifting billions of people out of poverty and life \nexpectancy.\n  The point now is, in the United States, the average life expectancy \nis near 80 years old. As people learned to access the bounty of energy \navailable, we turned it to our advantage. As we got better at it, \nincomes and populations soared.\n  This is another interesting chart, Mr. Speaker. As we look at the use \nof world energy, just going back over the last 30 years, the bottom \nline is energy use. The top line is the world GDP, the increase in \nwealth that we have seen coinciding with this increase in energy. You \ncould take a look at some specific countries and see how energy has \nbenefited them.\n  In China and India, both of which have industrialized and increased \nenergy use over the last generation, life expectancy has increased by \nmore than a decade. Infant mortality has plummeted by 70 and 58 \npercent, respectively, in China and India. This is all correlated with \nincreased energy use and the availability of affordable energy \nresources.\n  As Alex Epstein argues in ``The Moral Case for Fossil Fuels,'' \nhundreds of millions of people have gotten their first light bulb, \ntheir first refrigerator, their first decent-paying job.\n  With all of our world problems, affordable energy has helped make \nthis the brightest, most abundant time in human history. Some disparage \nthe story as one of unseemly consumption and excess. I see it as a \ntremendous triumph of human ingenuity and a victory for those who put \nhuman well-being as our top priority.\n  We can tell the same story about Western Pennsylvania, where, once \nagain, we are witnessing increasing prosperity attracted by affordable \nand reliable energy. This entails better opportunities for \nPennsylvania's youth and a better quality of life. That is why I am so \ntroubled by the President's actions at home and in Paris.\n  In negotiating a global compact, which will likely entail further \nrestrictions on our access to energy, the President is unknowingly \nendangering our future well-being. By not taking his plans to Congress \nfor approval, as should be the case with a treaty, the President is \nignoring the will of the American people.\n  This is not a trivial point. The American people will be denied the \nopportunity to weigh in on something that will drastically impact their \ndaily lives. Remember, the President said when he was a candidate in \n2008 that electricity rates will necessarily skyrocket under his plan.\n  All of this comes in addition to heavy burdens that the American \npeople are already grappling with. The so-called Clean Power Plan is an \nexample. By forcing more power plant closures and placing stricter \nrequirements on those that remain, the President's plan will raise \nenergy prices by $289 billion through 2030, hurting American families \nand businesses large and small.\n  Research suggests that we will see 224,000 fewer American jobs being \ncreated each year because of this rule. We will also see reduced \ndisposable income and weaker economic growth.\n  Minority communities will be especially hard-hit. A study from the \nNational Black Chamber of Commerce found that the Clean Power Plan \nwould increase poverty among African Americans by 23 percent and \nHispanics by 26 percent. This is unacceptable, and it is immoral.\n  Real people will be hurt by these actions. Yet, few in Washington \nseem to be caring about these real human costs. That is why I have \nintroduced a bill called the Fair Burdens Act. This bill would prevent \nthe burden from endangering our prosperity and well-being until the EPA \ncan verify that a sufficient number of countries have enacted similarly \nstringent policies.\n  In other words, the Fair Burdens Act would ensure that Americans \naren't made to needlessly suffer and that our jobs aren't forced \noverseas, as the President unilaterally slows the American economy.\n  We can't just rely on legislation. We need to change the narrative \nand educate the public. Affordable, reliable energy is a vital \ningredient for human prosperity and well-being. Ignoring this fact and \ntaking ill-conceived policy actions as a result condemns millions of \nAmericans and billions around the world to dimmer futures, higher \nenergy costs, and less prosperity. We owe it to our constituents to \ndefend their ability to live fulfilling, prosperous lives.\n\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have joined me here tonight to do \njust that. I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I think tonight is a great \nnight for us all to get together. While we are very concerned about the \ncost to American taxpayers and the fact that we will be going away from \nour fossil fuels, which are so abundant, so accessible and so \naffordable, there is another issue that takes place at the same time.\n  In the Paris protocol, we have heard the President say very clearly--\nand he has used this many times before--that things aren't getting done \nat the pace that he would like and that he has a phone and he has a pen \nand, if Congress can't act, he will act.\n  Well, I would like to suggest to the President, in fact, it is kind \nof shocking and stunning that a former professor of constitutional law \nwould have a total disregard for the Constitution. I would like to tell \nthe President that the Constitution is not a suggestion. It is who we \nare. It is what makes us an exceptional Nation.\n  Now, the United Nations' Framework Convention on Climate Change is \ntaking place right now in Paris. It is stunning that the legacy of one \nman would\n\n[[Page H9069]]\n\novershadow what is good for not only our country, but the world.\n  Decisions made by this President and the commitments made by this \nPresident, he looks at it as an executive decision, not as a treaty, a \ntreaty that requires him returning to the House and to the Senate. \nParticularly treating this as a treaty, it would take two-thirds of the \nSenate to concur with whatever it is that we are proposing. Again, as I \nsaid, this is a former professor of constitutional law. Yet, he \ncontinually defies it. He makes the House irrelevant.\n  This is not, by the way, a Republican or Democrat issue. This is an \nAmerican issue. This goes to the very framework and the very foundation \nof who we are as a Nation. So when you look at this, it is really hard \nto believe that there is such disregard.\n  I would just say to the President that, if you go to article II, \nsection 2, clause 2, it is very clearly stated: ``The President . . . \nshall have Power, by and with the Advice and Consent of the Senate, to \nmake Treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present concur . . \n.''\n  Again, this is an overreach by an executive. It doesn't matter if it \nis a Republican sitting in the White House or a Democrat sitting in the \nWhite House or an Independent or a Libertarian sitting in the White \nHouse. It clearly is defined in our Constitution how these powers work.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I wonder, Mr. Speaker, if one were to ask a question of \nsome high school students in a civics class--if you have an agreement, \nlet's say, between two countries or three countries or four countries \nand those countries are agreeing to do things that are going to bind \ntheir respective citizens, you would ask those students, I would think, \nMr. Speaker: What would you call that type of agreement?\n  I think every one of those students in a civics class might say a \ntreaty. If it looks like a treaty, if it smells like a treaty and it \nworks like a treaty, it is a treaty.\n  To just highlight what my colleague here has been saying, we have a \nprocess in our Constitution for when it is a treaty. It needs to get \nsubmitted to the Senate with a two-thirds vote.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his \ncontribution.\n  I mean, it really does come down to, well, tonight we are talking \nabout energy and we are talking about setting targets and timetables \nthat will be very expensive for hardworking American taxpayers' money. \nI would like to remind the President that the money he is talking about \ncommitting is not his. It belongs to hardworking American taxpayers.\n  This insane idea that somehow there is an endless amount of money to \nbe thrown around the world for whatever reason possible and knowing \nthat, really, the Paris protocol is nothing more than a conversation \ntaking place in Paris.\n  There is no commitment from these countries to do all these things. \nThere is an ask for these countries to do these things. What they are \nasking is: If we do comply with these suggestions, these targets, these \ntimetables, will we be subsidized by the United States of America?\n  The President has been unbelievable to make the commitments that he \ncontinues to make. He does not have that power. Our Constitution \nclearly defines the separation of powers. It is clearly structured so \nthat no one body can run roughshod over the other body. This has been a \nconcern forever. Yet, this President consistently time after time \ndisregards the House and the Senate.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  As I said earlier, this is not about Republicans or Democrats. This \nis about America and America's future. In this case, it is about \nenergy. But as we go forward, what other overreaches will this \nExecutive take? What other things will he do because it is about his \nlegacy and not about the well-being of our country and our people. It \nis shocking. It is stunning that he would continue on this path.\n  What is even more stunning to me is that the American people sit idly \nby and watch this happen day after day, week after week, month after \nmonth. In 7 years of watching this, they sit back and say: I am not \nsure that he doesn't have the power to do this. Well, let me tell you, \nit is clearly defined in our Constitution that this President does not \nhave this authority. In fact, no President, no Executive has the \nauthority to do what this President is continuing to do.\n  As we meet here in America's House and we look at what can you do, \nbecause people back home tell me all the time, ``Look, I agree with \nyou, but what can you do about it?'' and I know that for myself and my \ncolleagues, we refuse to sit by idly and watch our Nation be given away \nand watch our Constitution be run over roughshod because of one man's \nlegacy. This is not what is good for America. This is what is good for \nthis administration and this President. That is not only shameful, it \nis unconstitutional and cannot be tolerated.\n  That is why, with Senator Lee in the Senate and myself, we have come \nup with H. Con. Res. 97 that states any commitment of funds, \nhardworking American taxpayer funds, has got to come before the Senate \nfor its advice and consent.\n  As I said earlier, we can debate and we can talk and we can amend, \nbut what we cannot condone is an Executive who has a total disregard \nfor this House and for the Senate. As I said earlier, we need \ncolleagues on both sides. This is not a Republican issue or a Democrat \nissue. This comes down to the very foundation of who we are as a \ncountry.\n  If we turn our back on this, what will be next? The continual \ndisregard for the Constitution is not only of grave concern to me, to \nmy colleagues, but every single American, regardless of how you vote or \nhow you register. That is not the issue, my friends.\n  The issue is, when do the American people in America's House, with \nthe Senate, stand up and say there will be no commitment of hardworking \nAmerican taxpayer dollars unless it comes before the Senate as a treaty \nand gets the advice and consent of the Senate, two-thirds of which are \nrequired to pass this?\n  I know we are coming to an end in Paris, and I know there is great \nconcern of getting to Paris to find out exactly what the Paris Protocol \nis structured with, but I would just say this: Before you pack your \nbags and leave, take a copy of your Constitution with you.\n  For those folks sitting back home and watching this happen, please, \nget out your Constitutions and look. For our schools, please start to \npreach and teach the Constitution, of which too many Americans are \nwoefully uninformed.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. It struck me as my colleague from Pennsylvania was \ntalking about the Constitution. What he was getting at, Mr. Speaker, \nwas a simple concept of authority and whether the President has \nauthority to do what he is doing in Paris. The President is allowed to \nnegotiate certainly. He can conduct foreign affairs. It is pretty clear \nin the Constitution that he has that authority to do so. But the \nPresident, on his own, does not have the authority to obligate American \ntaxpayers to pay into any kind of fund. It is the House and the Senate \nthat do the appropriations.\n  I am mindful that my colleague came out of the auto business, where \nhe sold cars. I can imagine a situation where you might have a customer \ncoming in, let's say a 15-year-old, who wants to go in and buy a car. \nOf course my colleague might welcome this individual to the showroom, \nand this individual, a 15-year-old kid, might make an offer, but I \nthink he is going to be asking: Well, does this person have the \nauthority at the age of 15 to make an offer? Maybe the kid will say: \nWell, I am doing it for my mom and my dad. Well, you are going to want \nto see what authority he has. I am mindful that our Constitution gives \nthe authority to spend money to the Congress, which would then be \nsigned by the President.\n  I yield to my colleague if he wants to close.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. I would tell you this, and I think if \nthere is anything more telling of the view that this administration \nhas, all you have to do is go back in time to March of 2015 this year \nwhen Josh Earnest, who represents the White House in all the briefings, \nwas asked by a reporter in regard to the Paris Protocol and in regard \nto the climate control conference that would be taking place.\n\n[[Page H9070]]\n\n  This is so typical of this administration. The reporter looks to Mr. \nEarnest and says to him: Is this the kind of agreement that Congress \nshould have the ability to sign off on?\n  Now, you would think that somebody who works for a former \nconstitutional law professor would have a little bit of an idea when it \ncomes to speaking; and even while they may feel in their heart that \nthey have a total disregard for this body, I don't think that they \nwould be encouraged to speak out the way Josh Earnest did that day. Let \nme read what Josh Earnest said when the reporter asked him: Is this the \nkind of agreement that Congress should have the ability to sign off on?\n  He looks him right in the eye and says: I think it is hard to take \nseriously from some Members of Congress who deny the fact that climate \nchange exists that they should have some opportunity to render judgment \nabout a climate change agreement.\n  Is that not stunning? And not only stunning, but chilling that, \ncoming out of the White House, the spokesman for the President of the \nUnited States again consistently expresses the attitude of this \nPresident in that: Are you kidding me? We are actually going to have \nthe people's House, the people's Representatives weigh in on a climate \nchange initiative? They are not qualified. They only represent the \npeople. No. We will make that decision. And he again totally trashes \nthe House of Representatives.\n  By the way, for my friends who don't speak up when this happens to \nthem, you got trashed, too, my friends. I have watched you stand and \napplaud a President who says consistently that: I do not need the House \nof Representatives to effect change. I will use my phone and I will use \nmy pen, and I am tired of waiting for these people.\n  Well, Mr. President, once again I say to you that the Constitution is \nnot a suggestion. It is who we are as a nation. It is what makes us \ngreat. It is what allows the people to decide how they will be \ngoverned, not the government to decide how the people will be governed. \nThis is such upside-down thinking.\n  While I am concerned, as you are, with the abandonment of our fossil \nfuels and turning our economic revival upside down, I am more concerned \nwith an administration that consistently turns upside down our \nConstitution, runs roughshod over the House of Representatives, \ndisregards the Senate, and then sits back and says: This is the way it \nis going to be because I am the President of the United States.\n  I tell you, Mr. President, you are the President of the United \nStates. You take the same oath all of us take. If for some reason you \ncan't remember what it is, please take a look at it and remind yourself \nwho you are, what you are, and whom you represent.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded not to engage in \npersonalities toward the President, and Members are reminded to address \nthe Chair and not a perceived viewing audience or other Members in the \nsecond person.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his \nobservations about our Constitution and what it requires.\n  I yield the floor to my colleague from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), who \nhas been a very strong advocate for her constituents and for the energy \npolicy that we need to have in this country.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to join with \nRepresentatives Rothfus and Kelly and all my colleagues here tonight \nexpressing concern about the reports coming from the Conference of the \nParties, or COP 21, talks in France of a planned end-around of the \nSenate.\n  It is unacceptable to me that this administration is negotiating a \nmajor international agreement, promising vast sums of taxpayer dollars, \nwith no intention of allowing the people's representatives to weigh in \non a final agreement. While the President's team is in Paris trying to \nfinalize a deal, we have been here listening to our constituents. That \nshould be our goal: to listen to Americans and to fight to lower their \nelectricity costs, not obligating taxpayers to send billions of their \nhard-earned dollars overseas to implement climate change schemes.\n  Nor should we continue down this path of forcing rate increases on \nthe hardworking families in America, yet that has been the President's \nplan all along, Mr. Speaker. In 2008, President Obama proudly announced \nhis vision for energy costs in our country. He said: ``Under my plan of \na cap-and-trade system, electricity rates would necessarily skyrocket . \n. . coal . . . natural gas . . . you name it . . . whatever the plants \nwere, whatever the industry was, they would have to retrofit their \noperations. That will cost money, and they will pass that money on to \nconsumers.''\n  His plan: make them pay more. Even though his cap-and-trade \nlegislation failed in Congress, the administration has not given up and \ncontinues to ignore the voices of the American people by passing rules \nthat implement them, despite the law, and by traveling to Paris to work \na deal to inflict more mandates on the American people.\n  Even now, with little support here at home, negotiators are working \nevery angle to make sure a deal is secured, no matter how onerous it is \nto senior citizens and low-income families living paycheck to paycheck \nand for whom a rate increase will hurt the most.\n  This agenda has been a hallmark of the administration when it \nfinalized the EPA's recent Clean Power Plan rules on existing and new \npower plants, which amount to a disguised cap-and-trade program.\n  But we are listening to the American people. Upon the start of the \nParis talks, both Chambers of Congress passed joint resolutions against \nthe EPA's Clean Power Plan rules for new and existing power plants to \nnullify the rules put in place which were done by ignoring the will of \nthe people.\n  Twenty-seven States have also taken the EPA to court over these two \nrules. It is important that we do this. Missourians rely on affordable \nenergy. Americans everywhere rely on affordable energy, and to ignore \ntheir needs and wishes is irresponsible.\n  We do not need extreme, arbitrary mandates that will cost hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the next 15 years, close power plants across \nthe Nation, eliminate jobs, and close off access to reliable, \naffordable energy for the most vulnerable in our society.\n  We need to promote policies that increase access to affordable \nenergy, tap into the abundant energy supply, and create a reliable \ninfrastructure supported by American labor and ingenuity.\n  We need to make sure that Americans' voices are heard, which is why I \nproudly stand with my colleagues in support of Congressman Kelly's \nconcurrent resolution requiring the President to send any agreement \nstemming from these talks in Paris to the Senate as a treaty for advice \nand consent from those sent here by the people to represent them.\n  We need American energy policy that works for the American people, \nnot against it. They deserve a fair process that upholds the \nconstitutional authority of checks and balances envisioned by our \nforefathers.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand up for the American people and support \nthis resolution so the people's voices will be heard.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, those who disagree with us and our \ncolleagues point to the wisdom of the experts on the potential impacts \nof climate change, but we know that many of the so-called experts have \nhistorically been wrong, often significantly wrong.\n  In 1986, John Holdren, a senior adviser to President Obama on science \nand technology issues, predicted: ``carbon dioxide, climate-induced \nfamines could kill as many as a billion people before the year 2020.''\n  Since then, we have added almost 2\\1/2\\ billion people to the planet, \nan increase of almost 50 percent, and we aren't seeing a billion people \ndying from famine. We continue to make significant progress with \nimproved technology, and we are feeding more people than ever, and \npeople are living healthier and longer. We could not have done this \nwithout accessing abundant, affordable, and consistent energy.\n  Paul Ehrlich, another so-called expert on this issue, predicted in \n1970, that: ``By the year 2000, the United Kingdom will be simply a \nsmall group of impoverished islands, inhabited by some 70 million \nhungry people . . . If I were a gambler, I would take even more money \nthat England will not exist in the year 2000.'' Well, England\n\n[[Page H9071]]\n\nstill exists, and it is doing better than ever.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  England's Chancellor of the Exchequer was recently published in The \nWall Street Journal bragging about the nation's turnaround under \nconservative leadership: ``How Britain Got Its Mojo Back.''\n  To paraphrase Mark Twain, the report of Britain's death is greatly \nexaggerated, to say the least. If we had listened to the inaccurate and \ndire predictions of these experts and chicken littles and curtailed \nenergy usage, our world would certainly look differently than it does. \nIt would be poorer, less well fed, and billions of people would be \ngenerally worse off.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer).\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), and I want to commend my colleague and \nfriend, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly), for his eloquent \nand passionate defense of constitutional government.\n  It is not just the administration's efforts here to ratify something \nand bypass Congress without any input from us, but they are also making \nlaws through agencies, such as the EPA. We are engaged right now in a \ndebate over the Clean Power Plan, which is a reiteration of cap-and-\ntrade. It is all about regulating greenhouse gases. They have started \nthis process because in 2007, the Supreme Court, in a 5-4 decision, \nsaid that the Clean Air Act gave the EPA the authority to regulate \ngreenhouse emissions. Not everyone agrees with that.\n  As you see here on the easel, I have a quote from former \nRepresentative John Dingell. This is what he had to say about the \nSupreme Court's decision in EPA v. Massachusetts. He said:\n  ``Like most members of this committee, I think the Supreme Court came \nup with a very much erroneous decision on whether the Clean Air Act \ncovers greenhouse gases. Like many of the members of this committee I \nwas present when we wrote that legislation. We thought it was clear \nenough that we didn't clarify it, thinking that even the Supreme Court \nwas not stupid enough to make that finding.''\n  I want to state for the record, Mr. Speaker, that I am in no way \nmaking personal references to the members of the Court, particularly \nthe five who voted for that decision. That is Mr. Dingell's opinion. \nBut I think it is clear that it was never Congress' intent to allow the \nEPA to do this.\n  The point here is that we have had a debate over regulating \ngreenhouse gases. We did that in 2010 in the form of the cap-and-trade \nbill. And Congress, with Democrat majorities in both Houses, said \n``no.'' Yet the President is intent on making the United States a party \nto a legally-binding agreement to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that \nwill have almost no measurable impact on global temperatures. The EPA \nhas admitted that in testimony before the Science Committee.\n  This is basically a public relations effort to encourage other \nnations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions. As Mr. Rothfus has \npointed out, the cost on the American economy, and particularly on low-\nincome families, will be enormous. Also, on single-income households \nand senior citizens.\n  Even the former lead author of the International Panel on Climate \nChange, Philip Lloyd, asserted in a new paper that there is strong \nlikelihood that the major portion of observed warming is due to natural \nvariation. If it is due to natural variation, there is little to \nnothing that we can do about it.\n  Congress has been bypassed by the EPA and other Federal agencies for \ntoo long. Is time to stand up and reassert ourselves as the sole body \nempowered to make law under the Constitution.\n  The debate over greenhouse gases and climate change is not the \ncentral issue. This is really about the EPA and this administration \nusurping the authority of Congress to make a law.\n  As my friend from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly) explained, the issue is \nthat the authority of Congress, and consequently the right of American \ncitizens to representation and the making of our Nation's laws is being \nseriously diminished.\n  Under our Constitution, Congress makes the law and is held \naccountable by the people through elections. The effort to restrain the \nEPA is more than a policy position on an issue, but a matter of \nfidelity to the Constitution and the clear separation of powers \ndoctrine that is essential to the successful functioning of our \ngovernment.\n  As the people's elected Representatives, and I want to emphasize it \nis elected Representatives, not elected bystanders, it should be one of \nour top priorities to reassert Congress as the originator of law and \nreestablish congressional accountability for the regulations issued by \nFederal agencies, by requiring a vote on the regulations that have a \nsignificant impact on the economy. This would have a devastating impact \non the economy. By doing so, not only will the economy benefit, but the \nRepresentative and accountable government will be restored in the \nprocess.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support my friend from Pennsylvania's \nresolution to require that the President submit any agreement reached \nin Paris to the Senate for their advice and consent.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague for his comments.\n  Let's take a look at where we are at in this debate over energy use \nand what has been going on in Paris. Again, it always seems to be a \none-sided conversation about all the negatives and all the dire \nconsequences. I highlighted a few of the examples before of what some \nof the advocates have been saying, and how their dire predictions did \nnot come to pass.\n  Too often, Mr. Speaker, we take for granted how easy it is to live \nwith constant access to reliable sources of energy. Our health, indeed \nour lives, and the lives of those who we love, often depend on our \naccess to reliable energy available to us at every hour, every day. \nPeople in the developing world cannot yet say the same.\n  There is a powerful story of an unborn child who suffocated in utero \nin Gambia comes to mind. This tiny, three-pound little girl could not \nbe saved, because the hospital did not have access to a reliable source \nof energy. Her mother required an emergency C-section, but the surgery \ncould not begin until a generator was powered on. Precious minutes were \nlost, so precious life was lost. Without a reliable, consistent form of \nenergy, the hospital did not even own an incubator, which would have \nalso been necessary to save this baby's life.\n  We cannot forget how important affordable, reliable energy is for \nevery human person, and how attacks on these sources of energy are \nattacks on life itself.\n  I yield to my colleague from Texas (Mr. Weber).\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to condemn the \nPresident's actions to regulate our power plants and his efforts to \ncommit the United States to such onerous regulations through the United \nNations. At no other time in our history has a President been more \nwrong more times on so may issues that this country is facing today \nthan President Obama, Mr. Speaker.\n  At a time when our country is being attacked from inside our borders \nand radical Islamists are gaining ground all over the world, this \nadministration is obsessed with climate change? And, he refuses to \nadmit the radical Islam is our enemy? It makes me wonder if he thinks \nthat Syed Farook in English means ``global warming.''\n  It is clear that he is intent on regulating our Nation's economy and \nhurting its citizens instead of focusing on the immediate threat. You \ncan't make this stuff up, Mr. Speaker. I guess you could say the threat \nhe should be focused on is global swarming. He just doesn't seem to get \nit, Mr. Speaker.\n  The sad fact, Mr. Speaker, is even if every country abided by its \ngreenhouse gas emissions reduction commitments, temperatures would \ncontinue increasing 2.7 to 3.7 degrees Celsius. Without these \nreductions, temperatures would increase 3.0 to 4.0 degrees Celsius. The \ndifference is miniscule.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are no positive economic or environmental benefits \nto the President's unlawful regulatory actions. Instead, the \nadministration's pledge to the U.N. threatens job creation and economic \ngrowth right here in the United States of America.\n  According to one independent analysis, the economic cost to Americans\n\n[[Page H9072]]\n\nwill be approximately $29 to $39 billion each year. Electricity prices \nfor consumers in 40 States could increase by at least 10 percent, or \nmore. He has already been quoted during his campaign saying that under \nhis administration, electricity prices would, by necessity, skyrocket. \nThese are his words, not mine.\n  This represents nothing less than a war, Mr. Speaker, on low-income \nfamilies, and would further increase economic inequality.\n  Mr. Speaker, our country is in a crisis. Instead of its foolhardy and \nunconstitutional plan to regulate our climate, this administration \nshould be focusing on the livelihood and safety of this Nation and \nAmericans.\n  It is no secret that there are people around the world who hate the \nUnited States and wish to see its demise. There are attacks being \nplanned and plotted even as we speak, Mr. Speaker. Yet this \nadministration claims that that threat is contained and global warming \nis our main threat. Tell that to the 14 people who were tragically \nmurdered while celebrating Christmas in San Bernardino.\n  That is how I see it here in America, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague for doing this very \nimportant Special Order. I commend Mr. Rothfus and Mr. Kelly for doing \nthis.\n  I have got several things I would like to talk about. The first thing \nis that 190 countries are meeting in Paris to negotiate a new \ninternational agreement on climate change at the 21st session of the \nConference of Parties.\n  According to the U.S. Special Envoy for Climate Change, President \nObama intends to commit the U.S. to giving tens of billions of dollars \nper year to finance green energy initiatives in developing countries to \nreduce emissions by 26 to 28 percent below levels by 2025.\n  America, wake up. These tens of billions of dollars are coming out of \nyour money. We have seniors that can't buy health insurance or pay \ntheir rent or insurance. We have seniors and other families that are \nsuffering here in America. But yet, the President wants to commit tens \nof billions of our hardworking American taxpayers' money, and mine, \ntoo, to these other countries.\n  The Obama administration has indicated that the President does not \nintend to submit the Paris agreement to the Senate for its advice and \nconsent as an article II treaty. This is a clear violation of the \nconstitutional laws and ideals of America, and it will not be \ntolerated. We will hold him accountable.\n  The lack of progress becomes even more apparent when you start \nlooking at the country level. China, for its part, offered to reach \npeak carbon dioxide emissions around 2030, while reducing emissions per \nunit of Gross Domestic Product by 60 to 65 percent by that time from \nits 2005 levels. But the U.S. Government's Lawrence Berkeley National \nLaboratory has already predicted China's emissions would peak on their \nown around 2030, even without climate change initiatives. So they don't \nhave any skin in the game.\n  A Bloomberg analysis found that China's 60 to 65 percent target is \nless ambitious than the level it would reach by continuing business as \nusual. All this came before the country admitted it was burning 17 \npercent more coal than previously estimated. That is more coal than the \nentire country of Germany.\n  So, our government, our President, and this administration want to \nbind America to a United Nations treaty.\n  And let's look at the facts. America has been blessed with an \nabundance of energy sources. We should utilize all those sources to the \nbest of our ability--from coal, petroleum, natural gas, solar, wind, \nhydro electric, and even manmade nuclear energy. We should use those to \nthe best of our and society's advantage.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  We should not cripple the American power companies that supply energy \nto the manufacturers of America that employ the American citizens at \nthe whim of an administration's green agenda and is paid for on the \nbacks of hardworking American citizens in the way of lost jobs that go \noverseas because of higher regulations and energy costs, decreased \nwages because of a decrease in competition in the job market, higher \nenergy costs felt by all of our citizens, but more on the lower end, as \nhas been mentioned here, on the economic income scale because a higher \npercentage of their money goes to pay their utility bills.\n  Look at the facts. Geologists think the world may be frozen up again, \n1895.\n  Disappearing glaciers--disappearing glaciers--slowly with a \npersistence that means there is going to be complete annihilation. That \nis in 1902.\n  Professor Schmidt warns us of an encroaching new ice age, 1912.\n  Scientists say Arctic ice will wipe out Canada, 1923.\n  The discoveries of changes in the Sun's heat and the southward \nadvances of glaciers in recent years have given rise to the conjectures \nof the possible advent of a new ice age, 1923 again.\n  Most geologists think the world is growing warmer and that it will \ncontinue to get warmer, 1929.\n  The point of this is the consensus of scientists has been wrong over \nthe course of the years. If you look at recent facts, that 2-degree \nCentigrade benchmark that the scientific community says we can't get \nwarmer than 2 degrees or life on Earth is going to stop to exist as we \nknow it, that is not a scientific number. That is an arbitrary number. \nI did the research on it.\n  That number comes from an economist in 1970 that the environmental \ncommunity has gravitated to. They have used that as a benchmark, and it \nis a fallacy.\n  The Earth's temperature has increased approximately one-half of a \ndegree Centigrade over the past 20 to 30 years. This comes from the \nNASA Web site. I encourage the American people that are watching this \nto go to the NASA Web site. Look at the facts.\n  Also look at that half-a-degree Centigrade increase in our \ntemperature in the world. It partly is attributed to the new way they \nare measuring things today. They are more accurate than they were 20 or \n30 years ago. So that is a variation.\n  The other thing is they predict and they estimate that over 50 \npercent of that half-a-degree Centigrade increase--over 50 percent of \nthat--comes from solar activity, not manmade or anthropogenic causes.\n  So what does that mean? That means do we just not really even look at \nthe causes of these? No. Not at all.\n  Let's look at the facts. Even in left-leaning publications--in fact, \nI brought one here. I don't want to call them left-leaning, but the \narticle in The Economist has a 14-page ``Clear thinking needed'' on \nclimate change.\n  Even in this article they had some fallacies. One of them was saying \nthe warming in the world is 100 percent by human activity. That is a \nfallacy. That is false reporting.\n  The other thing is they go in there and they say that, with all the \nwind power that we have put into the world, around the globe, and all \nthe solar activity around the globe, and the massive government \nprograms to supplement these, it has failed to make a dent in the so-\ncalled manmade CO2 output on a global scale, and it is not \nreliable.\n  All those other forms of energy, the renewables, they are not \nreliable for baseline production, which is needed for national \nsecurity.\n  As I close, I just want to say this: As I said, America has been \nblessed with an abundance of energy sources. So let us, as leaders of \nthis great Nation, make energy policies that are common sense in nature \nand don't entangle us, as a Nation, with other nations that cripple us \nas a Nation not just economically, but they weaken our national \nsecurity, and they are going to be paid for by all Americans and, \nagain, felt mostly by those that can't afford it.\n  This treaty is a bad deal, and the President owes the respect to the \nAmerican people to go through the people's House and the Senate to have \nany agreement binding.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania, and I ask him to continue the \ngood work.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the gentleman from Florida for his remarks.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I would like to just talk about this word denial \nthat we hear thrown around a lot in this debate. There has been no \ndenial, Mr.\n\n[[Page H9073]]\n\nSpeaker, of the benefits that humanity has enjoyed because of fossil \nfuel use over the last decades.\n  Again, I am going to pull up this chart here. The benefits are clear. \nThe lower left graph is GDP per person in the world. It has \nskyrocketed, coincidentally, with the increase of energy use.\n  But life expectancy has skyrocketed over the last 200 years, again, \ncoincident with increased energy use, access to reliable, clean energy.\n  It is no wonder. You consider how energy is deployed. Take water, for \nexample. The tremendous progress that we have made with clean water and \npumping stations and ways to pull water in and to clean it, that is all \ndone using fossil fuel-based energy, whether it is coal, gas, oil. \nThere has been a tremendous success over the last 200 years as humanity \nhas looked for energy and used fossil fuels-based energy products.\n  Mr. Speaker, if President Obama and the unelected Federal bureaucrats \nat EPA had installed today's regulatory regime in the 19th century, my \ndistrict and this country would look vastly different.\n  Access to reliable, affordable energy has improved the quality of \nlife of people wherever it is available, which is why the Clean Power \nPlan is so deeply misguided.\n  It will also raise energy prices again by $289 billion through 2030, \nfulfilling a promise that the President made in 2008 when he said \nelectricity rates would necessarily skyrocket.\n  But minority communities will be especially hard-hit. Again, a study \nfrom the National Black Chamber of Commerce found that the Clean Power \nPlan would increase poverty among African Americans by 22 percent and \nHispanics by 26 percent. This is not acceptable.\n  In addition, the President's energy agenda constrains our energy mix \nand distorts the market to benefit certain politically favored \ntechnologies, regulations that reduce Americans' access to reliable, \naffordable energy sources, endangers our grid stability, putting \nmillions at risk of losing power during times of peak demand.\n  Meanwhile, the Clean Power Plan will avert only two one-hundredths of \na degree Celsius of warming over the next 85 years. That is less than 2 \npercent of 1 degree Celsius. It is not a fair tradeoff.\n  American energy policy should promote economic growth and prosperity \nso that we can tackle our debt. This is such an important point, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  When we have these debates and conversations about whether it is \ngoing on in Paris, whether it is going on in Congress, and we talk \nabout American energy and coal and gas, nuclear, other forms, it is not \nall pain, the pain that those who are running around and saying the sky \nis falling, the sky is falling. Time and again, their predictions have \nbeen proved false.\n\n  It is undeniable, Mr. Speaker, that access to affordable, reliable \nenergy has greatly advanced humanity. And humanity can figure it out. \nWe have made tremendous, tremendous progress with the environment over \nthe last 50, 60 years.\n  Certainly we have seen that in Western Pennsylvania, and that \nprogress is going to continue. It continues, in part, because we have \naccess to great, reliable, abundant, cheap electricity. Fossil fuels \nhave enabled that progress and will continue to enable that progress.\n  As we meet the challenges of a changing climate, Mr. Speaker, it is \nhuman ingenuity that is going to pull us through, human beings, \npersons, empowered to live lives freely.\n  Look what Holland has been able to do with the sea over the last 400 \nyears. Before the advent of all the huge machines that can move dirt \naround, they have been holding back the sea and building levees and \ndikes. It has been remarkable what the people of Holland have been able \nto do, even more so now that we have access to the technologies that we \nhave.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should be leading the world in heavy technology, as \nwe address concerns with rising sea levels.\n  There is no reason, Mr. Speaker, to doubt the capacity of the human \nperson and human ingenuity to overcome these challenges that may face \nus. But we can't be in denial about the fact that fossil fuel energy \nhas been a tremendous boon to humanity.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, we have tremendous challenges--tremendous \nchallenges--ahead in the coming years. We are $18 trillion in debt as a \nNation, and we have tens of trillions of dollars in unfunded liability.\n  We need to be growing like you have never seen before. With access to \ncheap, reliable energy, we will be able to pull ourselves out of debt. \nWe will begin to have that renaissance in our economy.\n  We have to meet those challenges we have. But if we expect to meet \nthose challenges, if we expect to meet the commitments we have made on \nSocial Security for Grandma and Medicare and meet the commitments we \nhave made to our veterans, tens of thousands who have sustained life-\nchanging injuries over the last 14 years, we need to be growing again.\n  A key access to that growth is to have access to abundant, reliable, \ncheap energy. We know what it has done historically: increasing \nincomes, lifting people out of poverty, increasing life expectancy, \nincreasing food production, increasing water purity.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a success story that needs to be told.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9073-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9073-H9074]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           OUR FIRST OPPORTUNITY TO MOVE TO PROTECT AMERICANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I don't propose to take an hour, but I do \npropose to bring a very important issue before the House and before the \nAmerican people. Today we had our first opportunity to really move to \nprotect Americans.\n  Presently, if you are on the no-fly list, which is not easy to get \non--there has to be some very specific reason why you could be a threat \nto American citizens, to the airplane on which you might be traveling, \nor you might be entering this country for some nefarious reason, like \nterrorism.\n  But if you are on the no-fly list and you do happen to be in America, \nyou can go to a gun store or to perhaps any fairground where there is a \ngun show and you can buy a weapon, virtually any gun, an assault \nweapon, a handgun, a shotgun.\n  And the question arises: If you are too dangerous to fly, are you not \ntoo dangerous to buy a gun?\n  But, under American law today, you can, indeed, be too dangerous to \nfly. You could be a threat to the other passengers or to a tower, to an \nairplane. But, apparently, you are not a threat to buy a gun.\n  In fact, there are some 16,000 people, a very small portion of the \nAmerican citizenry, that are on the no-fly list. Since 9/11 in 2001, \nmore than 2,000 men, probably women, who are too dangerous to fly on \nthe no-fly list have been able to purchase guns here in the United \nStates.\n  So let's see if we get this straight. You have been designated by the \nDepartment of Homeland Security and the various Federal Government \nagencies--TSA, FBI, quite possibly the CIA, and others--as being a \nthreat to the security and safety of America and Americans, and you are \nput on a no-fly list, meaning you can't get on an airplane.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  You are not able to buy a ticket, you are not able to travel, and yet \nyou find some way to go down to the local gun store in those States \nthat do not have background checks or maybe a gun show where there are \nno background checks, you present yourself and say: ``Oh, that is a \npretty good-looking AR-14. I'd like to have it.''\n  ``Sure, you got the money?''\n  ``I got the money.''\n  ``Here is the gun.''\n  This makes no sense whatsoever. Somehow I think the American public \ngets this. If you are too dangerous to fly, then you are too dangerous \nto be able to buy a gun in America. It is that simple. There ought to \nbe a law, but there is no law.\n  Here in the House of Representatives, many of us have been trying \nfor, actually, several years to deal with this crazy loophole in our \ngun safety laws; yet we have been unable to have a bill come to the \nHouse floor where 435 of us\n\n[[Page H9074]]\n\nthat represent all of the American citizens will have an opportunity to \nvote on whether we believe that, if you are too dangerous to fly, you \nare too dangerous to buy a gun.\n  So today my fellow Democratic representatives and I--about 135 of us \nthus far--have signed what is known as a discharge petition so that a \nbipartisan piece of legislation introduced by Representative King of \nNew York, who is a Republican, could be brought to the floor and all of \nus face the responsibility of selecting whose side do we stand on. Do \nwe stand for the safety of Americans and prevent people that are too \ndangerous to fly from being able to buy a gun, or do we stand with \nthose on the no-fly list that are presumably dangerous and say: ``Oh, \nyeah, you ought to be able to buy a gun even though you are too \ndangerous to fly''?\n  Now, for my American friends out there, all of you, voters and \nnonvoters, don't you think it is time for your Representatives, 435 of \nus, to stand before you in this House and say: ``We agree that if you \nare too dangerous to fly, then you are too dangerous to buy a gun, and \nyou cannot buy a gun,'' or stand here before all the American public \nand say: ``No, no, no. If you are too dangerous to fly, go ahead and \nbuy a gun''?\n  So, Mr. Speaker, that is what a discharge petition will do. It will \ntake our Republican friend's bill, Mr. King of New York, bring it to \nthe floor and put the issue before your Representatives, before the \nrepresentatives of the American people, and cause us to make a choice \nfor your safety or for the presumed right of a person who is too \ndangerous to fly to be able to buy a gun. It is pretty simple stuff. We \nwill see what happens.\n  That issue is now bubbling around here on the floor. Today there were \nfour motions to adjourn, which is a way of disrupting the normal \nprocedures of the House--which are terribly abnormal to begin with--and \ncausing the attention of the membership of the House and the press from \nthe press box, or wherever they happen to be, to focus on this one--\none--issue: whether those 16,000 or so people that are on the no-fly \nlist can also go out and buy a gun. Two thousand already have.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, we ought to quickly discuss this issue of, \nwell, there is a constitutional issue here, an issue in which these \npeople are on a list but they have no ability to get off--no. Not so. \nNot so. When the no-fly list was first put together following 9/11, the \nissue was raised of the constitutionality of it by the American Civil \nLiberties Organization. It went to a Federal court, and the Federal \ncourt said: No, we disagree with you. We believe this is a \nconstitutionally authorized protection of the American public, and \nthere is a procedure for an individual to petition to get off the list. \nSo this issue of constitutionality was decided some years ago by a \nFederal court.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the arguments that you will undoubtedly hear here \nabout this being, oh, an infringement of the constitutional right for \nan individual to buy a gun, no. This issue has already been resolved. \nIf you are on the no-fly list and you think you shouldn't be there, you \nhave got a procedure, a program underway and available to you to remove \nyourself from the no-fly list, and the court said it meets \nconstitutional muster.\n  So, taking it a step further, we know a lot of Americans of certain \nclasses that cannot buy a gun: criminals, convicted felons, people that \nin some States have been involved in domestic violence, and people that \nhave exhibited mental health issues. Those people are barred in many \ncases from not being able to buy a gun. So we would add to that \ncategory people that our law enforcement agencies have deemed to be \ndangerous, quite possibly terrorists, or abiding and assisting \nterrorist organizations. If you can't fly, we just simply say that you \ncan't buy a gun also--pretty simple.\n  My Republican colleague, Mr. King, is correct. The issue is not \nresolved. The issue will be back before us tomorrow, the 9th day of \nDecember, for those of us that believe that if you are too dangerous to \nfly, you are too dangerous to buy a gun. Those of us that believe this \nto be the right policy will continue to push this issue for the safety \nof Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, 16,000 people may not be able to buy a gun if this \nbecomes law, and that is a good thing, because we know already 2,000 \npeople that are on that no-fly list--actually, more than 2,000--have \nbeen able to buy a gun. What did they do with it? Well, maybe they went \nout and shot quail, or maybe--we pray not, but we don't know, do we?\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the issue is before us, as are many, many important \nissues, but I don't think there is any issue more important than the \nsafety of the American people. We know that if somebody is thought to \nbe dangerous, then they ought not have a gun.\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that this House will see the wisdom of taking a \nsmall step and denying some 16,000 people, many of whom are probably \nnot even American citizens, the opportunity to buy a gun.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9074-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H9074-H9077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  TERRORISM AND OUR RIGHT TO BEAR ARMS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, there has been so much in the news, and our \nfriends here on the floor have been raising questions about \nresponsible, reasonable gun control. We want gun control that does not \nviolate the Second Amendment of the Constitution, the purpose of which \nis to allow citizens to protect themselves. It is not just for hunting, \nbut to allow citizens to protect themselves.\n  The thing that I noticed, Mr. Speaker, in my decade as a judge, the \ncriminals that came before me for crimes involving a gun, I can't \nremember any of them--I think I handled around 6,000 felony cases that \nwent through our court. I can't remember any where they went down to a \ngun store and bought a gun. They stole them or they bought them from \nother criminals. With the 100 million guns that I understand have been \npurchased in recent years, it doesn't look like there will be any \nchance to remove guns from anyone except law-abiding citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been interesting. We inquired, my Republican \nfriends, my colleagues here, we inquired over and over, and still 7 \nyears after President Obama took office, we know that shortly \nthereafter there was a scheme hatched within his administration to sell \nguns to criminals that would get to Mexico and fall into the hands of \ndrug cartels. They didn't adequately monitor them. There was nothing \nput on the guns so they could be traced exactly where they were going. \nWe know one of them was used to kill one of our own government agents. \nSo whether it was intentional, reckless disregard for an American \nGovernment agent's life who was working for the President to have one \nof the President's subsidiaries or employees provide guns in such a way \nthat they would end up killing one American agent and, apparently, \nhundreds of Mexicans--and we don't even know the full extent because we \ncan't get answers from this administration.\n  Eric Holder intentionally withheld evidence. He refused to provide \ninformation. I felt like he should have been impeached and thrown out \nof office. We never got answers about Fast and Furious, but we did see \nemails where, within this administration, even after they got caught, \nthat this administration had facilitated weapons being provided and \nsold to people who would take them to the drug cartels of Mexico. Even \nafter they got caught, they were still wondering if it might be \npossible to use the fact that these guns were being used to create \nviolence to justify attacks on the Second Amendment and taking away \nAmericans' gun rights.\n  Apparently, November was a huge month for the sale of guns; and \napparently, Black Friday, in the past week, has been a record for--not \na record, but just a massive number of guns being sold. I believe I saw \nthere were 185,000 requests for gun purchases on Friday after \nThanksgiving. Regardless of what the number was--that is not completely \naccurate--it is staggering. How many people are now in fear for \nthemselves and their families because of the policies of this \nadministration?\n  Now, because of Fast and Furious and how there were people in the \nadministration that were contemplating the\n\n[[Page H9075]]\n\nsale of guns to drug cartels that this administration facilitated as a \nreason to have more gun control, it does make you question the \nmotivation of some of the administration's policies. We know that, \nespecially in the last 5 years of George W. Bush's Presidency, his \nadministration was vigorously prosecuting gun violations. But in 7 \nyears, this administration has never prosecuted as vigorously as the \nBush administration did in those times. Then we find out that not only \nwere they not prosecuting as vigorously as they did in those last 5 \nyears of the Bush administration, but in recent years, they have been \ncutting back on the prosecution of gun violations.\n  So we find out that, in 2013, gun violation prosecutions by this \nadministration diminished. Then we find out that in 2014, they \ndiminished even further by this administration. Then we find out that \nin 2015, this administration set a record for the last 7 years of \nprosecuting fewer gun violation crimes than any administration--well, \nthis was the lowest year, this year, any of his last 7 years.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, the administration, as they have increased the \ndemand for more gun control to take guns away from law-abiding \ncitizens, they have been decreasing the number of gun violations they \nhave prosecuted. In the wake of this administration's involvement in \nFast and Furious and trying to use it to promote more gun control on \nlaw-abiding citizens, it makes you wonder what is the reason this \nadministration continues to prosecute fewer and fewer gun crimes?\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  It is as if this administration--and I am not saying, Mr. \nParliamentarian, through the Speaker, I am not saying a specific person \nor the President. I am not violating the House rules. But I am saying \nthis administration in bulk, which doesn't violate the House rules, \nsomehow has had this policy of prosecuting fewer and fewer gun crimes \nat the same time they are increasing rhetoric to have more gun control. \nIt is as if--and I am not alleging; I am just saying. It is as if they \nwanted gun violence to increase so that they could get more gun \ncontrol, as it appears their motivation was in using what happened with \ngun violence as a result of the 2,000 weapons they forced gun dealers \nto sell to people they shouldn't have.\n  Well, when I first heard the proposal, gee, nobody who is on the no-\nfly list, can't even fly on a plane, should be able to go buy a gun, \nseemed reasonable. I was talking to my friend, Tom Price from Georgia, \nback here earlier, Mr. Speaker, and he said the same thing, well, that \nseems reasonable, until you start considering how one gets on the no-\nfly list, who has been on the no-fly list, the massive abuses of \nindividual constitutional rights by this administration, the abuses of \nthe IRS of law-abiding citizens that Richard Nixon could have only \ndreamed of abusing the way this administration has.\n  But the trouble is there is no due process for someone to be \nadjudicated to put on the no-fly list. There is no due process to get \noff the no-fly list. And, in fact, one of the men I respect as much as \nanybody I know--he is a constituent; he is an Army veteran; he is a \nretired general, lives in east Texas--we have had to help him a number \nof times, once again, to get off the no-fly list.\n  And, unfortunately, we never can find out why he is ever put on the \nno-fly list in the first place. The only thing I know, he is a devout \nChristian. He is a supporter of mine. He would never knowingly violate \nthe law of the United States.\n  So, I don't know. Is it because he is a supporter of mine? I mean, a \nyear ago, I was trying to fly back from London and an official there in \nLondon airport with their security said: Sir, I understand you are very \nsorry, but your homeland security says you are somebody that has to be \npersonally, physically searched along with everything that you have.\n  Gee, maybe somebody didn't like the way I cross-examined them in the \njudiciary hearing.\n  But when you know that this administration has abused its power \nrepeatedly and you find out that actually the no-fly list is so \nobscure, it is like something from a Kafka novel. I never really \nenjoyed his novels. But the trial, it makes you think of, wow, you mean \nthis obscure government entity can charge you with something, but you \ncan't--just like in a trial, you can't find out what you are charged \nwith. You can't find out why you are on the no-fly list. You can't find \nout if it is part of an enemies list. You can't find out what is the \nbest way to convince the government to get you off.\n  Are there mistakes made? Well, gee, Mr. Speaker, could it be that a \nmistake was made when one of my constituent families from Lufkin was \ngoing to take their dream vacation to Disney World? They felt like the \nkids were old enough to enjoy it now. And when they tried to check \ntheir bags, they couldn't because, of their five children, their middle \nchild was on the no-fly list. He was a potential terrorist.\n  Now, I come from a family of four kids, and if I was going to pick \none of my siblings, including me, to be a terrorist, I would say it is \nprobably the young one. Well, this child was 5 years old. He was the \nmiddle child, not the youngest. They pulled him aside thinking: Well, \ngee, his name is on the no-fly list. He must be a terrorist.\n  Well, thankfully, in Houston, they had some common sense and quickly \nfigured out this is not a terrorist; this 5-year-old kid. He is not. \nNot so when they tried to leave Orlando to fly back home. He was pulled \naside, the 5-year-old. He was separated from his parents. His parents \nwere fit to be tied. They were threatened. They were not allowed to be \nwith their child.\n  They take him off to interrogate him, a 5-year-old child; but he is \non the no-fly list, and they couldn't figure this out. They think he is \na terrorist. They ask him his date of birth. He is freaking out. He is \nseparated from his parents and his other siblings. He knows the month \nand day. He can't tell them the year. So now they think he is \nwithholding information.\n  They endured a lot of counseling and nightmares because of the abuses \nof this administration's policies. And yes, mistakes are made like \nthat; and sometimes when people's names get put on the no-fly list, you \ndon't know what it is for.\n  Here is an article, and I sure don't read from these folks very \noften, but the Los Angeles Times says:\n  ``It seems simple enough: If the Federal Government, based on \nintelligence or policing, puts a person on its watch list of suspected \nterrorists or decrees that he or she is too dangerous to be allowed on \nan airplane, then surely it would also be foolish to let that person \nbuy a firearm in the United States. Makes sense, doesn't it?''\n  That was the thrust of a proposed law by Senator Dianne Feinstein.\n  It goes on down:\n  ``One problem is that the people on the no-fly list, as well as the \nbroader terror watch list from which it is drawn, have not been \nconvicted of doing anything wrong. They are merely suspected of having \nterror connections.''\n  I thought it was outrageous that Senator Ted Kennedy was on the no-\nfly list. I don't know. Maybe Homeland Security knew something the rest \nof America didn't know, but it seemed silly to me. Senator Ted Stevens, \nthe late Senator's wife, Catherine Stevens, her name was on the no-fly \nlist. She had those problems.\n  So it could be that you are guilty of only having a name similar to \nsomebody that was put on the list for who knows why. But that is not a \ngood way to take people's guns away, to say: Yes, we want to pass a law \nso that this administration, behind closed doors, with the lowest \nlearners of this administration, can put people's name on the list that \ncan never buy a gun, can never fly on a plane. That is a scary \nproposition.\n  And how about the 72 Department of Homeland Security employees that \nare on the no-fly list? And then we find out also, thanks to Senator \nJeff Sessions, that we have had two--two--refugees in this country who, \nthis year, have been either charged or convicted of terrorist \nactivities. One worked around O'Hare airport and another one worked \naround here, I believe, as a cab driver working around Reagan airport. \nHow about we take care of the people that we know for sure are a threat \nto America?\n  Anyway, the article from The Washington Times says: ``According to \nthe technology website TechDirt.com, 40 percent of those on the FBI's \nwatch\n\n[[Page H9076]]\n\nlist--about 280,000 people--are considered to have no affiliation with \nrecognized terrorist groups. All it takes is for the government to \ndeclare it has 'reasonable suspicion' that someone could be a \nterrorist. There is no hard evidence required, and the standard is \nnotoriously vague and elastic.''\n  An article from Adam Kredo, from Free Beacon, about the 72 employees. \nA tip of the hat to Congressman Stephen Lynch for finding that \ninformation.\n  This article from Neil Munro, Breitbart, ``California Shooting Shows \nJihad Risk From Muslim Migrants' U.S.-Born Children'':\n  ``The San Bernardino shooter who killed 14 Americans is yet another \nname on the growing list of U.S.-born children of Muslim migrants who \ngrew up to embrace violent jihad.''\n  It seems like somebody has talked about that before.\n  ``Before Syed Rizwan Farook, the most notorious example was Anwar al \nAwlaki, born in New Mexico in 1971 to accomplished, professional-class \nYemeni parents. He subsequently embraced the violent commandments of \nIslam, complete with its many calls for attacks on kaffirs, or non-\nMuslims. His career as a jihadi adviser, recruiter cheerleader ended \nwhen he was killed by a U.S. missile strike in Yemen in September 2011.\n  ``Another example is Nidal Malik Hasan, the Virginia-born son of Arab \nmigrants, who murdered 13 Americans in Fort Hood, Texas, in 2009. That \nattack was downplayed by Federal officials as `workplace violence,' \neven though Hasan had described himself as a `Soldier of Allah' on his \nU.S. Army business cards . . . The problem is worse among Muslims, \nbecause Muslim culture and religion is hostile to integration, Spencer \nsays. `Islamic law announces itself as a superior model for society and \ngovernment so you've got no community-driven reason for Muslims to \nintegrate or adopt American values, because their way is better,' he \nsaid.''\n  Now, that is what Spencer says.\n  But I do know Muslims here in the United States that don't believe \nthat they should adopt sharia law. I have got Muslim friends in \nAfghanistan and all over North Africa and the Middle East. They don't \nwant radical Islam. And, in fact, in Egypt--so proud of the people of \nEgypt--they rose up and said: We don't want radical Islam. Of course, \nthis President, this administration, wants to punish them for throwing \nout the Muslim Brother president.\n  But this article--back to Neil Munro's article--he says:\n  ``In August 2015, the FBI arrested the U.S.-born son of a supposedly \nmoderate Imam as he began his journey to join ISIS in Syria. Mohammad \nOda Dakhlalla was accompanied by his young, university-educated \nAmerican wife, who was a convert to Islam. `That is the quintessential \nexample of the risks involved because the father is supposed to be a \nmoderate and we're supposed to think the son subscribes to a violent \nIslam completely different from the father . . . but there is no \nevidence of a rift between father and son,' Spencer said.\n  ``In October 2014, two U.S.-born teenage girls were nabbed by the FBI \nas they began their journey to Syria.\n  ``The left-wing Southern Poverty Law Center lists at least five \nadditional U.S.-born jihadis, or would-be jihadis, at its site, \nincluding James Elshafay who tried to detonate a bomb in 2004, Ehsanul \nSadequee, Tarek Mehanna, Walli Mujahidh--his family name comes from the \nArab term for `Holy Warrior'--and Naser Jason Abdo, who planned to \nattack Fort Hood in 2011.''\n  So I also would like a tip of the hat, Mr. Speaker, to Secretary Jeh \nJohnson that went back out to the All Dulles Area Muslim Society, ADAMS \nfor short. I am sure John Adams appreciates that very much. I don't \nknow if the President's friend, Imam Magid--oh, wait. Let's see. Well, \nthis article mentions him.\n  ``One of the `most meaningful discussions' on his `tour' ''--talking \nabout Jeh Johnson--``he called it, was in June with the ADAMS Center \nimam, which began with a Boy Scout Troop leading meeting participants \nin the Pledge of Allegiance. That imam, Mohamed Magid, is a past \npresident of the Islamic Society of North America, an organization \nlinked to the Holy Land Foundation in its terror-financing trial and to \nthe Muslim Brotherhood.''\n  And, by the way, it was listed as a co-conspirator in the Holy Land \nFoundation trial for supporting terrorism. And once they got the \nconvictions of the five main people being prosecuted, ISNA, CAIR, and \nsome other folks tried to get their names withdrawn from the pleadings \nbeing specifically named as co-conspirators in support of terrorism. \nBut the Federal district judge and also the U.S. Federal Court of \nAppeals, Fifth Circuit, said: No, there is plenty of evidence to \nsupport that you are co-conspirators in supporting terrorism.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I was told by a lawyer that the plan was, once they got those first \nfive convictions, they would go after ISNA, Imam Magid, and all of \nthese other people. Fortunately, for Imam Magid and ISNA and CAIR and \nall of these groups, President Obama got elected, and Eric Holder \nimmediately made clear that nobody was going to prosecute the rest of \nthose named coconspirators in supporting terrorism.\n  There was also a headline in the news today from The Washington Times \nthat reads: ``Huma Abedin taunts Donald Trump: `I'm a proud Muslim.' ''\n  ``Huma Abedin, the longtime confident to Democratic Presidential \nfront runner Hillary Clinton, took aim at Donald Trump's proposal to \nban Muslims from entering the United States in an email with the \nsubject line: `I'm a proud Muslim.'\n  `` `Donald Trump is leading in every national poll to be the \nRepublican nominee for President; and earlier today, he released his \nlatest policy proposal: to ban all Muslims from entering our country,' \nwrote Ms. Abedin--''or Ms. Weiner, anyway ``--in an email Monday \nevening to Mrs. Clinton's supporters. `I'm a proud Muslim, but you \ndon't have to share my faith to share my disgust. Trump wants to \nliterally write racism into our law books. His Islamophobia doesn't \nreflect our Nation's values.' ''\n  Here is an article from July 27, 2012, by Andrew McCarthy in which he \ntalks about Senator John McCain's claim that concerns about Huma Abedin \nare smear-based on a few unspecified, unsubstantiated associations.\n  Actually, Michele Bachmann and I and three others signed letters in \nwhich we just said, Here are some things we know. Would you do an \ninvestigation to see the extent of the Muslim Brotherhood's influence \nin your department? There were five different departments that had five \ndifferent specific letters, and there were not any vague allegations. \nWe just said, We know these things are true. Would you investigate?\n  We come to find out a lot in this article, which reads:\n  ``The letter averred that Abedin `has three family members: her late \nfather, her mother, and her brother, connected to Muslim Brotherhood \noperatives and/or organizations.'\n  ``It turns out, however, that Abedin, herself, is directly connected \nto Abdullah Omar Naseef, a major Muslim Brotherhood figure.''\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, the Muslim Brotherhood has been named as a \nterrorist organization by both Egypt and the UAE. They have asked \nofficials in both of those countries when I have been over there: Why \ndo you not recognize that the Muslim Brotherhood has been at war with \nyou since 1979? You keep helping them. You have got people advising the \nPresident. They are all Muslim Brothers. Why do you keep doing that? I \ndon't have an answer for them.\n  The article goes on:\n  ``It turns out Abedin, herself, is directly connected to Abdullah \nOmar Naseef, a major Muslim Brotherhood figure involved in the \nfinancing of al Qaeda. Abedin worked for a number of years at the \nInstitute for Muslim Minority Affairs as assistant editor of its \njournal. The IMMA was founded by Naseef, who remained active in it for \ndecades, overlapping for several years with Abedin. Naseef was also \nsecretary general of the Muslim World League in Saudi Arabia, perhaps \nthe most significant Muslim Brotherhood organization in the world. In \nthat connection, he founded the Rabita Trust, which is formally \ndesignated as a foreign terrorist organization under American law due \nto its support of al Qaeda.\n  ``You ought to be able to stop right there,'' but he doesn't. It goes \non. Further down, it reads:\n\n[[Page H9077]]\n\n  ``In this instance, however, before you even start probing the \nextensive, disturbing Brotherhood ties of her family members, Huma \nAbedin should have been ineligible for any significant government \nposition based on her own personal and longstanding connection to \nNaseef's organization.\n  ``Specifically, Ms. Abedin was affiliated with the Institute of \nMuslim Minority Affairs, where she was assistant editor of the Journal \nof Muslim Minority Affairs. The journal was the IMMA's raison d'etre. \nAbedin held the position of assistant editor from 1996 through 2008, \nfrom when she began working as an intern in the Clinton White House \nuntil shortly before she took her current position as Secretary of \nState Hillary Clinton's Deputy Chief of Staff.''\n  Again, this article was written in 2012.\n  ``The IMMA was founded in the late 1970s by Abdullah Omar Naseef, who \nwas then the vice president of the prestigious King Abdulaziz \nUniversity in Saudi Arabia.''\n  It goes on to talk about all of his ties with civilization jihad and \nwith the Muslim World League, over which he presided and with whom Huma \nAbedin had this relationship in this publication for all of those years \nthat she worked with Hillary Clinton.\n  ``The Muslim World League manages the `civilization jihad'--the \nBrotherhood's commitment to destroy the West from within and to \n`conquer' it by sharia proselytism, or dawa, as Sheikh Yusuf Qaradawi, \nthe Brotherhood's top sharia jurist, puts it.\n  ``Nevertheless, the Muslim World League has a long history of deep \ninvolvement in violent jihad as well.''\n  Then we have this article today: `` `Spinning up as we speak': Email \nshows Pentagon was ready to roll as Benghazi attack occurred.''\n  We still don't know who stopped the military. The email shows they \nwere ready to go help our people in Benghazi. Somebody stopped them. \nWas that advice Huma Abedin gave to Secretary Clinton? We don't know. \nWas this advice that reached the President? We don't know. We don't \nknow whether he went to bed and said, ``You take care of it,'' or \nwhether he went next-door, like was reported, until Osama bin Laden was \ntaken out. He went in the next room and didn't watch and played cards. \nWe don't know what they were doing.\n  This report from Robert Windrem: ``The ISIS Trail of Death'' goes on \nto point out all that ISIS is doing. We know there are 1,000 cases \nbeing investigated right here.\n  Look, I am not advocating we get rid of all Muslims in the United \nStates, we have got Muslim friends here in the House, but we do need to \ntake a look to see whether people want to replace our U.S. Constitution \nwith sharia law. We need to take a harder look at who we allow to come \ninto this country and have a child who they will take back to Yemen, or \nwherever, to teach their child to hate America.\n  People can make fun of me still, but we know Americans have died \nbecause we have allowed this to happen. They come back as American \ncitizens whenever they want, and it gets so bad that even President \nObama has to take out an American citizen, who was born here, to \nparents who trained him to hate America after they went back to Yemen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9077-1", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Mooney of West Virginia (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for \ntoday until 4:30 p.m. on account of medical reasons.\n  Mr. Lewis (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/12/08/house-section/article/H9077-2", "month": "12", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H9077]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GOHMERT.
