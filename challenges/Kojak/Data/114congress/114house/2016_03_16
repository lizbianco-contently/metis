The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Abraham) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to draw attention to my home \nState of Louisiana, where thousands of people throughout the State, and \nin my congressional district particularly, are dealing with the \naftermath of widespread flooding.\n  Beginning on Wednesday of last week, heavy rains began falling across \nnortheast Louisiana. By Friday, we had recorded over 2 feet of rain. \nCreeks and lakes overflowed. Water topped levees and spilled into \nneighborhoods. State highways looked like rivers, and parking lots \nlooked like ponds.\n  Since the flood began, I have visited a number of parishes throughout \nmy district. Whether it was in north, central, or southeast Louisiana, \nthe one constant was there were far, far too many people hurting.\n  As of yesterday, at least four people had died from the flood in \nLouisiana. Nearly 15,000 homes had been reported damaged, and the \nnumber will definitely grow. More than 6,800 people have requested help \nfrom FEMA, and that number will likely grow as well.\n  Lives were changed last week, and we have a long way to go to \nrecover. The President has approved, at the request of the Governor, \nFederal disaster aid for most parishes affected. This is a great, great \nthing, and we need it. I appreciate that support very much.\n  I have lived in Louisiana all my life. I still live in a soybean \nfield in northeast Louisiana not far from where I grew up in a \ncornfield, also close to my home. I have seen a lot of things in my \ntime and I have seen a lot of rain come, but I have never seen as much \nrain as we received last week.\n  Unfortunately, Louisiana is all too familiar with disasters. In the \nlast 10 years, we have seen five hurricanes, an oil spill, and now this \nhorrific flooding. But each time we face adversity, Louisiana and her \npeople respond. We follow Christ's commandment, which is to love and \nhelp one another.\n  I have been so inspired by the way our communities across Louisiana \nhave answered the call to serve: packing sandbags in the wee hours of \nthe morning, volunteering at shelters, cooking food for relief workers, \nhousing stranded family members; and sometimes people who are not even \nknown to these people, they are taking them into their homes. The acts \nof kindness just keep coming and coming, and we need more of them to \nkeep coming.\n  There is one group of individuals I want to especially recognize, and \nthat is our first responders. The National Guard has rescued over 3,295 \npeople so far. Sheriffs, deputies, other law enforcement officials, and \nfirefighters are still tallying their numbers because they have saved \nso many lives. These men and women have logged countless hours and put \nthemselves in harm's way to save the lives of others.\n  I have heard stories of some officers using makeshift rafts to pull \npeople from flooded homes and getting them out before waters overtook \ntheir home.\n  I have seen videos of the National Guard with Black Hawk helicopters \nrappelling into floodwaters and pulling people to safety who were \nclinging to trees. I saw one instance where a gentleman had been in a \ntree for up to 2 days.\n  It is just incredible what our first responders have done.\n  There is another story about our power company employees saving a man \nwhose truck was swept off the road by water. Again, he had been in a \ntree, hanging on for life, for 2 full days before he was saved.\n  Story after story in parish after parish show the incredible strength \nour Louisianians have and the first responders' abilities and their \ncaring and what they have done for our State.\n  The rains have stopped for now, but we are not in the clear by any \nmeans. The water is pushing most of our rivers over their flood stages \nin a big, big way. I hope another round of floods isn't on the way.\n  In Louisiana, we know how to bounce back from adversity, but we will \nonly do so with the continued generosity of those who are in a position \nto help others. I ask the Nation to remember Louisiana in its prayers \nas we continue and start the process of rebuilding.\n\n[[Page H1392]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1392-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   A REALISTIC INFRASTRUCTURE AGENDA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, the tortured Presidential nominating \nprocess continues with generalities and insults, but maybe we could \navert our eyes and attention for a moment and consider some real \nchallenges that we face closer at hand.\n  The backdrop in the metropolitan area in Washington, D.C., is that \nD.C. Metro has shut down for the entire day to deal with safety \nconcerns--an unprecedented step. The bigger issue for most people in \nthe region, for most riders and potential users, is the system's \nreliability.\n  It is a symbol of a lack of resources and a lack of leadership, not \njust for Metro, but for the States of Virginia, Maryland, the District \nof Columbia, and the Federal Government itself. They have, sadly, been \nlacking in leadership, in vision, and providing the resources for this \nvital system for a region of approximately 4 million people.\n  At the same time, we have a looming water and sewer crisis, almost 2 \nmillion miles of pipe, in some cases long past its useful life. A water \nmain breaks every 2 minutes. We have serious problems with system \nreliability with sewage.\n  The city of Flint, Michigan, and its terrible situation with lead in \nthe drinking water has captured attention, but it has also pointed out \nfor people who look deeper that this is a problem that afflicts \ncommunities across the country. We have, according to the American \nSociety of Civil Engineers, an overall grade, as a country, of D \ndealing with sewer and water challenges.\n  What if the major candidates would train their attention on serious \nproposals to deal with the infrastructure crisis already upon us? Not \nmere generalities, but let's talk about how they would pay for it. What \nis their vision to deal with multiple needs, and how would they set \npriorities?\n  It is not really that hard. In a number of very red States, \ngovernments have stepped up to raise the gas tax and fund \ntransportation. In metropolitan communities across the country, in red \nStates and blue, people are dealing with their challenges, proposing to \ntheir communities funding and vision to solve the problem.\n  I have got bipartisan legislation to establish a Federal water \ninfrastructure trust fund to help start in that regard.\n  We ought to fix the transportation funding. There is broad support \namongst labor, business, profession AAA truckers to raise the gas tax \nand be able to deal with our transportation challenges.\n  Finally, we should embrace technology in transportation, things from \nself-driving, autonomous vehicles, electronic payment for road systems, \na road user charge being experimented on in the State of Oregon. These \nare mechanisms that would help us update, modernize, and make these \nsystems more effective.\n  And by the way, when you hear all those candidates talking about \nstrengthening the middle class and the economy, these proposals would \nput millions of people to work at family-wage jobs in every community \nacross America. It would strengthen safety and liveability and bring \npeople together.\n  You know, when we have faced up to infrastructure challenges, whether \nit is Dwight Eisenhower's interstate freeway system, what we have done \nin the past with clean water and clean air, those are things that are \nbroadly supported by Americans. An infrastructure agenda, a realistic \ninfrastructure agenda has the potential of bringing people together \nwhile it strengthens America, and it would certainly be a nice change \nof pace.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1392-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1392]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF KRIS ANNE VOGELPOHL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Weber) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WEBER of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor and to \ncelebrate the life of Kris Anne Vogelpohl of Galveston. Many know Kris \nAnne Vogelpohl as the matriarch of the Galveston County Republican \nParty.\n  Kris Anne made her way from Colorado to Galveston, where she became \nchief therapeutic dietician at the University of Texas Medical Branch \nin 1950. It was at UTMB where she met her future husband, Dr. Elmer \nVogelpohl.\n  Kris Anne didn't waste any time getting involved in the community and \nlocal politics, too. In fact, in 1955, Kris Anne became one of the \nfounding members of the Galveston Republican Women. From there, she \nsolidified her GOP trailblazer status by becoming chairwoman of the \nGalveston Republican Party, where she thereupon built a strong \nfoundation for the party to grow and build on.\n  In addition to her political service, Kris Anne was an avid \nphilanthropist within the community. One of the organizations she \ninvested her time in was the Salvation Army, where she joined their \ncounty advisory board in 1959.\n  Kris Anne's unwavering commitment to the betterment of society was a \nsight to behold, Mr. Speaker. She made everyone feel so welcomed. She \nempowered so many people to take charge and get involved. Her \nenthusiasm for making our county, our State, and our country even \ngreater was infectious. The proof is in the pudding. Galveston has \nbecome one of the strongest Republican counties along the Gulf Coast \nand in Texas.\n  Dr. Vogelpohl could often be seen with Kris Anne in event after event \nall over Galveston County. You talk about stalwarts, Mr. Speaker. My \nprayer is that we all be such sterling examples to those who come \nbehind us. Lord knows that Dr. Elmer, as I call him, and Kris Anne \nwere--or make that are, quite frankly.\n  Kris Anne lived to be 90 years old. She was married for 55 years and \nis survived by her husband, two children, and six grandchildren.\n  Kris Anne may be gone, but in reality she is still here. She will \nforever be in the hearts and minds of the people she touched.\n  Mr. Speaker, my thoughts and my prayers are with Dr. Elmer, their \nchildren, their grandchildren, and with the great multitude of friends \nshe served. My prayer is also may the Great Shepherd of the Sheep, even \nthe Lord Jesus Christ, wrap them up in His loving arms and comfort \nthem. May He bless them and keep them. May God bless them all, and may \nGod bless the great State of Texas and Galveston County that Kris Anne \nloved so much.\n  In a wonderful way, He has been blessing us. He loaned us Kris Anne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1392-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1392-H1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n               HONORING THE LIFE OF OFFICER JACAI COLSON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, it is with great sorrow that I rise today \nto pay tribute and honor the life of Prince George's County Police \nOfficer Jacai Colson, who was killed in the line of duty.\n  Line-of-duty deaths are always difficult to bear. A police officer or \nanother first responder leaves their home, their station, or their \nvehicle, and their loved one, coworker, or partner expects to see them \nreturn.\n  My heart breaks for Jacai's loved ones and for the tight-knit \ncommunity that is the Prince George's County Police Department.\n  On March 12, 2016, an off-duty detective, Police Officer First Class \nJacai Colson, arrived at the District 3 police station in Landover, \nMaryland, with the intent of visiting a fellow officer, when matters \ntook an unexpected turn for the worse.\n  We will continue to learn the details of this tragedy in the coming \ndays. What we do know is that Officer Colson's actions saved lives and \nallowed his fellow officers to neutralize the threat, even as he made \nthe ultimate sacrifice.\n  On behalf of the citizens of the Fourth Congressional District of \nMaryland, I want to extend my appreciation to Officer Colson for his \nselfless and heroic actions and his relentless dedication to public \nservice.\n  I would like to remember the legacy Officer Colson leaves behind. He \nwas a Pennsylvania native who played quarterback at Chichester High \nSchool in\n\n[[Page H1393]]\n\nBoothwyn, Pennsylvania, where he graduated.\n  Officer Colson then went on to play wide receiver and defensive back \nat Randolph-Macon College in Ashland, Virginia. His college football \ncoach recalled Colson as ``a really respectful kid and just a high-\ncharacter young man. To be honest, he wasn't a great player, but he was \na really great person.''\n  Officer Jacai Colson was the grandson of a career police officer. He \nhimself joined the Prince George's County Police Department. After 2 \nyears of service on the force, he joined the narcotics department. \nOfficer Colson worked as an undercover detective. Later this week would \nhave been his 29th birthday.\n  I well know how difficult a job our local police officers have. They \nare tasked with the tremendous responsibility of meeting the \nincreasingly diverse needs of growing populations with diminishing \nresources.\n  At a time of so much national discussion about the relationship of \nlaw enforcement to our local communities, Officer Colson reminds us all \nof the important service and sacrifice of our men and women in blue.\n  Unfortunately, his death makes three officers that have been shot and \nkilled in Maryland in 2016. Last month two officers from the Harford \nCounty Sheriff's Office were fatally shot: Senior Deputy Mark Logsdon \nand Senior Deputy Patrick Dailey.\n  Today our police officers are being asked to be the first line of \ndefense in our war on terror in addition to carrying out more \ntraditional police work.\n  I want to thank them for their commitment to the citizens and \nfamilies of this great State. They are Maryland's heroes, and they have \nmy utmost respect and support.\n  Officer Jacai Colson's record of service was characterized by \nsacrifice, hard work, dedication to duty, and, most of all, by \nachievement. He leaves behind a legacy of service that others can and \nshould aspire to.\n  Now that his time on Earth has come to a needlessly premature end, it \nis my hope that Officer Jacai Colson has found the peace he has earned. \nOn behalf of this House, I extend my sincerest gratitude and \ncondolences to James and Sheila Colson, his parents; his entire family; \nfriends; Prince George's County Police Chief Hank Stawinski; Major \nKathleen Mills, District 3 Commander; the entire Prince George's County \nPolice Department; and the Fraternal Order of Police Lodge 89.\n  May God continue to comfort and sustain each of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1393-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1393]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              AMICUS BRIEF ON BEHALF OF THE U.S. V. TEXAS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nMissouri (Mrs. Wagner) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H. Res. 639.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are a Nation of immigrants. But, more importantly, we \nare a Nation of laws. We are also a Nation governed by a Constitution, \na Constitution designed by our Founders to protect the people from \ngovernment.\n  This same Constitution enumerates specific powers to the executive, \nlegislative, and judicial branches, these same powers that this \nPresident has decided he does not need to uphold.\n  As a result, we, as a united legislative body, will act this week \nagainst the President's executive amnesty and overreach. We must act \nbecause it is time that Congress--Republicans and Democrats--stand up \nfor the Constitution of the United States and against President Obama, \nwho has decided to turn his back on the American people.\n  We must act because the security and economic opportunity that \nAmericans are so desperate for today come with respecting, not \nundermining, the spirit of self-government for which our Nation was \nfounded.\n  Mr. Speaker, the President knows that he is not permitted to write \nlaws. Yet, through his executive amnesty, he is directly attacking \nCongress' Article I power.\n  Today Congress will once again say no to President Obama. We will \ncome together as an institution representing the American people to \npromote self-government.\n  I will vote in favor of the resolution on behalf of the great people \nof Missouri's Second Congressional District and in defense of the \npowerful words of James Madison in 1788:\n  ``The accumulation of all powers, legislative, executive, and \njudiciary, in the same hands, whether of one, a few, or many, and \nwhether hereditary, self-appointed, or elective, may justly be \npronounced the very definition of tyranny.''\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of this resolution and prevent \nthis very tyranny we see today.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nHawaii (Ms. Gabbard) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, there were two votes that occurred earlier \nthis week on House Concurrent Resolution 75 and House Concurrent \nResolution 121, which deal with very important and complex issues that \nI would like to talk about this morning.\n  I cosponsored and voted for House Concurrent Resolution 75 because of \nmy grave concern about the genocide occurring against Christians, \nAlawites, Shiites, Druze, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in \nSyria.\n  However, I was extremely disappointed by amendment language that was \nlater added to this resolution that provides cover or an excuse for \nISIS and other terrorist organizations committing this genocide.\n  Specifically, the language I object to is the following: ``The \nprotracted Syrian civil war and the indiscriminate violence of the \nAssad regime have contributed to the growth of ISIL and will continue \nto do so as long as this conflict continues.''\n  I fully reject this amendment to the resolution because it gives \nmoral legitimacy to the actions of ISIS, al Qaeda, and others who are \ncommitting genocide against Christians, Yazidis, and other religious \nminorities in Syria.\n  This amendment is an obvious attempt to make ISIS look like their \ncause is legitimate. This is absolutely unacceptable and undermines the \nvery heart and intent of this resolution.\n  This is very unfortunate because the problem of the genocide against \nChristians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities in Syria is very \nserious.\n  In fact, the main area in Syria where Christians and other religious \nminorities have any protection today from being slaughtered and where \nthey can practice their religious faith without fear of prosecution is \nin the territory that is still controlled by the Syrian Government of \nAssad.\n  The reality is that the language added to this resolution, coupled \nwith its sister resolution, House Concurrent Resolution 121, is really \naimed at justifying the overthrow of Assad, the result of which would \nbe a complete assault and elimination of Christians and other religious \nminorities in Syria.\n  The fact that this resolution, which was originally introduced to \nincrease protection for Christians, Yazidis and other religious \nminorities, has now been hijacked so that it becomes a vehicle to \nincrease the likelihood of an even greater genocide against those \nreligious minorities is an absolute disgrace.\n  The reality is that, if the Assad regime is overthrown tomorrow, \nevery Christian, every Yazidi, and every other religious minority and \nethnic minority in Syria will be in even greater danger than ever \nbefore from the genocide being perpetrated by ISIS, al Qaeda, and \nothers who are slaughtering them.\n  This resolution is no longer a sincere effort to protect religious \nminorities. It has instead become a resolution to give more legitimacy \nto ISIS and al Qaeda's genocidal activities and would bring about an \neven greater genocide of those religious minorities by eliminating the \nonly area where they now have refuge.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1393-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1393-H1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING PRINCETON, INDIANA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to an \noutstanding community in Indiana's Eighth Congressional District.\n\n[[Page H1394]]\n\n  It is no secret that the Hoosier State is home to hardworking, \ninnovative, and compassionate people. In the Eighth District, we are \nleading the way.\n  Today I want to highlight a couple of great accomplishments in \nPrinceton, Indiana.\n  Earlier this month high school senior Jackie Young, a star guard at \nPrinceton Community High School, was awarded the Naismith Trophy. This \nprestigious award is presented annually to the men and women's college \nand high school basketball players who achieve great success on the \ncourt and solidifies Jackie as the Nation's top high school woman \nbasketball player.\n  To us in southern Indiana, the award comes as no surprise. With 3,268 \ncareer points, Jackie is Indiana's all-time leading scorer. She is a \nnatural leader on and off the court.\n  Congratulations to Jackie. We wish her all the best as she prepares \nfor her next step, playing for Notre Dame.\n  Additionally, a community leader and anchor of our local economy, \nToyota Motor Manufacturing, will soon celebrate the 20th anniversary of \nits ground breaking in Gibson County.\n  Over the past 20 years, the plant has been a leader in economic \ndevelopment for our region, providing thousands of jobs and supporting \nlocal organizations.\n  I have had the pleasure of meeting many of the hardworking and \ndedicated team members at Toyota in Princeton. These men and women make \nquality products in Indiana that are being sold across the country and \naround the world, and they take pride in doing it.\n  On behalf of all Hoosiers across the Eighth District, I thank \neveryone at Toyota Motor Manufacturing for your continued commitment to \nour community and congratulate them on this tremendous milestone.\n  As one of Indiana's designated Stellar Communities, Princeton is, \nwithout a doubt, a shining example of what our great State has to \noffer.

They put pressure on the other \nside.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The MVP of the game was Alexus Dye, who scored 12 points and grabbed \n10 rebounds. ``Our defense is what got us here and led us to the win,'' \nsaid Dye.\n  The other star of the team was Wenonah's very own Kaitlyn Rodgers, \nwho scored 12 points, grabbed 14 rebounds, blocked 6 shots, handed out \n3 assists, and added 2 steals. ``This is what we came here for, and we \nwant to go out with a bang,'' said Rodgers.\n  Mr. Speaker, more noteworthy is the fact that, according to Coach \nBell, ``Every kid on my time averages a 3.0 GPA or higher. It's easy to \ncoach players with academic and athletic talent,'' says Coach Bell.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate the month of March as Women's \nHistory Month, recognizing trailblazing women throughout our history, \nclearly these young women have blazed their own remarkable path, both \nathletically and academically as student athletes, and we are happy, \nproud to commend them.\n  So on behalf of Alabama's Seventh Congressional District, I want to \nextend a heartfelt congratulations to these outstanding players and to \nCoach Bell.\n  While March Madness has gripped the rest of the State and the Nation, \nin Birmingham, Alabama, we are very proud of Wenonah High School's Lady \nDragons. I am confident that these young ladies have bright futures \nahead of them, and we will look back on these 3 consecutive years of \nchampionship wins with great accomplishment and pride.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1394-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1394]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, this weekend we learned \nthat ISIL/Daesh has continued their use of chemical attacks against \ninnocent civilians, including children, with two attacks in northern \nIraq. Over 600 people suffered burns, suffocation, and dehydration. \nAnd, sadly, a young child, Fatima, died from Saturday's murderous \nattack.\n  Officials have confirmed that ISIL has used chlorine and low-grade \nmustard gas to kill, incapacitate, and incite fear. Recent news reports \nsay ISIL developed a special unit for chemical and biological attacks, \nwhich is a threat to American families.\n  It is sad that the President's legacy is weakness. He has not \nsubmitted a plan to Congress to defeat ISIL, and has repeatedly \nbelittled their threat of\n\n[[Page H1395]]\n\nmass murder to American families. His legacy of failure is drowned \nchildren fleeing violence and dead children from chemical attacks.\n  I am grateful that the House of Representatives took a decisive \nstance against ISIL this week, accurately calling actions against \nChristians and other minorities genocide.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n  God bless Hammond School.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1395-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1395]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           STOP THE GENOCIDE\n\n  (Mr. SCHIFF asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SCHIFF.

A member of the air \ncavalry, he piloted Hueys under fire.\n  He was one of the most highly decorated officers in Vietnam and was \nawarded the Distinguished Service Cross, five Silver Stars, and two \nPurple Hearts.\n  After Vietnam, General Bahnsen continued his service and helped to \nestablish the National Training Center, where our soldiers prepare for \ndeployment overseas.\n  In retirement, Doc has remained an active alumni at the Academy. He \nfrequently travels to West Point to give lectures to cadets and is a \nleading booster for the West Point Rugby Team.\n  General Bahnsen is a true role model for America, and we should all \nstrive to ascribe to his virtues.

The gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Walden) and \nthe gentleman from Iowa (Mr. Loebsack) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most important responsibilities we have as a \nCongress, I think, is to protect and advocate for those who may not \nhave the power themselves or the influence or the armies of lawyers to \ncontend with the redtape that all too often is created by our own \ngovernment.\n  The bill we are considering today helps them. It does just that. It \nrelieves, we believe, an unnecessary regulatory burden on really small \nInternet service providers, the little ISPs out there all over our \ndistricts across the land that are struggling to compete in this \nmarketplace.\n  By extending an exemption to the Federal Communications Commission's \nenhanced transparency rules, this bill allows these small businesses to \nfocus on their core mission which, by the way, is providing broadband \nInternet access to customers all across America.\n  Over the last few months, we have spent a great deal of time focused \non this issue. We first raised concerns with the Federal Communications \nCommission itself in a November letter from the Republican members of \nthe Communications and Technology Subcommittee, as well as the Small \nBusiness Committee.\n  We urged the Chairman of the Federal Communications Commission, Tom \nWheeler, to not only make the exemption that they had already had in \ntheir rules permanent, but also to raise that threshold for defining \nwhat a small business is to bring it in line with the definitions \npreviously blessed by the Small Business Administration itself.\n  Well, the FCC, instead, extended the exemption for just 1 year. That \nis hardly time enough from these very onerous reporting requirements to \nmake a difference, a 1-year extension.\n  Despite the overwhelming support in the record for a permanent \nextension, it was clear that Congress needed to act because the FCC \nwouldn't. So I introduced a discussion draft to get the conversation \ngoing that would permanently extend the exemption and would increase \nthe threshold by defining a small business to match the definition used \nby the Small Business Administration itself.\n  We had a hearing in January on this draft. We heard from a small \nbusiness, an Internet service provider from a small community, who \nshared the dilemma that I think was indicative of what other small ISPs \nface in these circumstances.\n  Should they put up new equipment and expand and improve their \nservice?\n  Or if they have to comply with all these reporting requirements \ncalled for by the FCC, they said, look, I am going to have to spend the \nmoney, instead, on hiring lawyers and other compliance officers to meet \na reporting requirement that is new.\n  Should they improve service for customers, or should they devote \nthose financial resources to sifting through regulatory language and \ndrafting expensive and extensive reports on esoteric metrics like \n``packet loss''?\n  Now, often these small Internet service providers provide service to \nareas in the country that are rural, very rural, remote, or may not be \nas easy to serve or provide competitive options to customers of larger \nISPs.\n  We should be making all efforts to promote the viability of these \nupstarts, these businesses, these small entrepreneurs that are trying \nto fill the gaps, serve and compete in this very competitive \nmarketplace.\n  We should not be saddling them with additional requirements designed \nto snuff them out, basically, and that would make it more difficult for \nthem to do the business that they want to participate in.\n  While there was some initial disagreement about how to ease some of \nthese regulatory burdens, Mr. Speaker, Representative Loebsack and I \nwere able to come to a compromise through some very serious \nnegotiations. It worked out well, the legislative process.\n  We both agreed there is a problem. We said, okay, I don't really like \nthis number; what about that number? We kept a focus on the mission and \non the goal, which was to prevent this overreach of the Federal \nGovernment in the regulatory realm.\n  So in our amended bill, we extend the exemption from this reporting \nrequirement to 5 years. It seems like a reasonable number. This gives \ngreater regulatory certainty to these very small Internet service \nproviders looking for stability and predictability when they are making \nsome, frankly, pretty expensive investment decisions on equipment and \naccess and expansion.\n  In addition, we increased the threshold for what is defining a small \nbusiness from what the FCC had, and required the Federal Communications \nCommission to report back to Congress on this exemption, along with \ndata about small ISPs that is currently lacking.\n  They don't have all the data we think they need, so as their \noverseer, we are telling the FCC, go look at this, tell us what it \nmeans, come back to us. And we put a sunset on this as well so that \nCongress will have the opportunity in a couple of years to come back \nand say this makes sense; does it still make sense; is it in the best \ninterest of consumers and innovation and development of technology in \nthe marketplace.\n  In the end, I think this legislation represents a really solid, \nthoughtful compromise that will relieve the burdens for our smallest \nInternet service providers while leaving in place really important \nprotections for consumers, Mr. Speaker.\n  See, this does not wipe out what they have to do to serve customers, \nthe laws they have to follow, all that. That stays. We just said, you \ndon't have to do this really burdensome, costly, technical reporting to \nthe government.\n  It is important to note that this bill does not affect the bright-\nline rules for managing traffic or the transparency rules adopted in \nthe FCC's 2010 rules. Customers will continue to have access to those \ndisclosures they have come to expect, with the information needed to \nmake informed decisions about their Internet service.\n  So I would like to thank my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle, the ranking member of the subcommittee, Ms. Eshoo, as well as, \ncertainly, Mr. Loebsack, for working well with us on this bill.\n  I would like to particularly thank Kelsey Guyselman, from the \nmajority committee staff, and Ashley Shillingsburg from Representative \nLoebsack's staff--I hope I said that right--for their hard work in \ngetting together and working this out.\n  This bipartisan process has resulted in a strong piece of \nlegislation, and I am confident it will actually protect many and \npromote continued network investment and build-out by small business so \nwe have a more vibrant, competitive marketplace and more service into \nareas that otherwise might\n\n[[Page H1398]]\n\nnot ever get access to high-speed broadband which, as you know, Mr. \nSpeaker, is really important in places like Tennessee and Oregon and \nIowa.\n  This legislation represents a commonsense approach to a problem that \ndirectly impacts so many of our constituents, and this solution will \nenable our country to continue its leadership in broadband deployment.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to join us in this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, broadband development is a critical issue for my home \nState of Iowa, as it is for Congressman Walden's home State of Oregon, \nas it is for so many rural areas, in particular.\n  We all know how important Internet access is for our constituents. \nOur students need access to the Internet to do their homework. Our \nbusinesses need the Internet to participate in the global economy and \nengage in the ever-growing world of e-commerce. Our healthcare \nproviders need Internet access to serve patients with innovative \ntelemedicine tools.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Our constituents simply can't compete in the 21st century economy \nthat we live in without access to the Internet. It is really that \nsimple.\n  Broadband deployment is especially important in our country's rural \nareas. Less than half--only 47 percent--of Americans living in rural \nareas have access to broadband. We as legislators need to do what we \ncan to get these essential services to our constituents.\n  This bill is a commonsense, bipartisan measure, and I thank \nCongressman Walden for working with me on this bill that will help \nsmall Internet service providers throughout the country deploy \nbroadband and serve our constituents.\n  In my home State of Iowa, we have 134--that is 134. We have 99 \ncounties but 134 individual small ISPs. The smallest provider in our \nState is based in my district and serves only 100 subscribers.\n  As a whole, these companies serve a median of only 750 subscribers. I \nam proud of the work done by these small businesses that serve the \nfamilies and businesses that live on farms or in small towns that \notherwise might not have any options.\n  Small ISPs do not have the resources that the bigger guys do, and \nthat is the important thing to remember with this bill. I support the \nFCC's enhanced transparency rules, and I think that it is important to \nmake sure that consumers have the information they need to make \ninformed decisions and to make sure they are protected. It is also \nimportant that we find a balance between providing consumers with \ntechnical information about their Internet and making sure that \nconsumers have access in the first place.\n  I have heard from small businesses in my district that these rules as \nproposed by the FCC will pose a significant burden and consume critical \nresources, potentially limiting their ability to invest in broadband \ndevelopment. For example, they have told me they would have to buy \nspecial equipment to measure things like packet loss on their networks. \nThese are companies that may have only one technician on staff, so you \ncan imagine the burden.\n  To address these burdens, this bill would continue the FCC's \nexemption of small business from the enhanced transparency rules for 5 \nyears. It also instructs the FCC to gather data to determine the \nimpacts of these rules so that we can revisit this issue down the road. \nWhen we revisit the issue, we have the opportunity then to figure out \nthe best way to implement these important consumer protections going \nforward.\n  This short-term exemption gives small ISPs some much-needed \ncertainty, allowing them to focus their resources on broadband \ndeployment and thus serving their consumers.\n  I am glad that Mr. Walden and I were able to work together on a \nbipartisan compromise, and I thank our respective staffs as well. They \ndid a great job.\n  While the original bill would have permanently exempted companies \nfrom the FCC's rule, this bill sunsets after 5 years, giving companies \ntime to comply and giving the FCC time to report back to Congress on \nthe real impact of these rules on consumers.\n  The original bill would have also exempted companies with 500,000 \nsubscribers and 1,500 employees. I and others on the subcommittee were \nconcerned that this threshold was simply too high, and we were able to \ncome to an agreement to exempt ISPs serving half that many subscribers.\n  So this bill before us will give the certainty that small ISPs need, \nand it will help us achieve what I think we are all working for here, \nwhich is both expanded broadband access and the consumer protections \nthat are needed by our constituents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he my consume to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Latta). He is a very capable and able vice \nchair of the Subcommittee on Communications and Technology and a man \nfrom Ohio who has done incredible work on a whole range of these \ncommunications issues.\n  Mr. LATTA. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4596, the Small Business \nBroadband Deployment Act. This legislation limits the regulatory burden \non small Internet service providers, ISPs, serving rural America, just \nlike in my area, and allows them to focus on improving services for \nconsumers.\n  The Federal Communications Commission's 2015 Open Internet Order \nincluded enhanced transparency rules for ISPs, requiring disclosure of \ncommercial terms for prices and other fees and a number of complicated \nperformance metrics. The FCC recognized that the burden of compliance \nwould fall disproportionately on smaller providers and offered \nregulatory relief by temporarily exempting ISPs with 100,000 \nsubscribers or fewer.\n  Today's bipartisan action will extend the exemption to 5 years and \nexpand the definition of small broadband providers to fewer than \n250,000 subscribers. This commonsense proposal will help small and \nrural broadband providers across my district focus on investing in \nnetworks, deploying broadband, improving connectivity, and creating \njobs.\n  I thank Chairmen Upton and Walden, Ranking Member Pallone, and \nCongressman Loebsack for working together on this bill. I am proud to \nsupport H.R. 4596 and believe it will protect vital small ISPs who \nserve all of our constituents.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Eshoo), the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nCommunications and Technology.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding me the \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this bill, H.R. 4596, the Small \nBusiness Broadband Deployment Act. There has been a lot said about it, \nand anyone who tunes in, it is not as complicated as it sounds.\n  We know what the Internet represents. We know we want to expand \nbroadband in our country. We know especially in the rural areas of our \ncountry that broadband and all that it represents has not reached \neveryone, and there are many small businesses that are working hard to \nbring broadband into the areas where people do not have access.\n  We also have some critical protections for the consumers of \nbroadband, and we wanted to make sure that we could protect the \nconsumer but also not burden the small businesses, and that is what \nthis legislation represents.\n  I am pleased that the bill includes the 5-year sunset provision, \nwhich is going to provide the FCC more time to study whether or not the \nexemption should be made permanent and how a small ISP should be \ndefined.\n  So, long story short, I think that this is a good bill. It represents \na bipartisan effort, and I hope it works out the way the promises are \nbeing made about it.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time each side \nhas remaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 21\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Iowa has 24 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished and very \neffective majority leader of the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n[[Page H1399]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his work on this.\n  Mr. Speaker, government policy is stuck in the past. Regulators from \n20th century agencies are trying to manage and control a 21st century \nworld--and it isn't working.\n  The world is too complex and individual situations are too unique for \na big, bulky government to try to apply standards to everyone. And \nevery time government tries to micromanage the markets or the free \nexchange of ideas or the development of new technology, our country and \nour people fall behind. We lose out on new companies, new jobs, and new \nservices.\n  So, in the House, we want to free innovators from Silicon Valley to \nBoston by removing the obstacles that hold us back. We want \nbreakthrough technologies and positive disruption that ensures American \nleadership around the world and brings government itself into the 21st \ncentury. It is our innovation initiative.\n  Today, thanks to Greg Walden, we have the first bill from the \ninnovation initiative on the floor, protecting the Internet for \nhundreds of thousands of users.\n  The Internet is arguably the most dynamic contributor to a growing \neconomy and higher quality of life in the world. It delivers \ninformation and education, supports new businesses and workers, and \nincreases our ability to communicate and experience the world.\n  But right now, small Internet service providers that bring Internet \nto homes and businesses in less populated parts of the United States \nworry that the Washington bureaucracy will swoop in and impose \nregulations on them, and this will create a compliance burden that \ncould put them out of business.\n  These small providers don't have enough resources to navigate the \nbureaucratic maze and bring broadband to communities at the same time. \nIf these small Internet service providers go under, it could leave many \npeople with limited Internet access or no access at all.\n  The administration delayed these rules once, but that was only \ntemporary. These small Internet providers need permanent relief so they \ncan focus on doing the job of delivering Internet to the American \npeople. So we are passing a bill today that lifts these regulations on \nsmall providers for good.\n  We need to take every opportunity we can to create the space for \ninnovation to thrive in this country. That is the purpose of our \ninnovation initiative, and that is how we can make a more prosperous \nAmerica that works for everyone.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who brings extensive \nexperience in all of this realm, of both electric and communications, \nbased on his vast background on this during his days on the Public \nUtility Commission in North Dakota. He has been a huge asset on our \nsubcommittee.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Walden for yielding the \ntime and for his important leadership.\n  I think it is worth noting, as I know Representative Loebsack and \nseveral of us from rural districts often get involved in issues like \nthis, and I always like to remind people that Representative Walden's \ndistrict is actually larger than the State of North Dakota. That is how \nrural we are. We all know Iowa is a rural State. I think this bill is a \ngreat representation of what happens when a coalition of rural States \nand districts get together and try to do the right thing for the people \nwe work for. So it is a pleasure to be part of that.\n  I will be brief because the leadership has already outlined the \nessence of the bill very effectively. I will spend just a minute or 2 \ntalking about the reality of the importance of this to a place like \nNorth Dakota and to places like rural Oregon or Iowa and other places \nwhere distance is greater than the population, where the advantages of \naccess to something as dynamic as the Internet makes all the difference \nin the world for education opportunities, for health care \naccessibility, and, of course, for individual use.\n  That is a challenge in rural America that, frankly, many of our small \nInternet service providers and communication and technology companies \nhave been meeting all along with plenty of things going against them, \nnot the least of which is: much of the deployment of broadband in rural \nAmerica has been done, even when it is not necessarily economically \nadvantageous to do it at the time, so that the burdensome regulations, \nintended or unintended, that came from the FCC rule just don't apply to \neverybody.\n  I think that the standards that we have set in the negotiation that \nhave created the benchmarks for access deployment are appropriate. And \n250,000 consumers and the size of the companies, I think, hits just \nright that sweet spot, not only because it was negotiated and it has \ngot consensus, but because I think it is the right number. I think they \nare the right numbers.\n  So we don't want to stifle innovation. We want to expand innovation, \nespecially in something as dynamic as the Internet. This act does that. \nI am honored to be a part of it, and I am honored to be a member of the \ncommittee.\n  I thank the Representative Eshoo as well as Representative Loebsack \nand certainly Chairman Walden for their leadership.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, seeing no other speakers on our side of the \naisle, I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Mr. LOEBSACK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I thank Chairman Walden for working on this, once again. Thanks to \nour staffs, again, for working on this compromise.\n  There is just one last thing. I would like to remind folks that \ntransparency is a good thing, and the FCC has good intentions when they \ntalk about transparency and making sure that consumers understand what \nthey are getting for their money. So, as far as I am concerned, we have \nto continue to provide that transparency, but we have to make sure that \nwe do it in the way that we are doing it in this particular \nlegislation, to have that balance that those ISPs, those small-sized \nISPs, can continue to provide that access in the first place, as I \nmentioned already in my remarks.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  I thank everyone who has worked on this. It is a great compromise. I \nwish that we could do this more often here in this body and over in the \nSenate. I am not such a Pollyanna to believe that this is the beginning \nof great things to happen, but I think we made real progress here.\n  I again thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Eshoo, and our staffs \nfor working on this.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague from Iowa who has been a great \npartner in finding the right sweet spot here as we move forward on more \ntelecommunication policy that will help us allow these great innovators \nand inventors to go out and serve our constituents and offer \ncompetition in the marketplace and, not just because they are small, be \nsnuffed out by a government that requires things they can't afford to \ndo and takes money away from innovation.\n  They still have to, as you know, follow all of the laws and all of \nthe protections and all of that. It is just this reporting requirement \nseemed pretty onerous. In fact, obviously, the FCC thought it was when \nthey first came out with their rule. We concur with that and extend \nthat exemption on out.\n  I would also like to say, Mr. Speaker, I am really proud of the \nbipartisan work that Mr. Loebsack, myself, and others have done on our \nsubcommittee.\n  This marks the fifth piece of legislation that we have brought to the \nHouse floor in this Congress in one capacity or another. We passed the \nFCC consolidated reporting legislation, Mr. Speaker, unanimously across \nthis House floor.\n  This is designed to deal with the antiquated statutory requirements \non reports that aren't needed, oftentimes aren't completed, and, yet, \ncost money to taxpayers and those who pay fees. So we have a \nconsolidated report that is designed to simplify that process, save \ntaxpayers money, and decrease\n\n[[Page H1400]]\n\nthe Federal bureaucracy a bit. That is over in the Senate now, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  We passed FCC process reform legislation that we reached bipartisan \nagreement on as well. I think it passed unanimously through the House, \nMr. Speaker.\n  This is really important because we are trying to shed a little light \non the FCC's activities and bring fairness and transparency to the \nFederal Communications Commission so that the public, the consumers, \nthe stakeholders, all have a better opportunity to see how policy that \nwill affect them is being deliberated and considered or even what is \nproposed. That bill is over in the Senate.\n  Then we dealt with the issue of what we call the DOTCOM Act to make \nsure that, when the contract runs out on how the Internet naming agency \nand all works and all the IANA and ICANN pieces, that consumers are \nprotected and will continue to have free Internet, free from government \nintrusion, free, as it has been, to innovate and create this enormous \nchange. That passed the House I think with over 380 votes.\n  The Spectrum Pipeline legislation actually was part of the bipartisan \nbudget agreement we passed at the end of last year. So that is now in \nlaw, as a matter of fact.\n  This marks, as I say, our fifth initiative to try to help this great \nsector of our economy continue to expand, that provides access to the \nworld, and provides access to commerce and jobs in a rural setting.\n  I can't tell you how important this is in a district such as mine \nwhere people now can locate in a smaller community, in a rural \nenvironment, with a great lifestyle, connect into the Internet, and be \nable to conduct commerce and grow jobs.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a fine piece of legislation, represents really \nsolid work, and is really important to a lot of start-up and small \ncompanies across our country that we need to help grow, expand, and be \nthe next competitor and the next one to really move up and give all us \nconsumers more competition and better service.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the other side of the aisle. I \nask Members on both sides of the aisle to join us in bipartisan support \nof this legislation, which, by the way, Mr. Speaker, is also supported \nby the administration.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, we have built a proud, bipartisan record of \nsuccess, and this legislation will help our nation's small businesses \nwhich are the lifeblood of Michigan's economy, and the American economy \nas a whole. A quick look at the stats reveals small businesses \nrepresent 99.7 percent of all employers in the United States, and they \nare true job creators, consistently accounting for 60 to 80 percent of \nnet new jobs in each of the past ten years.\n  Small Internet providers in particular serve a unique role in \nconnecting consumers across the country. They provide service to rural \nconstituents, to other small businesses, and to areas of the country \nthat otherwise would lack any alternative. They often do so with very \nfew resources, relying on a smaller number of employees to do a great \ndeal of work. The bill that we will vote on today makes sure that they \ncan continue to do so without being hampered by regulatory burdens and \nred tape.\n  The Small Business Broadband Deployment Act builds on the temporary \nsteps taken by the Federal Communications Commission to exempt small \nproviders from the enhanced transparency requirements adopted as part \nof the 2015 Open Internet Order. At the time, the Commission recognized \nthat there could be a significant impact on smaller businesses, and \nrightfully exempted them from the requirements. However, the FCC's \ngrant of a series of temporary exemptions does not give these \nbusinesses the certainty they need to make informed investment \ndecisions.\n  H.R. 4596 is a bipartisan solution to this problem. By extending the \nexemption for five years, and raising the threshold for the definition \nat a small business, this legislation will protect small businesses and \nultimately benefit consumers. Keeping these entrepreneurs focused on \nlaying fiber, building towers, and improving service means a better \nInternet experience for their customers, and more jobs. This is what \nthey set out to accomplish when they started their businesses--serving \ntheir communities, not spending hours or days complying with a maze of \nregulations and piles of paperwork.\n  Our committee spent a great deal of time considering this problem. In \naddition, the robust record at the FCC in support of the exemption \nconfirmed our view that this extension was necessary. We heard directly \nfrom witnesses like the president of a small fixed wireless provider, a \nformer FCC commissioner, and a public interest representative. Their \ninput both on how important this bill is, and on how to improve our \nearly draft bill, helped us to come to the final version we are \nconsidering today.\n  Subcommittee Chairman Walden and Representative Loebsack worked in a \nbipartisan way to come to a consensus on legislation that achieves all \nof our goals. The final product is a bill that we can all be proud to \nsupport, and I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense solution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate on the bill has expired.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 1 Offered by Mr. Veasey\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. It is now in order to consider amendment No. \n1 printed in part A of House Report 114-453.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 4, insert before the semicolon the following: \n     ``, including whether making such exception permanent would \n     increase access to services provided by small businesses''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 640, the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of my amendment to H.R. \n4596, which simply adds an additional component to the required report \nfrom the FCC.\n  My amendment requests the agency to also answer whether a permanent \nexemption from enhanced disclosure for small Internet providers, or \nISPs, could increase access to the services offered by these small \nbusinesses. As many of you already know, these exemptions were created \nin the FCC's most recent update to the open Internet order.\n  As Congress considers modifying or making this exemption permanent, \nit is important to know the impact this would have for those people the \norder was intended to protect, in this case, the consumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, the real purpose of a permanent exemption should not be \nto just lighten the load for these businesses, but also to increase \naccess to broadband services in general.\n  Even in urban areas, like the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex that I \nrepresent, there is still an alarming number of people without access \nto all broadband services. Congress must work to enact evidence-based \npolicy to expand Internet access.\n  My amendment would simply have the FCC provide additional information \nregarding the effects of a permanent extension on a small ISP's \nconsumer base.\n  However, after speaking with my colleagues, including the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. Loebsack), I am confident that the goal of my amendment \nwill be achieved through the bill itself.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, reserving the right to object, I thank the \ngentleman for his participation in this process and debate. I look \nforward to working with him on these issues. I share his concern, and I \nappreciate his participation. As I say, the door is always open and \nhappy to continue. We all want the same outcome here for our consumers.\n  Mr. Speaker, finally, I failed to include in the Record a letter of \nsupport for our underlying bill signed by the heads of the American \nCable Association; CCA; CTIA; United States Telecom Association; WISPA, \nthe Wireless Internet Service Providers Association; WTA, Advocates for \nRural Broadband, the rural broadband coalition; and the National Cable \n& Telecommunications Association, so I would like to include that in \nthe Record in support of this effort.\n                                                   March 15, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy & Commerce, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Frank Pallone,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Energy & Commerce, Washington, \n         DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton and Ranking Member Pallone: We write to \n     express our strong\n\n[[Page H1401]]\n\n     support for H.R. 4596, the Small Business Broadband \n     Deployment Act, which is scheduled to be considered by the \n     full House of Representatives tomorrow.\n       We commend you, and Communications & Technology \n     Subcommittee Chairman Walden and Representative Loebsack, for \n     crafting a common-sense bill that provides small broadband \n     providers with greater certainty than the Federal \n     Communications Commission's temporary exemption from the \n     enhanced transparency obligations adopted as part of the Open \n     Internet Order. In multiple industry submissions to the \n     Federal Communications Commission (FCC), including filings \n     regarding the Paperwork Reduction Act, small providers \n     demonstrated that the enhanced requirements would impose \n     time-consuming and costly compliance obligations; yet, the \n     FCC only extended the existing temporary exemption for a \n     limited time. After reviewing the record at the FCC and \n     receiving testimony at its hearing on the legislation in \n     January, the Communications & Technology Subcommittee found \n     there was more than sufficient evidence to further expand and \n     extend the exemption.\n       We are gratified that the Committee has produced a \n     bipartisan bill that will enable small broadband providers to \n     focus their financial and human resources on providing high-\n     quality broadband service to their customers rather than \n     dealing with new regulatory obligations. We urge support for \n     H.R. 4596 and look forward to its approval tomorrow.\n         President and CEO of American Cable Association, \n           President and CEO of CCA, President and CEO of CTIA, \n           President and CEO of National Cable & \n           Telecommunications Association, Chief Executive Officer \n           of NTCA--The Rural Broadband Association, President and \n           CEO of United States Telecom Association, Executive \n           Vice President of WTA--Advocates for Rural Broadband, \n           Legislative Committee Chair of WISPA.\n\n  Mr. WALDEN. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the gentleman's amendment \nis withdrawn.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the previous question \nis ordered on the bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, President Obama's trip to Cuba is ill-\nconceived and premature. A fun trip, the President labeled it. The \nvisit comes on the heels of declarations by the Communist Party that it \nwill ``not give up a single inch in the defense of revolutionary and \nanti-imperialist ideals.''\n  Harrumph. This translates to over 2,555 arbitrary detentions of \npeaceful protesters between January and February of 2016 alone and over \n8,000 arrests just last year.\n  The President's meeting with civil society is such a low benchmark, \nthe official Cuban newspaper, Granma, stated that Obama's visit \ndestroys the myth that Cuba violates human rights. The leader of the \nfree world has chosen a legacy-shopping photo op enjoying a baseball \ngame with a murderer and a thug.\n  In these critical moments for democracy on the island, we must \nsupport peaceful demonstrations like the one scheduled in south Florida \nat 11 a.m. on Sunday in front of the Bay of Pigs monument on 8th \nStreet.\n  (English translation of the statement made in Spanish is as follows:)\n  It will be led by Assembly of the Cuban Resistance from Exile, Forum \nfor Democracy and Freedom in Cuba, and Organization for Foundation for \nthe Judicial Rescue.\n  It will be led by La Asamblea de la Resistencia Cubana desde el \nexilio, el Foro por los Derechos y Libertades desde Cuba, y la \norganizacion Fundacion Rescate Juridico.\n  The exile community in Miami, who has welcomed many of Castro's \nformer political prisoners, is painfully aware of the trampling of \nhuman rights still going on today. This is not a fun trip for peaceful \ndissidents.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, today Washington, D.C., was a little bit \nmore of a mess than usual. The Metro is shut down. In part, it is a \nconsequence of mismanagement for years; but more importantly, it is a \nstatement about the deteriorated state of transit in America. There is \nan $80 billion--B, billion--backlog of capital needed to bring existing \ntransit--not new transit options to get people out of their cars and \nout of traffic and mitigate congestion--just to bring existing transit \nsystems up to a state of good repair.\n  As I have been talking about this around the country for the last \ncouple of years, I have been saying, you know, things are so bad that \nthey are killing people in Washington, D.C., and that is what has been \nhappening. It has deteriorated to the point where we had one accident \nthat killed six people and a fire last year that killed one person.\n  We need to make these repairs. We need them made in America. We have \nthe strongest Buy America requirements for transit of any part of the \nFederal Government. It will provide American jobs. It will give \nAmericans better commuting opportunities. It will make our people safe \non transit.\n  But this body has failed to bring forward or even allow a vote on \nadditional\n\n[[Page H1404]]\n\nfunding for transportation infrastructure in this country. It is a \ncrisis. We are becoming third or maybe fourth world in our \ninfrastructure. Bridges are falling down, potholes, and transit systems \nthat are falling apart; it is time to invest in America.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1404-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS FAILURES\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Veterans Administration failed to \ncontact thousands of veterans who submitted applications for health \ncare. Apparently, those applications were incomplete, but the VA did \nnot tell the vets to correct the applications and resubmit them; so the \napplications were left pending on a shelf with no action by the VA and \nno health care for the veterans. Reports state that nearly 300,000 \nveterans died waiting for a resolution from the VA.\n  Of course, the VA blamed the veterans. This is a farce. The veterans \nnever even received a follow-up call to finish their supposedly \nincomplete applications.\n  These mistakes are that of the VA, not the veterans. The VA should be \nashamed. Government bungling stood in the way of these warriors \nreceiving health care and broke a promise the Nation gave to them.\n  The VA's dysfunctional bureaucrats need to be removed, and veterans \nshould be allowed to have a voucher that gives them the privilege to go \nto their own doctors, doctors who are more concerned about health care \nthan paperwork.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1404-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REMEMBERING MARTIN OLAV SABO\n\n  (Mr. ELLISON asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the well of the floor today to \npay homage and honor to a great Minnesotan and a Member of this body, \nMartin Olav Sabo. He was the Congressperson who preceded me to \nrepresent the Fifth Congressional District.\n  I can say without any reservation that very, very few people can \nboast to be greater public servants than Martin Sabo in my State of \nMinnesota or in America.\n  Martin Sabo served for more than 40 years in public life, 28 years in \nCongress. He was the chair of the Committee on the Budget, and he was \nalso a good friend to all. I will say that he was always gracious and \nwell-mannered. He was a helpful person, and he was available to mentor \nliterally hundreds of Minnesota politicians, public activists, and \nservants.\n  It is with a heavy heart that I give these remarks because, of \ncourse, it would be wonderful to have all of our friends, including \nMartin Sabo, be with us for a long, long time; but, of course, every \none of us does leave this world, and when they do, they would be very, \nvery lucky to make the mark that Martin Sabo did--a great man, a great \nMinnesotan.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1404-3", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1404]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1345\n                         CHANGE NEEDED AT WMATA\n\n  (Mrs. COMSTOCK asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. COMSTOCK. Mr. Speaker, yesterday afternoon the Washington \nMetropolitan Area Transit Authority, our Metro system, informed us that \nthey would be suspending operations all day today and into tonight.\n  While I appreciate that the new general manager had to make this \ndecision to keep our riders safe, what this does is highlight many more \nwidespread problems throughout the system that have been present for \nyears that we need to address. We know a culture change in management \nneeds to happen.\n  When our delegation met with the new manager at the end of last year, \nwe told him we needed to have a management change and that we needed to \nsee some action taken quickly. I am appreciative the Transportation \nchairman is going to have hearings on this.\n  I want to read to you an example of why we need changes here. A \ntrainee at Metro talked about the incompetence there. He said:\n\n       I'll be honest with you. I studied harder for fast-food \n     jobs and waiter jobs when I was in college than I did for \n     their training program at Metro. Their testing program is a \n     joke.\n\n  This is from a Washingtonian article in December of last year.\n  WMATA and Metro lifers who haven't left for years need to start \nleaving so that we can have a new management culture there.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1404-4", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1404-H1410]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WOMEN'S HISTORY MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I welcome my colleagues for a Special Order \nabout Women's History Month.\n  This month of March we are blessed with the opportunity to discuss \nthe opportunities particularly presented by the Republican Party and \nthe philosophies of the Republican Party as they relate to women, \nwomen's history and women's future and the opportunity to be involved \nin building women up and providing opportunities in the future, an \nopportunity culture that is shared by men and women to make sure that \nour homeland is safe and secure, to make sure that our families are in \nan environment that will be uplifting. These are some of the topics we \nwill be discussing today.\n  I am joined by several colleagues, one of whom I would like to call \non first. Incidentally, the first colleague I am calling on is a \nRepublican man with whom I graduated from law school as a student at \nthe University of Wyoming College of Law.\n  My own home State of Wyoming is the first government in the world to \ncontinuously grant women the right to vote. That occurred in 1869. \nColorado, the home State of this gentleman, is the first State to grant \nwomen the right to vote.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  Mr. BUCK. I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming, my friend and law \nschool classmate, for her great leadership on this issue.\n  I am proud to come from a State that was not only the first to give \nwomen the right to vote, but the first to elect women to the State \nlegislature. My wife Perry is continuing that great tradition as a \nmember of the Colorado General Assembly.\n  Many women have impacted our neighborhoods, our communities, and our \nNation. But I want to speak briefly today about the many women who will \nimpact our world.\n  They have ideas and ambitions and callings. They have machines to \ninvent, deals to negotiate, people to heal, diseases to cure, and \nlegislation to pass.\n  Republicans are advancing an agenda to help these women impact our \nfuture. We are focused on making the country more secure, on creating \njobs, on replacing ObamaCare with a patient-centered alternative, on \nextending opportunity to all children, and on protecting the freedom at \nthe heart of our prosperity.\n  Women don't need government getting in their way. That is why the \nefforts of Congress to reassert its authority and roll back executive \noverreach are so vital.\n  Congress has the responsibility to create an environment where women \nthrive. In 100 years, I hope we are celebrating the women who made this \ncountry great, not lamenting the government that stopped them.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the gentleman for being here today and \nacknowledging the importance of Women's History Month and the \ninvolvement of women in politics and government and for his leadership \nin his home State of Colorado.\n  Next I would like to yield to a longstanding colleague who is well \nknown\n\n[[Page H1405]]\n\nto the House of Representatives. Virginia Foxx has done more on \nworkforce development issues in the last couple of years than have been \ndone in many, many years in the House of Representatives.\n  She is the first in her family to graduate from college, earn a \nmaster's and doctorate degree, and then went on to be the president of \nan institute of higher learning, a community college.\n  Her presidency there also lifted education in her home State. She is \nthe chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Higher Education and \nWorkforce Training.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from North Carolina's Fifth \nDistrict (Ms. Foxx).\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Lummis for her \nleadership in this Special Order this afternoon and for all the great \nwork that she has done.\n  She is a wonderful role model for women. She has lent her expertise \nas the former treasurer of her State, and has brought much, much talent \nto the House of Representatives. I appreciate all that she has done \nsince she has been here.\n  We all know, I think, that March is Women's History Month, which \nhonors and celebrates the struggles and achievements of American women \nthroughout the history of the United States.\n  Since 1917, when Republican Jeannette Rankin of Montana became the \nfirst woman to serve in Congress, 313 women have served as U.S. \nRepresentatives, Senators, or Delegates.\n  Many Americans might assume that their congressional Representatives \ncome from exclusive and rarified backgrounds. Well, my story could \nhardly be less rarified.\n  As a child, my family's home didn't have electricity or running \nwater. My parents, while dedicated and hardworking, were very poor, \nwith little formal education. Girls with my background weren't likely \nto end up in Congress.\n  Fortunately, I was pushed by the right people, teachers and \nadministrators who wouldn't let me settle for less than my best.\n  In the mountains of North Carolina, I learned firsthand the power of \neducation and its vital role in the success of every American. Although \nit took me 7 years while working full-time, I became the first in my \nfamily to go to college and earn a degree.\n  In the 1970s, I was a member of the League of Women Voters. Through \nthe League, I attended school board meetings in my county as a public \nobserver to encourage accountability of elected officials. I went to \ncountless meetings, many times as the only person representing the \ngeneral public.\n  During one meeting of an all-male school board, a local reporter \nleaned over and said: These guys are incompetent. Why don't you run for \nthe school board?\n  My instinctive response was: I am not qualified.\n  I think many women fall prey to this attitude of self-\ndisqualification and underestimate their abilities. I took another look \nat those board members and changed my mind.\n  Eventually, I ran for the school board. While I lost that first race, \nI won the next election for school board, and I haven't lost an \nelection since.\n  So while I may not have had wealthy parents or an Ivy League \neducation, I did have what every single American has: opportunity.\n  A few weeks ago I spoke to a local Girl Scout troop about Congress \nand its role in our government. As the group was leaving my office, one \nof the parents pulled me aside and said how glad she was that the girls \nhad the opportunity to hear from a woman in my position.\n  Women are a stronger presence than ever before on Capitol Hill. We \nhave rich and varied perspectives and a commitment to good ideas and \nteamwork. The women of the 114th Congress are shaping our Nation, and \nit is an opportunity and responsibility that we take seriously.\n  Although I am now serving in my sixth term as a Representative from \nNorth Carolina, I am still really a teacher at heart, having spent the \nlion's share of my life working as an educator and administrator in \nNorth Carolina colleges and universities.\n  I believe confronting the challenges facing American schools and \nworkplaces is critical to providing opportunity for every individual to \nget ahead.\n  That is why, as chairwoman of the House Subcommittee on Higher \nEducation and Workforce Training, I have led efforts to modernize and \nreform the Nation's workforce development system. I appreciate very \nmuch my colleague mentioning that.\n  In 2014, the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act was signed into \nlaw. This bipartisan, bicameral compromise between the SKILLS Act that \nI authored and the Senate's Workforce Investment Act of 2013 \nstreamlines and improves existing Federal workforce development \nprograms and fosters a modern workforce that American businesses can \nrely on to compete.\n  House Republicans have also fought to limit one-size-fits-all Federal \ndictates that hamper innovation and limit the ability of States and \nlocal schools to address their students' needs.\n  Last fall we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, which reverses \nWashington's micromanagement of classrooms and gives parents, teachers, \nand local education leaders the tools they need to repair a broken \nsystem and help all children reach their potential.\n  Unfortunately, many Americans still struggle to realize the dream of \nhigher education because our current system is often expensive, \ninflexible, and outdated. Too many students are unable to complete \ncollege, saddled with loan debt and ill-equipped to compete in our \nmodern economy.\n  The United States is the world's summit of opportunity, and we have a \nresponsibility to act now to preserve that role. House Republicans are \npursuing reforms that will help all individuals, regardless of age, \nlocation, or background, access and complete higher education, if they \nchoose.\n  We are working to empower students and families to make informed \ndecisions. We want to simplify and improve student aid as well as \npromote innovation access and completion. We are committed to ensuring \nstrong accountability and a limited Federal role.\n  By keeping college within reach for students and preserving the \nexcellence in diversity that has always set America's colleges and \nuniversities apart, our country and our economy stand to benefit.\n  While Women's History Month celebrates the incredible accomplishments \nof women throughout America's history, the most lasting tribute we can \npay is our efforts to improve this Nation for the next generation of \nwomen.\n  Rather than simply being discouraged by the many problems facing our \ncountry and our world, I have learned to be an agent of change focused \non the problems that can be solved and the people who can be helped.\n  I thank my friend who encouraged me back in the 1970s to run for the \nschool board because of the opportunities it has provided me to help \nother people throughout my life.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. We are tackling five big priorities that women care \nabout this year: national security, jobs, health care, upward mobility, \nand balance of power.\n  You just heard from Congresswoman Foxx about jobs, about education, \nand upward mobility that comes through those avenues.\n  The other areas we are talking about include national security and \nhealth care. No one in Congress is better prepared to address those \nissues than our next speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, I welcome the first woman to represent the Second \nDistrict of North Carolina, which includes all of Fort Bragg, home of \nthe airborne and Special Operations Forces.\n  She has served on the House Energy and Commerce Committee since 2012 \nand currently serves as chairman of the Republican Women's Policy \nCommittee.\n  Prior to running for office, she worked as a registered nurse for \nover 21 years and owned a general surgery practice with her husband \nBrent in Dunn, North Carolina.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield to the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina (Mrs. Ellmers), someone with real life experience in the areas \nof health care and who represents a district that is so profoundly \ninfluential in this Nation's national security.\n\n[[Page H1406]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank my friend and colleague from \nWyoming (Mrs. Lummis). I just want to say how much I appreciate her \nleadership, especially today, as we are talking about Women's History \nMonth and the different roles that we, as women in Congress, are \nplaying, and how we want to formulate and build the structure into the \nfuture for all women. I thank her for her service to all of us in \nrepresenting Wyoming.\n  Mr. Speaker, this month is Women's History Month. It is an \nopportunity to highlight the various ways women in America are pushing \nthe envelope to leave a positive and lasting imprint on society.\n  As the first woman to represent North Carolina's Second District, and \nthe first woman in our State to represent Fort Bragg, national security \nremains one of my utmost priorities.\n  So when I learned of a proposal to deactivate the 440th Airlift Wing \nlocated at Pope Army Airfield in Fort Bragg, I rallied my North \nCarolina colleagues. For nearly 2 years, we went toe-to-toe with the \nAir Force on this misguided decision.\n  The 440th is known for its ability to rapidly mobilize and execute \nlast-minute exercises. It is unique in its mission and provides \nunparalleled levels of training to paratroopers of the 18th Airborne \nCorps.\n  Deactivation of the Airlift Wing would undoubtedly affect our \nmilitary readiness and it could jeopardize the safety of our \nparatroopers. Given the global uncertainty abroad right now, this \ndecision just doesn't make sense.\n  To fight this ill-conceived decision, I coordinated with my North \nCarolina colleagues to question top military leaders here at the \nCapitol. During these same meetings, we sought answers to tough \nquestions and asked for data to back up their justification for the \nWing's closure.\n  As a woman representing the military base, I have remained unwavering \nin my work to acquire answers. I have asked for meetings with the Air \nForce Reserve, the Army, the Pentagon, members of the Joint Chiefs of \nStaff, and local Fort Bragg commanders.\n  The threat of terrorism abroad and the growth of radical groups like \nISIS makes the decision to deactivate even more baffling. Constituents \nback home in North Carolina feel the same way, so I have charged \nforward in my efforts to prevent its closure.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I think it is important to reiterate that \nthe Republican women in Congress are making history in a variety of \nways. As women, we are working to create new opportunities, restore a \nconfident America, and ensure the safety and security of every family \nliving in our country.\n  Again I thank my good friend, Congresswoman Lummis, for hosting \ntoday's Special Order, for being the person that she is, representing \nWyoming, being a leader amongst all of us, as women in Congress, and \nallowing us to speak about the individual initiatives that we are \ntackling as women.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the gentlewoman and acknowledge her expertise on \nhealth care, and want to raise an issue that I would love to hear her \ncomments on.\n  One of the bills that I am cosponsoring is a bill called the Research \nfor All Act, and it would acknowledge that most medical research \nfocuses on men, and studying women is suggested, but not required.\n  Now, sometimes different drugs have different effects on women than \nthey do on men, and vice versa. For example, there is a diabetes drug \nstudy that shows that their drug may lower women's risk of heart \nfailure, but increase a man's; and unless we have adequate studies done \non both men and women, we won't recognize those differences or nuances \nin treatment options that should be tailored differently to men and \nwomen.\n  Based on your experience in nursing, your lifelong career there, do \nyou have any comments about other healthcare initiatives that women are \nworking on here in Congress?\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. First of all, I thank the gentlewoman \nfor her piece of legislation on that particular issue because it shows \nthe importance and how incredibly accurate you are when you are saying \nthat there are so many differences in treatments geared towards women \nand geared towards men.\n  When you highlight heart conditions, that is the number one killer of \nwomen in this country, when we look at disease. Heart disease is the \nnumber one. When we look at this, we know that women respond \ndifferently to symptoms of heart disease than men do, and so do the \ndrugs. So that is a perfect example of why we have to be focusing from \na perspective where we consider both genders.\n  There are so many things that are being worked on here in Washington \nby the women leaders that we have. For instance, some of the things \nthat we have been able to pass on a large bipartisan scale have to do \nwith breast cancer.\n  The USPSTF came out with a decision saying that women between the \nages 40-49 don't necessarily have to have mammograms, and so, \ntherefore, their insurance companies shouldn't have to pay for it.\n  I worked across the aisle on legislation to stop that from moving \nforward, and we were able to put a 2-year moratorium on that decision \nso that we can actually bring a consensus together.\n  The last thing we want to do for women in this country is send out \nmore mixed messages on breast cancer and the treatment of and the \nprevention of. So we are working with our colleagues, as Republicans \nand Democrats.\n  Another perfect example of a healthcare decision that is being made \nby the USPSTF right now is essentially interrupting the process for men \nto get a PSA test, which is the only way we can diagnose prostate \ncancer. It is a simple blood test, and right now they are making \ndecisions as to whether or not insurance companies should have to pay \nfor that. I think that is devastating.\n  And then, of course, I will just say, Medicare remains one of the \nmajor issues that we are working on. I will tell you that all of the \nwomen in the Republican conference are dedicated to this effort.\n\n  There are some new rule changes that are coming out from CMS now that \nwe are all targeting, and we have got to do that for every senior in \nthis country who is receiving Medicare. They need the health care that \nthey deserve, and we have got to do everything we can to make sure that \nit is accessible to them.\n  But, obviously, the largest--the elephant in the room, if you will, \nis, of course, the Affordable Care Act, and we continue to be dedicated \nto this issue.\n  In North Carolina, I can tell you it is a mess with the insurance \nplans. The individual plans themselves have skyrocketed from 30 to 40 \nto 50 percent increase in premiums, with an equal increase on the \ndeductible.\n  The out-of-pocket costs that families in North Carolina now are \nspending is outrageous. They are literally making decisions to not go \nto the doctor when they need health care because they don't want to \nhave to pay extra.\n  This is unacceptable. It certainly was not the intention of the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  As you know, my dear colleague, we have had many of the solutions to \nthis problem, and I believe that the women in our conference are going \nto lead and be a strong voice to our leadership for us to move forward \nso that we can show the American people that we have alternatives to \nthe Affordable Care Act that will continue to give them good coverage, \nbut also continue to support good health care.\n  The 21st Century Cures Act we passed in 2015 is another perfect \nexample of all of us coming together to ensure the American people get \nthe coverage, the cures.\n  What better way to save dollars in health care than to come up with \ncures?\n  If we could just find one on Alzheimer's alone, we would save \nincredible amounts of money.\n  Listen, I am just proud and honored to be able to have a voice, \nespecially when it comes to health care because, as we know, health \ncare touches every life, and we have to do everything as Members of \nCongress, as mothers, as sisters, to do everything we can for the \nAmerican people.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Alzheimer's, which you mentioned, is a disease where \ntwo-thirds of the patients are women, which also means that men are 50 \npercent less likely to get it. So the importance of having women making \npolicy\n\n[[Page H1407]]\n\non these issues is very high because we are the ones who are dealing \nwith frequently female relatives, be they mothers, sisters, aunts, who \nare suffering from Alzheimer's.\n  When we have people like Congresswoman Ellmers, who has a nursing \nbackground, a medical professional background, we have the opportunity \nto use that expertise that she has gained in her prior career, in her \ncapacity as a member of the Energy and Commerce Committee, where much \nof the healthcare-related legislation originates in this Congress.\n  In addition, our new Speaker of the House, Paul Ryan, has put \ntogether several idea-gathering groups to make sure that we are \nbuilding an agenda for the next Congress that will address these issues \nthat have festered during the last 8 years; among them, the \nunacceptable consequences of ObamaCare that have created the situations \nwhich you described in your home State.\n  Can you give us a sneak preview about what some of these idea \nmeetings are bringing to light about the direction of healthcare \npolicy, as crafted by the Republican Party, about your role in those \nidea sessions, and how we intend to roll out health care that truly is \naffordable?\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Well, I will just say that I have had \nthe honor of being part of the Republican Study Committee group that \nhas worked on alternatives to the Affordable Care Act, and we have come \nup with about 10 or 12 different issue-based sections that are good \npolicy that really have been there for a while, that many of our \nmembers have had; and we have actually culminated it into a plan of \naction that would take care of the issue and cover those things that \nthe Affordable Care Act is leaving the American people behind.\n  One of the issues is choice, being able to choose a plan for your \nfamily that you feel is appropriate. Unfortunately, the Affordable Care \nAct, it was promoted as something that provided incredible choice. You \nwere going to be able to go to your doctor. You were going to be able \nto go to the hospital you wanted. It was going to bring down the cost. \nAnd none of those things have come to be true. So now we have to go in \nand we have to change that.\n  You should be able to buy insurance across State lines or from a \ndifferent perspective rather than what you have within your own State. \nYou should be able to have a healthcare savings plan where you can put \ndollars away and be responsible for yourself.\n  Young people are in a different situation. They shouldn't have to \nspend hundreds and hundreds of dollars every month on a healthcare plan \nthat they cannot afford when they can have a much more economical issue \nthere, another situation that they can deal with.\n  Another big issue is tort reform at the national level. I think this \nis something that will also save dollars. There are many, many ideas \nfrom the business side of it, with small businesses to larger \nbusinesses having better choices, being able to negotiate healthcare \nplans.\n  So when we are talking about health care and we are talking about the \naffordable care, what we really are talking about is healthcare \ncoverage. And I think that is one of the most important parts of this \ndiscussion that many times, I think, gets confused.\n  We are talking about healthcare coverage, which leads to better \nhealth care. We should be doing everything we can to make sure that it \nis accessible to every American, and to take care of those who cannot \ntake care of themselves.\n  Pre-existing conditions is a huge issue. We have to be able to deal \nwith that. We know that we cannot leave the American people hanging. In \nother words, when we talk about wanting to repeal it, we know that \nthere has to be a process in place to make sure that there is a safety \nnet for all of those families who have been forced off of their \ninsurance plans and on to an affordable care plan that was not their \nchoice, only they were forced to do it because it became law.\n  Now we have to make sure that we are providing an option for them, \none that will move them from one place to another, a much better place.\n  I will just say again that we are dedicated to this issue. It is the \nmain reason I ran for Congress to begin with. I will not let up on this \nuntil we actually have the solutions that we are looking for.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I am looking forward to our working together over this next year on \nthis issue and just moving health care forward in so many different \nways. Unfortunately, the Federal Government does have a lot to do with \nwhat is working and what is not working, and I am just very happy to be \npart of that conversation.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank our colleague for her dedication and commitment \nto health care for Americans that will truly work for them.\n  Speaking of which, and in recognition of a wonderful woman who is an \nexample of the types of healthcare issues that we are addressing this \nafternoon as part of our focus on Women's History Month, we have been \njoined by the good gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Salmon), who would like \nto pay tribute to a woman from his great State of Arizona.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona, Congressman Matt \nSalmon.\n  Mr. SALMON. First, before I start honoring this wonderful woman, I \nwould like to say that I learned early in my life, in my church, that \nif you want to talk about something, you convene a meeting with a bunch \nof men; if you want to solve something, you convene a meeting with \nwomen.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. My former Senator, Alan Simpson, used to say: ``The cock \ncroweth, but the hen delivereth the goods.''\n  Mr. SALMON. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak very, very lovingly and admiringly \nabout one of the most wonderful people I have ever gotten a chance to \nknow in my life. Her name is Laura Knaperek.\n  I first met Laura when I was a State legislator. I was assigned to be \non the health committee, and Laura was a citizen activist that came \ndown to champion the cause of families, and specifically families with \nchildren with developmental disabilities. I was amazed then at her \npassion, and I remember telling her: You ought to run for office some \nday.\n  She was a beloved member of the Arizona community and a tireless \nchampion for those with developmental disabilities and one of the \nstrongest advocates for families I have ever met in my life. She sought \nto lift people's lives around her.\n  She was first elected to the State legislature in 1994. She set \nherself apart as a selfless public servant. A few weeks ago, our \nSpeaker, in talking to the Conference, mentioned that there are two \ntypes of people in politics: there are doers, and there are be-ers. \nLaura Knaperek was a doer. She was not interested in having the title \nof being a State legislator; she was interested in solving the problems \nof the day.\n  She was diagnosed, in 2012, with ovarian cancer. I remember seeing \nher shortly after that diagnosis, and there was no despair and no \nconcern. Without missing a beat, she just wanted to talk about how she \ncould uplift other people's lives.\n  I remember Laura decided to champion an idea in Arizona, which I \nbelieve is an idea whose time has come. It is the right called the \nRight to Try. I think it was one of the very first States in the \ncountry that has tried to pass this by referendum. Laura was successful \nin doing this.\n  It basically allows individuals with terminal diseases access to \nthings that aren't necessarily approved by the FDA yet. If it is their \nlast-ditch chance, they ought to have a shot at life, and that was \nLaura's contention. She championed this idea, and it passed \noverwhelmingly at the ballot.\n  I am sad to say that, 4 years after her diagnosis, she succumbed to \nthis dread disease.\n  I was shocked because Laura was on Facebook and every other social \nmedia outlet constantly championing ideas and thoughts of others, and \nshe never said anything about herself. She never wallowed in self-pity. \nShe was the kind of person that realized that the greatest service that \nwe can do is serving other people.\n  In my church, there is a saying that, when you are in the service of \nyour fellow being, you are in the service of God. I think Laura \nunderstood that better than anybody.\n\n[[Page H1408]]\n\n  Because of Laura, I introduced H.R. 3012, the Right to Try Act, \nintroduced the last session of Congress. I think that Americans deserve \nthe same opportunity that Arizonans have to be able to try to save \ntheir life and do whatever is necessary to save their life if they are \nterminally ill and they have no other options, no hope.\n  I think that we can honor Laura and others like her by allowing \neverybody across the United States who suffers from a terminal illness \nthe access to every tool available to help them fight for their \nprecious life. The Right to Try, to me, is, in reality, a component of \nthe God-given right to life. The Right to Try offers hope to those who \nhave nowhere else to turn.\n  Laura Knaperek passed away at the age of 60, leaving behind her \nhusband, Robert, their 6 children, 19 grandchildren, and 1 great-\ngrandchild.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with me today in honoring Laura's life \nand pray that we continue Laura's fight to allow those with terminal \nillnesses another chance at life.\n  I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the gentleman for that warm tribute to a woman \nwho selflessly provided an option that women and men can use in the \nevent that they are terminally ill where a possible drug treatment or \nother type of treatment has been identified that has not yet cleared \nthe FDA drug analysis and has not yet been approved but may be \ntremendously helpful to preserving these lives that will be otherwise \ncut short so early, especially a woman of Laura's caliber, who, at 60 \nyears of age, died, leaving such a wonderful family.\n  I thank the gentleman for sponsoring the legislation giving people \nthe same opportunities that Arizonans have.\n  Have you reintroduced that piece of legislation in this Congress?\n  Mr. SALMON. Actually, we are going to be reintroducing it, and we are \nprobably going to rename it Laura's Law in honor of Laura Knaperek.\n  There are very few times in your life that you meet somebody that you \nthink they got the memo mixed up in Heaven, that God sent a memo that \nsaid that this person that is supposed to be an angel actually got to \ncome down to Earth. That was Laura. She was an angel, a living angel, \nand somebody that gave a lot of people reason for hope through the \ncourse of her life, and she never, ever sought recognition. All she \nsought was helping others and changing other people's lives.\n  Do you know what? That is the standard I think we all aspire to, but \nthere are rare occasions where we find somebody that just embodies \neverything that is good.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. As we celebrate Women's History Month, we look for that \njunction between women who have done historic things, women such as \nLaura, and the way that they have paved the way for policies that can \nbe implemented that provide opportunities for people that are in a \nsimilar condition as hers to have some hope and a chance at a longer \nlife.\n  We are grateful that Congressman Salmon has been willing to pick up \nthe torch of her good work and bring it to the attention of, and \nhopefully the approval of, this Congress.\n  I thank the gentleman for his role in this Congress, for \nacknowledging the importance of Laura's life for today's Special Order \non Women's History Month, and for carrying on her fine work in his \ncapacity as a fine gentleman who is doing the best to represent his \nState, and in doing so, enhances the opportunity for every American in \nthis Nation. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. SALMON. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I yield to the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. SALMON. I do want to say one other thing.\n  I know that the gentlewoman is going to be retiring after the end of \nthis term, and I just want to say what a true honor it has been to \nserve with a statesman such as yourself. You are truly one of the \nbright spots in this place.\n  There have been a lot of times when I feel like I kind of had to kick \nmyself extra hard to get motivated to come back and get on that plane \nand come to Washington, D.C., and leave my family behind; but there are \npeople that give me hope, and you are one of those people. You will be \nsorely missed. It doesn't matter whether you are a woman or not a \nwoman. You happen to be. You are a fine, fine individual, and I am \nproud to know you.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. I thank the gentleman. It is an honor to serve with you.\n  I know you are completing your second tour of duty in this Congress \nas well and will be returning to a lovely family in Arizona. Those of \nus who are from the West are blessed to live in beautiful places with \npeople that create a society that matches the scenery, and you are an \nimportant part of that society.\n  Clearly, Laura was an important part of that society. She enhanced \nyour life; and you, in turn, enhance ours.\n  I thank the gentleman from Arizona for his service.\n  Here, in Women's History Month, I can't help but toot the horn of my \ngreat State of Wyoming, the first government in the world to grant \nwomen the right to vote. We also had the first woman Governor, the \nfirst woman justice of the peace, the first woman grand juror, the \nfirst women who were elected delegates to the Republican and Democratic \nNational Conventions, and the first woman elected official in the \ncountry, who happened to be the State superintendent of public \ninstruction, Estelle Reel.\n  All of these women were trailblazers. This all happened 50 years \nbefore the 19th Amendment to the U.S. Constitution granted all American \nwomen the right to vote.\n  Wyoming territory, in 1869, became the first government in the world \nto continuously grant women the right to vote, and it has been my \nprivilege as a woman from the great State of Wyoming to follow a woman \ncolleague, Congresswoman Barbara Cubin, who served 14 years in this \nbody. I now, in my eighth term, make a combined total of 22 consecutive \nyears where our beloved State of Wyoming has been represented in this \nHouse of Representatives by women. And that is really saying something, \nsince Wyoming only has one Member of Congress. It is, indeed, a great \nhonor.\n  These women, however, we cannot just celebrate their past, our past, \nand the opportunities that we enjoy in this great Nation. We have to \nuse what we have learned as American women to enhance the lives of our \nfellow Americans as we serve here, which is one of the reasons that we \nare both celebrating Women's History Month and discussing specifically, \ntoday, what the Republican Party is doing.\n  Women's History Month is our opportunity to celebrate the incredible \naccomplishments women have made to America. But the most lasting \ntribute we can pay this month is our effort to make history for the \nnext generation of women. That is why House Republicans are building an \nagenda to restore a confident America where every American feels secure \nin their lives and their futures.\n  The five big priorities that women care about that we are working on \ntogether this year include: national security, which was discussed by \nRenee Ellmers; jobs, which was discussed, of course, by Virginia Foxx; \nhealth care, where we have several nurses and medical practitioners \nthat are women that are deeply involved in this legislative project; \nand upward mobility, something that is important to all Americans, but \nespecially women.\n  When you consider how many women heads of household there are; when \nyou consider that a rising tide lifts all boats, and when women earn \nmore money, families do better, children do better, women do better, \nand men do better, it is very important, when we are talking about \nupward mobility, that opportunities are provided for women by having a \nTax Code that does not burden them and by having jobs that come back to \nthis country that have previously left this country.\n  We can do that by changing our Tax Code in a way that allows us to \nbring jobs back to this country so those employers and their employees \nare not penalized by higher taxes that we have through a Tax Code that \nmakes sure that corporations pay more taxes here than they do in other \ncountries. That is why we have what are called inversions. That is why \npeople are leaving this country to take their jobs to other countries. \nWe need to bring them back, providing more opportunities to have\n\n[[Page H1409]]\n\ngreat jobs here in this country for women, heads of household, and for \nall members of our society and culture.\n  With women making the majority of healthcare decisions in this \ncountry, we need to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act with an \nact that will provide opportunities for a marketplace for insurance \nthat acknowledges that some people have preexisting conditions and you \nwill not be penalized for such, that acknowledges that some people just \nwant catastrophic coverage and later in their life can move into a \nsystem that maybe provides more specific coverage, and that allows you \nto shop for insurance across State lines. You can find a product that \nworks specifically for you and that has a pool of participants large \nenough so that a very small population State like mine can be involved \nin a bigger pool, thereby bringing down the risk and bringing down the \ncosts for those of us in very small States.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  We have to be looking also at specific healthcare issues. Multiple \nsclerosis is much more prevalent in the Intermountain West than it is \nin a lot of other areas.\n  Research being done right now at Cornell University is showing that \nthere is a possible connection between multiple sclerosis and a fungus \nin the soils.\n  These are the kinds of unusual connections when research is done that \nwill allow us to address certain healthcare issues that may be more \nprevalent in one region than another, a healthcare system that is \nflexible and affordable and recognizes that not all healthcare issues \nare the same for men or women, for the Intermountain West versus the \ncoastal States, for the African American population, for the Hispanic \nAmerican population, for the White population.\n  These are all things that need to be discussed in the context of an \naffordable healthcare system that recognizes the tremendous scientific \nadvantages that we enjoy by virtue of having a first-class higher \neducation system.\n  We have to make sure that that higher education system continues to \nadvance opportunities for all people that can contribute to the body of \nknowledge that have made America the greatest country in the world.\n  Women currently making up the largest component of the higher \neducation population will be leading the way among them.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I wrap up this Special Order that has \nacknowledged women's history in this country and acknowledges the work \nthat is being done here in Congress to make sure the future for \nAmerican women is brighter, better, more prosperous, and more \nfulfilling than ever, I yield to the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King), a \nchampion of healthcare revision that will benefit both men and women.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from Wyoming \nfor yielding to me on this important topic. I am privileged to be here \non the floor listening to this discussion that we have today.\n  I think of the many, many hours that roll back as far back as 2009, \nwhen the healthcare debate began to get intensified here in this \nCongress. From the beginning, for me, it was about freedom.\n  I often say to people that the most sovereign thing that we have is \nour soul. We are in charge of that. We are in control of that. With \nGod's help, we are in the management of our own soul. The Federal \nGovernment hasn't figured out how to tax it, how to nationalize it, or \nhow to manage it.\n  That may be a point of profundity, but what is the second most \nsovereign thing that we have, aside from our soul? Number two is our \nskin and everything inside it, our bodies.\n  The Federal Government has figured out under ObamaCare how to \nnationalize that, how to do--I call it a hostile takeover of our skin \nand everything inside it--and tell us: We are going to tax your \npaycheck and we are going to command you to take that money and pay a \nhealth insurance premium, not the policy of your choice, but the policy \nof Uncle Sam's choice.\n  Then that policy, the rules written within it and the thousands of \npages of rules that have been written on ObamaCare since, will \ndetermine whether you get health care or at least whether you get it \npaid for out of your health insurance policy or not. That I call a \nhostile takeover of my skin and everything inside it.\n  It is abhorrent to me for a free people to be subjugated to such a \nlaw. Yet, the other side of this is that we have had elections in 2010, \n2012, 2014, and now an election coming up in 2016.\n  The results of this upcoming election might be the one where we \nfinally set the full 100 percent ``rip it out by the roots as if it had \nnever been enacted'' ObamaCare.\n  ``Repeal it completely and entirely as if it had never been enacted'' \nactually are the last words of the repeal bill that I wrote in the \nmiddle of the night after it passed here on March 22, 2010, a sleepless \nnight, I might add.\n  The question was: What is the other side of the glorious repeal of \nObamaCare? A number of really good things that we would have done by \nnow if it weren't obstructed by the policy that exists in front of us \nthat is named after our President.\n  The first and I think most important one is to provide for selling \ninsurance across State lines. There is legislation there that has \nexisted for years called the McCarran-Ferguson Act.\n  It is legislation that enables the States to write the mandates and \nthe specifications in such a way that the States can be lobbied by \nlarge health insurance companies whose goal is to have a monopoly \nwithin each of those States.\n  That is trade protectionism that is allowed. It is in violation of \nthe Commerce Clause in the Constitution, I might add. But the McCarran-\nFerguson Act enables that.\n  We need to repeal the components of the McCarran-Ferguson Act so that \na young man, while at the beginning of this dialogue in 2009 or 2010--a \n23-year-old young man would be paying about $6,000 a year for a typical \nhealth insurance policy in New Jersey, but a young man, same age, \nsimilarly situated in Kentucky, would be paying about $1,000 a year.\n  This would let the young man from New Jersey buy the policy from \nKentucky, which, eventually, the competition would bring the price down \nin New Jersey, probably wouldn't bring it up in Kentucky, and we would \nsee that the opportunities we would have as Americans we could trade \nfor health insurance in any State.\n  Free trade zones on health insurance, what a wonderful thing. Then \nthe Federal mandates would be gone. They would be away.\n  That would mean that especially young people that could wisely manage \ntheir investments would be able to buy a health savings account. The \nway they were set up in 2003, a couple at age 20 could have invested \n$5,150 a year. That was the max-out in an HSA.\n  If they spent about $2,000 a year for normal medical costs and \naccrued the balance of that at the 40-year average of interest rate, \nthey would arrive at 65 Medicare eligibility with approximately \n$950,000 in their health savings account.\n  Uncle Sam's interest in that HSA at that point, that nearly $1 \nmillion, would be to tax it as real income when it comes out of the \nHSA.\n  Well, I would say instead, if you could buy a Medicare replacement \npolicy in the dollars, when we did the math on this, for the couple for \n$144,000, the government would tax the balance. I would say keep the \nchange tax free.\n  If you take yourself off of the Medicare rolls, the entitlement \nrolls, by buying a replacement annuitized, paid-up-for-life policy to \nreplace the Medicare liability, keep the change tax free, say, \n$150,000, around $800,000 tax free, that becomes your retirement \naccount.\n  The HSA has become now a life management account where you would be \nplanning your health insurance. The more money you had in your HSA, the \nmore deductible you could sustain, the higher deductible and the higher \nco-payment.\n  With that nest egg of an HSA, you could negotiate the health \ninsurance premiums down. You would manage your way, get your exercise, \nget your check-ups, because you would want to be able to live long and \nhealthy to spend all of that mad money, if you choose, that balance of \n$800,000.\n  That is the kind of thing that is in front of us if we can get \nObamaCare out of the way. Sell insurance across State lines, expand \nHSAs, address the\n\n[[Page H1410]]\n\ntort reform piece of this, which is billions of dollars a year that is \nunnecessarily spent on tests that are done to protect from the \nliability that is there.\n  With these packages, other good ideas that come from other Members \ndoing this in the fashion and vision by our Founding Fathers, we go out \nto where all of the solutions are, out to the voices and ideas of the \npeople, bring those ideas here.\n  Each of us, our job, the gentlewoman from Wyoming's job and mine, is \nto sort through the good ideas, bring the best ideas here to \nWashington, let our best ideas compete with the other good ideas, and \nput that out on the President's desk for the solutions that we really \nneed.\n  I appreciate the attention and the opportunity to speak.\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Iowa for his \nleadership on this issue, for being a devoted husband, father, and \nfather-in-law.\n\n  I know that the women in his life have influenced his perspective on \nthese healthcare issues, as have so many of us. I thank him for \nparticipating in this discussion, this Special Order, celebrating \nWomen's History Month.\n  I want to conclude the Special Order by highlighting two Republican \nwomen with whom I serve in Congress who are truly doing courageous \nthings in their lives with their families.\n  First of all, Congresswoman Cathy McMorris Rodgers, who is the \nhighest ranking Republican woman in this conference, is our conference \nleader. She is the mother of three children.\n  One is a special needs child, a friend to all of us, a delightful \nyoung man who was born while she was serving in Congress, as were her \nother two children.\n  The devotion that Cathy McMorris Rodgers has to her family and to \nparents of special needs children has brought about important \nlegislation that is good for parents and special needs children all \nover this country.\n  As we celebrate this Women's History Month, I want to acknowledge our \ncolleague Cathy McMorris Rodgers for her important role in this \nCongress as a leader on this issue and many others.\n  I also want to acknowledge our colleague Jaime Herrera Beutler, who \nis from the State of Washington. Jaime, during a pregnancy which \noccurred while she also was serving as a Member of this Congress, as \nshe still does, experienced a pregnancy that would have brought about \nthe death of her child.\n  But because she was courageous enough to test and, like Laura's Law, \nallow a rather experimental treatment where she was injected with a \nsaline solution in utero that allowed that baby to continue to mature \nuntil its birth, at which point it was allowed to grow and had \ndialysis, and then, at a point at which that child had become big \nenough and healthy enough, received an organ transplant from Jaime \nHerrera Beutler's husband, the father of the child.\n  That child and that father and that mother, who we continue to serve \nwith here in this Congress, are all doing well. This is the first known \nchild to survive, given the condition that that child was identified as \nhaving before it was born.\n  Most doctors recommend that a parent terminate that pregnancy or, in \nmany cases, that pregnancy will be terminated on its own without any \ninvolvement outside of the womb.\n  But in Jaime's case, she took the extraordinary step of having a \nsaline injection to allow that child to continue to grow and mature in \na way that allowed it to be born.\n  This is a lovely child, another friend of all of ours, because, \noccasionally, that child visits us here in the Cloakroom behind this \nfloor of the House.\n  What an honor to serve with these two courageous mothers who, while \nhaving these children and going through these extraordinary issues, are \nserving their States, their districts, their Nations in this Congress, \nand contributing to uplifting women in this country through their \nservice to this Congress.\n  As I conclude this tribute to Women's History Month, I want to remind \npeople that women in this Congress are making a difference with regard \nto legislation that affects all of us, whether they are in the avenues \nof natural resources, water, air--the areas that I spend most of my \ntime on--whether they are in the areas of health care, jobs, or higher \neducation.\n  The areas that women in Congress are interested in are as diverse as \nthe areas that men are interested in, but women bring a different \nperspective to those same issues. Women look out into the future.\n  When I served in the Wyoming Legislature, our chief clerk, who sits \nup there just as these folks do and observes what is happening, was one \nday asked: Can you tell a difference between the way men and women \nlegislate, regardless of whether they are Democrats or Republicans?\n  He said: Absolutely. Women are looking to the future. They are not \nfocused on the next election. They are focused beyond the next election \nfor what will be good for their children, their grandchildren, and \nfuture of the Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  As I observed his comments throughout my legislative years in Wyoming \nand now throughout my legislative years here, I think there is some \ntruth to that. That is why I think it is so important that women be \ninvolved in the legislative process and participate in this great \ninstitution, which is the Congress of the United States, for the \nbetterment of future generations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1410-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1410-H1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: THE PEOPLE'S BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New \nJersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is recognized for 60 minutes as the \ndesignee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday night, we got word of a \ndecision that may be the death knell for the budget proposal made by \nthe majority of this body. The members of the self-styled Freedom \nCaucus have announced their refusal to support the plan that their own \nleadership has put forward. I am truly afraid of what they would offer \nas an alternative, because the budget being considered in committee \nthis week is a far cry from what American families need.\n  Mr. Speaker, at its most fundamental level, a budget is two things: a \nguiding document and a statement of values. The budget that the House \nRepublicans have put forward--the budget that is not enough for the \nFreedom Caucus--makes it clear that they value special interests more \nthan working families. It is a guiding document to an America that is \nbereft of opportunity for those who have worked or have studied or have \nfought for it.\n  My colleagues and I are here on the floor tonight to support a very \ndifferent plan--a budget that seeks to give everyday Americans the only \nopportunity they have ever asked for--the opportunity to work hard, to \nplay by the rules, and to get ahead. It is a budget for the people, so \nit shouldn't come as a surprise that we call it The People's Budget.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Progressive Caucus budget would invest \nin our schools, our roads, our bridges, our workers, and our \nenvironment to put us back on the path to prosperity in a way that \nausterity never will, because the cuts of the past few years should \nhave made one thing clear: trimming our spending does little to impact \nthe long-term deficit, but it destroys working families, hinders the \nmost vulnerable Americans, and threatens the future of our Nation.\n  The People's Budget would invest $1 trillion in our bridges, roads, \nrailways, and other infrastructure facilities to prevent the kind of \ndevastating failures we have witnessed in Flint, Michigan.\n  The People's Budget would fully fund Head Start, capitalizing on one \nof the best opportunities to give our young\n\n[[Page H1411]]\n\npeople a leg up in an increasingly global economy.\n  The People's Budget would take steps to make debt-free college a \nreality for students, keeping higher education as a ladder into \neconomic prosperity rather than making it a privilege for top earners.\n  The People's Budget would fully fund affordable housing programs, and \nit would end persistent family homelessness with an investment of $11 \nbillion.\n  The People's Budget would take a stand on protecting our environment \nfrom further damage by investing in clean and renewable energy \nresources and ending subsidies for oil, gas, and coal once and for all. \nAnd that is just the beginning.\n  Our economy may be rebounding from the Great Recession, but there are \nplenty of Americans who have been left behind--stuck in roles with low \nwages, in long-term unemployment, in the gender and racial pay gaps \nthat persist in this Nation, or in debt that keeps them from \nprogressing in their lives. We can't afford to let this stand. We need \na budget for the people, and we need it now.\n  Mr. Speaker, the budget that was announced by the majority yesterday \nis truly a roadmap to ruin. It would leave seniors out in the cold by \nending the Medicare guarantee. It would gut domestic programming with \n$6.5 trillion in cuts--the most outrageous and threatening action ever \nproposed by the majority on the Budget Committee. It would make the gap \nbetween average Americans and the wealthy few too great to bridge, \ntaking away any chance at restoring the vibrant middle class our \neconomy relies on. It would do the same thing that my colleagues have \ntried to do for some time, which would be to stack the deck for top \nearners and the well-connected at the expense of everyone else.\n  The people need change. The people need a plan that levels the \nplaying field, that gives them opportunities to succeed, and that puts \ntheir interests above the interests of corporations and the wealthy. \nThe people need salaries to let them do more than just make ends meet. \nThe people need a way to pay for affordable child care while they are \nat their jobs. The people need education for their children and \nteachers who are trained to give students the tools to succeed. They \nneed roads that aren't crumbling and trains that stay on the tracks; \nthey need bridges and tunnels that connect them with their jobs without \ntheir having to spend hours in traffic; and they need job training to \nfind employment in a changing economy.\n  The people, Mr. Speaker, need The People's Budget.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), my colleague \nand the chairman of the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the Representative Watson Coleman. I appreciate \nthe gentlewoman's leadership during the Progressive Caucus Special \nOrder hour. Every week, she helps give the world the progressive \nmessage, and I am so grateful that she does.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me mention that The People's Budget is really not \njust some document that members of the Progressive Caucus, when huddled \nin a room, drafted up. We actually believed that the people ought to \nparticipate in the writing of The People's Budget, so we engaged not \nonly the ideas of constituents from our districts but also those from \nother people, like from the Economic Policy Institute, the people in \nthe labor community, and others, who all had great ideas about how to \nformulate our budget. Altogether, we included the ideas of 44 different \ngroups and of many, many individuals beyond that to support and help us \ndraft The People's Budget. We want to thank all of them.\n\n  This really is a People's Budget because it puts forward the main \nthing that any budget ought to put forward in a budget from Congress, \nand that is the promotion of good-paying jobs.\n  Now, just because the unemployment rate has gotten to a lower level \ndoesn't mean that we have got a great jobs picture for working \nAmericans. The People's Budget would increase good-paying jobs by 3.6 \nmillion, and we are very proud of that. While Republicans may think \nthat the best way to judge a budget is by how many dollars from the \nFederal budget they cut, we believe that the main way to judge a budget \nis by how many Americans are put to work in good-paying jobs.\n  How do we create these jobs?\n  One, by investing in our infrastructure. The People's Budget invests \nin $1 trillion so that we can rebuild our roads, bridges, railways, \nwater systems, and grids. We make sure that the crumbling \ninfrastructure that faces us right now gets fixed. That includes \ninfrastructure in Flint, Michigan, and in other cities around this \ncountry where water infrastructure is so hard-pressed.\n  Beyond that, we will provide the protections that American workers \nneed. The People's Budget calls for the protection of collective \nbargaining; it works to close the pay equity gap; it increases funding \nfor worker protection agencies that crack down on wage theft and \novertime abuses--but that $1 trillion will also save American lives.\n  Two weeks ago, I and many members of the Congressional Progressive \nand Black Caucuses traveled to Flint, Michigan, and I saw firsthand \nwhat happens when governments are run like a business. When money is \nthe only consideration and when the Governor thinks that passing an \nemergency manager law just to cut costs at the expense of children's \nhealth and clean water, we see what the results of that kind of \nthinking are and that it is penny-wise, but incredibly pound-foolish. I \nmet dozens of families who were exposed to dangerous levels of lead, \nbut also people who were touched by the evils of Legionnaires' disease \nbecause of waterborne illness.\n  The People's Budget includes $765 million for the city of Flint so \nthat we can replace toxic pipelines and provide health and education \nservices for residents. Flint isn't the only city that is exposing \nresidents to lead; so The People's Budget also includes $150 billion \nfor waterlines nationwide.\n  We can never allow a tragedy like Flint's to happen again, but we \nhave to make the investments right now. It is a simple choice: Do we \nbelieve that we should have a State's tax cuts go to the richest dead \npeople? Should we cut their taxes? Should we cut the taxes of \nmultinational, giant, profitable corporations? Or should we spend the \nmoney to help ensure the health and welfare of American children and \nother citizens?\n  I think we should look out for the American people. The People's \nBudget does that. We are glad to have the support of so many \norganizations, and we look forward to a very strong vote when the day \narrives.\n\n\n                       Stop Violence in Honduras\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I want to make another statement which is \nunrelated to our budget, but it is still very important.\n  I am profoundly saddened and angered by the murders of Berta Caceres \nand Nelson Garcia, two leading environmental activists in the nation of \nHonduras. These two murders were less than 2 weeks apart. It is an \nongoing challenge that must be addressed immediately.\n  Ms. Caceres spent decades fighting for the rights of Honduras' \nindigenous community, winning the Goldman Environmental Prize--an \ninternationally recognized award--for her work. She was assassinated in \nher home while she was supposed to be under special protection by \ngovernment security forces.\n  Mr. Garcia was a member of Ms. Caceres' organization, the Civic \nCouncil of Popular and Indigenous Organizations of Honduras. He was \nshot yesterday in front of his mother-in-law's home.\n  Honduras and the world have lost two extraordinary advocates for \nenvironmental and indigenous rights, and also for social justice.\n  We need to do more than mourn their losses. It is time to act. It is \ntime to suspend assistance to the Honduras security forces until such \ntime as we know they are not penetrated by illegal actors; until such \ntime as we can be assured when they say they are going to protect \nsomebody, those people are protected; and until we know and have \nconfidence that American taxpayers' dollars are not being used to \nassassinate leaders who are doing nothing more than trying to improve \nthe environment and increase the rights of indigenous people.\n  These assassinations fit into a pattern of attacks that has taken \nplace against Honduran activists since the 2009 military coup. The NGO \nGlobal\n\n[[Page H1412]]\n\nWitness calls Honduras the most dangerous place in the world for \nenvironmental activists. More than 100 environmental activists have \nbeen killed in the last 5 years there, and many activists and community \nleaders remain at risk. We must do everything in our power to stop this \nviolence and harassment in Honduras.\n  Please rest in peace, Berta Caceres and Nelson Garcia. The people who \nremain behind will continue to fight for environmental justice and \nindigenous rights, and we here in the United States join that fight.\n\n\n               U.S. Supreme Court Nominee Merrick Garland\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I close, I want to spend a few minutes on another \nimportant topic as well.\n  Today, President Obama nominated Chief Justice Merrick Garland to \nfill the vacancy that has been left on the Supreme Court by Associate \nJustice Antonin Scalia.\n  Judge Garland has more Federal judicial experience than any Supreme \nCourt nominee in history. His work on the D.C. circuit court, an \nappointment to which he was confirmed with strong bipartisan support, \nhas earned praise from Members of Congress on both sides of the aisle. \nHe is qualified. He is competent. He is not the ultraliberal that many \nof my conservative colleagues feared.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Yet, following up on his promise that the Senate would consider \nabsolutely no one that President Obama put forward, Majority Leader \nMitch McConnell said today: ``It is a president's constitutional right \nto nominate a Supreme Court justice, and it is the Senate's \nconstitutional right to act as a check on a president and withhold its \nconsent.''\n  I beg to differ. I think it is the President's constitutional \nresponsibility, not just a prerogative, to fill the bench of the \nSupreme Court. Withholding consent, something that is typically done \nwhen a candidate is underqualified or inappropriate, is far different \nthan just ignoring the process altogether.\n  This is a political decision made about the only body that shouldn't \nbe exposed to such things. It goes beyond just a filibuster or \ncommentary from a few outliers.\n  And if Republicans follow through with their plan, it would \nconstitute the longest vacancy with no vote on a nominee ever. There is \nno precedent for this. There have been appointments, nominations, and, \nabove all, hearings during Presidential election years.\n  It is flat out ridiculous to refuse a man as qualified as Judge \nGarland even hearings. This is a dereliction of duty that surpasses the \nsadly run-of-the-mill inability of the majority to get anything done, \nfrom funding the government until the eleventh hour to passing a \nbudget, to actually governing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would be remiss if I came to the floor without taking \nthe time to say this: The Senate must change course and consider Judge \nGarland on his merits. He has earned bipartisan support before, and he \ndeserves it again.\n  I need to remind this body and the Senate that the President of the \nUnited States was elected for a second term and that term includes four \nfull years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I conclude my Special Order hour.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1412-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1412]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HOUSE CONCURRENT RESOLUTION 121\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Hawaii (Ms. Gabbard) is \nrecognized for the remainder of the hour as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, earlier this week there were a few very \nimportant votes that occurred on complex issues that I would like to \ndiscuss here today. They were with regards to H. Con. Res. 75 and H. \nCon. Res. 121, which is the one I will discuss now.\n  Make no mistake. H. Con. Res. 121 is a war bill. It is a thinly \nveiled attempt to use the rationale of humanitarianism as a \njustification for overthrowing the Syrian Government of Assad.\n  Similar resolutions were used in the past to legitimatize the regime-\nchange wars to overthrow the governments of Iraq and Libya. I will have \nno part of it. I voted ``no'' on H. Con. Res. 121. I voted ``no'' \nagainst more unnecessary interventionist regime-change wars.\n  We all know that Bashar al-Assad, President of Syria, is a brutal \ndictator. But this resolution's purpose is not merely to recognize him \nas such. Rather, it was a call to action. Specifically, it is a call to \nescalate our war to overthrow the Syrian Government of Assad.\n  For the last 5 years, the United States, Saudi Arabia, Turkey, and \nothers have been working hand in hand in that war to overthrow the \nAssad Government, supposedly for humanitarian reasons. But I ask: How \nhas this war to overthrow Assad actually helped humanity?\n  Hundreds of thousands of Syrians have been killed. Millions have \nbecome homeless refugees. Much of the country's infrastructure has been \ndestroyed.\n  Terrorist organizations like ISIS, al Qaeda, and others have taken \nover large areas of the country and are engaging in genocide.\n  Now the same people who are behind this war to overthrow Assad want \nto escalate that war, and this resolution is an attempt to gin up \npublic support for that escalation.\n  This resolution urges the administration to create ``additional \nmechanisms for the protection of civilians,'' which is really coded \nlanguage for the creation of a so-called no-fly zone or safe zone.\n  The creation of this no-fly zone or safe zone in Syria would be a \nmajor escalation of the war. Doing this would cost billions of dollars, \nrequire tens of thousands of ground troops, and a massive U.S. air \npresence. It won't work.\n  Furthermore, it will likely result in a direct confrontation between \nthe United States and Russia. Fortunately, President Obama has thus far \nopposed implementing such a so-called no-fly zone and has resisted \npressure to escalate this war in this way,\n  The fact is that the main areas currently in Syria where Christian, \nAlawites, Druze, Yazidis, and other religious minorities can practice \ntheir faith without fear of persecution are in the Syrian territories \nwhere Assad maintains control.\n  Therefore, the overthrow of Assad would worsen the genocidal \nactivities by ISIS and al Qaeda and other terrorist organizations \nagainst Christians, Alawites, and other Syrian religious minorities.\n  If the U.S. has learned nothing else from Iraq and Libya, we should \nhave learned that toppling ruthless dictators in the Middle East \ncreates even more human suffering and strengthens our enemy, groups \nlike ISIS and other terrorist organizations in those countries.\n  It is undeniable that, in both Iraq and Libya, humanitarian \nconditions today are far worse than they were before those governments \nwere toppled and ISIS and other terrorist organizations are far more \npowerful with greater strongholds, causing even more suffering.\n  If the U.S. is successful in its current efforts to overthrow the \nSyrian Government of Assad, allowing groups like ISIS and al Qaeda and \nother terrorist organizations to take over all of Syria, which is what \nwill happen, including those Assad-controlled areas where Christians \nand other religious minorities remain protected, the United States will \nbe morally culpable for the genocide that will occur as a result.\n  This is exactly what happened when we overthrew Saddam Hussein in \nIraq. It is what happened in Libya when we overthrew Muammar Gaddafi. \nTo do the same thing over and over and expect a different result is the \ndefinition of insanity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1412-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1412-H1416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. \nKing) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to be recognized to \naddress you here on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives\n\n[[Page H1413]]\n\nand to continue the deliberation here that makes this the most \ndeliberative body anywhere in the world.\n  I understand that the Senate might take issue with that. However, I \nam always happy to engage in debate with the Senators as well.\n  I came to the floor because I wanted to speak, Mr. Speaker, about an \nissue that has cost scores and scores of American lives.\n  Since the time I came into this Congress, I was surprised and, you \nmight say, shocked and appalled that so few Members were paying \nattention to the reality of what is happening in the streets of America \nover the years.\n  I think of a school bus that was run off the road up in Cottonwood, \nMinnesota, a few years ago. Four of the children in that school bus \nwere killed. Two of them were siblings. Three families were hit with \nthat terrible tragedy.\n  The cause of that accident was a vehicle that ran the bus off the \nroad that was driven by an illegal alien that had been interdicted \nmultiple times and turned loose on the streets to recommit again and \nagain.\n  I recall that discussion. It brought home to me something that I knew \nlogically, but I hadn't felt emotionally at that point, Mr. Speaker.\n  If there are people in this country who are unlawfully present and \nthe law directs that, when encountered by law enforcement, they shall \nbe placed into removal proceedings, if we enforce the law when we \nencounter people that are illegally in America, then, by the very \ndefinition of following the law that requires that they are placed in \nremoval proceedings, they are no longer on the streets of America, they \nare no longer driving vehicles that are running school buses off the \nroad or bringing about head-on crashes or being involved in vehicular \nhomicide or driving while under the influence because, by definition of \nenforcement of the law, they are not here to do that.\n  They might commit these crimes in other countries, in their home \ncountry. That is the issue for the countries that they can be lawfully \npresent in.\n  But here, when I see the funerals of four children that come about \nbecause we had an opportunity to enforce the law and, instead, we \ndecided that our compassion for the law breaker was greater than our \ncompassion for the victim of the crime, you end up with four funerals \nof children that were riding home from school in a school bus that day.\n  Now, it shouldn't take very much for people who are professionals \nthat deal with this every day to understand that, that if the law says \nthat they shall be placed in removal proceedings--you have a President \nwho says to them instead, through Jeh Johnson, who is now the Secretary \nof the Department of Homeland Security, to the law enforcement officers \nwho have pledged and take an oath to support and defend the \nConstitution--which, by the way, the President takes an oath to \npreserve, protect, and defend the Constitution.\n  The very definition in the Take Care Clause of the Constitution is \nthat he shall take care that the laws be faithfully executed.\n  Well, instead, the President has decided to essentially execute some \nof the immigration law that exists. That doesn't mean enforce it. When \nI say that, I say that facetiously, Mr. Speaker. He has ordered the law \nenforcement officers to not enforce the law.\n  And the advice that came from Jeh Johnson to the law enforcement \nofficers of the Border Patrol was, if you came into this job and put on \nthis uniform and took your oath to support and defend the Constitution \nand you thought that it meant that you are going to enforce immigration \nlaw, if you think that is what you are going to do, you had better get \nanother job.\n  That was the message to them that came out here about 10 days ago--\nget another job if you came here to enforce the law--if you are working \nfor the Border Patrol or for ICE or for Customs and Border Protection.\n  It is an appalling thing, Mr. Speaker, to think that we have a \nPresident who has taken an oath to preserve, protect, and defend the \nConstitution of the United States and to take care that the laws be \nfaithfully executed and, instead, he is taking care that they not be \nenforced in case after case after case. And this poster I have, Mr. \nSpeaker, is the bloody result.\n  The title says ``Free to Kill: 124 Criminal Aliens Released By Obama \nPolicies Charged With Homicide Since 2010.'' Now, that is not all of \nthe homicides.\n  Here is where they are. A lot of them are in California. A good \nnumber of them are in Arizona, Texas, and up along the East Coast. They \nare in Council Bluffs, Iowa, or in Omaha. Yes, they are in my \nneighborhood as well, Mr. Speaker.\n  Now, that is 124 killers. These are criminals that had already been \nprosecuted, already been convicted. These are felons that had been \nreleased on the streets of America because of a policy that the \nPresident seems to think is a discretionary policy.\n  That is not 124 graves only. That is at least 135 graves because of \nthe multiple murders that have taken place after they are convicted. At \nleast two of them that were released on the streets in the past were \nalready convicted of homicide-related charges. That is how bad this is.\n  The idea that we shouldn't enforce our laws even against people that \nare illegal in the United States, unlawfully present in America, out of \nsome sense of compassion, and they might say that they don't have the \nroom and they don't have the budget, well, that is not so either.\n  I would just note some of the statistics that I have pulled down here \nover time. In 2012, ICE reported that there were 850,000 aliens present \nin the country who had been ordered removed or excluded, but who had \nnot departed. That is 850,000.\n  Now, they tell us that there are 11.2 million illegal aliens in \nAmerica. Well, I don't actually accept that number. That is a number \nthat has been constantly and commonly used here.\n  I arrived here in 2003. I swore in here in January of 2003. At that \ntime, the immigration debate was talking about 12 million illegals in \nAmerica. 12 million. 12 million. The drum of 12 million was beat for \nseveral years. Then it drifted down to 11.5. Now it is 11.2 million.\n  We are thinking that we have a crisis with illegal immigration coming \ninto America. But the number hasn't increased? Have that many gone back \nhome? Have that many died?\n  If not, that number is growing, and I think it has grown \nsubstantially more. The data we are looking at is 11.2 million, and \nthat is from the Pew Research Center. I think they do a good job. I do \ndisagree with them on that number.\n  If that is the case, out of 11.2 million illegals in America, 850,000 \naliens are present in the United States of America who had already been \nordered removed. We call that law enforcement?\n  Just about anybody in the world that has ever looked across and \nthought about coming to America knows that your chances of being sent \nback to your home country, if you succeed in getting into America, are \nnil. They are almost nothing.\n  If you embarrass the administration, if you are such a violent \ncriminal, perhaps they will find a way to send you back. But even this \nadministration, when they want to send them back, the few that they do, \ndoesn't push hard on those other countries to take them back.\n  Now, every country in the world that refuses to take their illegals \nback, we have the leverage to convince them, I believe, to take those \nillegal aliens back, 850,000 of them.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  I didn't divide that out, but it is roughly 1 in 12 of the illegal \naliens in America have already been adjudicated for deportation, but \nthey don't go, and we don't do anything about it.\n  Here is another statistic. For every 10 Americans detained in Federal \ncourt--that's Americans--173 illegal aliens are detained by a Federal \ncourt. So I don't know why they gave me 10 of 173, but I can divide \nthat out in my head. Federal court deals with 17.3 illegal aliens for \neach American--that would be an American, lawful, permanent resident or \nan American citizen that they deal with. That is a high, high volume of \nillegal aliens going through our Federal court system.\n  Here is another piece of data that emerged from a study that I \nrequested in 2005. This was a GAO study that shows that 27 percent of \nour Federal prison population is criminal aliens--27\n\n[[Page H1414]]\n\npercent. So more than a fourth of the inmates that are housed in \nFederal penitentiaries are criminal aliens. That is a huge percentage.\n  If you would think that they are in there for immigration crimes, for \noverstaying their visa, or for crossing the border, no. That is highly, \nhighly unlikely that they are incarcerated for what this administration \nwould call minimal offenses. They are in there for other things.\n  Here is another example. The illegal aliens represent 5 percent of \nthe population, 27 percent of the Federal prison population, and \npresumably 27 percent of the Federal crimes that are committed as well. \nSo that is a proportion of more than five times their representation in \nthe population they are represented in prison and they are represented \nby the crimes that are committed.\n  Now, we should not think that these are just data, Mr. Speaker. \nCrimes aren't just data, because for every crime, there is at least one \nvictim. The victims pay a huge, huge price that is not compensated by \nthe taxpayer.\n  For example, our criminal laws are descended from old English common \nlaw, and old English common law recognizes this, that everything was \nthe product, the property, of the sovereign, the king. If you went out \nand poached a deer, the crime was against the crown, because the king \nowned the deer. The king owned everything. So if you poached a deer, \nyou killed the king's deer, and the king is going to have his justice. \nIf you killed one of his subjects, one of his serfs, if you committed \nmurder, the crime was against the crown.\n  That is why, today, the crimes that we have are against the State, \nwhether it be the nation-state or whether it be the State that we \nhappen to be abiding in. So when you go to criminal court, they will \nsay this is the case of the State versus whoever has the charges \nbrought against them, John Doe, criminal. You will hear that announced \nat the beginning of the criminal case: This is the case of the State \nof, say, Iowa, against John Doe, criminal.\n  The victim, if the victim is alive and survives and is in that \ncriminal courtroom, they are going to be looking back and forth \nlistening to the prosecution and then the defense go back and forth, \nand they are going to be wondering: Where am I in this equation? The \nvictim is not in the equation because, if the State believes that they \nget justice, then justice is served, and the victim is essentially out \nof that equation with the exception of a few little things we have done \nsuch as to allow for and provide that the victim or the victim's family \nhave an opportunity to face the accused and, actually, face the \nconvicted.\n  So we are descendants from that, Mr. Speaker. When the crimes are \ncommitted against individuals, the victims of these crimes are paying \nthe price. They are paying the price with their lives. They are paying \nthe price with their bodies. They are paying the price with whatever \ntheir treasured products might be.\n  If they are a victim of assault and battery and grand larceny, then \nthey have been beaten up, they have been pounded, they have been \nbruised and bloodied and maybe bones broken. Maybe they have survived \nan attempted homicide, and maybe their wallet was lifted and their \ncredit cards or their car. The things that they owned, the things that \nthey cherished are lost, and they have to heal up. We don't compensate \nthem for their loss even though the State is an intervenor in a \ncriminal crime.\n  So the case of the State v. John Doe, criminal, should tell us that \nthe loss of life is not compensated either. It is not measured. It is \nnot quantified. The 124 criminal aliens released who have committed \nmurders during this period of time is a small portion of the overall \nnumber of criminal aliens who were released who did commit homicides.\n  But what are those lives worth?\n  We just heard the gentleman from Minnesota lament the loss of two \nlives. It is tragic. I am sorry he comes here to this floor. I am sorry \nthat he feels that pain. I am sure the families feel the pain. But \nthese are mostly anonymous victims, the four children in Cottonwood, \nMinnesota.\n  Kate Steinle--the story that I pulled here, her name is now a \nhousehold name, Mr. Speaker--was murdered in San Francisco on July 1, \n2015. Now when I see an attractive young lady with brown hair, \nimmediately the picture of Kate Steinle flashes into my mind's eye, \nstanding there innocently and shot and killed by a criminal alien who \nhad been ordered deported, I believe the number would be at least twice \nbefore, on the streets because San Francisco is a sanctuary city.\n  Well, the sanctuary city isn't just exclusive to San Francisco. All \nover this country there are sanctuary jurisdictions. There are \nsanctuary jurisdictions in Iowa, at least 25 of them that I can \nidentify, and they exist across the country, local jurisdictions that \nhave decided they are not going to cooperate with Federal law \nenforcement officers.\n  And furthermore, when ICE puts out a detainer order, Federal law \nrequires that an ICE detainer order is mandatory. The statute that was \npassed directed the rules to be written in such a way that the detainer \norders are mandatory.\n  A year ago, February 25, I believe that day would be--I remember my \ndate is right, but I am not certain on my year. It could be 2014 rather \nthan 2015. But the ICE Acting Deputy Director, Dan Ragsdale, sent a \nletter out to hundreds of political jurisdictions, law enforcement \njurisdictions, and said to them: This ICE detainer order that you have \nbeen getting, that you have been complying with because it is an order, \nit is really not an order. It is just a suggestion. So we are not going \nto enforce that, and neither are we going to protect you if you are \nsued for detaining someone that ICE has put a detainer order on.\n  They essentially said: We don't have your back at the Justice \nDepartment, even though the law directs that we do have. And so that \nbrought about more sanctuary cities, more sanctuary jurisdictions, \nentire counties that have decided they are not going to cooperate with \nICE. So when ICE sends an ICE detainer order to a sanctuary \njurisdiction--often, a city--their policy is: We aren't going to turn \nthis criminal over to ICE. We are going to turn him loose instead.\n  Well, when they turn them loose instead, they do so by the tens of \nthousands. And, you know, Mr. Speaker, that Americans are the victims \nof homicide as a result, some of it first-degree murder, second-degree \nmurder, negligent homicide, vehicular homicide. Americans' graves are \nscattered all over this country at the hands of illegal aliens, \ncriminal aliens, not only those that came across the border illegally--\nthat makes them criminals, Mr. Speaker--but those who are in this \ncountry even legally. When they commit a crime, they become a criminal \nalien.\n\n  There are graves in every single State in this country, multiple \ngraves in every single State in this country that didn't need to be. \nThere are grieving families all over this country in every single State \nthat didn't need to grieve. They didn't need to see their loved one \nkilled, whether it was a car accident, whether it was a bullet, whether \nthey were bludgeoned, however it might have been. Those lives could \nhave been saved by enforcing the law. But, instead, the Obama \nadministration does the opposite. They set up an affirmative plan to \nstart turning loose illegal aliens who are felons, who are criminals.\n  Here is some more data. In 2014, according to a U.S. Sentencing \nCommission report, it shows illegal immigrants represented 36.7 percent \nof Federal sentences, 36.7 percent of their sentences. I have already \nsaid that 27 percent of the inmates are criminal aliens. Then, again, \nit is about roughly half or a little bit more of them are from Mexico.\n  The Obama administration, in 2013, released--and this number has been \ncommitted to my memory for some time--36,007 criminal aliens turned \nloose on the streets, and that represented 88,000 convictions, more \nthan 88,000 convictions among those 36,007 criminal aliens. Of that, \n193 had been convicted of homicide.\n  Now, when do you turn murderers loose on the streets of America, \nespecially if they are deportable? If they serve their time--they might \nbe second-degree murder, maybe they serve their time, maybe they get an \nearly out--they go home to their home country. They are deported at the \nend of\n\n[[Page H1415]]\n\ntheir sentence. That is how our law reads.\n  But the Obama administration said: No, we are going to turn 36,007 of \nthem loose: 193 homicides represented by them, 426 sexual assaults, 303 \nkidnappings, 1,075 aggravated assaults, all of that packaged up in the \n36,007. That was just 2013. That was the beginning of this mass release \nof criminals who are criminal aliens, deportable criminal aliens out of \nour prisons.\n  In 2014, they slacked off a little bit. They only released 30,558 \ncriminal aliens, and they represented 79,059 convictions. That is the \nwork that is being done by the Obama administration. I could go on with \ndata after data.\n  Here is one. ICE had been claiming to have removed record numbers of \nunlawful or otherwise removable aliens from the United States. Well, \nthey counted their deportations differently than any administration \nbefore. So those that said they will accept a voluntary return when \nthey are caught at the border, they will say: Well, we can put you in \nthe van and haul you back to the port of entry and turn you loose to \nwalk back across the bridge. If you will do that, we will count you as \ndeported.\n  That used to be just voluntary return. Now the Obama administration \nhas admitted that they have essentially jiggered the numbers and \nchanged the category.\n  But even still, even if this isn't accurate in comparison to previous \nadministrations, those numbers have gone down, from along the way, \n389,834, fiscal year 2009. It did go up a little bit the next year, \n392,000 and change, then up to 396,000, and then going back. The number \nin 2012 was almost 410,000.\n  So you can see, Mr. Speaker, that number has dropped off by tens of \nthousands. Then ICE has since admitted to dropping in removals clear \ndown to 368,000 in 2013, 315,000 in 2014.\n  This number continues to go down, from up to nearly 410,000 down to \n315,000, almost 100,000 fewer deportations when they are counting the \nvoluntary returns in that list. That means we don't have a lot of \nimmigration enforcement going on, and the message and the signal is: \nCome try to get into America. We are not going to do a lot about that \nin this Obama administration.\n  And what happens? Well, what happens is we have a Presidential \nnomination process that has emerged. Out of it comes, who got the first \nbig bounce and spark off of making the pledge that he would build a \nwall, a beautiful wall, and he would return the people and end illegal \nimmigration residence in America and put them the other side of the \nwall? That was Donald Trump. If Donald Trump doesn't have that issue, \nDonald Trump doesn't probably have a campaign. I am sure that it is a \nbig part of what motivated him to run for President.\n  Ted Cruz also, Mr. Speaker, has the most solid and cleanest record on \nimmigration policy. It is complete; it is inclusive; it is anti-amnesty \nall the way. And, by the way, he doesn't make provisions for inviting \npeople back in after they are removed. I don't think that takes a whole \nlot of prudence to hold that position.\n  Why would you reward somebody that you needed to go to the trouble to \nadjudicate them for removal, deport them back to their home country, \nand then do as they said in the Gang of Eight bill? They have a \nprovision in that bill that thankfully the House didn't take up. It is \nthe ``we really didn't mean it'' clause in which they say, written into \nthe Gang of Eight's bill, if you have been deported in the past and you \nare in your home country today, after the Gang of Eight bill presumably \npassed, you can apply to come to the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  We deported you before, but we really didn't mean it. We can bring \nyou back in here. If we hadn't caught you in America and you had been \nhere when the Gang of Eight bill would potentially become law, then, if \nyou get to stay under those provisions, then you get to come back to \nAmerica if you have previously been deported.\n  I think that is lunacy, Mr. Speaker, to be going to all the trouble \nto enforce the law and then to reverse course with that and provide the \n``we didn't really mean it'' clause.\n  That bill, by the way, had in it prospective amnesty. In other words, \nit didn't deal with people who would come in after it became law, so, \npresumably, they would be treated with the same kind of amnesty or pass \nfor those who were in America; and those that had been deported from \nAmerica get to come back to America, too, with some exceptions if you \nare a bad enough criminal.\n  The logic of this is beyond my ability to reason with it, Mr. \nSpeaker, but the logic that this country needs to reason with is the \nlogic of the rule of law. We have to be a Nation of laws--not of men--\nand the laws need to apply to everyone equally, not applied differently \nto different people.\n  There has to be an expectation that the law will be enforced. If we \ndon't have that, then we devolve into a Third World country. In a Third \nWorld country, you can get pulled over not even for not speeding, but \nyou might have to pay off the officer in order to be able to drive on \ndown the road. In this country, if that ever happens--I wouldn't say it \nnever happens, but where I come from, it doesn't happen and I never \nhear of it--that would show a digression from the rule of law.\n  We have to all respect the law. The law has got to be enforced \nagainst everybody equally. There has to be an expectation that the law \nwill be enforced. Any country that has any value to protecting its own \nsovereignty has to have borders.\n  We have borders. We know what they are: 2,000 miles on the southern \nborder, roughly 4,000 miles on the norther border, oceans on the east \nand on the west. Those are the borders of the United States of America. \nWe have water all the way around Hawaii. We know the lines in Alaska. \nWe don't dispute them with Canada. We get along just fine agreeing on \nwhat our borders are. But if we don't enforce them, if we don't protect \nthem, we are no longer a sovereign Nation.\n  We allow people to stream across the border. We have had Border \nPatrol testimony here in this Congress within the last decade where \nthey testified that they believed that they interdicted perhaps 25 \npercent of those that attempted to cross the border. When you looked at \nthe numbers of those interdictions and did the math on that, it turned \nout to be 4 million illegal border crossing attempts in a single year. \nThat is roughly at the peak of this. That has diminished by a few \nmillion.\n  But think of that: 365 divided into 4 million works out to about \n11,000 a night. About 11,000 illegal aliens come across our southern \nborder at night. Maybe that number could be as far down as perhaps \n6,000 or so, but that is still the size of Santa Anna's army. The size \nof Santa Anna's army comes across every night.\n  Coming across, sure, there are some decent people that are looking \nfor a better life--maybe a lot of them--but 80 to 90 percent of the \nillegal drugs that are consumed in America come from or through Mexico. \nIt is the demand in the United States that brings those drugs in here. \nWe have a culpability in this, too.\n  But just the same, the violence in Mexico, the murders--over 100,000 \npeople have been killed in the drug wars in Mexico--is all part of an \nopen border situation that we have here in the United States, costing \nMexican lives, costing American lives. Graves are scattered in every \nsingle State in the Union because we have an administration that \ndecided not to enforce the law, even though the President takes an oath \nto preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution and take care that \nthe laws be faithfully executed. We have got executive overreach time \nafter time after time. He has reached into the constitutional authority \nof this Congress.\n  Time after time, I brought an amendment to this floor, Mr. Speaker, \nthat has cut off all funding to implement or enforce the President's \nlawless, unconstitutional amnesty actions, to cut off all funding under \nthe Morton Memos, to cut off all funding to DACA, to cut off all \nfunding to DAPA and shut down those operations that are outside the \nconstitutional authority of the President, by my definition, by the \ndefinition of the majority vote in this Congress, and also by the \ndefinition of the President himself, who said multiple times--and we \nhave him on videotape at least 22 times saying he didn't have \nconstitutional authority to--I will put it in shorthand--grant amnesty. \nHe\n\n[[Page H1416]]\n\ndidn't use those words, but it certainly is the paraphrase of what he \nhad to say. After multiple times of telling us all the proper \nconstitutional interpretation, he decided to do it anyway.\n  The President of the United States' restraint factor is not giving \nhis word, putting his hand on the Bible, and raising his right hand and \ntaking an oath to the Constitution. His restraining factor is not his \nword. It is what he can get away with.\n  He demanded that Congress pass the Gang of Eight amnesty bill, and \nCongress said: Nuts, we are not doing that. We are not going to see the \ndemographics of America forever altered by bringing in millions of \nundocumented Democrats in order to play into the hands of Barack Obama \nand the Democrats in the Senate and the House.\n  We have a responsibility to the American people. We the people need \nto decide. That is why our Founding Fathers wrote in the enumerated \npowers in the Constitution the responsibility of Congress to establish \nthe naturalization laws and, by inference, to write the immigration \nlaws. That immigration policy is not to be set by the President of the \nUnited States. It is to be set by Congress.\n  Congress wrote the law in 1996, the Immigration Reform Act, which \nLamar Smith of Texas was so instrumental in, as a large body of the \nimmigration law that we have to follow. That was the considered will of \nthe people. It was the bipartisan, considered will of the people, \nsigned by the President of the United States. Gee, that would be Bill \nClinton back then, wouldn't it?\n\n  So we have a country that is the unchallenged greatest Nation in the \nworld. We have a lot to be proud of. We have a destiny, an arc of \nhistory that has been flattened. It has been descending for a lot of \nreasons--economic reasons, cultural reasons, failure to adhere to our \noaths to uphold the Constitution reasons--but in a large way, it is \ndiminished because we have so little respect for the rule of law.\n  Of all of the things we can talk about with regard to immigration \npolicy--securing our borders, ending sanctuary cities, making sure that \nlocal law enforcement works again in cooperation with Federal \nimmigration officials, ending this idea that detainer orders are \nvoluntary, not mandatory--piece after piece of this--an entry/exit \nsystem that tracks the people in the country and when they leave so we \nknow what the balance is of those visitors who are here, and an E-\nVerify system that I will say the New IDEA Act, my bill--all of that \nput together brings America to the right place. We have an obligation \nto turn this into an upending arc of history, not descending.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1416-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1416]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOC. \n                              NO. 114-117)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States: \n  Pursuant to the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (50 \nU.S.C. 1701 et seq.) (IEEPA), I hereby report that I have issued an \nExecutive Order (the ``order'') with respect to North Korea. The order \ntakes additional steps with respect to the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008, expanded in scope in \nExecutive Order 13551 of August 30, 2010, relied upon for additional \nsteps in Executive Order 13570 of April 18, 2011, and further expanded \nin scope in Executive Order 13687 of January 2, 2015. The order also \nfacilitates implementation of certain provisions of the North Korea \nSanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law 114-122), \nwhich I signed on February 18, 2016, and ensures the implementation of \ncertain provisions of United Nations Security Council Resolution \n(UNSCR) 2270 of March 2, 2016.\n  In 2008, upon terminating the exercise of certain authorities under \nthe Trading With the Enemy Act (TWEA) with respect to North Korea, the \nPresident issued Executive Order 13466 and declared a national \nemergency pursuant to IEEPA to deal with the unusual and extraordinary \nthreat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States \nposed by the existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons-usable \nfissile material on the Korean Peninsula. Executive Order 13466 \ncontinued certain restrictions on North Korea and North Korean \nnationals that had been in place under TWEA.\n  In 2010, I issued Executive Order 13551. In that order, I determined \nthat the Government of North Korea's continued provocative actions \ndestabilized the Korean peninsula and imperiled U.S. Armed Forces, \nallies, and trading partners in the region and warranted the imposition \nof additional sanctions, and I expanded the national emergency declared \nin Executive Order 13466. In Executive Order 13551, I ordered blocked \nthe property and interests in property of three North Korean entities \nand one individual listed in the Annex to that order and provided \ncriteria under which the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, may designate additional persons whose \nproperty and interests in property shall be blocked.\n  In 2011, I issued Executive Order 13570 to further address the \nnational emergency with respect to North Korea and to strengthen the \nimplementation of UNSCRs 1718 and 1874. That Executive Order prohibited \nthe direct or indirect importation of goods, services, and technology \nfrom North Korea.\n  In 2015, I issued Executive Order 13687, in which I determined that \nthe provocative, destabilizing, and repressive actions and policies of \nthe Government of North Korea constitute a continuing threat to the \nnational security, foreign policy, and economy of the United States, \nand further expanded the national emergency declared in Executive Order \n13466. In Executive Order 13687 I provided additional criteria under \nwhich the Secretary of the\n\n[[Page H1417]]\n\nTreasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State, may designate \nadditional persons whose property and interests in property shall be \nblocked.\n  I have now determined that the Government of North Korea's continuing \npursuit of its nuclear and missile programs, as evidenced most recently \nby its February 7, 2016, launch using ballistic missile technology and \nits January 6, 2016, nuclear test in violation of its obligations \npursuant to numerous UNSCRs and in contravention of its commitments \nunder the September 19, 2005, Joint Statement of the Six-Party Talks, \nincreasingly imperils the United States and its allies. The order \naddresses those actions and takes additional steps with respect to the \nnational emergency declared in Executive Order 13466 of June 26, 2008. \nThe order also facilitates implementation of certain provisions of the \nNorth Korea Sanctions and Policy Enhancement Act of 2016 (Public Law \n114-122), which I signed on February 18, 2016, and ensures the \nimplementation of certain provisions of UNSCR 2270 of March 2, 2016.\n  The order is not targeted at the people of North Korea, but rather is \naimed at the Government of North Korea and its activities that threaten \nthe United States and others. It blocks the property and interests in \nproperty of the Government of North Korea and the Workers' Party of \nKorea and provides additional criteria for blocking the property and \ninterests in property of any person determined by the Secretary of the \nTreasury, in consultation with the Secretary of State:\n   to operate in such industries in the North Korean economy as \nmay be determined by the Secretary of the Treasury, in consultation \nwith the Secretary of State, such as transportation, mining, energy, or \nfinancial services;\n   to have sold, supplied, transferred, or purchased, directly \nor indirectly, to or from North Korea or any person acting for or on \nbehalf of the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of Korea, \nmetal, graphite, coal, or software, where any revenue or goods received \nmay benefit the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of \nKorea, including North Korea's nuclear or ballistic missile programs;\n   to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for an \nabuse or violation of human rights by the Government of North Korea or \nthe Workers' Party of Korea or any person acting for or on behalf of \neither such entity;\n   to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for the \nexportation of workers from North Korea, including exportation to \ngenerate revenue for the Government of North Korea or the Workers' \nParty of Korea;\n   to have engaged in significant activities undermining \ncybersecurity through the use of computer networks or systems against \ntargets outside of North Korea on behalf of the Government of North \nKorea or the Workers' Party of Korea;\n   to have engaged in, facilitated, or been responsible for \ncensorship by the Government of North Korea or the Workers' Party of \nKorea;\n   to have materially assisted, sponsored, or provided \nfinancial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services \nto or in support of, any person whose property and interests in \nproperty are blocked pursuant to the order;\n   to be owned or controlled by, or to have acted or purported \nto act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, any person whose \nproperty and interests in property are blocked pursuant to the order; \nor\n   to have attempted to engage in any of the activities \ndescribed above.\n  In addition, the order prohibits:\n   the exportation of goods, services, and technology to North \nKorea;\n   new investment in North Korea; and\n   the approval, financing, facilitation, or guarantee of such \nexports and investments.\n  Finally, the order suspends entry into the United States of any alien \ndetermined to meet one or more of the above criteria.\n  I have delegated to the Secretary of the Treasury the authority, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of State, to take such actions, \nincluding the promulgation of rules and regulations, and to employ all \npowers granted to the President by IEEPA as may be necessary to carry \nout the purposes of the order. All executive agencies are directed to \ntake all appropriate measures within their authority to carry out the \nprovisions of the order.\n  I am enclosing a copy of the Executive Order I have issued.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, March 15, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1417-1", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. Jackson Lee (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account \nof attendance of memorial service for Ms. Tiffany Johnson, who served \nthe House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/03/16/house-section/article/H1417-2", "month": "03", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1417]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    BILL PRESENTED TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  Karen L.
