The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nNorth Carolina (Ms. Foxx) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to commend Unifi Manufacturing, \nIncorporated for its commitment to recycling.\n  Headquartered in Greensboro, Unifi is a leading producer and \nprocessor of multifilament polyester and nylon textured yarns. They \nprovide innovative, global textile solutions and unique branded yarns \nfor customers at every level of the supply chain.\n  Unifi employs about 950 people in North Carolina's Fifth District at \nits Repreve Recycling Center in Yadkinville. The company is currently \nconstructing an 85,000-square-foot expansion that will more than double \nthe size of the facility.\n  Repreve is polyester yarn made from chips that come mainly from \nrecycled plastic bottles and industrial fiber waste. These \nenvironmentally friendly yarns have been used in products for customers \nthat include Ford, The North Face, Nike, Haggar, Quiksilver, Volcom, \nand Patagonia. For example, a classic fit casual dress pant by Haggar \nfeatures seven recycled bottles. Seat covers in a Ford F-150 truck \ncontain 16 recycled bottles.\n  Unifi is currently converting about 42 million pounds of recycled \nproducts a year into chips at its Yadkinville facility. That includes \n31 million pounds of post-consumer plastic bottles and 11 million \npounds of post-industrial fiber and fabric waste. Once the expansion is \ncomplete, it will recycle 72 million pounds annually.\n  At current production levels, the Yadkinville center accounts \nannually for the conversion of 900 million recycled plastic bottles and \nsaves the equivalent of 16 million gallons of gasoline that would be \nrequired to make new polyester and nylon.\n  Last spring, Unifi also opened a 1-megawatt solar farm onsite in \nYadkinville. The solar farm is projected to provide about 10 percent of \nthe energy needed to run the recycling center.\n  Additionally, Unifi is expanding the Repreve brand through its 60 \npercent interest in Repreve Renewables, a biomass feedstock company \nthat focuses on the direct sales of Freedom Giant Miscanthus to \nfarmers. Some analysts believe this type of grass is extremely \nefficient in converting sunlight to biomass energy. It also produces \nmore fuel than any other biofuel source.\n  Repreve Renewables has had significant commercial success with \nThrivez, its poultry bedding brand. Thrivez regrows annually without \nreplanting, reducing soil erosion, improving water quality, and \nminimizing water, herbicide, and fertilizer needs.\n  Unifi has been profitable for 5 consecutive years, and Repreve has \nexpanded from two main apparel customers in 2007 to 32 in 2015. I \ncommend Unifi for achieving economic success through sustainability.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H225-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H225-H226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MALHEUR WILDLIFE REFUGE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today is the ninth day of armed \noccupation of the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge in Oregon--lawless, \nreckless behavior. As the Audubon Society points out: putting one of \nAmerica's most important wildlife refuges at risk and threatening \nFederal employees.\n  David Jenkins, president of Conservatives for Responsible \nStewardship, points out they are trampling on the rights of every \nAmerican, they are the opposite of conservatives, and they will \ncontinue to bully, threaten, and test the limits of civil society until \nthey are stopped. Jenkins urged the Obama administration to follow \nTeddy Roosevelt's advice that the law must be enforced with resolute \nfirmness.\n  I fully understand policy differences, that compromises must be made \nand that there will be mistakes. I have worked with my Republican \ncolleague Greg Walden, whose neighboring district goes all the way to \nthe Idaho border, as we struggled to make broad Federal policy work \nbetter for everyone as we spent several years developing a vision for \nMount Hood that included protections for wilderness and\n\n[[Page H226]]\n\npractices for infrastructure and management. It is an ongoing effort. \nBut with 323 million Americans, diverse landscapes, and philosophies \nthat are buried, there are going to be struggles and differences that \ncontinue.\n  The answer is to keep working to find common ground, like we did with \nour staff and families on a 3-day hike around that magnificent \nmountain. For that moment, Mount Hood wasn't the dividing line between \nour districts; it was a point around which we could come together to \nagree and work to make things better. It brought us together. That is \nexactly what needs to happen now.\n  There are tremendous challenges in our State of Oregon. We have a \nwildlife refuge in the Klamath Basin with a historic opportunity to \nremove unnecessary dams that even the private owner doesn't feel it \ncould maintain, to help restore damage to salmon runs, to be able to \ndeal with a parched wildlife basin in the middle of a desert.\n  The Federal Government has promised far more in that basin to the \nstakeholders than it can deliver. There is a huge responsibility for \nall of us in the Federal Government to help unwind this unsustainable \nsituation.\n  Native Americans, particularly in the Northwest, despite solemn \ntreaty rights promised to them by the Federal Government and ratified \nby Congress, have long been abused and ignored. They deserve to be \ntaken seriously and their rights respected.\n  There are opportunities, like dam removal, that signal a winning \nopportunity to keep faith with our environmental responsibilities and \ntreaty obligations to Native Americans, to wildlife, and to the \nsurrounding area.\n  Far from being a threat to the region's economy, the removal, in an \nenvironmentally responsible way, of the four dams which generate little \nenergy will provide hundreds of family wage jobs for years that will \ninject badly needed money into the region in the deconstruction phase, \nto say nothing of the long-term benefits for tourism, recreation, and \nenhanced environment.\n  Let's seize the opportunity in the Klamath. Let's take the \nopportunity to implement the long-term vision and water restoration for \nthe Malheur Basin. These are items where hundreds and hundreds of \npeople have labored in good faith for tens of thousands of hours. They \ndon't need armed outsiders to come to Oregon, threatening public safety \nand the precious resources for their own political gains.\n  We ought to be able, in our region, to snatch victory from the jaws \nof defeat, discord, and the specter of dissension, anger, and a \ncontinued sense of victimhood and loss. We don't have to do that. Let's \nbuild on the progress that we have established and work together to \nmake these people and ourselves winners.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H226-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H226]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, the great World War II was at its \npeak. So, on September 11, 1943, 28-year-old Sandy Thompson left her \nteaching job and volunteered for the Women Airforce Service Pilots, \nbetter known as the WASP. As a pilot, she towed targets for live \nantiaircraft practice, helped deliver planes to overseas bases, and \ntested new aircraft.\n  Of the 1,000 women who were WASPs, 38 were killed during their \nmissions. Sixteen of these unsung heroes still live in Texas, and these \npilots are part of the Greatest Generation.\n  WASPs were considered civilians until 1977. Then Congress granted \nthem veteran status. In 2002, the WASPs were allowed to be cremated and \nhave their ashes placed in Arlington National Cemetery, but now \nbureaucrats have decided that these veterans are not worthy of having a \nproper military burial and have revoked burial rights in Arlington. The \nreason they say is a lack of space. This is disgraceful. A lack of \nspace is a sorry excuse to dishonor these veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, the government owns 23 percent of the land mass in the \nUnited States. Find space to permanently honor these female veterans.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H226-7", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H226-H227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FEDERAL GOVERNMENT MUST HELP CORRECT MANMADE DISASTER IN FLINT, \n                                MICHIGAN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk to this Congress about my \nhometown of Flint, Michigan.\n  This morning I wrote to the President and wrote a letter to our \nGovernor, asking for help for my hometown.\n  Almost beyond belief, for a year and a half, the city of Flint has \nhad water running through the pipes and into the homes of the people in \nFlint. The water has extraordinarily high levels of lead, which can \naffect the trajectory of a child's life permanently.\n  This was a decision made by the State government when it took over \nthe city of Flint because of its financial situation. To save a few \ndollars, it switched from Lake Huron as its primary water source to the \nFlint River, without even any science or thought as to how the river \nmight be treated. As a result, that corrosive river has put lead into \nthe water source and into the bodies of young children.\n  Today, finally, after months and months and months, apparently, our \nGovernor is going to announce some sort of response at the State level. \nI can assure you this: There is no confidence of the people of the city \nof Flint and of the people of Michigan--I have, certainly, no \nconfidence myself--that the State's response will be adequate. I am \nasking the Federal Government to step in and help correct this manmade \ndisaster in Flint, Michigan.\n\n[[Page H227]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H227-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                HONORING THE LIFE OF CARLYLE FARNSWORTH\n\n  (Mr. McKINLEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McKINLEY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor the life of \nCarlyle Farnsworth from Wheeling, who passed away on Christmas Eve.\n  I was honored to have known him as a friend. Carlyle was a member of \nthe Greatest Generation in America, and he served in the United States \nMarine Corps during World War II. When he returned home, he built a \ncareer, raised a family, and was a community leader for a number of \nyears.\n  He served on the board of the Wheeling Hospital for 29 years and was \na past president. He was president of the Wheeling Area Chamber of \nCommerce, was active in scouting with the local valley Scout council, \nand served as the vice president of the Scouts for over 20 years. \nCarlyle attended the very first National Scouting Jamboree right here \nin Washington in 1937.\n  He was a distinguished banker for over 40 years and served as the \nbank president for many of those years. He belonged to numerous State \nand national banking associations and served on the West Virginia State \nBoard of Investments.\n  My lasting impression of Carlyle was how cheerful, upbeat, and \npositive he was. I offer my condolences to his loving wife of 44 years, \nSue; to his daughter, Betsy Ann; to his son, Thomas, and his wife C.J.\n  Carlyle will be missed, but he will be remembered as a leader, as a \nloving husband, and as an inspiration to all of those with whom he came \nin contact.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H227-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H227]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       This Act shall take effect on the date that is 180 days \n     after the date of the enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Sarbanes) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to insert extraneous materials into the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Indiana?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Recently there has been a significant amount of debate surrounding \nliquid nicotine, ranging from its use as cigarette cessation to its use \nin public spaces. While there are differing points on the future of \nvaping, everyone can agree on the need to prevent the product from \ninadvertently reaching the hands of children.\n  That is why my colleague from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) and I introduced \nthe Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act, which simply requires \nchild safety packaging be added to liquid nicotine containers. The bill \nwe are considering today and have already passed in the Senate is \nidentical to our bill, which passed out of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce in October of last year.\n\n[[Page H228]]\n\n  Liquid nicotine, the product that is used in vaping pipes, is getting \ninto the hands of children at a startling rate. I witnessed this \nfirsthand when I had the opportunity to visit the Indiana Poison \nControl Centers last year.\n  Their director, Dr. Jim Mowry, shared with me that exposures to e-\ncigarettes in Indiana alone have increased eightfold from 2011 to 2014. \nThe numbers nationwide are even more startling, with poison control \ncenters across the country showing a 14-fold increase in the exposure \nto e-cigarettes, from 271 cases in 2011 to just under 4,000 cases in \n2014.\n  Attracted by flavors like Skittles and Apple Jacks, curious children \nare often tempted to taste this liquid. Unfortunately, a single \nteaspoon of this liquid can be deadly to a child if it is either \ningested or absorbed through the skin.\n  Since there are no safety packaging requirements currently under \nFederal law, children aren't hindered in any way from having access to \nthis potentially lethal product. With vaping becoming even more popular \nacross the country and with an estimated 36 percent of e-cigarette \nusers not locking up bottles of liquid nicotine or using childproof \ncaps, I fear these calls to the poison control centers will only \ncontinue to rise.\n  That is why the bill in front of us today is so important. Very \nsimply, it solves the problem that we have by applying to liquid \nnicotine the existing childproofing requirements found in the Poison \nPrevention Act. We shield our children from hazardous products. Liquid \nnicotine should be no exception.\n  Now, I know that the FDA also plans to regulate in this space and \nsome have expressed worry about the overlapping regulations that this \nbill might impose. I am hopeful that the savings clause that we have \nadded to the bill will allay the fears of those skeptics since it \nexplicitly allows the FDA to continue its regulatory authority.\n  There is a significant amount of debate about the FDA's authority in \nthis area and when it will act. Regardless, since the FDA hasn't even \nproduced a proposed rule yet, a final rule will likely not be finalized \nfor over a year. That is a year of more calls to poison control centers \nacross the country and a year of kids being needlessly exposed to an \neasily preventable danger. Let's solve the problem right now by passing \nthis legislation and sending it to the President's desk today.\n  In closing, I express my thanks to my colleague, the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. Esty). This is something that I know she has worked on \nfor quite some time; so, I thank her for helping to spearhead this \neffort and for helping us to craft a bill that will protect children \nfor generations to come.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of S. 142, the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention \nAct, which would protect children from exposure to liquid nicotine.\n  Liquid nicotine comes in a variety of flavors, like orange, grape, \nbubblegum, and cotton candy, which appeal to kids, and many of these \nliquid nicotine products are easily accessible to children for contact \nand consumption. At this time, there is no existing standard to protect \nagainst accidental poisoning.\n  The threat of poisoning is not an imagined threat. About a year ago \nthe first American victim--a 1-year-old--died from liquid nicotine \npoisoning. The number of calls to poison control centers about liquid \nnicotine continues to rise, and more than half of those reported \nexposures occurred in children who were under 6 years of age.\n  This bill, as you heard, takes the commonsense step of directing the \nConsumer Product Safety Commission to limit the risks of child liquid \nnicotine poisoning by requiring special packaging for liquid nicotine \ncontainers.\n  At the same time, it allows the Food and Drug Administration to \ncontinue with its rules on tobacco products, including the requirement \nfor the childproof packaging of liquid nicotine.\n  The FDA's authority to do so is clear, and I strongly encourage the \nOffice of Management and Budget to finish its review of the tobacco \nrule so the rules can go into effect quickly.\n  I hope and expect this will be as widely supported in the House as it \nwas in the Senate. I salute Representative Brooks. I also thank \nRepresentative Elizabeth Esty for her important leadership on this \ncritical issue and for working across the aisle, from the outset, to \nadvance this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may consume to \nthe gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty).\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the Child Nicotine \nPoisoning Prevention Act.\n  Along with Senator Nelson, I proudly introduced the Child Nicotine \nPrevention Act last year. This year it has been a real pleasure to work \nwith my good friend Susan Brooks.\n  I would like to thank her as well as Representative Schakowsky, \nRepresentative Sarbanes, Chairman Upton, Ranking Member Pallone, and \nall of the staff for their help on this commonsense, important--\nliterally, lifesaving--legislation that I hope we will pass today and \nput on the President's desk tonight.\n  As a mom, I can only imagine the pain felt by parents whose children \nhave been poisoned by a substance that, so far, the Federal Government \nhas done nothing from which to protect their children.\n  It is understandable that children are attracted by the liquid \nnicotine that is being sold right now through e-cigarettes. The \npackages are brightly colored. They look like candy. They have flavors \nlike strawberry, gummy bears, cotton candy, peppermint, chocolate. Once \nyou open the package, it smells like candy.\n\n  It is not surprising, particularly at the holidays, that children who \nare seeing brightly colored food flavorings and who are dyeing cookies \nand making them bright colors would be curious. They smell it and want \nto taste it. Just a little over a year ago a 2-year-old died in New \nYork from ingesting this.\n  Even a small bottle of liquid nicotine has enough poison to kill four \nsmall children; so, I am grateful to my friends today on both sides of \nthe aisle for having joined us to reduce the risk of these poisonings \nby adding the simple packaging that we are all familiar with, those \nplastic wrappings that are on every bottle of eyedrops, on every bottle \nof contact lens solution, and on all poisons and commonsense household \nproducts that we know could endanger an adult.\n  But here we are talking about children, and they deserve our \nprotection. Liquid nicotine, which is just as dangerous, deserves to \nhave that packaging.\n  This bipartisan legislation will require that all liquid nicotine \nquantities be childproofed. It is a simple, commonsense measure. It \nwill save lives. I ask that all of my colleagues support this \nlegislation today so as to ensure that liquid nicotine packaging in all \nsizes and shapes and colors and flavors is childproofed.\n  We have worked very hard to ensure that we are working within the \nFDA's authority, giving them time to develop final rules. But, frankly, \nwe have already waited over a year. We have already had a death in the \nlast year, and there has been a huge increase in the number of calls to \npoison centers. So it is past time for us to act.\n  Again I thank my colleagues, particularly the chairman and Susan \nBrooks, for their leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us today. Let's get this on the \nPresident's desk for signature. Let's get our children protected from \nthe dangers of liquid nicotine.\n  Mr. SARBANES. Mr. Speaker, I urge support of this important bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  In closing, as the gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty) so \neloquently stated, I also commend my colleagues on the Committee on \nEnergy and Commerce for seeing the importance of this.\n  I thank Mr. Sarbanes, the chairman, and the ranking member for moving \non this commonsense legislation. I thank Ms. Esty for being a champion \nof the Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n[[Page H229]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to S. 142, the \n``Child Nicotine Poisoning Prevention Act,'' which requires any \nnicotine provided in a liquid nicotine container sold, offered for \nsale, manufactured for sale, distributed in commerce must be in special \npackaging that is difficult for children under five years of age to \nopen or access harmful contents.\n  As the founding member and Chair of the Congressional Children's \nCaucus, I am in support of this bill because it places the safety of \nchildren first.\n  Today, small children are at risk of injury and death from easily \naccessed liquid nicotine used to refill electronic cigarettes.\n  Nicotine liquids used in e-cigarettes are sold without child proof \npackaging.\n  Further, these nicotine products are attractive to children because \nthey come in a wide range of candy flavors such as gummy bear, cotton \ncandy and chocolate.\n  Liquid nicotine is highly toxic and sold in a highly concentrated \nform.\n  Many liquid nicotine products contain nearly 36 mg of nicotine per \nmilliliter of liquid.\n  According to the Campaign for Tobacco Free Kids the concentrated form \nof nicotine in liquid form intended for use in smokeless cigarettes \nwould only take a small 15 milliliter dose to kill four toddlers.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control the number of calls to \npoison centers involving e-cigarette liquids containing nicotine rose \nfrom one per month in September 2010 to 215 per month in February 2014.\n  Data from the American Association of Poison Control Centers (AAPCC) \nshowed nearly 4,000 adverse incidents related to e-cigarette exposures \nin 2014, a 145 percent increase from 2013 and a 14-fold increase since \n2011.\n  In 2015, there were 1,499 calls to Poison Control Centers through May \n31, 2015 that were liquid nicotine related.\n  This bill would save children's lives by allowing the Consumer \nProduct Safety Commission (CPSC) the authority to require the use of \nchild-resistant packaging on liquid nicotine containers sold to \nconsumers.\n  The CPSC currently requires such packaging on many common toxic \nhousehold substances like bleach, as well as FDA-regulated products \nlike prescription drugs.\n  S. 142 is needed to save children from unnecessary poisonings from \nliquid nicotine.\n  The most recent National Youth Tobacco Survey showed e-cigarette use \nis growing fast, and now this report shows e-cigarette related \npoisonings are also increasing rapidly,'' said Tim McAfee, M.D., \nM.P.H., Director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health.\n  We all must do our part to reduce liquid nicotine poisoning of \nchildren.\n  It will take the efforts of members of the House in voting to pass \nthis bill, health care providers, e-cigarette companies and \ndistributors, and the public need to join efforts to keep our children \nsafe from potential health risk from e-cigarettes.\n  Strategies to monitor and prevent future poisonings are critical \ngiven the rapid increase in e-cigarette related poisonings and the \nfirst step is voting for S. 142.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of S. 142, ``Child Nicotine \nPoisoning Prevention Act.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Brooks) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 142.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H229-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H229-H241]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1600\n             NORTH KOREA SANCTIONS ENFORCEMENT ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. ROYCE.

FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The Government of North Korea has repeatedly violated \n     its commitments to the complete, verifiable, irreversible \n     dismantlement of its nuclear weapons programs, and has \n     willfully violated multiple United Nations Security Council \n     resolutions calling for it to cease its development, testing, \n     and production of weapons of mass destruction.\n       (2) North Korea poses a grave risk for the proliferation of \n     nuclear weapons and other weapons of mass destruction.\n       (3) The Government of North Korea has been implicated \n     repeatedly in money laundering and illicit activities, \n     including prohibited arms sales, narcotics trafficking, the \n     counterfeiting of United States currency, and the \n     counterfeiting of intellectual property of United States \n     persons.\n       (4) The Government of North Korea has, both historically \n     and recently, repeatedly sponsored acts of international \n     terrorism, including attempts to assassinate defectors and \n     human rights activists, repeated threats of violence against \n     foreign persons, leaders, newspapers, and cities, and the \n     shipment of weapons to terrorists and state sponsors of \n     terrorism.\n       (5) North Korea has unilaterally withdrawn from the 1953 \n     Armistice Agreement that ended the Korean War, and committed \n     provocations against South Korea in 2010 by sinking the \n     warship Cheonan and killing 46 of her crew, and by shelling \n     Yeonpyeong Island, killing four South Koreans.\n       (6) North Korea maintains a system of brutal political \n     prison camps that contain as many as 120,000 men, women, and \n     children, who live in atrocious living conditions with \n     insufficient food, clothing, and medical care, and under \n     constant fear of torture or arbitrary execution.\n       (7) The Congress reaffirms the purposes of the North Korean \n     Human Rights Act of 2004 contained in section 4 of such Act \n     (22 U.S.C. 7802).\n       (8) North Korea has prioritized weapons programs and the \n     procurement of luxury goods, in defiance of United Nations \n     Security Council resolutions, and in gross disregard of the \n     needs of its people.\n       (9) The President has determined that the Government of \n     North Korea is responsible for knowingly engaging in \n     significant activities undermining cyber security with \n     respect to United States persons and interests, and for \n     threats of violence against the civilian population of the \n     United States.\n       (10) Persons, including financial institutions, who engage \n     in transactions with, or provide financial services to, the \n     Government of North Korea and its financial institutions \n     without establishing sufficient financial safeguards against \n     North Korea's use of these transactions to promote \n     proliferation, weapons trafficking, human rights violations, \n     illicit activity, and the purchase of luxury goods, aid and \n     abet North Korea's misuse of the international financial \n     system, and also violate the intent of relevant United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions.\n\n[[Page H230]]\n\n       (11) The Government of North Korea's conduct poses an \n     imminent threat to the security of the United States and its \n     allies, to the global economy, to the safety of members of \n     the United States Armed Forces, to the integrity of the \n     global financial system, to the integrity of global \n     nonproliferation programs, and to the people of North Korea.\n       (12) The Congress seeks, through this legislation, to use \n     nonmilitary means to address this crisis, to provide \n     diplomatic leverage to negotiate necessary changes in North \n     Korea's conduct, and to ease the suffering of the people of \n     North Korea.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Applicable executive order.--The term ``applicable \n     Executive order'' means--\n       (A) Executive Order No. 13382 (2005), 13466 (2008), 13551 \n     (2010), 13570 (2011), or 13687 (2015) to the extent that such \n     Executive order authorizes the imposition of sanctions on \n     persons for conduct, or prohibits transactions or activities, \n     involving the Government of North Korea;

and\n       (E) called on all jurisdictions to protect against \n     correspondent relationships being used to bypass or evade \n     countermeasures and risk mitigation practices, and take into \n     account money laundering and terrorist financing risks when \n     considering requests by North Korean financial institutions \n     to open branches and subsidiaries in their jurisdiction.\n       (3) On March 7, 2013, the United Nations Security Council \n     unanimously adopted Resolution 2094, which--\n       (A) welcomed the Financial Action Task Force's \n     recommendation on financial sanctions related to \n     proliferation, and its guidance on the implementation of \n     sanctions;\n       (B) decided that Member States should apply enhanced \n     monitoring and other legal measures to prevent the provision \n     of financial services or the transfer of property that could \n     contribute to activities prohibited by applicable United \n     Nations Security Council resolutions; and\n       (C) called on Member States to prohibit North Korean banks \n     from establishing or maintaining correspondent relationships \n     with banks in their jurisdictions, to prevent the provision \n     of financial services, if they have information that provides \n     reasonable grounds to believe that these activities could \n     contribute to activities prohibited by an applicable United \n     Nations Security Council resolution, or to the evasion of \n     such prohibitions.\n       (b) Sense of Congress Regarding the Designation of North \n     Korea as a Jurisdiction of Primary Money Laundering \n     Concern.--Congress--\n       (1) acknowledges the efforts of the United Nations Security \n     Council to impose limitations on, and require enhanced \n     monitoring of, transactions involving North Korean financial \n     institutions that could contribute to sanctioned activities;\n       (2) urges the President, in the strongest terms, to \n     immediately designate North Korea as a jurisdiction of \n     primary money laundering concern, and to adopt stringent \n     special measures to safeguard the financial system against \n     the risks posed by North Korea's willful evasion of sanctions \n     and its illicit activities;

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on this resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate Leader McCarthy working with myself, \nworking with Ranking Member Eliot Engel of New York to schedule this \nlegislation for floor consideration.\n  Last week, North Korea conducted its fourth known nuclear test. The \nKim regime has developed increasingly destructive weapons.\n  What we are concerned about here is the miniaturization of nuclear \nwarheads that fit onto its most reliable missiles. We are also \nconcerned about the submarine tests for firing from a sub these \nmissiles that would be capable of launching those devices. We are \nconcerned about the ongoing efforts to make certain that they have got \nthe range now on a three-stage rocket, ICBM, to hit the United States. \nThis threat is unacceptable, and it has to be aggressively challenged.\n  The legislation that we are considering here is the most \ncomprehensive North Korea sanctions legislation to come before this \nbody. Importantly, what this bill does is use targeted financial and \neconomic pressure to isolate Kim Jong-un and his top officials from the \nassets that they maintain in foreign banks and from the hard currency \nthat sustains their rule.\n  These assets are derived primarily from illicit activities, such as \ncounterfeiting U.S. currency, something that North Korea has been \ncaught doing with hundred-dollar bank notes, such as selling their \nmissile systems around the world, contraband in cigarettes, drugs, and \nother illicit activities. And all of that is used to advance North \nKorea's nuclear program.\n  They also pay for the luxurious lifestyle of the ruling elites, as we \nhave seen in some of the exposes that come out of North Korea, and it \nis used to repress the people. In other words, the money from that hard \ncurrency pays for the generals, pays for the secret police, pays for \nthe missile program and the nuclear weapons program.\n  A strategy of financial pressure is the approach we took a decade ago \nwhen the previous administration targeted Banco Delta Asia. That was a \nMacao-based bank. This was in 2005. They were targeted for their role \nin laundering money for North Korea, and this cut it off from the \nfinancial system, really. This led other banks in the region to shun \nNorth Korean business, because when the option is out there between \nwhether or not you are going to bank with North Korea or bank with the \nU.S. and the rest of the world, it is a fairly easy choice for these \nbanks to make. At that point, they freeze the accounts, and that, \nobviously, isolates the regime.\n  At that time, according to one former top U.S. official who was \nspeaking to the issue of what the North Koreans would say when they \nwould come into the meetings with the State Department, at every \nconversation we had with the North Koreans, he said, every one of them \nbegan and ended with the same question: ``When do we get our money \nback?''\n  Now, the part that got my interest at the time was not only the \nreport that, because he couldn't pay his generals, there were problems \nfor the regime--it is not a good position for a dictator to be in--but \nalso that missile production\n\n[[Page H236]]\n\nlines had come to a halt because they couldn't buy on the black market; \nthey didn't have the hard currency anymore to do it, the parts that \nthey needed for their programs.\n  Unfortunately, the pressure at the time was lifted. I think it was \nlifted prematurely for certain because the representation was made that \nKim Jong Il was going to make concessions on his nuclear program, \nconcessions that ultimately were never made. From my standpoint, what a \nmistake. From the standpoint of the people I talk to over at Treasury, \nwhat a mistake. They had a different vision on how those sanctions \nshould be maintained.\n  Today, the Obama administration has let its North Korea policy drift. \nA year ago, it promised a proportional response to the massive cyber \nterrorist attack against the United States. But to date, the \nadministration's response has been dangerously weak. A mere 18 low-\nlevel arms dealers have been sanctioned. That has been it. Failing to \nrespond to North Korea's belligerence, I think, only emboldens their \nleader.\n  Disrupting North Korea's illicit activities will place tremendous \nstrain on that country's ruling elite who have so brutalized the people \nof North Korea. I spoke to the defector who used to run their \npropaganda machinery about this. He defected through China. And he \ndiscussed this issue. He said: Look, that hard currency goes, not to \nthe people; it goes for the military apparatus and the political \napparatus of the regime. So we have got to go after those illicit \nactivities like we went after organized crime in the United States: \nidentify the network, interdict shipments, disrupt the flow of money.\n  North Korea, after all, has been called a ``gangster regime.'' You \nhave seen that term in the press. Well, it is pretty apt. This regime \nis a critical threat, frankly, to our national security. Under this \nbill's framework, anyone laundering money, counterfeiting goods, \nsmuggling, or trafficking narcotics will be subject to significant \nsanctions.\n  It is also important to remember the deplorable state of human rights \nin North Korea. Two years ago, a U.N. Commission of Inquiry released \nthe most comprehensive report on North Korea to date, finding that the \nKim regime ``has for decades,'' in their words, ``pursued policies \ninvolving crimes that shock the conscience of humanity.'' So this bill \nrequires the State Department to use this report's findings to identify \nthe individuals responsible for these abuses and to press for more ways \nin which to get information into North Korea so as to move the \nattitudes of the population inside the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, a return to the strategy of effective financial pressure \non North Korea is our best bet to end North Korea's threat to its own \npeople, to our South Korean allies, and ultimately to us.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                 Committee on Oversight and Government Reform,\n\n                                Washington, DC, February 26, 2015.\n     Hon.

As a \n     result of your having consulted with us on provisions in H.R. \n     757 that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee \n     on Ways and Means, I agree to waive consideration of this \n     bill so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor.\n       The Committee on Ways and Means takes this action with the \n     mutual understanding that by forgoing consideration of H.R. \n     757 at this time, we do not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this or similar legislation, and \n     the Committee will be appropriately consulted and involved as \n     the bill or similar legislation moves forward so that we may \n     address any remaining issues that fall within our Rule X \n     jurisdiction.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of this measure.\n  I want to first thank our chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee, \nEd Royce, for authoring this very good, bipartisan bill. I am very \npleased to be the lead Democratic cosponsor. I think this is an \nimportant bill, and it ties in with what we have tried to do for these \npast years on the Foreign Affairs Committee, being bipartisan and \nletting politics stop at the water's edge when we are talking about \ninternational affairs.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week's nuclear test in North Korea was a stark \nreminder of just how dangerous the Kim regime is. A nuclear weapon in \nthe hands of a rogue power is a threat to peace and stability around \nthe world. North Korea continues to have a destabilizing influence on \nthe peninsula and across the region, and the potential for nuclear fuel \nfrom North Korea to end up on the black market in the hands of violent \nextremists only compounds the threat.\n  Yet, despite the burden of some of the toughest sanctions imaginable, \ndespite constant pressure from the global community, despite the \nincreasing isolation of North Korea from the rest of the world, leaders \nin Pyongyang persist on this dangerous and destabilizing course.\n  The latest test demands a response. We need to work with our allies, \nparticularly South Korea and Japan. We need to make sure this issue is \nat the top of the agenda in our engagement with China. China can have a \nlot of influence and does have a lot of influence over North Korea. We \nneed to act unilaterally to make clear to the North Koreans that their \nactions have consequences.\n  This bill would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. Let \nme say I am very proud, again, in a bipartisan way, this bill passed \nunanimously out of the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  North Korea has become more and more savvy at evading sanctions, and \nthat is why this bill broadens our sanctions. The country's elites do \nbusiness with shell companies and cover up the money trail. This allows \nhard currency to flow into North Korea. This bill would crack down on \nthis practice and go after anyone helping prop up the Kim regime \nthrough these illegal activities.\n  I must say that I have been to North Korea twice, to Pyongyang twice. \nWe watched in the morning when people were going to work. The elites do \nvery well there. It is just the rest of the country that is starving.\n  This bill would include the important exceptions for the humanitarian \naid that benefits the North Korean people. We help them with food aid. \nWe are the most generous country with feeding North Korea. It is \nimportant to point this out because our quarrel is not with the North \nKorean people. It is with the despot and his aides that run North \nKorea.\n  We know that the people of North Korea endure deplorable treatment at \nthe hands of a corrupt regime. I can tell you the country's citizens \ndeserve much, much better. That is why we will keep up the pressure on \nNorth Korea's leaders and that is why we need to pass this legislation.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Smith), chairman of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nAfrica, Global Health, Global Human Rights, and International \nOrganizations.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished \nchairman for yielding.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions \nEnforcement Act of 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a compelling need to pass tough and effective \nlegislation to freeze the assets of the Kim Jong-un regime.\n  I want to commend Chairman Royce for his long and hard work on North \nKorea and his determination to bring this bill to the floor. I again \nthank Ranking Member Eliot Engel for his good, strong sense of \nbipartisanship. This is a one-two punch against a cruel dictatorship, \nand this legislation has to get to the President as soon as possible.\n  Mr. Speaker, whether it be North Korea or Iran, when will we learn \nthe hard lesson that totalitarian states do not negotiate in good \nfaith, cannot be trusted to hold up their end of the bargain, and use \nour goodwill and our foreign capital to keep on proliferating? They \nwill not allow intrusive inspections because they cheat and because it \nweakens their status at home. They use nuclear weapons negotiations to\n\n[[Page H238]]\n\nenhance their own diplomatic status and to gain concessions.\n  In the end, nuclear negotiations earn rogue nations like Iran and \nNorth Korea foreign capital and other investments from the West. They \nuse that to fund additional missile technology, to fund criminal and \nterrorist activities, and to continue with clandestine nuclear \nprograms.\n  During the Bush administration, the most effective tools in bringing \nthe North Korea dictatorship to heel were the freezing of its assets in \nthe Banco Delta Asia in Macao and the building of an international \ncoalition to interdict suspect North Korea shipping. These should be \nour priorities now, especially in the shadow of North Korea's nuclear \ntests, by imposing mandatory sanctions on the perpetrators of human \nrights abuses, censorship, arms and human trafficking, money \nlaundering, as well proliferation.\n  Nearly 2 years ago, the U.N. Commission of Inquiry reported that the \nongoing crimes against humanity in North Korea have no ``parallel in \nthe contemporary world.'' These crimes include ``extermination, murder, \nenslavement, torture, imprisonment, rape, forced abortions and other \nsexual violence, persecution on political, religious, and racial, and \ngrounds, the forcible transfer of populations, the enforced \ndisappearance of persons, and the inhumane act of knowingly causing \nprolonged starvation.''\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Kim Jong-un cares not at all about the welfare of his own people. We \nshould expect that he cares even less about the welfare of the people \nof Japan, South Korea, or even U.S. citizens who face the threat of \nNorth Korean nuclear weapons.\n  The U.N. Commission recommended that the U.N. impose targeted \nsanctions on the North Korean leaders responsible for its human rights \ncrimes. However, China blocks U.N. action.\n  Without U.N. action, the U.S. must act, using our position as the \nsteward of the global financial system. The U.N. Special Rapporteur on \nNorth Korea welcomes such action, supporting targeted sanctions of \nthose most responsible for these heinous crimes against humanity.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Connolly), my friend and colleague and a valued member of \nthe Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my dear friend from New York, the \ndistinguished ranking member of the House Committee on Foreign Affairs.\n  I rise today in support of the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act \nof 2016. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nleadership in bringing this legislation before us.\n  I especially appreciate the inclusion of two of my amendments, one to \nprovide for the reunification of Korean families separated by the 38th \nparallel, and another to ensure that U.S. policy toward North Korea is \ninformed by the recommendations made in the landmark Commission of \nInquiry on Human Rights in North Korea conducted by the United Nations.\n  Amidst the tense geopolitical standoffs and irresponsible actions of \nthe North Korean regime, we must always remember the human cost of this \nenduring conflict. I believe this bill, through these amendments and \nimportant exceptions to sanctions for humanitarian relief \norganizations, does just that. This is timely, if not overdue, \nlegislation.\n  North Korea is a reckless, paranoid state devoid of virtually all \naspects of human autonomy, now armed with a nuclear umbrella. That \nmakes the Korean peninsula one of the most dangerous flash points on \nthe globe.\n  There have been recent developments in North Korea that are \nprofoundly troubling and deserve an immediate response from this \nCongress. Reports that North Korea has conducted its fourth nuclear \nweapons test confirm that the regime in Pyongyang is committed to \ndefying international norms and risks destabilizing the entire Asia-\nPacific region.\n  As co-chairman of the Congressional Caucus on Korea, I remain deeply \nconcerned with the volatility and the ever-present potential of \nconflict on the Korean Peninsula.\n  It is a specter that looms over 75 million Koreans and, for their \nsake and that of the region, the U.S., the Republic of Korea, China, \nand other regional stakeholders must demonstrate commitment to \naddressing this threat.\n  By targeting the individuals and entities that support the Kim regime \nthrough illicit activities, this bill will hopefully weaken the resolve \nand capability of Pyongyang to endanger regional stability.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of the bill.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe), chairman of the Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, \nand Trade of the Committee on Foreign Affairs. He is also an original \ncosponsor with me on this legislation.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for bringing this piece of legislation up to the House floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, North Korea is a world threat, a nuclear world threat. \nIts leaders are outlaws with no redeeming social character in their \nsouls, and we need to operate with them knowing this.\n  Last week, North Korea tested another nuclear weapon. As chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, I held a \nhearing in October and predicted that this test would happen again.\n  With Iran about to receive hundreds of billions of dollars for its \nillegal nuclear program, we shouldn't be surprised that North Korea \nwants a piece of the pie, too. Illegal nuclear programs and material \ncan bring a lot of money to a regime.\n  In the hearing that we had in October, we learned of deep connections \nbetween Iran and North Korea. Both nations, among other things, sponsor \nworldwide terror. They have a history of working together on missile \ndevelopment. There is mounting evidence that they have worked together \non their nuclear weapons programs as well. We should expect Iran to \nkeep working with North Korea to advance its own nuclear weapons \nprogram.\n  We have sanctions on North Korea, but all those sanctions have not \nbeen fully implemented. The administration's policy of strategic \npatience is not working because this barbaric regime continues to \ndevelop nuclear weapons and ICBMs. I say our patience has run out in \ndealing with them.\n  This bill is Congress showing North Korea that there are consequences \nfor their testing of nuclear weapons. We cannot let North Korea develop \nits nuclear program even more.\n  North Korea already has submarines with missiles on them that can \nreach the United States, over 10 nuclear bombs, and for some reason has \nAustin on its hit list. I take that personally, Mr. Speaker, that \nAustin is their number one target in the United States.\n  North Korea is a state that imprisons Christians for their faith, \nstarves its citizens, controls the Internet and the media, tortures \nanyone in its domain who dares to disagree with the regime, and is \nengaged in cyberterrorism.\n  Dangerous actions by a ruthless dictator must be met by forceful \nresponses. I am glad to be an original cosponsor of this bill. I urge \nits passage. It is time for them to pay the price for going rogue.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nHawaii (Ms. Gabbard), our colleague on the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs, a rising star in our committee.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, I am rising today in strong support of H.R. \n757, the North Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act, which I am proud to be \na cosponsor of.\n  North Korea continues to pose a serious and dangerous threat to my \nconstituents in Hawaii, the Pacific, and the West Coast of the United \nStates. Our communities and our families lie within range of North \nKorea's intercontinental ballistic missiles.\n  North Korea's nuclear tests just a week ago and their continued \npursuit of developing more nuclear weapons and miniaturizing those \nweapons serve as a reminder of the threat that North Korea poses to our \ncountry, which my constituents in Hawaii know all too well.\n  There are some necessary steps that the United States must take to \ndeal with this threat: We need to increase the strength and \ncapabilities of our Pacific fleet and forces. We need to stop\n\n[[Page H239]]\n\nthe downward trend in investment of ballistic missile defense \ndevelopment and capabilities, and strengthen our ballistic missile \ndefense capabilities, specifically in Hawaii and the Pacific, to \ncounter this threat. We need to completely reexamine our strategy of \nso-called strategic patience with North Korea, recognizing that North \nKorea has continued to grow in their nuclear and missile capabilities, \ntelling us that the status quo is not working.\n  This bill, however, deals with another important area where we need \nto act, and that is sanctions. It gives us the tools to respond to \nNorth Korea's provocations. One provision would apply sanctions that \nprohibit the export of munitions to North Korea and severely restrict \nexport licenses for controlled goods and technologies. It would \nprohibit financial transactions between U.S. persons and the Government \nof North Korea and sanction those who send or receive lethal military \nequipment to or from North Korea.\n  The bill will also give us the tools to reapply some of the most \neffective sanctions that we have ever had against hard currency for \nthose who do business with North Korea. We saw how these sanctions were \neffective before.\n  Following U.S. action against the Banco Delta Asia based in Macao in \n2005, the assets of North Korean banks and leaders were frozen and \ncompletely blocked from the international financial system. This \ndirectly affected the money being used to develop these nuclear and \nballistic missile capabilities, and the money also supported the \nregime's leadership and its elites and their lifestyle.\n  This severely increased the pressure in North Korea, causing them to \nengage with the international community, coming to an agreement to lift \nthe sanctions in 2007--prematurely, in my view--made in exchange for \nshutting down and sealing the Yongbyon nuclear facilities and \ndiscussing a list of its nuclear-related activities with the U.S. and \nother parties in the region.\n  The agreement was violated by North Korea in 2009 when they tested a \nmissile, and the sanctions on Banco Delta showed us earlier a way to \nimpact North Korean leadership and business directly. Those sanctions \nshould have been immediately reinstated upon North Korea breaking that \nagreement, but that is why we are here today--to act.\n  While sanctions alone are not enough, this bill could provide some \nvery important tools to countering North Korea's aggression and \nultimately achieving our objective of a denuclearized North Korea.\n  Lastly, this bill recognizes the terrible human rights abuses \ninflicted on the people of North Korea. For many years, State \nDepartment human rights reports, as well as private organizations' \nreports, have depicted a pattern of extreme human rights abuses by the \ntyrannical North Korean regime, including the denial of basic human \nfreedoms: withheld access to food and deplorable prison camps where \nextrajudicial killings, enslavement, torture, and sexual abuse are \nwidespread.\n  I would like to thank our Chairman Royce and our Ranking Member Engel \nfor their steadfast, bipartisan dedication and leadership to taking \naction on this global and domestic security issue. This bill provides a \ncritical step forward.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen), chairman emeritus of the Committee on \nForeign Affairs and author of multiple North Korea human rights and \nsanctions laws. She is also a cosponsor of this bill.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I am so proud and pleased to be here \nspeaking on behalf of this bill, H.R. 757, the North Korea Sanctions \nEnforcement Act. I thank Chairman Royce and Ranking Member Engel for \nintroducing this important bill which, once again, is presented in \ntheir usual bipartisan manner.\n  While initial reports, Mr. Speaker, cast doubt on North Korea's \nclaims that it carried out a hydrogen bomb test, any enhancement of the \nregime's nuclear capability should be--must be--a cause for concern. \nBoth U.S. and South Korean intelligence assessments indicate that North \nKorea already possesses the capability to install a nuclear warhead on \na missile that can reach United States territory or that of our allies.\n  Despite some doubt about that capability's effectiveness, it is just \na matter of time before North Korea finishes developing this dangerous \ntechnology that it is seeking or, worse, shares this technology with \nIran, as these two rogue regimes are bosom buddies and have long been \nknown to collaborate on their ballistic missile programs.\n  What is clear is that our current policy toward North Korea is not \nworking. Administrations from both parties, Mr. Speaker, have made \nmistakes with North Korea over the years. They have failed to respond \nto North Korea's violation of its nuclear deal and have failed to hold \nthe regime accountable for its illicit activity. Administration after \nadministration have removed North Korea off the State Sponsors of \nTerrorism list and continue to keep the regime off that list despite \nmounting evidence that would support its inclusion back on the \nterrorism list. Various administrations have utterly failed to enforce \nthe North Korea sanctions that we already have on the books.\n\n  The Obama administration's so-called strategic patience policy with \nNorth Korea has proven to be a disaster, and it is time that we fully \nand vigorously enforce the existing sanctions and expand upon those to \nimplement new sanctions on Pyongyang until its nuclear program is \ndismantled.\n  By some estimates, North Korea might already have 10 to 15 nuclear \nweapons, and Kim Jong-un has shown that he will stop at nothing to get \nthe weapons and the technology that he desires. This bill would help \nensure that our sanctions on North Korea are finally being enforced the \nway they always should have been, but we can't forget that North Korea \ncannot make progress on its nuclear program alone.\n  North Korea has a long history of collaborating with other rogue \nregimes, and we must ensure that we are enforcing sanctions on all of \nits collaborators. Any government entity or individual that has sold or \ntransferred weapons or technology to North Korea in violation of U.S. \nlaw or U.N. Security Council resolution should also be targeted for \nsanctions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will end with this note: North Korea has been writing \nthe playbook for rogue regimes to follow, and unless this \nadministration gets serious about confronting Pyongyang's aggressions, \nI worry that it will continue to allow Iran to take advantage of us, \nthat we won't enforce sanctions on Tehran, just like we are not \nenforcing them on North Korea.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. In a few years' time, we will be back here debating \nwhat to do after another nuclear device test by North Korea, by Iran, \nor by other rogue actors.\n  North Korea poses an imminent threat now to our security as well as \nthat of our allies. We cannot afford to ignore it nor look the other \nway.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for this important bill and urge \nits passage.\n  I thank the chairman and the ranking member for this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Colleagues, a nuclear weapon in the hands of North Korea, a rogue, \ndestabilizing country on the peninsula and across the region, is simply \na nonstarter. It is unthinkable. Despite our tough sanctions and \nincreasing isolation from the global community, Pyongyang continues \ndown a dangerous and destabilizing course.\n  Last week's nuclear test in North Korea is a jarring reminder of just \nhow dangerous the Kim regime is and demands a response from the United \nStates and our allies as well. We must work with South Korea and Japan \nto make sure this issue is at the top of our agenda in our engagement \nwith China. We must act unilaterally to make sure to North Koreans that \ntheir leadership's actions have consequences.\n  H.R. 757 would broaden our sanctions and strengthen enforcement. The \nbill\n\n[[Page H240]]\n\nwould crack down on North Korean elite who do business through shell \ncompanies to evade detection and go after anyone helping to prop up the \nKim regime through illegal activities. This bill would include \nimportant exceptions for the humanitarian aid that benefits the North \nKorean people.\n  North Koreans deserve much more than what its leaders are providing, \nwhich is why we need to pass this legislation. We cannot allow North \nKorea to continue to be dangerous and frivolous. We have to stand up \nand say no. They have to understand that we mean business. They have to \nunderstand that what they have done is unacceptable and will not stand.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have the opportunity today to show Americans and the world that \nCongress is willing to lead on this vital national security issue. This \nis an issue that Congress has been focused on, obviously, for some \ntime.\n  I have spent much of my time on the Foreign Affairs Committee focused \non the North Korean threat. Ranking Member Eliot Engel and I, in one of \nour first trips together as chairman and ranking member of the \ncommittee, traveled to visit our South Korean ally and toured the \nwreckage of the Cheonan.\n  This was a corvette ship that was hit and split right in half by a \ntorpedo fired by a North Korean submarine, costing the lives of 46 \nsailors. It is a reminder of the attitude that North Korea has in terms \nof its provocative action.\n  Both Eliot Engel and I have been to North Korea on separate trips, \nand we can tell you it is a totalitarian state with an ever-present \ncult of personalities. If you have ever read Orwell's book, ``Nineteen \nEighty-Four,'' the society in that book seemed almost more rational \nthan this police state.\n  I was talking to the former Minister of Propaganda. In the no-go \nareas, 1.9 million were starved to death in North Korea. You ask why. \nWell, with the paranoia of the police state, they are not considered \nparticularly loyal out there.\n  Besides, the food can be sold on the food exchange in the capital for \nhard currency. Donated food often is used in this way to support what \nhe calls ``juche,'' to support this philosophy which leads them forward \nwith this desire to have a nuclear weapon and the capability to deliver \nit.\n  This bipartisan bill, which I authored with Eliot Engel as our \nprincipal coauthor, is based on legislation that unanimously passed the \nHouse last Congress. Its implementation will help sever a key subsidy \nfor North Korea's weapons of mass destruction program, for only when \nthe North Korean leadership realizes that its criminal activities are \nuntenable do prospects for peace and security in Northeast Asia \nimprove.\n  This bill will return us to the one strategy that has worked to \npressure North Korea at a time when Kim Jong-un is trying to blackmail \nhis way to consolidating power.\n  Congress must send the message to the Kim regime that they can either \nreform and disarm or the system can implode. Without hard currency, \nwithout being able to pay the generals, that system would implode. By \ncutting off Kim Jong-un's access to the hard currency he needs for his \narmy and his weapons, this bill, H.R. 757, will squarely present the \nNorth Korean regime with that choice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, recent news of North Korea's claim that \nit successfully conducted an H-bomb test for the first time, in \ndefiance of United Nations' resolutions ups the ante on why we must \nremain steadfast in expediently addressing insecurity in our nation and \nacross the globe, as anticipated in this bill by Representative Royce \nof California, entitled the North Korean Sanctions Enforcement Act of \n2,315 which has enjoyed bi-partisan support.\n  Our world today is faced with resurgent and evolving threats from \nweapons of mass destruction to destructive nuclear ambitions.\n  Indeed, news events inform us of the far-ranging spectrum we must \ncontend with, ranging from persistent nation state-based dangerous \nnuclear ambitions in North Korea, to continued chemical weapons used in \nSyria, to terrorist organizations such as Daesh ramping up their \ndestructive capabilities through vitriolic recruitment strategies, that \npose an existential threat beyond the borders from which ISIS is \noperating.\n  I am confident that these are issues that President Obama will be \naddressing and proposing durable solutions to during his last state of \nthe Union Address as our nation's Commander In Chief.\n  Under his leadership, our nation has achieved foreign policy feats \nthat have worked to maintain our security, promote our geopolitical \nobjectives and advance our diplomatic relationships with key allies.\n  Let's just take a quick look back at some of the President's foreign \npolicy achievements:\n  The capture and neutralization of Osama Bin Laden which brought an \nend to a nearly decade long manhunt.\n  The withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq which helped to bring an end \nto a costly war, helping our country save billions of dollars in U.S. \ntaxpayer funds.\n  The current Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, which has been \ninstrumental in deterring and stemming Iran's nuclear ambitions and \nenabling security in the global society.\n  The repealing of Don't Ask, Don't Tell, an aspersion on the personal \nprivate matters of those who have dedicated their lives to protect our \nnation.\n  Signing into law the New Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (START), an \nimportant treaty that showcases how the U.S. leads by example by \nsigning a treaty that requires both the United States and Russia to \nreduce their nuclear warhead arsenals to 1,550 each, a 30 percent \nreduction from the 2002 Treaty of Moscow and a 74 percent reduction \nfrom the 1991 START treaty.\n  Neutralization of al Qaeda propagandist and foreign fighter recruiter \nAnwar Al Awlaki, one of the main leaders in the Al Qaeda in the Arabian \nPeninsula (AQAP).\n  Indeed, under President Obama's leadership, our country's military \naid to Israel has increased remarkably with the eye towards deepening \nand expanding U.S./Israeli relations-an important aspect of our \nnation's foreign policy and geopolitical efforts to promote peace in \nthe region.\n  This president's foreign policy achievements in promoting the \nsecurity of our nation are irrefutable and this is why I support the \nNorth Korea Sanctions Enforcement Act of 2015 because it will empower \nhim to continue his impressive work in this arena.\n  Much like the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) championed \nby this Administration, this bill encourages our President to \ninvestigate any credible information of sanctionable activities \ninvolving North Korea.\n  Furthermore, this bill will designate and implement sanctions against \npersons and entities who knowingly engage in or contribute to \nactivities in North Korea whether it is through their exporting or \nimporting of weapons of mass destruction, significant arms, significant \nluxury goods, money laundering, censorship, or engage in human rights \nabuses.\n  Pursuant to the bill, the President is empowered to exercise \nauthorities under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act \n(IEEPA) as it relates to persons, entities and the government of North \nKorea.\n  This bill empowers our President with discretionary authority to \ndesignate and apply sanctions to persons involved in certain other \nkinds of conduct.\n  This bill will facilitate civil forfeiture of assets, real or \npersonal, if said properties inure from any attempted or actual \nviolation of this Act, or which constitutes or is derived from proceeds \ntraceable to such a violation.\n  Other core provisions of the bill is the empowerment of our Treasury \nSecretary to:\n  determine whether reasonable grounds exist for concluding that North \nKorea is a jurisdiction of primary money laundering concern; and\n  In the event our Treasury Secretary makes this determination, he is \nempowered to impose one or more special measures with respect to the \njurisdiction of North Korea.\n  Finally, our sense of Congress in this bill is in comity with and \nensures the consistent enforcement of United Nations Security Council \nresolutions and financial restrictions on North Korea.\n  Through this bill, our president will be empowered to withhold \nassistance under the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 to any country that \nprovides lethal military equipment to, or receives it from the \ngovernment of North Korea.\n  This bill is also important because it will put into place an \nenhanced screening procedure whereby our Secretary of Homeland Security \n(DHS) will be able to determine if physical inspections are warranted \nof any cargo bound for or landed in the United States that has been \ntransported through a foreign seaport or airport whose inspections are \ndeficient if there are reasonable grounds to believe that such cargo \ncontains goods prohibited under this Act.\n\n[[Page H241]]\n\n  This will facilitate expedient seizure of vessels or aircraft used to \nfacilitate sanctionable activities.\n  The President will also be supported in his efforts to produce \nprogress reports on significant activities undermining cyber security \nconflicted, or otherwise ordered or controlled, directly or indirectly, \nby the government of North Korea.\n  Our Secretary of State will be supported in his human rights efforts \nof reporting on each political prison camp in North Korea, which will \ninclude a detailed description of those abuses or censorship.\n  Again, I thank Chairman Royce for championing this bill and look \nforward to working with him and other members of this House in \npromoting our national security and supporting our President's \nobjective of establishing us as a credible and trusted leader in the \nglobal landscape.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Royce) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 757, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H241-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H241-H242]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                PRESIDENTIAL ALLOWANCE MODERNIZATION ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 1777) to amend the Act of August 25, 1958, commonly known as \nthe ``Former Presidents Act of 1958'', with respect to the monetary \nallowance payable to a former President, and for other purposes, as \namended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1777\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to \nthe rule, the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman \nfrom the District of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 20 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential Allowance \nModernization Act. The act updates an arcane law which no longer \nreflects day-to-day reality in order to reduce unnecessary costs to the \ntaxpayers. H.R. 1777 decreases the pension of former Presidents, \nincreases the pension of surviving spouses, and limits the allowances \nprovided for post-Presidential expenditures.\n  This important piece of legislation amends and modernizes the Former \nPresidents Act of 1958 by authorizing a $200,000 annual pension for \neach former President and a $100,000 annual survivor benefit for each \nsurviving spouse.\n  We thank these Presidents and their spouses for the unbelievable toll \nand service that they have given to their country. Currently, former \nPresidents receive an annual pension of roughly $203,700, and a \nsurviving spouse's pension is $20,000.\n  The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act also sets an annual \nallowance of $200,000 for costs such as travel, staff, and office \nexpenses that are associated with post-Presidential life.\n  For those former Presidents that earn outside income, which most do, \nthe $200,000 annual allowance is reduced dollar for dollar for every \ndollar a former President earns in outside income in excess of \n$400,000.\n\n[[Page H242]]\n\n  So, in essence, if former Presidents want to ride off into the sunset \nand go fishing and enjoy the Utah sunsets, they can go do that. They \nwill be very healthily compensated to lead that kind of lifestyle.\n  If they choose to go out and sell books and give speeches and do all \nthose things, more power to them. If that is what they choose to do, \nthey can go out and make that type of money. For some, they make \nmillions of dollars doing so. At that point, I just don't think that \nthe taxpayers should necessarily supplement their income. They don't \nneed it at that point.\n  So we worked in a very good, bipartisan way with Ranking Member \nElijah Cummings from Maryland. We worked to do this together. We \nintroduced this in a bipartisan way. I want our Members to know that, \nif this bill passes, it would save nearly $10 million in the first 5 \nyears.\n  In fiscal year 2015, Congress appropriated $3.2 million for pensions, \noffice staff, and related expenses for former Presidents. Of that \namount, the General Services Administration made $1.1 million in rental \npayments for office space.\n  The annual allowance provision under H.R. 1777 replaces the millions \nof dollars currently provided for travel, staff, and office expenses of \nformer Presidents and ends an unnecessary government handout to former \nPresidents that decide to make millions after leaving office.\n  This bill does not affect the security or protection of former \nPresidents or family members of a former President. But, rather, H.R. \n1777 brings an end to the American taxpayer subsidizing expenditures \nfor former Presidents.\n  Unfortunately, both sides of the aisle recognize that, no matter who \nthe President is, in this modern age, they are going to have security \nconcerns the rest of their lives.\n  Under this bill, all of those expenses for the Secret Service and \nthose type of expenditures will continue to be paid for, at no expense. \nNo matter their income, it is a duty and obligation of the Federal \nGovernment to protect these former Presidents, and they will continue \nto do so.\n  The Presidential Allowance Modernization Act modernizes the Former \nPresidents Act while reducing unnecessary costs to the taxpayers.\n  Again, I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings, who was an original \ncosponsor of this bill. I also want to thank Representative Grothman \nfrom Wisconsin, who cosponsored and worked on this piece of \nlegislation. I urge Members to vote in favor of this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1777, the Presidential \nAllowance Modernization Act. I want to thank my good friends, Chairman \nChaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings of the Oversight Committee, for \ntheir work on this important update of Presidential legislation.\n  This is what this bill would do: It would update what has become an \narcane law and reduce unnecessary costs to the taxpayer. The bill would \namend the Former Presidents Act of 1958 to provide a $200,000 annual \npension for each former President and a $100,000 annual survivor \nbenefit to each surviving spouse. The pensions are indexed to inflation \nand would increase with the Social Security cost-of-living adjustment.\n  Currently, surviving spouses receive $20,000--an interesting \ndisparity between the spouse and the former President--and former \nPresidents receive a pension equal to the pay for Cabinet Secretaries, \nwhich for 2015 is $203,700.\n  The bill would also provide an annual allowance of $200,000 for costs \nassociated with post-Presidential life. The annual allowance would \nreplace amounts currently provided for travel, staff, and office \nexpenses, which totaled $3.25 million in fiscal year 2015 for the four \nliving former Presidents.\n  The allowance would be reduced dollar for dollar for every dollar a \nformer President earns in outside income in excess of $400,000.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  So, you see, there might be no Presidential pension if the President \ndoes what most Presidents have done, which is to almost not be able to \nhelp earning outside income.\n  Updating the allowance ends an unnecessary government handout to \nformer Presidents making millions of dollars after leaving office. \nThere is little reason why American taxpayers should be subsidizing \nthese former Presidents when they are making a comfortable living on \ntheir own work.\n  This legislation would not affect the funding for the security and \nprotection of former Presidents and their spouses, and that is an \nimportant provision, considering the world in which we live today.\n  Last, Mr. Speaker, I want to particularly thank my good friend, \nChairman Chaffetz, for the amendment, my amendment to the bill in \ncommittee to eliminate the prohibition on preventing a former President \nor surviving spouse from receiving a pension during the period of time \nhe or she holds office in the District of Columbia.\n  Imagine that. When this bill was written, it was a double-dipping \nbill, and they thought that some President would leave office and want \nto, somehow, seek work in the District of Columbia. Hardly, but I can \nunderstand that provision, and I thank the chairman that this double-\ndipping provision, he and I both find, is no longer necessary.\n  While this language may have made sense in 1958, that was before the \nDistrict even had home rule. The District had no mayor or city council. \nIt was under the total dominance of the Federal Government.\n  Since then, of course, there have been changes that I am pleased to \napplaud, and the government of the District of Columbia pays for the \npensions of its own employees, so the Federal Government isn't in it at \nall.\n  There is no reason the concern that a former President would receive \nboth a pension and a salary from the Federal Government should still be \na part of our law.\n  This is a good-government bill that makes fiscal sense by reducing \ntaxpayer-funded costs. I certainly urge my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to support H.R. 1777.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I urge its \npassage. I really and truly enjoyed working with Members on both sides \nof the aisle to get this through and urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  I want to thank the chairman.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia \n(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a bipartisan bill from the Senate that we are \nconsidering. Senator Johnson of Wisconsin has put forward this bill. It \nhas cleared the Senate, we are happy to bring this up, but I would urge \nits adoption.\n  It is S. 1629, with a very long title to it: The District of Columbia \nCourts, Public Defender Service, and Court Services and Offender \nSupervision Agency Act of 2015. It just rolls off the tongue.\n  This bipartisan bill was introduced, as I said, by Senator Ron \nJohnson of Wisconsin, and it gives judicial officials in the District \nof Columbia the authority they need to make personnel and managerial \ndecisions.\n  In 1997, Congress reorganized the District of Columbia judicial \nagencies, making them Federal agencies with Federal employees. This \nbill improves the efficiency and functions of the D.C. judicial branch \nby extending them authorities that are available to other Federal \nagencies.\n  S. 1629 allows the D.C. courts system to collect debts and erroneous \npayments made to employees through installment plans of reasonable \namounts. Additionally, the courts will be able to provide uniforms to \nnonjudicial employees. This helps address safety concerns by giving \nthese employees greater visibility in the courthouse and in the \ncommunity.\n  Further, these reforms will allow the D.C. judicial offices to \noperate certain incentive programs, make use of the donations and \ncontributions, and utilize unpaid volunteers. It brings sensible \nauthorities to the District's judicial agencies that will allow these \nofficers to increase efficiencies and conduct their work more \neffectively.\n  We had an opportunity to mark up this bill, and I appreciate the \ninput of Ms. Norton certainly, being from the District of Columbia. And \nwe would urge its final passage here on the floor now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I need to thank Senate Homeland Security and Governmental \nAffairs Committee Chairman Ron Johnson and Ranking Member Tom Carper \nfor sponsoring the District of Columbia Courts, Public Defender \nService, and Court Services and Offender Supervision Agency Act, and \nfor all their hard work in getting it passed in the Senate.\n  Thanks also are due to my good friend, the chairman of the Oversight \nCommittee, Jason Chaffetz, and its Ranking Member, Elijah Cummings, for \nbringing this bill to the floor and working so closely with us in the \nDistrict of Columbia.\n  This bill may seem small, but its technical changes will improve the \noperations and effectiveness of three District of Columbia criminal \njustice agencies that are under the jurisdiction of the Federal \nGovernment, and they are under that jurisdiction because of the \nRevitalization Act, which took over the funding of certain District of \nColumbia agencies because they are State agencies, to improve the \nfinancial condition of the District of Columbia, which was the only \ncity that carried State functions.\n  This bill gives these agencies some modest new authorities that are \nalready available to comparable Federal agencies. The bill would \nauthorize CSOSA to use incentives-based programs for offenders, instead \nof only sanctions to get compliance.\n  This is in keeping with modern penology. It would allow the Public \nDefender Service to accept and use public grants, voluntary and \nuncompensated services, such as unpaid law clerks and interns of the \nkind, for example, that we use here every day, and private \ncontributions made to advance the Public Defender Service's work. It \nwould allow the courts to collect debts owed to it by its employees.\n  These changes are small and they are noncontroversial, but they mean \na great deal to the District of Columbia because they will modernize \nand improve the daily operations of the District's criminal justice \nsystem.\n  If I may say so while the chairman is on the floor, these small \nchanges, somehow I hope our committee will find a way to allow the \ncourts, themselves, to do so that we do not have to bring such small \nchanges before this body, which has such important work.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan piece of \nlegislation. It is common sense. We should pass it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 1629.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H244-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H244-H246]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                GRANTS OVERSIGHT AND NEW EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I really want to, first, thank Senator Fischer for the \ngreat work done in a bipartisan way in order to move this bill forward. \nThat combination, working with a Member who serves on our committee, \nMr. Walberg, and the relentless work on this piece of legislation, it \nis often referred to as the GONE Act, Grants Oversight and New \nEfficiency Act. It is a good piece of bipartisan, bicameral legislative \neffort.\n  I believe the bill will be effective in bringing about greater \nreforms for the grants closeout process, allowing agencies to save \ndollars and make better use of constrained resources. We cannot afford \nto allow grants to remain open year after year of their expiration \ndate. The GONE Act is an important step in addressing this issue.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from Michigan for championing \nthis bill and working through this through his work on H.R. 3089, as \nwell as working with the Senate in order to bring it to this point this \nday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill before us, the Grants Oversight and New \nEfficiency Act, or GONE Act--and I like that name, it is a very catchy \nname, and you will see why in a moment--it seeks to improve the grant \nmanagement process by requiring Federal agencies to report on expired \ngrants. The Government Accountability Office has found that expired \ngrants are not always closed out properly. In fact, GAO found that \nnearly $1 billion in undisbursed balances remained in expired and \ndormant grant accounts; therefore, the GONE Act's name.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I would call this found money, not gone money. It \nis still there. Improving the grant closeout process will help protect \ntaxpayer dollars and ensure that those dollars can be redirected to \nbetter uses.\n  This act may also incline agencies and localities to use funds they \nhave asked for. This legislation would require agencies to report to \nthe Secretary of Health and Human Services and to Congress on the \nnumber of expired grants and those with undisbursed balances. For the \noldest expired grants, agencies will need to explain why those grants \nhave not been closed.\n  The bill would also require agencies to report a year after the \ninitial report on progress made on grant closure. Hopefully, this \nincreased accountability will bring improvement to grant management.\n  I commend Representatives Walberg and Lawrence for their work on this \nbipartisan, commonsense legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg), who is the lead person sponsoring this piece of \nlegislation here in the House companion.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 1115, the Grants Oversight \nand New Efficiency Act, or as we call it, the GONE Act. As the lead \nHouse sponsor of this bill, I am proud of the bipartisan, bicameral \neffort that has gone into this legislation.\n  I especially want to thank the Senate champion of this bill, my \ncolleague in the Senate, Senator Deb Fischer, and also my Michigan \ncolleague, Congresswoman Brenda Lawrence, along with the staff who have \nworked so hard to bring this bill to the floor today.\n  Last year, we marked up this legislation in the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee and passed it on to the House floor. After \nsome additional fine-tuning made by our colleagues in the Senate, I am \npleased to have the opportunity to see the GONE Act take the final step \ntoward becoming law.\n  Even as we debate this bill today, the Federal Government is racking \nup service fees to administer thousands of expired empty grant \naccounts--costing taxpayers millions of dollars per year. I introduced \nthe GONE Act to bring some common sense to the grant management process \nand require Federal agencies to finally take action to identify these \naccounts with a zero balance which should be closed out.\n  Specifically, the GONE Act will direct agencies to work with the \nDepartment of Health and Human Services to identify the total number of \ngrant awards that remain open but have been expired for 2 years or \nmore. HHS was chosen for this role because of the work it has done in \nclosing out expired accounts--good work--and for its role as the agency \nwhich houses the Payment Management System.\n  In addition to the total number of expired grants, the bill requires \neach agency to explain to Congress why the 30 oldest grants that remain \nopen have not been closed. The bill also directs inspectors general for \ncertain larger grant-making agencies to conduct a risk assessment to \ndetermine if a further review of that agency's grant\n\n[[Page H246]]\n\ncloseout process is necessary. All of this information will give \nagencies and Congress valuable insight into issues that agencies face \nwhen it comes to a timely closeout of grants.\n  It is my hope that this information will inform future efforts to \nstreamline the grant's lifecycle, specifically the closeout process. In \nfact, S. 1115 requires OMB and HHS to submit a report to Congress on \npotential legislative reforms that are necessary to improve the grants \nlifecycle. I look forward to hearing from OMB and HHS on this topic, \nand I thank those agencies for the feedback they have offered on this \nbill.\n  For months, Members of the House and Senate on both sides of the \naisle have worked to develop this bill into one that will serve to \nadvance the efficiency of the grants process. OMB, HHS, and the \ninspector general community have all provided helpful comments as we \nworked to finalize this legislation, and I am grateful for their \nassistance.\n  Mr. Speaker, spending taxpayer dollars on expired and empty grant \naccounts is the definition of government waste. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this bill today and send the GONE Act to the President's desk.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is a good bipartisan bill. I urge its \npassage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, S. 1115.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H246-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H246-H247]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TAXPAYERS RIGHT-TO-KNOW ACT\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg), the prime author of this bill.\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 598, the Taxpayers \nRight-To-Know Act. This bill is a bipartisan and bicameral effort to \nprovide more information about Federal programs and their activities \nonline.\n  I want to thank my colleague Jim Cooper for all his work in pushing \nthis legislation forward.\n  The American people deserve to know what their government does with \ntheir hard-earned dollars, don't you think? H.R. 598 will make it \neasier to evaluate Federal Government spending by requiring Federal \nagencies to identify their programs and provide basic information like \nwhat their programs do, how they perform, and how much they cost. \nAgencies must do a better job of managing their programs and \nidentifying areas where taxpayer dollars are wasted.\n  The Government Accountability Office is tasked with reporting on \nduplication and continues to find new areas of duplication across \ngovernment. Over 5 years, GAO has identified 106 areas of duplication, \noverlap, and fragmentation; moreover, they identified an additional 72 \nareas for potential cost savings. While only 37 percent of recommended \ncorrective actions have been taken, GAO estimates that these actions \nhave saved the Federal Government and the taxpayer about $20 billion.\n  While GAO's work has been invaluable, their ability to look \ncomprehensively at the Federal Government is inherently limited because \nof the poor reporting by agencies about their activity. Quite simply, \nwithout better data, billions more will be lost and wasted.\n  Current law, specifically, the Government Performance and Results \nModernization Act, requires agencies to report all their programs, \ntheir funding, and their performance information to the Office of \nManagement and Budget. However, OMB's current inventory is incomplete \nand provides inconsistent information. This makes it more difficult and \ntime consuming to identify areas of waste and inefficiency.\n  H.R. 598 establishes an across-the-board definition of ``program'' \nand requires the publication of detailed information on each Federal \nprogram. This change will allow American taxpayers and Federal \nwatchdogs to better evaluate the effectiveness and utility of \ngovernment programs.\n  The Taxpayers Right-To-Know Act is an important and necessary step \nforward for the government in providing programs that are accountable, \neffective, and efficient.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Senator Lankford for his work on the \nSenate companion bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act builds upon two existing \nlaws that came through our committee: the Government Performance and \nResults Modernization Act of 2010 and the DATA Act, which was signed \ninto law in 2014.\n  The Obama administration launched the performance.gov Web site to \nimplement the GPRA Modernization Act, and this bill would enhance the \ninformation available through that Web site.\n  The bill would require the Office of Management and Budget to make \navailable on a central Web site an inventory of all Federal agency \nprograms that have a budget authority of more than $1 million.\n  The bill also would require OMB to include on this Web site links to \nany evaluation, assessment, or program performance reviews by an \nagency, an inspector general, or the Government Accountability Office \nreleased during the preceding 5 years.\n  The Taxpayers Right-to-Know Act would require agencies to disclose \nhow much agency staff are administering each covered program, as well \nas other individuals whose salary is paid by the government through a \ncontract, grant, or other agreement.\n  The Office of Management and Budget raised serious concerns about its \nability to implement the requirements of the bill as it was reported by \nthe committee. I want to thank the chairman for making changes to help \naddress those concerns in the amended version of the bill before us \ntoday. It is important that we continue to work together to ensure the \nbill will work as intended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, this is a good bipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  Again, I thank the good work of our colleague Mr. Walberg in helping \nto champion this through, the good work on both sides of the aisle in a \nbipartisan, bicameral way. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 598, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia \n(Ms. Norton) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Duncan), the gentleman who has championed this issue as \nthe prime sponsor.\n  Mr. DUNCAN of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Chaffetz for \nhis support and for yielding me this time.\n  This is a bill that has passed in three separate Congresses with \noverwhelming bipartisan support and very, very little opposition. In \nfact, in this Congress, it is cosponsored by Ranking Member Elijah \nCummings. In past Congresses, it has been cosponsored by Ranking Member \nEdolphus Towns; and in one Congress, Chairman Waxman became the primary \nsponsor. So it is a very bipartisan bill.\n  It is a very simple bill, one that I think can be supported by anyone \nwho is opposed to secrecy in government and believes in an open, \ntransparent system. The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act simply \nrequires that donations to a President's library greater than $200 be \ndisclosed to the public and posted online.\n  It is very surprising to people that there are no laws governing \nthese donations at this time. In fact, any person, corporation, or \nforeign government can donate any amount, unreported, while a President \nis still in office.\n  I first introduced this bill in the 106th Congress after reading a \nfront-page story in The Washington Times reporting that foreign \ngovernments from the Middle East were making very large donations to \nthe proposed library for President Clinton. I was concerned about the \ninfluence of donations being made by foreign governments. However, I \nhasten to say this is not directed toward former President Clinton or \nanyone else. This bill has been introduced and passed, and I have \nsponsored this bill under both Republican and Democratic Presidents.\n  I did read at one point that after I introduced this bill that \nPresident Clinton's library had received a $450,000 contribution from \nthe ex-wife of Marc Rich, who had fled the country to evade $40 million \nin taxes. So these types of things have certainly raised concern.\n  In 2013, the Sunlight Foundation's policy director endorsed my bill \nduring a hearing on Federal Government transparency in the House \nOversight and Government Reform Committee, saying: ``It would provide \nvaluable information on special interests whose donations put them in \nclose proximity with Presidents.''\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Presidential libraries were once modest structures, but they have \ngrown rapidly over the years into megamuseums devoted to a President's \nlife and legacy. President George W. Bush's library topped $500 million \nin costs. That is seven times the cost of his father's library. A \nrecent report in The New York Times noted that President Obama's \nlibrary could end up costing $1 billion.\n  As costs soar, clearly there is potential for abuse, no matter who is \nPresident. This is, as I said, not a partisan issue. It is not directed \nat any President. It is simply a good government bill that I think \nalmost everyone can support, and certainly they have in the past.\n  I urge support for this legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I support this bill, Mr. Speaker.\n  I want to thank Representative Duncan and Ranking Member Cummings for \nsponsoring this legislation. Representative Duncan first sponsored a \nbill to improve Presidential libraries 16 years ago. What has happened \nthat we can't get this bill through the Congress? I hope this bill this \nyear will prove different. This Congress, I hope we can finally get \nthis important reform on the President's desk where I am sure it will \nbe signed.\n  The Presidential Library Donation Reform Act would provide \ntransparency to the process for building Presidential libraries. The \npractice of creating a Presidential library began decades ago with \nPresident Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The tradition has carried on \nthrough every President since that time, and it is going to continue.\n  Presidential libraries have become increasingly more expensive as \nthey\n\n[[Page H249]]\n\nhave evolved into multipurpose centers that do more than simply house \nPresidential records. For example, the William J. Clinton Library cost \nan estimated $165 million, while the George W. Bush Presidential Center \ncost an estimated $250 million to build, with President Bush having \nraised approximately half a billion dollars for his library, museum, \nand institute. We can expect that with each new President, these \nlibraries are going to cost more. That is just natural.\n  Under current law, there is no requirement to disclose the identities \nof those who donate to a Presidential library, and a President is able \nto secure an unlimited amount of private donations while still in \noffice.\n  The bill before us would make a simple but very important change in \nexisting law. Under this bill, organizations that raise money to build \nPresidential libraries would be required to disclose the identity of \nany individual who donates more than $200. It seems reasonable to me, \nMr. Speaker. The National Archives and Records Administration would \nthen be required to post the donation information in a manner that is \nfree to access and downloadable.\n  Additionally, this legislation would create criminal penalties for \nindividuals who report false information on donations and for \nfundraising organizations that omit donation information.\n  A group of 15 good government organizations, including Citizens for \nResponsibility and Ethics in Washington and the Sunlight Foundation, \nsent a letter urging the House to support this bill. Here is what they \nwrote:\n  ``Under the current opaque system, Presidents raise funds privately \nto establish their Presidential libraries. These efforts, which often \nbegin long before they leave office, are unregulated and undisclosed, \ncreating opportunities for, or the appearance of, influence-peddling. \nImproved transparency would help reduce the appearance of impropriety \nand help deter inappropriate behavior.''\n  The appearance is just as important as the behavior itself, I \nemphasize, Mr. Speaker.\n  This bill was approved without opposition by the Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform in March and has passed the House \nseveral times before.\n  As I noted, companion legislation sponsored by Senators Corker and \nJohnson was approved by the Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs \nCommittee earlier this year.\n  It looks like this bill may become law after all, Mr. Duncan.\n  I urge every Member of this body to support transparency by voting \nfor this important legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I urge its passage. It is high time that this passed. It is \nbipartisan, it is bicameral, and it is done with some good leadership \nfrom Mr. Duncan. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1069, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H249-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H249-H255]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             FOIA OVERSIGHT AND IMPLEMENTATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Cummings) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n\n[[Page H253]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Issa), the former chairman of the Oversight and \nGovernment Reform Committee and one of the lead sponsors of this bill.\n  Mr. ISSA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  It is no accident that this is one of the first bills of the new \nyear. Like some of the other legislation, it is not a new idea. In many \nways, what it really is is this body, once again, if you will, \nreiterating when we talk about freedom of information for the American \npeople, whether it is a private citizen who doesn't know what the \ngovernment knows about him or her and would like to or it is an \ninterest group, a think tank, or very, very often the press--The New \nYork Times, The Washington Post, the LA Times, and a host more--wanting \nto know what the government is doing, what their government is doing \nwith their money, their freedoms.\n  This bill emphasizes in no uncertain terms something that is long \noverdue: that the balance between the American people's right to know \nabout their information and the government's right to keep a secret \nshall always be balanced in favor and presumed to be the American \npeople's right. In other words, no longer, after this bill is signed \ninto law, will an administration, Republican or Democratic, be able to \npresume that they are going to say no if they possibly can. Instead, \nthis bill shifts the burden to the presumption of yes.\n  Not only does it shift the burden, but it puts an outright mandate \nthat, after 25 years, information not covered by national security \nrequirements or classifications of secret or above, shall, in fact, \nsimply be available.\n  These are fundamentally important distinctions between the current \nlaw. But more to the point of a modernization, this legislation \nmandates a single point of asking for FOIA, an assumption that it is \nlong overdue for us to streamline and improve the ability to get this \ninformation and get it to everyone.\n  One of the aspects of the legislation is that H.R. 653 will require \nthat information asked for again and again and again be posted and \navailable for everyone rather than each time being a burden of somebody \nwanting similar or even identical information to have to put in a FOIA \nrequest.\n  Mr. Speaker, what I want to close with is this isn't just bipartisan; \nthis is universal. Members of the House and the Senate, whether there \nis a Republican or Democratic President, whether it is on behalf of a \nconstituent wanting some simple information, we regularly use the \nFreedom of Information Act, and we regularly find ourselves frustrated.\n  This is good for the administration. It builds on legislation like \nthe DATA Act and other reforms that the Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee have done over a number of years.\n  Lastly, I want to thank my good friend from Maryland (Mr. Cummings). \nFrom the very day we began heading the committee, more than 5 years ago \nnow, together, he has always been for FOIA reform, always been for more \ntransparency, and always been supportive of the legislation you see \nhere today. I want to thank Mr. Cummings, something that I don't get \nenough chances to do.\n  And I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz for bringing this bill, not \nonly as it was originally written, but with some important \nmodifications to make it, hopefully, go through quickly when it is \nconsidered by the Senate.\n  I urge its support.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight \nand Implementation Act.\n  I want to start by thanking Representative Darrell Issa for working \nwith me on this legislation. We first introduced the FOIA Act in March \n2013. The bill before us today is the product of 3 years of work--hard \nwork--feedback, negotiation, and perseverance.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the Oversight and Government \nReform Committee, Jason Chaffetz, for his work on this bill and his \nstrong support for bringing it to the House floor today.\n  I would say that this is a bipartisan effort, but it is more than \nthat. We actually worked very, very hard together, all of us, to make \nthis happen. If there was any case where we had to use this term of not \nmoving to common ground but moving to higher ground, it would be this \nlegislation.\n  Open government advocates--journalists, editorial boards, and \neveryday citizens--who support this bill also deserve a tremendous \namount of gratitude.\n  The FOIA Act would strengthen the cornerstone of our open government \nlaws and the Freedom of Information Act. This legislation builds on the \nhistoric work of the Obama administration, which I believe will go down \nin history as the most transparent administration to date. The bill \nwould codify the presumption of openness standard that President Obama \nput in place in a memo issued on his first day in office.\n  The bill would require agencies to identify specific identifiable \nharm to an interest protected by exemption unless disclosure is \nprohibited by law. This provision would not require agencies to \ndisclose classified information, it would not require agencies to \ndisclose anything they are prohibited from disclosing by law, and it \nwould not remove any of FOIA's existing time exemptions. It would, \nhowever, put the burden on agencies where it should be: to justify \nkeeping government information secret.\n\n  The bill would also put a 25-year sunset exemption 5 of FOIA--the \ndeliberative process exemption--and limit the scope of records that \nagencies could withhold under that exemption. It would modernize FOIA \nby requiring the Office of Management and Budget to create a central \nportal to allow FOIA requests to any agency through one Web site.\n  The Office of Government Information Services, the FOIA ombudsman \ncreated by Congress in 2007, would become more independent, which is \nvery important under this bill, because that office would be allowed to \nsubmit testimony and reports directly to Congress without going through \npolitical review.\n  This bill is coming to the floor with an amendment that makes a \nnumber of changes, and many of them proposed by Chairman Chaffetz. Some \nof these additions include requiring agencies to provide each FOIA \nrequester with a contact name and information for an agency employee \nwho can provide information on the status of the request. This is so \nvery, very important.\n  Our bill has widespread support. A coalition of 47 open government \ngroups sent a letter in support of this bill on February 5, 2015, that \nsaid:\n  ``Congress must act this year to ensure that FOIA stays current with \npeople's need to access government information and resilient in the \nface of attempts to subvert that access.''\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Numerous editorial boards have written, urging Congress to pass FOIA \nreform legislation.\n  A New York Times editorial from February 2015 reads: ``This is a rare \nchance to log a significant bipartisan accomplishment in the public \ninterest.''\n  A USA Today editorial in March 2015 called for the enactment of this \nbill's reforms.\n  A Los Angeles Times editorial read that this legislation and a \nsimilar bill in the Senate ``deserves to be passed.''\n  This is a movement called Fix FOIA by 50. That movement is aimed at \ngetting H.R. 653 enacted before the 50th anniversary of FOIA in July of \nthis year.\n  An online clearinghouse for the movement includes stories from \njournalists about why FOIA is critical to their work and why this \nlegislation must be enacted.\n  It is important to note that, even with the enactment of this \nlegislation, the work of Congress must continue.\n  Agency FOIA staff are being asked to do more than ever before. From \n2009 to\n\n[[Page H254]]\n\n2014, the overall number of FOIA requests submitted to Federal agencies \nincreased by 28 percent with new records set in each of the past 4 \nyears in a row. The total number of FOIA personnel, however, decreased \nby about 4 percent. Congress must give these agencies more resources.\n  Again, I thank Congressman Issa for all of his hard work. I know that \nhe has been on this bill for a long time and has tried to make sure it \ngets passed. Again, I want to thank both staffs for working so hard.\n  Since Chairman Chaffetz became chairman, we have had two meetings, \nand I know our staffs have had numerous meetings and have hammered out \nthe details to make a very good bill a better bill. I want to thank \nthem.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for transparency and for the American \npeople by voting ``yes'' on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is a good, much-needed piece of legislation. It is hard to \nbelieve that FOIA, the Freedom of Information Act, was passed nearly 50 \nyears ago.\n  We are a little different in the United States. We are self-critical. \nWe do look at things. We do examine things. We do it in the spirit of \nmaking this country better.\n  We also have to remember who we work for. We work for the American \npeople. The American people are paying the tab. It is their government, \nand they have the right to know.\n  Updating this piece of legislation is something that, in particular, \nCongressman Issa sought to do some time ago. He put the wheels in \nmotion and started to draft a good and much-needed bill.\n  Coming together with the ranking member, Mr. Cummings, has made this \nall possible. We have had some good, vibrant discussions. We had 2 days \nof hearings in our committee. We heard from citizens. We heard from the \nmedia. We heard from a host of people.\n  I think it is fair to say that, in large part, the FOIA, the way it \noperates now, is broken. I do agree and concur with the ranking member \nthat, if we are going to have such a bombardment of requests, they need \nto be properly funded and there needs to be the personnel in order to \nmake sure they can fulfill these requests.\n  When appropriation season comes, I want to stand with Mr. Cummings \nand with others and make sure that it is properly funded so that those \ngood people can do their good work.\n  There were a number of reforms and improvements that needed to \nhappen. I do appreciate the flexibility of working and of offering \nsuggestions and then another set of suggestions.\n  This would not have been possible, Mr. Speaker, without some good \nwork in the Office of Legal Counsel. Sally Walker dealt with us time \nand time again.\n  On our side of the aisle, we had it spearheaded with Katy Rother, and \nI know that Krista Boyd particularly, on Mr. Cummings' staff, was vital \nto making this happen.\n  There are vital pieces of information that are needed and that are \nrightfully requested by the American people, but this piece of \nlegislation will make that FOIA process smoother. It will make it more \neffective, more efficient, and I think it is much needed as we go into \nthe 50th year of FOIA. I look forward to its passage. I urge a ``yes'' \nvote.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I close by highlighting a few additional provisions of FOIA.\n  This bill would require agencies to review existing records to \nidentify categories of records to proactively disclose rather than \nwaiting for FOIA requests.\n  The bill would also require the Department of Justice to report to \nCongress on categories of records that would be appropriate for \nproactive disclosure.\n  Finally, the bill would tackle the proliferation of statutory FOIA \nexemptions by requiring the Government Accountability Office to catalog \nall of the statutory exemptions on the books.\n  Again, I urge the support of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the good, bipartisan work. It was through a lot of labor \nand a lot of listening to what the public needs and to what the media \nneeds. I do think this will make the Freedom of Information Act better \nas it is the spirit by which we operate in this country.\n  I urge the bill's passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Permanent Select Committee on \n           Intelligence,\n                                  Washington, DC, January 8, 2016.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairman, Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Chaffetz: On January 7, 2016, your committee \n     ordered H.R. 653, the ``FOIA Oversight and Implementation Act \n     of 2015,'' reported. As you know, H.R. 653 contains several \n     provisions that implicate the work of agencies within the \n     jurisdiction of the Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence. The bill addresses how elements of the \n     Intelligence Community (IC), as defined in section 3(4) of \n     the National Security Act of 1947, may protect sensitive \n     information from disclosure under the Freedom of Information \n     Act (FOIA).\n       On the basis of your consultations with the Committee, I \n     understand that H.R. 653 has been crafted to avoid compelling \n     the disclosure of any properly classified information, or \n     other information where disclosure would adversely affect \n     intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing \n     FOIA exemption. In particular, I understand that H.R. 653 \n     does not allow or require FOIA requesters to obtain IC \n     records or information, without regard to the age of the \n     records or information, if such disclosure would adversely \n     affect intelligence sources and methods.\n       I further understand that H.R. 653 does not alter an \n     Intelligence Community element's discretion over the language \n     it chooses to use in denying records or information sought \n     pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, I understand that the \n     requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to \n     include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an \n     Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the \n     contents of the required ``list.'' To the extent that \n     elaboration of any list would adversely affect intelligence \n     sources and methods, an IC element may cite to the applicable \n     FOIA exemption to meet the list requirement.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     these understandings and would request that you include a \n     copy of this letter in the Congressional Record during its \n     floor consideration. Thank you in advance for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Devin Nunes,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Oversight and \n           Government Reform,\n                                 Washington, DC, January 11, 2016.\n     Hon. Devin Nunes,\n     Chairman, Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your January 8, 2016, \n     letter regarding H.R. 653, the FOIA Oversight and \n     Implementation Act of 2015, as reported. H.R. 653 bill \n     addresses how elements of the Intelligence Community (IC), as \n     defined in section 3(4) of the National Security Act of 1947, \n     may protect sensitive information from disclosure under the \n     Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). I am writing to confirm \n     our mutual understanding with respect to the consideration of \n     the bill.\n       H.R. 653 has been crafted to strengthen FOIA by \n     establishing a strong presumption in favor of disclosure, \n     while also recognizing the need to avoid compelling the \n     disclosure of any properly classified information, or other \n     information where disclosure would adversely affect \n     intelligence sources and methods protected by an existing \n     FOIA exemption. The bill, as reported, does not require \n     agency FOIA staff to disclose IC records or information, \n     without regard to the age of the records or information, if \n     such disclosure would adversely affect intelligence sources \n     and methods. Further, the bill does not alter an IC element's \n     discretion over the language it chooses to use in denying \n     records or information sought pursuant to FOIA. Specifically, \n     the requirement in Section 2(f)(3) for federal agencies to \n     include ``a list'' of all denied records preserves an \n     Intelligence Community element's discretion regarding the \n     contents of the required ``list.''\n       A copy of our exchange of letters on this matter in the \n     will be inserted into the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of this bill on the House floor. Thank you for \n     your attention to this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jason Chaffetz,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 653, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n\n[[Page H255]]\n\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H255-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H255-H257]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FEDERAL INTERN PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

This is \na bill brought to my attention by him. We took it through the process \nin our committee and marked it up, and here we are on the floor.\n  The bill establishes some important protections against the workplace \ndiscrimination and harassment of both unpaid Federal interns and \napplicants for Federal internships. Currently, there are no specific \nprovisions in law to protect these unpaid interns.\n  H.R. 3231 makes it illegal to discriminate, to sexually harass, or to \nretaliate against unpaid Federal interns and applicants for Federal \ninternships.\n  Specifically, the bill protects against discrimination and harassment \non the basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin under \nthe Civil Rights Act of 1967, under the Age Discrimination in \nEmployment Act of 1967, and under the handicapping condition under the \nRehabilitation Act of 1973.\n  Unpaid interns, similar to paid employees, are to be considered \nprotected against discrimination and harassment.\n  I thank Mr. Cummings for his passion on this issue to guard against \nthis discrimination and harassment. I look forward to supporting this \nbill. I am glad we could bring it to the floor today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The bill before us, the Federal Intern Protection Act, would close a \nloophole in Federal employment law that currently leaves unpaid interns \nopen to discrimination and sexual harassment.\n  Earlier this year our committee held a hearing at which we heard \ntestimony about sexual harassment and retaliation in an EPA regional \noffice. During that hearing, both Chairman Chaffetz and I expressed our \ndisgust at the exploitation of these young women and demanded that \naction be taken to prevent this in the future.\n  Unfortunately, the act of harassing unpaid interns on the basis of \nrace, religion, age, or, in this case, sex is not prohibited by Federal \nlaw. Under current law, victims rely on the discretion of managers to \nprevent the recurrence of this behavior, something that does not always \noccur.\n  As one witness testified: ``Even after finding out about the numerous \nharassment victims, the direct reporting manager continued to feed the \nharasser a steady diet of young women.''\n  As we saw at our hearing, allowing this kind of behavior to go \nunchecked can have serious consequences on the lives and careers of \nthose who are interested in government service and on those who are \nsimply trying to be all that God meant for them to be. There are many \nunpaid interns who are willing to commit to working for the Federal \nGovernment. We should protect them from this kind of despicable \nbehavior.\n  I want to take a moment to thank Chairman Chaffetz for helping us to \nmove this bill through the committee expeditiously and to bring it to \nthe floor. As a matter of fact, in our committee, we received a \nunanimous vote on it, and I am hoping that there will be a unanimous \nvote on the floor today.\n  I thank him and I thank his staff and our staff for pulling all of \nthis together to get us to this moment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott).\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3231, the Federal Intern \nProtection Act.\n  This bill would amend title 5 of the U.S. Code to extend protections \nagainst discrimination and harassment to unpaid interns who work at \nFederal agencies. The bill would define an intern as someone who \nperforms uncompensated voluntary service in an agency to earn credit \nawarded by an educational institution or to learn a trade or \noccupation.\n  Internships are often the first real entry into a profession; yet, \nunpaid interns are not expressly protected from the discriminatory \npractices prohibited by the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Age \nDiscrimination in Employment Act, the Rehabilitation Act, and other \nlaws and regulations. This bill would remedy this problem and extend \nthose workplace protections to unpaid interns who may be vulnerable to \negregious treatment.\n  Madam Speaker, all too often, when unpaid interns have taken cases of \nworkplace discrimination to the courts, the courts have ruled against \nthem. In the Second Circuit, a unanimous panel of judges concluded that \nunpaid interns are not employees covered by existing laws.\n  In the 1997 case of O'Connor v. Davis, an employee at a State \nhospital harassed an unpaid intern, calling her Miss Sexual Harassment \nand subjecting her to sexually explicit comments.\n  The court stated that it was not unsympathetic to O'Connor's \nsituation and acknowledged that she was not in quite the same position \nto simply walk away from the alleged harassment, as her success at \nschool was dependent on her successfully completing her internship.\n\n  The Second Circuit noted that Ms. O'Connor's dependency on her \nemployer made her vulnerable to continued harassment much as an \nemployee dependent on a regular wage can be vulnerable to ongoing \nmisconduct.\n  Despite that, the Second Circuit concluded: ``It is for Congress, if \nit should choose to do so, and not this court to provide a remedy under \neither title VII or title IX for plaintiffs in O'Connor's position.''\n  As ranking member of the House Committee on Education and the \nWorkforce, I urge Congress to do more to protect unpaid interns, be it \nin the Federal sector, in the Halls of Congress, or in the private \nsector.\n  The House Committee on Education and the Workforce has jurisdiction\n\n[[Page H256]]\n\nover legislation that strengthens worker protections and defends the \ncivil rights laws of workers, including fighting against discrimination \nand supporting diversity in the workplace.\n  Now that the House is about to complete the consideration of H.R. \n3231, covering Federal workers, I am calling on the leadership of the \nCommittee on Education and the Workforce to move expeditiously to \nconsider the companion legislation, H.R. 3232, the Unpaid Intern \nProtection Act. That bill would ensure that unpaid interns in the \nprivate sector are free from discrimination and harassment as \nprohibited by the Civil Rights Act.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Extending workplace protections to nonpaid interns, who under current \nlaw lack the protections provided by civil rights laws, should be a \npriority for the Committee on Education and the Workforce, and that is \nbecause internships have become such an important part of the \nworkforce.\n  According to the 2014 State of Internships Report from a college \nintern database, InternMatch, about two-thirds of interns surveyed said \ninternships were important for long-term career advancement and about \nthe same number even stated that internships should be mandatory. \nStudent surveys showed that over 60 percent want to intern in the \nprivate sector, about 14 percent in the government sector, and 19 \npercent in nonprofit organizations.\n  As Members of Congress, our position should be clear. Regardless of \nwhether an internship is at a Federal agency, on Capitol Hill, or at a \nFortune 500 company, we must ensure that the unpaid status of interns \ndoes not leave them without a remedy when their civil rights are \nviolated. To that end, we should begin by passing H.R. 3231, the \nFederal Intern Protection Act.\n  We should then start working on legislation to provide similar \nprotections to unpaid interns who work in the private sector.\n  I want to thank Ranking Member Cummings for his leadership on this \nbill, along with my fellow cosponsors, the gentlewoman from New York \n(Ms. Meng) and the Delegate from Washington, D.C. (Ms. Norton).\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this bill.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, there are some good young people who are \ngetting their education. They are excited. They have their whole life \nin front of them. They get this amazing opportunity to do this \ninternship. Maybe it is a month, maybe it is 3 months, maybe it is 6 \nmonths. It is just a limited portion of time. That is where they are \ngoing to get a base of knowledge and experience that they are going to \nbe able then to parlay and take into the workforce. It is going to help \nshape and mold their futures.\n  As Members, every one of us rely on interns. We have them in our \noffices in our districts and we have them in our offices in Washington, \nD.C. We see them in the private sector. We see them all over the place. \nThey provide a valuable role.\n  Unfortunately, there are some young people--and we have heard these \nstories, and they are horrific--who go into this situation, and \nsomebody in power, somebody who does get a paycheck, somebody who does \ncontrol their time, does ask them to do tasks--does the unforgivable \nand asks them--or does something to them that they should never do.\n  To hear this story that there isn't a law on the books so the courts \ncan help take care of it, that is just not an excuse. We do a lot of \nthings in this body, and I would like to think this is one of the \nreally good things that we do here today, is pass a piece of \nlegislation like this so we can protect these young people, because if \nsomebody does break the law and does go forward and does do something \nunforgivable, they have some recourse.\n  If we are going to take their time and we are going to use the \nresources of these young people, those people in charge should be held \naccountable. I think that is the good we are doing here today.\n  So to those particularly young women--I am sure there are young men \nout there too, I just haven't heard as many of their stories--to those \nyoung women, at least, I hope we are listening and we are doing \nsomething good. That is why I encourage the passage of this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Meng), one of the cosponsors of this bill.\n  Ms. MENG. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express strong support for \nH.R. 3231, the Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015.\n  Madam Speaker, internships are increasingly considered a resume \nnecessity for entry-level positions in both the public and private \nsector. More and more, businesses, organizations, and government \nagencies consider internships a prerequisite experience to full-time \nemployment. In fact, on college campuses across this country, career \nservice officers push their students to obtain competitive internships \nbecause they provide valuable professional experiences and are \nconsidered essential.\n  What we often forget is that unpaid interns are amongst the most \nvulnerable of workers. They need these internships to succeed in their \ncareers. Yet, they are powerless to protect themselves from \ndiscrimination and sexual harassment. Facing these challenges can be \ndevastating to young interns at the beginning of their careers.\n  One year ago, a brave and intelligent young woman, Christina, came to \nmy district office to talk to me about her experiences as an unpaid \nintern. Christina had faced sexual harassment. She had no legal \nrecourse, but she refused to stay silent. She came to my office with a \nfellow college student, Anna. They told me about the experiences of \nmany young college students who had faced sexual harassment as unpaid \ninterns. I stand here on their behalf today because we can do something \nabout this.\n  State legislatures across this country have started to listen. New \nYork, Oregon, Illinois, California, Connecticut, New Jersey, \nWashington, D.C., and New York City have all passed some form of \nprotection for unpaid interns.\n  Unpaid internships in Federal agencies, in particular, are coveted \nand competitive positions. The Federal Intern Protection Act of 2015 \ndirectly addresses this vulnerability by extending existing Federal \nprotections under the Civil Rights Act of 1964 to unpaid interns \nworking for the Federal Government. We can provide vulnerable interns \nin the Federal Government with the protections they deserve.\n  I would like to thank my colleague, Representative Cummings, for his \nleadership on this issue. I also thank Representative Scott of Virginia \nand Ms. Eleanor Holmes Norton and their staff for all of their hard \nwork.\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume as I close.\n  Madam Speaker, there have been several cases where interns have tried \nto bring suit and the courts have said that you have no remedy. \nChairman Chaffetz is absolutely right. It is sad when you can have such \nan egregious act but no remedy. I think one of the most frustrating \nthings for anyone is when they have been harmed or when they have been \ntreated wrongfully and there is no remedy, there is a problem.\n  The courts have said over and over again: Congress, if you want there \nto be a remedy, then you have to act. That is exactly what we are doing \ntoday. I think it says a lot for us as a Congress, and I think it says \na lot for us as a Nation.\n  Going back to some of the words of Chairman Chaffetz, when we look at \nunpaid interns, they do come to these offices trying to get experience \nand trying to learn the duties and the responsibilities of a certain \njob. They realize that by doing this, it may very well change in a \npositive way the trajectory of their destiny. They come in with those \nhigh expectations, only to have them destroyed. Sometimes the damage \ncan last not for a day or for a week, but for a lifetime.\n  Then there is another piece that I think a lot of people don't think \nabout, and that is that it is not always the deed, but it is also the \nmemory of having gone through these types of incidents.\n  I think this is a very important piece of legislation. I would urge \nmy colleagues to vote for it.\n  Again, I thank the chairman, because we sat there in a hearing and we \nheard about a very bad case. A lot of people wonder about the value of \nhearings\n\n[[Page H257]]\n\nsometimes, but out of that hearing came this legislation. So, again, I \nthank the chairman for all of his hard work in helping us get the bill \nto the floor.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the kind words, and I \nappreciate the dedication and commitment of Mr. Cummings, Mr. Scott of \nVirginia, and others who care deeply about this. I do as well. To be \nable to play a role to help shepherd it to this point is an honor and a \nprivilege.\n  I urge its passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the hard work and \ndedication of Eden Prairie Officer of the Year Patrick Kenyon and the \nDepartment's Civilian Employee of the Year, Investigative Aide Pauline \nSager.\n  Pauline has been with the Eden Prairie County Police Department for \n36 years and has proven herself as a tireless advocate for the public. \nShe is known as an expert on financial fraud crimes. She has advised \nlaw enforcement throughout Minnesota and helped bring criminals to \njustice.\n  Patrick, a 9-year veteran of the Department, worked as a patrol \nofficer and a juvenile investigator. Officer Kenyon is known as a role \nmodel to other officers, and he is always willing to help his \ncolleagues in their duties.\n  Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement officers keep our communities safe \ndue to the commitment of people like Pauline Sager and Patrick Kenyon. \nI thank them both for their service to Eden Prairie, and I congratulate \nthem on their recognition.\n\n[[Page H259]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n            INTRUSION SOFTWARE AND THE WASSENAAR ARRANGEMENT\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, securing our networks from cyber attack is \na challenging task. One of the most effective techniques is penetration \ntesting, or turning hacking tools on one's own network to find \nweaknesses before bad actors have a chance to exploit them.\n  Unfortunately, a rule proposed by the Bureau of Industry and Security \nwithin the Department of Commerce last May has the potential to make it \nmuch harder to share existing tools and develop new ones, which could \nseverely harm our national security and our economic competitiveness.\n  The rule was issued as part of the addition of ``intrusion software'' \nto the Wassenaar Arrangement, one of the principal international export \ncontrol regimes. Perhaps unsurprisingly, using a 20-year-old \nframework--itself the successor of a three-quarter-century-old cold war \nagreement--to regulate cutting-edge technology has proved difficult. \nHowever, I am very thankful for the Bureau's willingness to reexamine \nthe initial proposal, and I am looking forward to tomorrow's Homeland \nSecurity hearing as an important step in the process to produce a final \nrule that allows defenders to test their networks before they are \nattacked. This is a bipartisan hearing tomorrow, and I look forward to \ntomorrow's hearing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     RECOGNIZING MARGARET DUNLEAVY\n\n  (Mr. BISHOP of Michigan asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to reflect on the \ncareer of an outstanding public servant in my district, Margaret \nDunleavy. Mrs. Dunleavy retired on December 31, 2015, after serving as \nthe Livingston County clerk for 19 years.\n  In her capacity as clerk, Mrs. Dunleavy has been responsible for \noverseeing elections in the county, as well as maintaining vital \nrecords and all the circuit court records. She was first elected in \n1996, and the voters of Livingston County chose her for their clerk in \nfour additional elections.\n  Her role as county clerk was not Mrs. Dunleavy's first public service \nexperience. She previously served as Hartland Township clerk and deputy \nclerk.\n  Mrs. Dunleavy will be remembered as a hardworking, professional, \nethical, and highly qualified clerk. I am thankful to have had the \nopportunity to work with her. I wish her all the best in her \nretirement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent such a dedicated public \nservant in Michigan's Eighth District.\n  Thank you, Mrs. Dunleavy, for your commitment to Livingston County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING WOMEN PILOTS\n\n  (Mr. ASHFORD asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the important \ncontribution women pilots have made to the service of our military in \nWorld War II. These women deserve a proper military resting place.\n  In 1942, Betty Grace Clements of Elmwood, Nebraska, entered into the \nWomen Airforce Service Pilots. Betty was one of only 1,100 women who \nhad earned her wings to fly noncombat missions to support the war \neffort.\n  Betty's job during World War II was to provide courier services for \nthen-Colonel Paul Tibbets and his crew. Colonel Tibbets and his crew \nwere training to fly the Enola Gay and bring an end to the war. Betty \nwas part of the history. She helped end the war, and she served \nNebraska and her country with honor.\n  Betty passed away in 1965, but, under today's law, her ashes could \nnot be added to the Arlington National Cemetery. I think that is a \nshame. WASPs have fought for proper recognition for their service. I \napplaud Congresswoman McSally for her bill to give these women the \nrecognition they deserve.\n  I thank Dr. Grace Clements, Congresswoman McSally, and all women \npilots who have served.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-4", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HUMAN TRAFFICKING AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of National Slavery and Human Trafficking Prevention Month, \nwhich is intended to draw attention to a problem which is sadly still a \nconcern across this Nation and across the globe.\n  According to the National Human Trafficking Resource Center, \nauthorities have investigated more than 500 cases of suspected human \ntrafficking just in Pennsylvania since 2000, including 75 cases \nreported in 2015 alone.\n  Human trafficking has been called one of the fastest growing criminal \nindustries in the world. The statistics and recent reports indicate \nthat these types of cases are on the rise across Pennsylvania, \nincluding those involving victims who are still teenagers.\n  I greatly appreciate the work of organizations in Pennsylvania's \nFifth Congressional District and across the State in assisting those \nhurt in human trafficking.\n  Last year, I supported the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, \nwhich was signed into law by President Barack Obama. This legislation \nis aimed at addressing the rise in human trafficking and to improve \nservices for survivors.\n  I will continue to work in the House towards eliminating this \ndisturbing behavior.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-5", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H259]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HELLFIRE MISSILE\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, last week we were made aware of an \nextremely serious security breach that resulted in the Castro regime \ntaking possession of a U.S. Hellfire missile.\n  It is reprehensible to think that while the Obama administration \nconducted secret negotiations with a communist regime that had under \nits control sensitive U.S. military hardware, the White House \nnegotiators chose to do nothing about it. The State Department has \nknown about Castro having Hellfire missiles since June of 2004. \nApparently, what is the rush?\n  Cuba continuously engages in military cooperation with our foes and \ncould easily share the missile or its technology with the Russians, \nChinese, or North Koreans to be used against our own national security.\n  An exhaustive investigation must be held by Congress. I urge the \nadministration to hold accountable those responsible for diverting the \nHellfire missile to Cuba, and to hold accountable the criminal \ncommunist regime that still refuses to return this sensitive technology \nto us and continues to undermine our interests.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H259-6", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H259-H260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      NORTH KOREA NEEDS DISABLING\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this week the House will take up new \nsanctions on North Korea in response to their nuclear weapons test last \nweek. This measure will prevent those facilitating their nuclear \nweapons program from entering the United States. It sanctions financial \ninstitutions and seizes assets in order to halt North Korea's nuclear \nweapons program.\n  The steps we are taking reflect the type of approach we should also \nbe taking with Iran. Rogue states, like Iran and North Korea, cannot be \ntrusted to respect international agreements and must be coerced into \ngiving up their nuclear weapons ambitions. Only when Iran and North \nKorea feel the financial impact of our sanctions will they change \ncourse.\n  Iran and North Korea are also nations that both threaten key allies \nand friends of the United States. The sanctions we are contemplating \nare an important reminder to the world that the United States will not \nlook the other way when reckless and aggressive regimes pursue the most \ndeadly weapons in the world.\n\n[[Page H260]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H260-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H260]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                      ONLY OUTLAWS WILL HAVE GUNS\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, on the very evening the \nPresident held a town hall calling for increased gun control, \nPhiladelphia Police Officer Jesse Hartnett was shot at 11 times. None \nof the President's proposals would have prevented the attack.\n  More gun control will not stop criminals. The attack was carried out \nwith a stolen police pistol.

The attacker shouted his support for ISIS.\n  To reduce shootings, we must enforce current laws, reform mental \nhealth laws, and defeat Islamic terrorists overseas.

Mr. Speaker, I rise with a sense of concern, of \nsadness, and, also, of relief regarding the heinous shooting of the \nPhiladelphia police officer. I am grateful that he managed to survive, \nthat he is in the hospital, and that he is healing. We wish him and his \nfamily well and that he, as well, will heal.\n  I think it is important to note that we need to look at the rage of \ngun violence from a sensible and logical perspective. Yes, the \nPresident's proposals would have had an impact on this crazed, \nallegedly ISIL-inspired individual who had no direct contact with ISIL, \nwho had not been to the caliphate to fight, and who, unfortunately, had \na previous criminal record.\n  How would the proposals do so?\n  First of all, it was a stolen gun. The President has suggested there \nbe 200 more ATF officers to enforce the law. He has provided $500 \nmillion for mental health resources, and this individual suffered from \nthat.\n  In addition, he has provided for data collection, for the FBI to redo \nand to make more certain the inspection or the review of someone who is \ntrying to get a gun.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's look logically at what the President has offered, \nand let's not get in the way. Let's try to help stem the tide of gun \nviolence so that our officers, as well, are not in the line of fire.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H260-3", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H260-H264]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     WOMEN AIRFORCE SERVICE PILOTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \nto include extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about a very special group \nof women who were mentors to me and who were pioneering heroes of our \ncountry. These women were the Women Airforce Service Pilots, the WASPs.\n  Some people don't know that much about them, but here is a picture of \nthem as they flew airplanes in the World War II era. When we needed \neverybody to serve in whatever capacity one could in our country, they \nneeded women to step up and become pilots in order to do all sorts of \ndifferent missions, like towing targets for the gunners on the ground \nto learn how to shoot things down, like training men to go on to fly in \ncombat, like ferrying airplanes all over the theaters to deliver them \nwhere they needed to be in the combat zone and bringing them back for \nmaintenance. They were test pilots and engineers. You name it.\n\n  These women were asked to step up and serve. They went through \ntraining. They put on the uniform. They lived in the barracks. They \nlearned how to march. They were pioneers for women like me, who later \non served as aviators in the military.\n  There are just a little over 1,000 of these amazing women who served \nin World War II. They weren't given Active-Duty status, although that \nwas the intent of General Arnold when they set up this program.\n  If you think back then, the thought of having women military pilots \nwas a little bit of a cultural hang-up. We will let women be Rosie the \nRiveter, and we will let women serve in support positions. But pilots? \nNow, that is kind of crazy talk.\n  So they had a little bit of a problem culturally, but they didn't \ncare. They chose to serve anyway. They said, ``I am going to step up \nand serve my country. I am going to do that as a pilot. I am going to \ndo this with honor and with valor,'' just like their male counterparts \ndid in these very same missions before them, alongside them, and then \nafter them.\n  Thirty-eight of them died in training or in conducting missions. \nThirty-eight of them paid the ultimate sacrifice. They weren't even \ngiven veterans' benefits or any benefits after perishing in the line of \nduty, but they still continued to serve because their country needed \nthem.\n  It was not until 1977 that they were actually given veteran status \nafter the fact. They were then given honorable discharges. They were \ngiven the medals that their male counterparts got for serving as Active \nDuty in the military. They were allowed to be buried, with honors, in \nveterans' cemeteries across the country and were given full military \nhonors, which they deserved.\n  They were actually allowed, as they should be allowed, to be in \nArlington National Cemetery, alongside other heroes who have gone \nbefore them. Yet, we just found out within the last few weeks that that \nhas been rescinded by the Department of Army.\n  That happened quietly back in March of 2015 to these heroes, who \ndeserve to be recognized and who deserve to be a legacy in Arlington \nNational Cemetery so that future generations will know what they did \nand will know of the doors that they opened in the way that they \nserved. It was rescinded by the Army.\n  We didn't know about this until Elaine Harmon, one of the WASPs, \npassed away. I saw her handwritten will when I me with her family last \nweek. It reads, ``I desire to be in Arlington National Cemetery. I want \nmy ashes there.''\n  Her family put in the request like everybody else does, and they were \ndenied. We now found out that the Army has rescinded that and that it \nis no longer allowing these pioneering women to be laid to rest in \nArlington.\n  Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a closet in her \ngranddaughter's home, awaiting her final resting place in Arlington, \nwhich she deserves. The Army gave us some bureaucratic answer about, \noh, they are running out of space, and, by mistake, they opened it up.\n  In 2002, they actually allowed women to be in Arlington. Only two \nwomen took advantage of this and asked to be, in their own right, in \nArlington. Then the Army turned around and rescinded it. Again, they \ngave some bureaucratic answer.\n  They are on the wrong side of this. We have looked into all of the \nlegalities. The Army has all of the authorities that they need to allow \nthese heroes to be laid to rest in Arlington, but they are choosing not \nto do so.\n  We have introduced legislation. We are going to make sure that it \nhappens, but we are calling on them to actually\n\n[[Page H261]]\n\nchange it tonight. Right now, the Secretary of the Army or the \nSecretary of Defense or the President could tonight say: Do you know \nwhat? Elaine Harmon and the other WASPs--there are only a little over \n100 who are still living--are going to be allowed to have their ashes \nin Arlington National Cemetery alongside other heroes. This is the \nleast they could do, and they could do it tonight.\n  So I am leading the Special Order tonight. This is a bipartisan \nSpecial Order. This is bipartisan legislation, and it is bicameral. \nWhen we raised awareness of this issue and got the legislation \ntogether, we had nearly 80 sponsors right away on this bill who said: \nLet's change this thing.\n  Today the Senate introduced a similar bill, and we are going to work \ntogether to get this thing done. We want to continue to raise awareness \nto this issue, this egregious violation of these women. We want this \nthing changed now. It takes a little bit of time sometimes around here \nto work through legislation.\n  In the meantime, Elaine Harmon's ashes are sitting on a shelf in a \ncloset. That is not the way we treat our heroes. That is not the way we \ntreat our pioneers who paved the way for military aviators, like me, to \nbe able to serve in the way we did, and it needs to be changed tonight.\n  We have a number of individuals here on both sides of the aisle who \nare going to be sharing this time with me tonight. I first yield to my \ngood friend and colleague, the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. \nDavis), who is the lead Democratic cosponsor of this bill.\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Thank you so much.\n  I am so glad that my colleague from Arizona is here to speak to this. \nShe is very uniquely qualified to do that as one of the first women \npilots--or the first--to actually fly in combat.\n  As I remember, the women who joined us a few years ago here in the \nCapitol who were part of the WASPs were here to receive Gold Medals for \ntheir heroic acts during the war and for really coming forward and \nbeing part of that volunteer band of women who had had some experience \nin flying, but who could not have imagined in their wildest dreams \ndoing what they were asked to do, but they were delighted to do it.\n  As I will share, they actually wanted to do more, but there were some \nother people who took over and asked them to go home and enjoy their \nlives after they had given so much. So I am just delighted to join in \nthis effort and to right this injustice for military trailblazers who \nwere truly ahead of their time.\n  When the call came to serve in World War II, the WASPs answered that \ncall just like millions of other Americans. They logged over 60 million \nmiles in over 12,000 aircraft. As my colleague has said, 38 WASP women \ndied while serving their country.\n  In 2009, as I mentioned, the WASPs were awarded the Congressional \nGold Medal for flying military missions in World War II. Boy, even when \nthey were here, they were just a strong group of women who delighted in \nseeing one another and in reminding themselves of the amazing stories \nthat they brought.\n  More than anything else, they serve today as great role models to \nwomen who were considering going in the Air Force, of course, and in \nthe Navy, flying for our country, but, also, for taking on some \nremarkable challenges in their lives. They really represent that for \nall of us.\n  They fought, of course, and they died in service to their country. \nThey trained in military style. They slept on metal cots like everybody \nelse and marched and lived under military discipline. That is why we \nfeel they deserve the full honors that we give our war heroes.\n  As has been mentioned, they were given those honors, but because we \nhave a problem of space, it was decided that perhaps they were not at \nthe top of the list. We need to be sure that we provide for everyone \nwho needs to be there.\n  There are many WASPs who may not necessarily choose to be at \nArlington National Cemetery, but for those who have chosen in working \nwith their families--and their families have fought hard for them--this \nis something that we need to do.\n  I want to particularly mention--and I thought this was really fun to \nread--one of the articles about these WASPs.\n  This is Eddy, who is saying, ``I thought it was the nastiest thing \nthat they''--speaking of the Army Air Forces officials--``could have \ndone to us.'' This was while she was receiving visitors at her home in \nCoronado. ``They fired us. They gave our jobs to Air Force men who \ndidn't want to go overseas. I would have gone overseas in a minute,'' \nshe said. ``I was a (heck of) a good fighter pilot.''\n  In my community of San Diego, in El Cajon, I also have a woman named \nJoyce Secciani, who perhaps was not as forthright as Eddy.\n  But despite some fading memories, at 87, she still shares Vivian's \npassion for the WASPs and her disappointment with its demise. She was \nalso one of the 1,102 women who flew in the all-volunteer program \nbetween 1942 and 1944.\n  She remarked, ``All of us felt bad to lose (our flying jobs)--all of \nus wanted to keep up our ability to fly,'' because they knew that, with \nprevailing chauvinistic attitudes, there would be no pilots' work for \nthem in the civilian realm.\n  We need to be sure that we don't lose our perspective about the work \nthat these women did and that we honor them in this way, that we honor \nthem and their families who supported them as well, because we know, \nwith all of our military families, it is not just the person who \nserves, but it is the entire family who serves as well.\n  That was certainly true of these WASPs, whose family members worried \nabout them and were concerned about them as they carried on with their \nduties as forcibly as they did.\n  Let's send that message. Let's continue to work hard. I know that the \nWASPs are also planning a museum to honor them and to make sure that \nthe country never forgets the work that they did because it was \nnecessary.\n  Had they not been there to do that work, many, many people would not \nhave received the materials. Whatever it was, they were making sure \nthat it got to our fighting warriors during World War II.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I am so delighted that my colleague is choosing to move forward with \nthis. I want to turn it back to her, and I know that there are other \ncolleagues of mine over here that would like very much to join in this.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Thank you, Congresswoman Davis. I really appreciate your \npartnership on this issue. Together we can show the American people \nthat we can be united on these things that matter to support our \nveterans and support our heroes and, again, put the pressure on the \nadministration that we have oversight of to actually fix this wrong \nright now. I really look forward to continuing working with you on it.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Maine (Mr. Poliquin), who is joining \nthis discussion as a cosponsor on the bill, very strongly supporting \nthis initiative.\n  Mr. POLIQUIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the Congresswoman.\n  I don't think it much matters if you are a man or you are a woman, \nbut you serve in the United States military. Anybody who has stood up \nfor this country to protect our freedom, protect our way of life, \nprotect our kids, they should receive the full benefits, the full \nhonors of anybody who served in uniform.\n  Now, tonight, as Congresswoman McSally said, we can fix this. There \nis absolutely no reason whatsoever why the Pentagon should, for some \nreason, say there is no room at Arlington. Are you kidding me?\n  Over 1,000 of these brave, patriotic women, during a time where, as \nCongresswoman McSally and Congresswoman Davis mentioned, they were not \nalways welcomed in doing what men were doing, they stood up, they stood \nup and they left their homes and they left their families. They did \nwhat was right. They served this country with honor, with dignity. They \nflew 78 different types of aircraft all over the world. Over 60 million \nmiles were logged. Look at this picture.\n  I salute you, Congresswoman, for bringing this before us.\n  Now, do you think any of these WASPs were saying, ``Well, I don't \nknow, we just can't get this done, we just can't perform this mission, \nI am sorry''? Well, the Pentagon needs to step up right now. They need \nto find a\n\n[[Page H262]]\n\nway to make sure, if these WASPs want to be interred at Arlington, they \nshould be.\n  Now, some of the missions that these brave women flew on included \ntransporting these vehicles all around the world. You know what they \nalso did? They towed targets for men on the ground that were practicing \nartillery. Did you hear one of these WASPs complain, ``Gee, I hope that \nthese men will hit the targets instead of us''?\n  The least the Pentagon can do is to take this seriously, listen to \nthe will of the people, and make sure that these brave women are so \nhonored by being interred, if they wish, at Arlington.\n  Now, one of these humble American heroes is a woman by the name of \nBetty Anne Brown, who very recently passed away at age 92. Now, \nwouldn't she be proud of all of us today standing up and asking that \nour country, that the Pentagon does the right thing?\n  I salute Ms. McSally for her leadership on this issue. The Pentagon \ncan do what is right today. As you mentioned, Congresswoman, \nlegislation is not needed if our Commander in Chief or the folks who \nrun the Pentagon stand up and do what is right.\n  These women deserve every right to be buried at Arlington if they so \nwish.\n  Thank you very much, and I am honored to cosponsor this bill.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Poliquin. I really appreciate \nhis strong support and strong words in support of this effort here.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), my good \nfriend. I think back to how many years ago it was this week, actually, \nwhen I was your guest at the State of the Union Address. So I have \nappreciated your support to me when I was in the military and the \nfights that we had to make sure that women were treated fairly and, \nalso, your strong support on this particular effort.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman McSally for \nyielding. I want to thank her for bringing our attention to this \nimportant issue this evening.\n  I am proud to serve with her on the House Armed Services Committee. I \nknow she is very proud to represent the people of Arizona in the Second \nCongressional District there.\n  I might make note that Ms. McSally's roots are from my home State of \nRhode Island. She and I grew up in the same neighborhood, and I am \nproud to have worked with her on several issues since she has arrived \nin Congress. I was proud, again, back then to have her as my guest to \nthe State of the Union Message as she mentioned.\n  Again, I thank you for raising this important issue. I find it \ncompletely disheartening that the Women Airforce Service Pilots have \nbeen denied interment in one of our Nation's most sacred national \nburial grounds where we honor our men and women who have served.\n  These brave female aviators of World War II embody courage, \nresiliency, and patriotism. Again, I am proud to support Congresswoman \nMcSally's efforts to reinstate their interment eligibility in Arlington \nNational Cemetery. Without these women, some of whom made the ultimate \nsacrifice for our country in one of its greatest times of need, our \nNation would not stand where it does in the world today. We are \nindebted to them for their service.\n  The very least that we can do, Mr. Speaker, is to honor them with the \ndignity and the respect that they have earned and so deserve. We have \ngot to see this policy reversed. I know that we will. It is a \nbipartisan effort. I am proud to join with my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle in raising attention to this issue and insisting that we \nensure that these brave female aviators of World War II, again, who \nembody the courage and resiliency and patriotism that this country so \nadmires and that we are grateful for, and that we see that they are \nproperly given the honor that they deserve.\n  Again, I want to thank Congresswoman McSally for shedding this light \non this misguided injustice.\n\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Langevin.\n  Again, I appreciate your support on this bill and your friendship \nover the years. I look forward to working together to getting this \nmission done and then additional things in the future. Thank you so \nmuch for your strong support for our heroes.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). She has \nbeen a strong advocate, as others who have spoken today, for the WASPs \nand especially the push for the Congressional Gold Medal. I am just \nhonored to have you as a cosponsor and a strong advocate on this bill.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. I am so pleased, so honored, so humbled to be part \nof your Special Order. In the short time that you have been in \nCongress, you have been a real leader on so many important issues, and \nI think none as important as the one that you are spearheading today.\n  I rise today to support you in your mission to give due recognition \nto the Women Airforce Service Pilots, otherwise known as WASPs, not the \nother WASPs that you know about. These are the real ladies that got the \njob done. They are a remarkable group of women who served our country \nproudly during World War II.\n  As you heard from the other speakers, our country turned to female \npilots to deliver planes to our military air bases overseas, tow \ntargets for live antiaircraft artillery practice, and simulate strafing \nmissions. They became the first women in U.S. history to fly for our \nproud military.\n  Out of more than 25,000 women who applied for the program, only 1,704 \nwere accepted in noncombat roles. These courageous American women \nlogged in more than 60 million miles between 1942 and 1944, but it \nwasn't until 1977 that Congress passed legislation that gave these \npatriotic women their much-deserved veteran recognition.\n  In 2002, Arlington National Cemetery decided to allow WASPs, among \nothers listed as Active Duty designees, to receive benefits consistent \nwith the status that they had so rightfully earned. However, the \nDepartment of the Army recently rescinded this decision and made these \nbrave women aviators of World War II ineligible for burial at Arlington \nNational Cemetery.\n  As the author of the legislation--and the gentlewoman and I have \ntalked about this repeatedly--awarding WASPs the Congressional Gold \nMedal in the year of 2009, I am honored to stand with my friend and \ncolleague, Congresswoman Martha McSally, a true patriot in her own \nright, to ensure that the WASPs have the right to have these services \nalongside the rest of our war heroes. These patriotic women selflessly \nhelped defend our country. They deserve full military honor.\n  I am humbled and proud to represent south Florida, and I would like \nto inform the gentlewoman that this has been home to some of these \nremarkable heroine women. I am going to mention some of their names: \nFrances Rohrer Sargent, Helen Wyatt Snapp, Ruth Schafer Fleisher, \nShirley Kruse, and Bee Haydu. Some are with us, and some are no longer \nwith us. Some are not in great shape because they served in World War \nII. It is happening throughout our Nation where we see our finest \npassing away.\n  In this time of great challenges to women, those women that you have \nthere before us, they pushed beyond the boundaries. They brought new \nopportunities for women to come.\n  My daughter-in-law, Lindsay, she flew combat missions in Iraq and \nAfghanistan for the Marines, but she would not have been able to do so \nwithout the women who came before her. Just as you are a pioneer--to \nthe gentlewoman I say thank you for your patriotic duty--but you stand \nalso on their shoulders. These pioneers fought for the values of \nfreedom and democracy. It is our duty to ensure that they are not \ndenied the recognition for their service.\n  We shouldn't be begging for this. With the valiant efforts of these \nAmerican heroines, the United States and our allies were able to \nsuccessfully defeat the Axis Powers during World War II.\n  I thank you, Congresswoman McSally, for introducing this important \nlegislation that would make the Women Airforce Service Pilots eligible, \nonce again, for the services in Arlington National Cemetery with full \nmilitary honors. I agree with you that we don't need the legislation; \nthat tonight, the Secretary of the Army could do the right thing, as he \nhad done before, sign the order making this happen.\n  We will continue the battle in their names. Thank you so much to the \ngentlewoman. Thank you for spearheading\n\n[[Page H263]]\n\nthis effort. Thank you for taking this on. You are a valuable member of \nthis institution. Thank you for the time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. I want to thank the gentlewoman from Florida. As soon as \nI mentioned it to Ileana, she was like: This is wrong. We have got to \nget involved. We have got to fix this.\n  So I appreciate your strong advocacy before I got here, and your \ncontinued advocacy as a wingwoman in this cause.\n  You know, for the WASPs in this story and this cause, it is not just \nthe right thing to do for the country. For me, it is also personal. \nThese women opened the door for me to be able to be a pilot in the Air \nForce and, when the doors were opened, to transition to be a fighter \npilot in the Air Force.\n  I will be honest with you, I didn't hear about them when I was in \nhigh school. This is one reason why it is so important that we allow \nthem to be laid to rest in Arlington, so that it is part of the \neducation for future generations.\n  It wasn't until I went off to the Air Force Academy that I actually \nlearned about the WASPs and learned about what they did. I just didn't \neven imagine that we would have women military pilots in the 1940s in \nWorld War II, but we did.\n  I got to meet some of these amazing women when I first came to Tucson \nto fly the A-10 Warthog, started my training. There were several of \nthem that lived in southern Arizona, and I got to become friends with \nthem, and they became mentors to me and encouragers to me.\n  As the doors were opening up for us to transition into fighters, \nthere was hardly anybody we could really look to who understood what it \nwas like to be in challenging circumstances where you are the only \nwoman. People have attitudes about whether you can or cannot or should \nor should not do what you are doing as an aviator. But these women \nunderstood that. They put up with the same biases and the same \ndiscrimination as they served. They flew in World War II.\n  As I was looking around for someone to have as a role model, these \nwomen were incredible friends to me and supporters and wingwomen to me.\n  Here is one picture I want to show you. This is Ruth Helm, one of the \nTucson residents who, sadly, made her final flight over the last year. \nThis is when she was inducted into the Arizona Aviation Hall of Fame. \nThis is a picture of the two of us in civilian clothes as she was \ninducted there.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  These women paved the way for me, but they encouraged me. Even at my \nmost challenging times, when I was feeling discouraged, I would sit \ndown with them, and they would just fire me up to live to fight and fly \nanother day.\n  Despite the fact that they were told to leave the military after all \nthey did, they still were proud. They didn't have a chip on their \nshoulder. They were grateful for the opportunities that they had. They \nlaughed off some of the challenges that they went through. They just \nstarted encouraging me, ``Come on, you can do it. We did it.'' I just \nwas able to kind of get back in there and continue to push forward \nbecause of what they did before me to open up the doors for me.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. McSALLY. I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Obviously we share a compassion and passion for \nthese wonderful women. We also serve on the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity together.\n  First of all, let me thank you for your service and thank you so very \nmuch for bringing this very important issue, this bipartisan issue to \nthe floor of the House and certainly to your colleagues. I am looking \nforward to working with you on this issue.\n  I just want to say that one of my greatest joys in the United States \nCongress was the military war zones that I had the chance to go to, \nstarting with the Bosnian war. I came in in that timeframe and traveled \nto that area, Kosovo and Albania, and then, of course, Iraq and \nAfghanistan and certainly a number of other sites where issues of \nconflict were going on.\n  There I saw a myriad of women who stood on the shoulders of these \nwomen, who are now in a variety of the branches, not just aviators or \nin the Air Force in particular, but they stood on the shoulders of \nthese women. It gave me a sense of pride and duty to say to them, \n``Thank you.''\n  Women are unique. Many of them are mothers or sisters and daughters \nwho are in the service, or they take care of children, or they are \nnurturers for someone else. We have a particular role, but yet they are \nin the military leaving their families.\n  Just coming in today, I read an article about the ranger who is from \nmy constituency who just came out of ranger school and is from Houston. \nI simply want to say, this is the right thing to do.\n  Every year--and I think you have joined us now as you have come to \nCongress--we go on Memorial Day week to Arlington and lay a wreath for \nwomen who died in the line of duty or in the service of their country. \nDoes anyone realize the numbers of women? We have been doing this now \nfor more than a decade, and the women of the House join us. They do \nthat because this is a valuable part of America's history.\n  To the lady, the aviator that now, I wouldn't say languished, but is \nwith her granddaughter, her ashes are with her granddaughter, I want to \nmake a public commitment joining you to say that her ashes should be in \na place where she can rest in peace. We should move this quickly. If it \nrequires an independent action by the Army, a reconsideration, I am \nsure none of us would be offended by the Army rescinding this \nparticular--how should I say it?--action.\n  I just wanted to come and thank you. I want to thank my colleague \nSusan Davis and all of my colleagues who have been on the floor. I did \nnot want to miss this opportunity.\n  Coming from Texas, I think, as I walk down the streets of Houston or \ntravel throughout the State of Texas, I see veterans and Active Duty \neverywhere. We are proud of that. In urban centers like Houston, you \nwould think not, but they are dominant there.\n  Just this past Christmas, we had what we call Toys for Kids and \nhonored veterans' families. This is an important mission, and I want to \njoin you in this mission. We have gotten our assignment. We really need \nto work. I think the American people need to know that all of us will \njoin together to honor either our veterans, our fallen soldiers, or \nthose who were the pioneers who I know the story of, who stood when \nthey were called and did not step away from duty, did not step away \nfrom the danger, did not step away from possible death as they pursued \nthe cause of this country and to protect this country.\n  I thank you for yielding to me.\n  I am ready to roll up my sleeves. Let's get busy. Let's help find a \nresting place for this dear sister and servant of the Nation. Let's \nfind a resting place going forward for all of those who have served \nthis wonderful and great country. They deserve it.\n  Ms. McSALLY. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining the \nconversation tonight, again, to continue to highlight this egregious \naction that was taken that is putting our heroes in a place, especially \nElaine Harmon, right now, where she has nowhere to be able to rest in \npeace. The place that she wanted to be is denying her, even though her \nservice and the criteria are very clear that she has earned that right.\n  I really appreciate you joining this bipartisan mission. We are not \ngoing to rest until the mission is complete. I want to thank the \ngentlewoman for that.\n  As I was mentioning, this isn't just the right thing to do, but this \nis personal for me. As I transitioned into fighters, these women, these \npioneers who opened up the door for me to even have the opportunity to \nbecome a fighter pilot, they mentored me. They walked alongside me. \nThey encouraged me. They gave me some perspectives from their own \ntraining and their own experiences. They made me laugh. They made me \ncry. They were friends who just paved the way for me.\n  You think about the debates we have had in this body over the years. \nI mean, women couldn't be pilots again in the military until, the late \n1970s or early 1980s, they finally opened up the door for women to be \npilots. But they could only serve in noncombat roles.\n\n[[Page H264]]\n\n  When they had that debate, that didn't have to be theoretical or \nhypothetical. They had the example of these amazing women who did what \nthey did in World War II--again, over a thousand of them, under \nextraordinary circumstances, flying by themselves, often just trying to \nfigure it out in bad weather and how they were going to land and \ndealing with emergencies and clearances and just doing what it took in \norder to get the mission done, get the plane where it needed to be, \ntrain the men to go off and fly in combat, tow the targets, do the \nsimulated strafing runs, all the test piloting, everything, to include \nrisking their lives. Thirty-eight of them died.\n\n  This is personal to me. These three women pictured in this photo--\nDawn Seymour, Eleanor Gunderson, and Ruth Helm--they are sitting in \nthis photo in the front row of the change of command ceremony that I \nhad where I took over command of an A-10 fighter squadron, which was an \nhistoric day for our country that we finally had a woman doing that. It \nwas an historic day for me to be able to take command of a squadron. I \ninvited them and asked them to sit in the front row. I honored them in \nmy change of command speech because I wanted to make sure that \neverybody there knew that I only had the opportunities that I had in \nthe military because they paved the way.\n  These three women are personal friends of mine. Two of them have \nsince had their final flight. Dawn Seymour is still with us, but the \nother two have passed away. We have to keep their legacy going. We have \nto make sure the next generations know how they served with honor at a \ntime when the country needed them. We have to make sure that Elaine \nHarmon and any of the other WASPs who want to have their ashes in \nArlington Cemetery are allowed to do that.\n  Let's be clear. The only reason these women were not considered \nActive Duty at the time was because of gender biases and discrimination \nagainst women. That is the only reason. Had they been a man doing those \njobs, they would have been Active Duty in the Army Air Corps; they \nwould have been discharged honorably; and under the current guidelines, \nthey would have been eligible to have their ashes at Arlington. The \nonly reason they were not Active Duty at the time was because of gender \ndiscrimination.\n  Now this is 2016. It is time for that to stop. We thought it was over \nin 1977 when we finally retroactively gave them that veteran status. \nThey were given those honorable discharges and the medals that they \ndeserved from serving in World War II. We opened up the door for them \nto have military honors and to be laid to rest in veteran cemeteries \naround the country.\n  Arlington Cemetery opened up the doors to them finally--a little \nlate, but in 2002. Last March, without telling anybody, they quietly \nrescinded that. It was just the last slap of gender discrimination \nagainst these amazing pioneers. It needs to be overturned immediately. \nThis is the right thing to do for Elaine Harmon and for the other women \nwho are still living. There are about 100 of them who are still with \nus; and for the next generations who need to know about their service, \nthey deserve to be laid to rest next to the other heroes who are there.\n  The Secretary of the Army has all the authority he needs to let \nElaine Harmon's ashes be in Arlington. Let's be clear. This does not \ntake legislation. He has all the authority he needs to make that happen \ntonight. If he won't do it, the Secretary of Defense can. If he won't \ndo it, then President Obama can. We should not wait another day, Mr. \nSecretary, Mr. President, before making the decision and calling on \nElaine Harmon's family and saying, ``It is approved. Elaine can rest in \npeace in Arlington National Cemetery,'' which is what she deserved and \nwhat she asked for. We should not be lingering another day.\n  As we continue to call on the administration to do the right thing, \nwe are not going to sit by idly. We have got our legislation \nintroduced. We have got almost 80 cosponsors in the House. We have got \na Senate version of the bill that was introduced today, led by Senator \nMikulski and Senator Ernst, also a bipartisan bill. We are going to \ncontinue to push this forward to make this right for our heroes, these \nWomen Airforce Service Pilots, these WASPs. It is the least that we \ncould do for all they have done for us.\n  The last thing I want to say before I close out is that this just \nseems to be a cruel irony and a cruel contradiction if you think about \nit. Just last month, the Pentagon announced that they are opening up, \nfinally, all positions in the military to women. It has been a long \nroad to get to that place. I have been a strong advocate for that \nhappening for a very long time.\n  We are a country that is about equal opportunity. We are a country \nthat treats people as individuals. Our foundations are based on not \ntreating people as a class. We should always, and in the military as \nwell, pick the best man for the job, even if it is a woman.\n  It has been a long haul to get over our biases as a country about \nwhat we think women as a whole group could or should do in service to \nour military. Gradually, positions have been opened. Gradually, women \nhave continued to show that, when called, they will serve valiantly and \nwith honor. They will fight and they will die, if needed, for our \nfreedoms and our liberty.\n  At the time that the Pentagon is opening up all positions to women in \nthe military that they are qualified for, they are closing the doors to \nArlington for the pioneers who made that happen. That is a cruel \nhypocrisy and contradiction, and it needs to be made right tonight.\n  So again, I call on the Secretary of the Army, Secretary of Defense, \nand the President--perhaps he could announce it in his speech tomorrow \nnight--that one of the legacy things that we are going to do for our \nheroes, for our pioneers, for these amazing women, is to allow them to \nbe laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. We owe it to them. They \npaved the way as trailblazers. We owe it to them to be able to rest \nalongside the other heroes and to be able to continue to educate the \nnext generations about their legacy.\n  All I will say to the WASPs is: I have got your back. You had mine, \nand I have got yours now. It is the right thing to do.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H264-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H264-H267]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          EGYPT TALKING POINTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Iowa (Mr. King) is recognized for \nthe remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my honor and privilege to be \nrecognized to address you here on the floor of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and for her presentation here \ntonight and the collection of people who came down to support her \ninitiative and her agenda.\n  I thank the men and women who have stepped up and put on the uniform \nand actually those, also, who have risked their lives who were not \nformally wearing the uniform to defend our country.\n  I am one who, I think you know, Mr. Speaker, has great reverence for \nour constitutional values and the pillars of American exceptionalism, \nthe underpinnings that make this a great nation. One of the things that \nwe have been able to do as a great nation is be able to inspire others.\n  If we look around the world, there are those who think that the only \nthing that could happen that is good to somebody is if we just bring \nthem into America and give them access to our welfare benefits and \nmaybe they will become good Americans and all will be right with the \nworld, but I don't know if they have done the geography very well, Mr. \nSpeaker, and recognize that we can do a lot more good by helping people \nwhere they are so that they can help themselves.\n  One of the most important things we can do is not send the wealth of \nAmerica over to give people money and food and housing. That goes on \nfrom time to time, and there is a good number of times it is very well \njustified. But the best thing we can do is inspire others to live and \nmodel after the freedom of the United States of America. Then they can \nhelp themselves, Mr. Speaker.\n  I think of a time I sat down with several Ambassadors to the United \nStates from Israel. We had a meeting over here in a room just off the \nHouse floor.\n\n[[Page H265]]\n\nThey were explaining to me that they had adopted Hebrew as their \nofficial language. They did that, I believe, in 1954. They formed their \ncountry in 1948.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  And I said: ``Why did you establish an official language and why did \nyou resurrect essentially a dead language''--Hebrew--``that had not \nbeen used in common discourse or business or politics''--except for \nprayer--``for 2,000 years?''\n  And they said they saw the success of the United States with the \ncommon language that we have. English is our common language.\n  They wanted a common language for Israelis. They wanted something \nthat would be unique, something that would bond and bind them together, \nbecause they had seen the successful model here. They were inspired by \nthe successful model of assimilation that came about because of a \ncommon language. So they adopted Hebrew as their official language in \nIsrael.\n  I was quite impressed, Mr. Speaker. I was quite impressed that \nAmerica would inspire a country that had all the world history to draw \nfrom, yet they look at the model we have here to make such a definitive \nthing as to bring back a language that had not been utilized in common \ndiscussion for 2,000 years.\n  I give you that example, Mr. Speaker, because I come here tonight and \nI want to talk about Egypt and how it is that the United States of \nAmerica inspires people around the world in ways that we may not \nrealize.\n  I come to the floor tonight, Mr. Speaker, to commemorate and \ncelebrate and give notice to and congratulate the Egyptian people. \nYesterday they swore in and convened their parliament. That is Egypt's \nfirst parliament in nearly 4 years.\n  It is a great day for Egypt, and it is a great day for liberty \nworldwide. It is a great day for the United States to see that there \nare others around the world who are inspired by our system of a \nrepresentative form of government.\n  I extend my congratulations to President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi and to \nthe new speaker and drafter of Egypt's Constitution, Ali Abdel-Al, but \nalso to Mr. Moussa, whom I met with on at least two occasions as he \nchaired the committee to draft the Egyptian Constitution.\n  The citizens of Egypt have achieved an important foreign policy \nmilestone, Mr. Speaker. Yesterday was that day. I was curious that they \nwould convene on a Sunday. Only under extreme circumstances would we \nstart our day here on a Sunday.\n  However, Egypt is a Muslim country. It is about 95 percent Muslim--it \nhas got a higher percentage of Christians than people might think--and \nthey go to mosque on Friday. In fact, I learned that the Christians \nhave their services on Friday as well. That way, Sunday is a workday.\n  But, in any case, the short history and the most recent history of \nEgypt is really astonishing. I point out that it seems as though our \nadministration has missed the importance of this.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I will just go through some of the history of Egypt \nas we commemorate and congratulate them for convening their Parliament \nnow under a legitimized constitutional government of the sovereign \nnation-state of Egypt, a country that we need to expand and strengthen \nour relations with and a country that can be a central player in \nstabilizing the instability all throughout the Middle East.\n  It is important that Egypt be a significant component of that effort \nthat is going forward not just in this administration, but into the \nnext administration and for a long time.\n  Back in 1981, President Mubarak took power. He held power for 30 \nyears. In that 30-year period of time, some people thought that he was \na strong man and that he dealt harshly with some of his opposition that \nwas there. It may be true. I am not here to defend President Mubarak.\n  When President Obama took office, it was clear that he had a \ndifferent view of President Mubarak than I have expressed here. He went \nto Cairo to give a speech in Egypt on June 4, 2009.\n  And I remind the body, Mr. Speaker, that President Obama, then-\nSenator Obama and a candidate for President, in the spring of 2008 made \na statement roughly similar to the fact he believed his middle name \nmeans something to the rest of the world.\n  And when they recognize and see his middle name, they all know that \nhe can communicate with them in a certain way that someone who doesn't \nhave that middle name doesn't have that particular tool.\n  And so shortly after that--being elected President and then armed \nwith that conviction--President Obama traveled to Cairo, Egypt, and \ngave his speech on June 4, 2009, at Al-Azhar University in Cairo.\n  Now, Al-Azhar University is essentially the global center for Islamic \nthought. They have Islamic scholars there that are respected worldwide \nwithin the world of Islam.\n  So to send a message to the Muslim world, there wasn't a place that \nwas more effective than going to Al-Azhar University to give his June \n4, 2009, speech.\n  It happens to be a fact, Mr. Speaker, that the seating arrangement \nwas arranged, we have to presume, with the approval of President Obama. \nAnd who sat in the front row, Mr. Speaker?\n  The leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood were seated in the front row \nwhen President Obama gave his speech at Al-Azhar University. That sent \na powerful signal to the Egyptian people, a signal that the President \nof the United States supports the Muslim Brotherhood.\n  Now, I don't bring this up as speculation, Mr. Speaker. I bring it \nback to the floor of the Congress because I am speaking from hands-on, \neye-to-eye experience in talking with the Egyptian people and some of \ntheir leadership and some of their press.\n  They say to us: ``Why does President Obama support the Muslim \nBrotherhood?'' That is a bit of a tough question and is a hard one to \nrebut when they are seated in the front row at Al-Azhar University.\n  Well, this brought about a significant amount of unrest. It \ncontributed to the unrest, is probably a more reasonable way to \ndescribe this, Mr. Speaker. As the unrest grew in Egypt, we also heard \nmessages coming out of the State Department.\n  For example, then-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton made a statement \nvery similar to: Mubarak needs to be gone yesterday. And so the push \nfrom the Obama administration, the push from the State Department, \nthen-Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and others, began to put \npressure on Mubarak.\n  While this is going on, the Arab Spring erupted about January, \nFebruary 2011. Of course, it was multiple countries throughout the \nMiddle East that had unrest. And there was significant unrest in Egypt, \nas we know.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, the pressure built and the demonstrations that \ntook place in Tahrir Square were intense. Some of them were violent. We \nsaw on television the massive amounts of people that were on the square \nand weren't going to leave.\n  With the trouble that was there, finally, on February 11, 2011, \nMubarak stepped down. When he stepped down, that left a bit of a void \nthat was still wrapped up in the chaos.\n  During that chaos, there were primarily Muslim Brotherhood activities \nconsisting of mobs that were attacking Christian churches, attacking \nthe Evangelical churches that are there, and attacking the Coptic \nChristian churches that are there. In fact, the persecution went on in \nmultiple cities around Egypt. There were multiple churches that were \nburned and razed to the ground. Some were just gutted by fire.\n  Well, in June 2012, Mohamed Morsi came to power. He is the face and \nthe voice--and may still be--of the Muslim Brotherhood. As Morsi came \nto power, they began to see how the Muslim Brotherhood would rule \nEgypt.\n  The protests died down for a while, and then they ramped back up \nagain, Mr. Speaker and got worse and worse and worse and more intense.\n  And so the protests accelerated up to January 25, 2013. There were \nmany protests. Egypt was more or less very difficult to govern and rule \nbecause of the protests against Morsi and because of the way that Morsi \nhad mishandled government and the way that the Muslim Brotherhood, with \ntheir heavy hand, had worked against many of the Egyptian people.\n  Morsi was the duly-elected President. And I believe the number was \n4.6 million Egyptians that came to the polls\n\n[[Page H266]]\n\nout of 83 million Egyptians altogether. So it was a low percentage of \nturnout, but they saw him get elected.\n  And then, as he essentially disempowered the legislature and \ndisempowered the judicial branch of government, there was a democratic \nelection for Morsi, an election one last time. The dictator had taken \nover, and the Egyptian people knew it. And they began to push back, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  So the protests accelerated from January 25, 2013, on throughout that \nspring. And then, as we watched, there was a funeral at the main Coptic \nchurch in Cairo. The Muslim Brotherhood mobs attacked the funeral and \nkilled people. And so that is a brutal division within the society that \ntook place. That was April 7, 2013.\n  Throughout that summer, the Christian groups were gathering together, \nMr. Speaker, and during that period of time they would have regular \nprayer meetings to pray that God would bring relief to Egypt and turn \nthe country back over to the Egyptian people and let them govern their \ncountry and have their country back, take it away from Morsi.\n  As I sat and listened to Pastor Maurice, who leads a 4,000-member \nEvangelical church in Egypt, as they were gathering for prayers on the \nnight of June 29, he said to the other pastors who had been regularly \ncoming together to pray: I am going to lead the prayer tonight. I am \ngoing to be in charge of the prayer tonight.\n  So they agreed. They gathered together and Pastor Maurice offered \nthis prayer. He said: God, we have been praying daily for relief from \nEgypt. I am tired of waiting. I don't want to wait any longer. I want \nthis relief tomorrow.'' It is the night of June 29, 2013. ``God, bring \nus this relief tomorrow.''\n  That was the eve of the relief that came. By June 30, the following \nday, the streets and every city began to fill in Egypt. Tahrir Square \nbecame full again. People poured into the streets of Egypt, and they \npoured into the streets on June 30, July 1, July 2, and July 3.\n  The numbers of people in the streets in Egypt that came out to \nprotest were estimated at 33 million people out of 83 million \nEgyptians. Now, think of that. If we had that same percentage come out \nin the streets of America, we would have 125 million people in the \nstreets of America, Mr. Speaker.\n  It was a massive turnout in Egypt. And something had to happen. They \npleaded with General el-Sisi: Will you take over in this country? We \ncan't take this any longer. We have got to have some leadership. We \nhave got to have somebody in charge of our country, Egypt.\n  General el-Sisi demurred. He said: No. I don't want to do this. I \ndon't want to step in. Finally, by the 3rd of June, he relented and \nstepped in with the military to bring order in Tahrir Square. That \nturned out to be a move that stabilized Egypt.\n  Shortly after that, they stabilized Egypt. They had more peace in the \nstreets. There was still trouble. The Muslim Brotherhood was still \nattacking people.\n  There were still arrests of some of those who had been violent take \nplace in the square that had been attacking people. But they installed \nan interim President and put some stability into the government. This \nis early July of 2013.\n  Myself and a couple of other Members went to Egypt over the Labor Day \nbreak in September 2013. We met with the interim President in one \nmeeting, in a different meeting with the Pope of the Coptic Church, in \na separate meeting then with General el-Sisi, and in a separate meeting \nwith Mr. Moussa, who was the chairman of the committee that was writing \na Constitution.\n  I remember each of those meetings in a distinct way. The Coptic Pope \nsaid: We are praying for the people who are killing us. We are not \ngoing to be sucked into a civil war in Egypt. We are praying for them \nand are asking God to forgive them, which I thought was a very high \nlevel of faith that I don't know that I could reach, Mr. Speaker. I was \nvery impressed with the Coptic Pope.\n  We met with Mr. Moussa, who described the Constitution they were \ndrafting, but he said it is up to the Egyptian people. They have got to \nratify it.\n  And as we met with General el-Sisi, I recall asking him a series of \nquestions: If this Constitution is ratified and a legitimized civilian \ngovernment takes charge in Egypt, will the military take orders from a \ncivilian President or a civilian prime minister and a civilian \nparliament?\n  He looked me in the eye and he said: Yes. The military will.\n  So I didn't know at the time--and I don't think he knew at the time--\nthat he would eventually become a candidate for President and actually \nbe the one issuing the orders to the military. But he has kept his \nword.\n  As he promised to me and others promised to me, they would ratify a \nConstitution, they would elect a national leader or President, and once \nthe Constitution was ratified and the President was elected, they would \nthen have elections and seat a parliament or a legislative body.\n  Within their Constitution they wrote the language that said, of the \nroughly 100 churches that have been destroyed--mostly by the Muslim \nBrotherhood--they would use Egyptian tax dollars to rebuild those \nchurches.\n  I am here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to say thank you to President el-Sisi \nof Egypt, thank you to Mr. Moussa and those others that worked on the \nConstitution, and to congratulate the Parliament in Egypt that is now \nseated as of yesterday. Their country is put in place now so that the \nEgyptian people are finally in charge of their country again.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  And when I am asked why does our administration support the Muslim \nBrotherhood, I am going to continue to give the same answer: The \nAmerican people support the Egyptian people. The Egyptian people don't \nsupport the Muslim Brotherhood. They have proven that over and over \nagain. The leadership that the Egyptians have elected has proven that \nthey have given their word, they have kept their word, they have \nperformed in the fashion that they said.\n  And as I have gone back now a couple of times since then, most \nrecently last spring, in about March or April, at some significant \nexpense, I might add, I remember sitting down with President el-Sisi, \nand he said a couple of things that I think that we should remember, \nand I believe he wanted me to convey them here on this floor, Mr. \nSpeaker; and that is that, he gave a speech January 1 of last year at \nAl-Azhar University, in the center of Muslim thought, and here is the \nmessage that he delivered.\n  The message was this, he is asking a rhetorical question, and it was: \nIs it possible to accept the idea that the whole world must die so that \nMuslims can live? That is verbatim, Mr. Speaker. It is a rhetorical \nquestion. It is the most powerful rhetorical question that I believe \nthat I have heard.\n  And, of course, he rejected that idea. He understands that Muslims \nand Christians and Buddhists and atheists and agnostics and all the \nreligions need to live on this world together, and he is looking for \nthat kind of peace and stability, so that no religion is persecuted, no \nreligion is being murdered while they are going to someone else's \nfuneral, or their wedding. And that happened also in Egypt, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  So I want to thank President el-Sisi for his commitment. And I would \nadd, also, that he made another statement that I think we also need to \nthink about, Mr. Speaker, and that is, he said they, speaking of the \nMuslim Brotherhood, they are trying to establish and impose divine law \non all the world.\n  When he looked at me he realized it didn't quite register, and he \nsaid, sharia law. They want to impose sharia law on the entire world. \nAnd he put his head down, almost between his knees, as he sat there, \nand shook his head in rejection.\n  I am convinced we can work with this man. He is a dedicated Muslim \nwho is a peaceful leader, who understands this picture of the world the \nway it sets.\n  When I look at the work that was done by Ataturk in Turkey, how he \nprovided a bridge between the East and the West, and that has been \ndrifting back a bit the other way under Erdogan, but I believe that \nPresident el-Sisi has the skill set, the convictions, and the \nfoundation to, one day, with the right kind of support, the support of \nthe United States of America and the free world and the Middle East,\n\n[[Page H267]]\n\ncould become the Ataturk for the world to bring about that bridge \nbetween the Muslim world and the Christian world and the West.\n  If we fail in that effort to do that outreach and tie these bonds \ntogether, these bonds that go back through history, a long ways back, \nMr. Speaker, if we fail, then I am afraid there will be a tremendous \namount of bloodshed.\n  If we succeed, I believe we can eliminate and forestall a significant \namount of bloodshed and bridge over this division that is coming at us. \nAnd he deserves and needs our help to defend himself from terrorists \nthat are attacking from all directions, from Sinai and everywhere else.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate your indulgence here tonight.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H267-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H267-H275]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       CONGRESSIONAL BLACK CAUCUS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nbe given 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and add \nany extraneous material relevant to the subject matter of this \ndiscussion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Mr. Speaker, it is an honor and a privilege for me to \nrise today and to co-anchor, along with my distinguished colleague from \nthe great State of Ohio, Representative Joyce Beatty, this CBC Special \nOrder hour, this hour of power.\n  Once again, we are privileged to take to the floor of the people's \nHouse to discuss an issue that should be relevant to every Member of \nthis institution on behalf of the 320 million-plus Americans that we \nrepresent in this great country, and that is the gun violence epidemic.\n  America has 5 percent of the world's population, but 50 percent of \nthe world's guns. It is estimated that there are more than 300 million \nguns in circulation throughout this country. So it seems to me \nreasonable that we would do everything possible to ensure that not a \nsingle one of those guns finds themselves in the hands of individuals \nwho would do us harm. And that in many ways is what President Obama has \ndone as it relates to his most recent executive action.\n  So today members of the Congressional Black Caucus will come to the \nHouse floor to discuss those executive actions, discuss the issue of \ngun violence, discuss the steps that we should be taking, here in this \nChamber, in order to keep the people of America that we all \ncollectively represent safe.\n  It is now my honor and my privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from \nOhio (Mrs. Beatty), my classmate and my co-anchor for this CBC Special \nOrder hour. I look forward to anchoring with her throughout the entire \nyear. She has been a tremendous champion for working families, for the \nmiddle class, for small-business owners and, of course, for the young \npeople who are ravaged in our communities all across this country by \ngun violence.\n  Mrs. BEATTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening proud to stand with my \nCongressional Black Caucus Special Order hour co-anchor, Congressman \nJeffries, from the Eighth Congressional District of New York.\n\n  Mr. Jeffries, it is my honor to stand here today as we undertake an \nurgent dialogue on how we, as elected Representatives of the people, \ncan work together to end gun violence.\n  I look forward to engaging with Congressman Jeffries and our \nCongressional Black Caucus colleagues in scholarly debate on the issues \nplaguing African Americans, African American communities, and to \ndevelop solutions to the problems our constituents face.\n  As the conscience of the Congress, the Congressional Black Caucus \nwill remain on the forefront of issues that affect Black Americans in \nparticular, and the Nation, in general. For tonight, our anchor, \nCongressman Jeffries, has pointed out the CBC will continue to shed \nlight on the epidemic of gun violence, standing our ground, ending gun \nviolence in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week we opened the Second Session of the 114th \nCongress. Four hundred thirty-five of us traveled back to Washington \nready to serve our constituents and work for the betterment of our \nNation.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, whatever spirit of bipartisanship may \nhave been present at the end of 2015 as Republicans and Democrats \nworked together on key pieces of legislation has disappeared at the \nprecise time our Nation is calling on Congress to pass commonsense \nlegislation to keep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  We find ourselves confronted with startling statistics that no Nation \nshould endure. Let me just take a moment to share just a few.\n  We know that the impact of gun violence affects every community and \nevery congressional district. However, African American children and \nteens are 17 times more likely to die from gun homicide than White \nyouth, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.\n  While African Americans make up 15 percent of youth in America, \nAfrican Americans accounted for 45 percent of children and teen gun \ndeaths in 2010.\n  According to Everytown for Gun Safety, 88 Americans die every day \nfrom gun violence, Mr. Speaker. Roughly 50 percent of those killed are \nAfrican American men, who comprise just 6 percent of the population. \nHomicide is the primary cause of death among African Americans ages 15-\n24.\n  Mr. Speaker, these numbers should be unthinkable, unimaginable, but \nthey are the unfortunate reality in which African American communities \nlive. In the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, whose legacy we honor \nnext Monday, he said: We find ourselves ``confronted with the fierce \nurgency of now.'' And Mr. Speaker, it is now that our Nation is in an \nurgent crisis, yet we are trapped in congressional inaction. Shameful.\n  So our President decided he would not stand by idly while Congress \ndid nothing to prevent another Newtown, another Charleston, other \nTucson. With tears in his eyes, he reflected on the senseless killings \ncaused by gun violence over the course of his administration. President \nObama announced new executive actions to confront the epidemic of gun \nviolence in America.\n  While mocked by some Republicans for showing emotion at the loss of \nso many lives, I am here to say I proudly stand with my President on \nthe actions he has taken to prevent gun violence in America.\n  These executive actions will save lives and make the country safer \nwithout infringing on law-abiding individuals' rights to firearms.\n  You will hear from our colleagues tonight talking about the \nPresident's actions. I look forward to continuing to work with my \ncolleagues and to address gun violence.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Beatty, for laying out the \ncase in such an eloquent and compelling fashion, and pointing out that, \nwith respect to gun safety and gun violence prevention in America, it \nis long past time when we act with the fierce urgency of now.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans have died as a result of gun violence \nsince the moment you and I first set foot in this institution, and not \na single thing has been done by the House of Representatives to prevent \nthose deaths. That is shameful, as you have pointed out, and we need a \nchange of course.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the distinguished gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Scott), the ranking member, lead Democrat on the House Education \nand the Workforce Committee, once, of course, chaired by the legendary \nAdam Clayton Powell, and Representative Scott has continued in that \ntremendous visionary tradition.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom New York and the gentlewoman from Ohio for organizing tonight's \nSpecial Order to focus on the toll that gun violence has taken on \ncommunities across America and, especially, the disproportionate impact \nit has had within communities of color.\n  Tonight's conversation comes at an important time. On average, every \nday more than 30 people are killed by firearms, many in mass murders.\n  Now, rather than do what they say is celebrate the problem, I want to \ntalk about solutions. Last Tuesday, the President announced the \nexecutive actions that his administration will take\n\n[[Page H268]]\n\nto prevent gun violence. I commend the President for taking this \naction, in light of the current congressional leadership's refusal to \nresponsibly address this epidemic.\n  These executive actions will ensure stronger enforcement of current \nlaws and will reduce the number of lives lost to gun violence. To begin \nwith, the President's executive actions will narrow the ``gun show'' \nand Internet loopholes by actually enforcing licensing requirements for \ngun dealers and overhauling the background check system to make it more \neffective and efficient.\n  Under current law, only licensed gun dealers are required to perform \ncriminal background checks for all gun sales, and only those \nindividuals deemed to be ``engaged in the business'' of dealing in guns \nare required to obtain a license from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, the ATF.\n  The executive actions make it clear that the commonsense proposition \nthat anyone making a profit from the sale of guns, or who regularly \nmakes gun sales or earns a livelihood from gun sales, is, in fact, \nengaged in the business and therefore must obtain a license and conduct \nrequired criminal background checks, even if those sales occur at gun \nshows or over the Internet.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  The question of whether someone is engaged in business will be \ndetermined by normal legal standards as opposed to people just \ndeclaring themselves to be exempt, which is going on now. Some of these \npeople are even making a living selling firearms. They need to get a \nlicense. This is the present law, and the President has said that he \nwill enforce it.\n  The Federal Bureau of Investigation, as part of executive actions, \nwill overhaul its National Instant Criminal Background Check System, \nthe NICS system, to make it more effective and efficient by hiring more \nthan 230 additional examiners and other staff so that the Bureau can \nprocess background checks 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and improve \nits notification of local authorities when prohibited persons \nunlawfully attempt to purchase a gun.\n  These people are currently breaking the law when they illegally try \nto buy a firearm, and local law enforcement officials need to be \ninformed. According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, this system \nhas already caught more than 2 million people trying to buy guns \nillegally, and they need to be held accountable for breaking the law.\n  Furthermore, dealers will also be required to notify law enforcement \nif their guns are lost or stolen in transit. This transparency and \naccountability will ensure that law enforcement will be notified and \ncan begin investigations when these losses occur.\n  Executive actions will also leverage the buying power of the \nDepartment of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the Department of \nHomeland Security to conduct or sponsor research into gun technology. \nWhen the Federal Government begins buying guns using that kind of \ntechnology, it will make it more likely that this technology will be \nused. There is technology that makes it impossible for anyone other \nthan the true owner to use weapons, and the more purchases the Federal \nGovernment makes, the more likely it is that technology will actually \nbe installed in future weapons.\n  The President has also directed the departments to review the \navailability of smart gun technology on a regular basis and to explore \npotential ways to further its use and to encourage research to more \nbroadly improve gun safety.\n  The President's plan also proposes a new $500 million investment to \nincrease access to mental health treatment to ensure that people who \nneed help do not fall through the cracks of the mental health system. \nThis is in addition to the huge increases in mental health funding \nunder the Affordable Care Act. Mental health services are considered \nessential services, and so now virtually all health insurance policies \ninclude mental health coverage.\n  While modest and within the President's executive authority, these \nexecutive actions will go a long way in keeping guns out of the hands \nof people who never should be able to purchase them in the first place. \nBut that is executive action. Congress needs to act so that more can be \ndone to actually protect citizens from gun violence.\n  The House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force has \nconsistently reiterated that Washington has a moral obligation to do \nsomething to address our Nation's gun violence epidemic. The most \neffective way to address this epidemic is through comprehensive, \nevidence-based policy proposals.\n  Our task force has put forth several proposals that will go a long \nway in achieving these goals. These proposals include reinstating and \nstrengthening the assault weapon ban, reducing the size of magazines, \nimplementing universal background checks, cracking down on illegal gun \ntrafficking and straw purchases, improving our mental health system, \nand implementing comprehensive, locally tailored, evidence-based \nviolence prevention and intervention programs.\n  The gentleman from California, Representative Mike Thompson, is the \nchair of the House Democratic Gun Violence Prevention Task Force, and \nhe has introduced a resolution to establish a select committee of the \nHouse to study gun violence. That resolution is cosponsored by \nDemocratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and 11 cochairs of the task force. The \nproposed select committee would be comprised of six Republicans and six \nDemocrats who would study the research and issue a final report and \nrecommendations, including legislative proposals, within 60 days of its \nestablishment.\n  It would study and make recommendations to address many issues, \nincluding the causes of mass shootings, methods to improve the Federal \nfirearms purchaser background check system, connections between access \nto firearms and dangerously mentally ill individuals, Federal penalties \nfor trafficking and straw purchasing of firearms, loopholes that allow \nsome domestic abusers continued access to firearms, linkages between \nfirearms and suicide, gun violence's effect on public health, the \ncorrelation between State gun violence prevention laws and the \nincidence of gun violence, the importance of having reliable, accurate \ninformation on gun violence and its toll on our Nation, the \nimplementation of effective gun violence prevention laws in accordance \nwith the Second Amendment to our Constitution, and the rates of gun \nviolence in large metropolitan areas.\n  Mr. Speaker, by taking a deliberate, research-based approach to gun \nviolence, treating it as we would a public health challenge, we can \nsignificantly reduce the ravages of gun violence.\n  The President is limited by his executive authority on what alone he \ncan do to address this epidemic. Long-term reforms can only be achieved \nthrough congressional action. I hope that the leadership of the \nCongress will follow the President's lead and act in a bipartisan basis \nto address this critical issue using public health strategies and \nevidence-based proposals.\n  Again, Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York and the \ngentlelady from Ohio for coordinating this Special Order.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Thank you, Representative Scott, for laying out the \nsteps that are being taken by the President in such a compelling way in \nexplaining why they are items that we should all support as well as \nsome of the steps that need to be taken legislatively by this Congress \nin order to deal with the fact that more than 10,000 Americans a year \ndie as a result of gun violence-related homicides.\n\n  I yield to the distinguished gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee). \nShe is an incredibly eloquent and passionate voice for the voiceless. \nWe appreciate her service here in the Congress not just on behalf of \nthe district that she represents in northern California, but certainly \non behalf of the people of the United States of America. I yield now to \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee.\n  Ms. LEE. First, let me thank the gentleman from New York for those \nvery kind remarks. But also I want to thank you and Congresswoman \nBeatty for organizing this very important Special Order and for your \ntremendous leadership, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman Beatty, \non ensuring public safety.\n  Your leadership, both Congresswoman Beatty and Congressman\n\n[[Page H269]]\n\nJeffries, has been bold, it has been visionary, not just as the result \nof the very recent tragedies but for many, many years even before both \nof you came to Congress. So it is an honor serving with both of you in \nthis body. Thank you very much for the opportunity to speak this \nevening.\n  Also, I want to just thank Congresswoman Robin Kelly, who is the vice \nchair on the Gun Violence Task Force. She also chairs the CBC's Health \nBraintrust.\n  I thank you for your tireless work to ensure that gun violence is \ntreated as a public health problem, which it is.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise this evening with my colleagues in the \nCongressional Black Caucus to call on Congress to do something--to do \nsomething--about the epidemic of gun violence that is harming our \ncommunities.\n  Since the start of the year--just 11 days ago--nine of my \nconstituents have already become victims of gun violence, including an \nelementary school teacher and an innocent mother pushing her child in a \nstroller. Just this weekend alone my community suffered three gun \nhomicides. My thoughts are with the victims' family at this very \nterribly difficult time. We have to do something. Enough is enough.\n  Congress can and must do more to stop this senseless violence. \nWhether it is Charleston, Oak Creek, Sandy Hook, the streets of Oakland \nor wherever, too many people have already lost their lives, too many \nfamilies have buried loved ones, and too many lives have been changed \nforever because of catastrophic injuries as a result of gun violence.\n  Madam Speaker, now is the time for action. Our constituents are \ndemanding action. The country is demanding action. I have received \nhundreds of calls and emails from my constituents, and I know other \nMembers are also hearing from their constituents. They are calling for \naction as well.\n  Earlier today in my own District, Oakland City Council President \nLynette Gibson McElehany buried her grandson, 17-year-old Torian \nHughes, who was shot and killed during a robbery just days before \nChristmas. This has been a very difficult period for Council Member \nMcElehany and her family. So in addition to our prayers not only for my \ncouncil member's family, but for all of those in our country who have \nbeen victims of gun violence, we must do something. We must do \nsomething in all of their memory.\n  Let me be clear. Congress can no longer ignore the massive toll that \nthis epidemic is having on our constituents, their families, and \ncommunities. Last week we joined with our colleagues and millions of \nAmericans in applauding President Obama's actions to reduce gun \nviolence in our Nation. Thanks to the President's leadership, there \nwill be more background checks, better enforcement of existing gun \nlaws, improved mental health services, and new research on how to end \nthis epidemic of gun violence.\n  But more action is needed to stop the more than 30,000 gun deaths \nthat occur in our Nation each and every year. Congress must pass \ncommonsense gun reform, like closing the gun show loophole, bipartisan \nmeasures that are supported by the vast majority of Americans and gun \nowners. Congress must also fund the expansion of mental health \nservices.\n  But this should not be an excuse, of course, to do nothing on gun \nsafety. We have got to provide the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms \nand Explosives the resources it needs to enforce our Nation's gun laws.\n  As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I have fought along with \nmy colleagues to get these vital public safety resources in the \nappropriations bills which keep our communities safe. We must also end \nthe extreme data restrictions that restrict law enforcement's ability \nto protect public safety and prevent policymakers from addressing gun \nviolence as a public health issue.\n  That is why I introduced last year H.R. 1449, the Tiahrt Restrictions \nRepeal Act, which would repeal the data restrictions on gun sales and \nbackground checks. These data restrictions are commonly called the \nTiahrt restrictions. They prevent data on gun background checks from \nbeing released to the public.\n  These provisions currently impede public safety by requiring the \nNational Criminal Background Check System records to be destroyed--mind \nyou, destroyed--within 24 hours, prohibiting the ATF from requiring \nlicensed dealers to conduct annual inventory checks to detect lost or \nstolen firearms and restricting local and State law enforcement from \nusing trace data to fully investigate corrupt dealers and traffickers.\n  This is outrageous. We have got to restrict and repeal these Tiahrt \namendments right away. It will help tackle the bad apple gun dealers \nwho provide dangerous weapons to criminals. It is estimated that just 5 \npercent of sellers supply the weapons used in nearly 90 percent of gun \ncrimes. The Tiahrt restrictions block access to vital data that \nlawmakers, law enforcement, and Federal agencies need to tackle gun \nviolence in our community.\n  Of course, many of us are proud to support Congresswoman Kelly's \nbill, which would allow the Surgeon General to study gun violence as a \npublic health issue and the Consumer Product Safety Commission to \nregulate firearms.\n\n  Madam Speaker, the time for action is now. Let's start listening to \nthe American people and insist that Congress do something. It is really \ndisingenuous to criticize the President for issuing commonsense gun \nsafety measures when we have been trying for years in this body--for \nyears--to get these sensible bills passed. The Speaker should allow \nthese and many other bills to come to the floor so that Congress can \nact. No more excuses.\n  We should support Congressman Thompson's proposal to establish the \nselect committee on gun violence. The Speaker should do this now. So we \ncan't continue to really allow the misinformation to get out about \nCongress. We need to do our job. We have been trying, many of us, the \nCongressional Black Caucus and others, especially Democrats, for many \nyears to try to get the Speaker to bring these bills to the floor.\n  So what did the President do? He had to do something. But no more \nexcuses. Congress needs to act. So I thank Congresswoman Beatty and \nCongressman Jeffries for this very important Special Order hour and for \nyour tremendous leadership.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Again, I thank the distinguished gentlewoman from \nCalifornia for her wonderful remarks, observations, and, of course, her \nsupport for the President's executive actions on gun safety, making it \nclear that the President was left with no choice but to act.\n  Tens of thousands of Americans die each and every year either as it \nrelates to homicide or suicide through a firearm, and nothing was \nhappening here in the United States Congress. The classic definition of \nlegislative insanity is to do the same exact thing, which in this \ninstance is nothing, and expect that things were going to change for \nthe safety and the well-being of the American people. That is why we \nare here on the floor today expressing strong support for the \nPresident's executive actions and pushing this institution to do more \nand finish the job that the President of the United States of America \nstarted.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Houston (Ms. Jackson Lee), a forceful advocate and the \nlead Democrat on the relevant committee on the House Judiciary side of \nthe equation as it relates to criminal justice, reform, and gun safety. \nShe, of course, has been a tremendous champion for the people that she \nserves down in H-Town, as well as across the country.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York for \nyielding.\n  As has been stated by my colleagues, I want to add my applause as \nwell for the thoughtfulness of the gentleman's leadership on a number \nof issues, but certainly on his pronounced leadership on criminal \njustice reform and on the Judiciary Committee; and then to be joined by \nformer leader of the Ohio State Legislature--and she has not forgotten \nher talents of leadership--and that is Congresswoman Joyce Beatty who \njoins us, if I might put words in both your mouths, with a sense of \noutrage about where we are today. I say that because I would like to \nstand here\n\n[[Page H270]]\n\nwith an enormous amount of outrage for where we are and why we are \nhere.\n  I want to add my appreciation to the Congressional Black Caucus, the \nchairman, Mr. Butterfield, and, of course, Congresswoman Dr. Kelly, who \nhas been a great leader on the issues dealing with health care. I just \nwant to cite to her, a lady that came to this Congress more than a \ndecade ago, Deborah Prothrow-Stith. You may have read her writings. She \npronounced during that time that gun violence was a health crisis. That \nwas so many years ago. Unfortunately, with all of her expert writings, \nwe still couldn't get movement.\n  I am going to take a slightly different perspective. If I could just \ntake these few moments to give you an anecdotal story, which many of \nyou might find absolutely with a great deal of shock, if you will. That \nis the limit to which gun rights advocates mislead the American people \non any ideas for gun safety or gun regulation as taking guns away.\n  I was in a meeting where someone was trying to understand why \nPresident Obama in his excellent presentation about securing America \nand protecting our children from gun violence was being associated with \nthe idea of taking over 345 million guns. This is what is represented \nto be President Obama's message. He will confiscate, through his \nprocess of gun testing or making sure that there are background checks \nfor everyone, that he wants to confiscate 345 million guns, which has \nbeen determined to be located in 65 million places here in the United \nStates.\n  Can I, in a public forum on this august floor of the House, say that \nwe, as Members of Congress--and I think Republicans will admit this--\nhave no evidence, no documentation, that the White House intends to \nconfiscate guns--no manner of level of increased ATF officers could \never do that--why this mischaracterization is here.\n  But listen to this. Gun rights advocates have made a lot of claims \nover the years that the Second Amendment they interpret means that they \ncan buy any gun they want and take it pretty much anywhere. Well, \nbasically, that does exist, except for the basic constraint of \nbackground checks, which now the President has expanded to ensure that \nif you are in a gun show--this is a gun show loophole--and you are \nsitting next to the stall of a licensed gun person and you are in the \nbusiness of selling guns, why shouldn't you be either licensed or \nrequire, basically, background checks?\n  But listen to this. In an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay \nclaim to a newfangled Second Amendment right: the right not to have \nanyone talk to gun owners about their guns. Specifically, gun advocates \ndon't want doctors discussing guns or the potential harms that guns may \ncause with their patients.\n  While mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing to do with the \nright to keep or bear arms, the advocates contend that the Constitution \nis on their side. Last month, for the third time in the same suit, a \nFederal court of appeals agreed. This is very bizarre. The case is \nfiled under the name of Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of \nFlorida, although First and Second Amendment buffs may recognize it \nunder the cutesy nickname Docs v. Glocks.\n  It started when some gun owners and the National Rifle Association \ntold Florida legislators that their doctors were harassing them by \nasking about gun safety--by asking about gun safety. The legislators \nresponded by passing a law that bars healthcare workers from discussing \nor recording anything about their patients' gun ownership or safety \npractices that could be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing.\n  Twelve other States are thinking about it, and now we have the \nPrivacy of Firearm Owners Act. This is in the face of a number of \nhomicides in this country. Let me cite to my colleagues that America is \nthe number one country out of Western nations that has the highest \nnumber of cases of homicide by firearm per 100,000. The closest that \ncomes to them is 0.7 by Italy. Then Taiwan, Canada, and Spain, 0.2; \nGermany, 0.2.\n  All the news stories that we see on violent disruptions in various \nplaces and protests, their numbers of gun violence, of homicides, is \nminiscule: Australia, 0.1; UK, 0.1; France, 0.1; South Korea, 0.03; and \nfinally Japan, 0.01. If that doesn't get our attention, I don't know \nwhat does.\n  Then look at this map; 353 mass shootings in America in 2015. My \ncolleague can see, is this anything to be proud of? Mass shootings not \nby knives, not by throwing stones, but by guns. This is what America is \nto the world: a sea of red of mass shootings, so much so that you can't \neven see background in some of the parts of this Nation. Yet there are \nlaws that are being passed to stop health professionals from asking \nwhether you have guns that might, in fact, endanger your children or \nyourselves.\n  On average, more than 100,000 people in the United States are shot in \nmurders, assaults, and other crimes. More than 32,000 people die from \ngun violence, including 2,677 children under the age of 18. Gun \ndeaths, justified versus criminal: studies also found that for every 1 \njustified homicide in the United States involving a gun, guns were used \nin 44 criminal homicides. In all of our communities, we see young Black \nmen being felled by gun violence, young people in our communities being \nfelled by gun violence, or innocent storekeepers being felled by gun \nviolence, or in the instance of the Philadelphia police officer.\n\n  All of us respect the dangers of law enforcement, recognizing that we \ncan work together by building prepared and trained law enforcement \nofficers to avoid the violence with guns. But in the instance of this \nindividual, who point-blank shot at an officer with a gun, who has now \nbeen determined possibly to have heard voices, though he said he was \ninspired by ISIS, again, someone wanted to suggest that it wasn't \nanything that Obama could have done. It was a stolen police gun and it \nis out on the streets. Obviously, we don't have enough people enforcing \nagainst the trafficking of stolen guns.\n  Mass shootings. The U.S. has a far higher number of mass shootings \nthan any others I have indicated.\n  Mental health. Approximately one in four American adults have a \nmental illness. Every time we hear of these mass shootings, the defense \ncomes, which they have a right, to talk about this person's severe \ncriminal mental illness condition.\n  Guns in suicide is the leading cause of related deaths in America. \nMore than 60 percent of deaths by guns in the country are the result of \nindividuals using these weapons intending to commit suicide--not \nknives, not stones, not even poison or an overdose on drugs--guns. Guns \nand domestic violence provide a deadly outcome.\n  Law enforcement killed by guns: each year hundreds of law enforcement \nofficers lose their lives in gun violence having been shot to death \nwhile protecting their communities. Of course, we know that we have \nexperienced tragic incidences under the authority of law where people \nhave been killed, and the community is over the top in frustration.\n  Background checks save lives. The tragedy at Mother Emanuel is the \nindividual went to buy guns and the store owner said it is taking too \nlong.\n  I support President Obama's very astute and thoughtful approach. Out \nof that, I am very glad to have introduced two initiatives. One, H.R. \n4315, Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act, which is a \ncapture of President Obama's, along with Karen Bass. I urge my \ncolleagues to sign on to H.R. 4315, which authorizes $500 million for \nhealth treatment access and to assist in the reporting of relevant \ndisqualifying mental health information to the FBI background check \nsystem, NICS--not to violate the privacy, but to give more information \nto the database, because that certainly would be part of saving lives.\n  As I conclude, H.R. 4316, that I am pleased to have Congresswoman \nKelly join me in this, the Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act, \nauthorizes the hiring of 200 additional ATF agents, the very point of \nwhich my Republican friends are saying, but yet they are condemning \nwhat the President has offered.\n  I would say to my colleagues in closing, if we don't do this for any \nother reason, to take and codify the President's initiatives on NICS or \ndata collection, on research regarding safer guns, on background checks \nor closing the gun show loophole, if we don't do it, we should do it \nfor the children.\n\n[[Page H271]]\n\nFrom December 2012 to December 2013, at least 100 children were killed \nin unintentional shootings, almost two every week, 61 percent higher \nthan Federal data reflect. About two-thirds of these unintended deaths, \nat 65 percent, took place in the home or vehicle that belonged to the \nvictim's family, most often with the guns that were legally owned but \nnot secured.\n  I remind you of that Supreme Court challenge or that law in Florida \nwhere doctors can't secure information to protect the patients or the \nchildren of these families. More than two-thirds of these tragedies \ncould be avoided if gun owners stored their guns responsibly and \nprevented children from accessing them.\n  I have introduced legislation on gun storage--I call it safety and \nresponsibility--but yet, unfortunately, it is perceived as attacking \nthe Second Amendment.\n  My good friend from New York (Mr. Jeffries), let me thank you for \nyielding. Allow me to just leave us with the point that, as the \nCongressional Black Caucus stands on the floor, we need partners in \ndoing the right thing. I hope before the President leaves office, he \nwill have the opportunity to reasonably and rationally sign bills that \nwill save lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Congressional \nBlack Caucus, Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D-NY) and Congresswoman \nJoyce Beatty (D-OH) who are anchoring this Special Order on Ending Gun \nViolence in America.\n  Gun violence in America can no longer be swept under the rug, ignored \nor irrationally justified.\n  We are in a state of national crisis and it is time to act.\n  Upon taking office, every Member of Congress makes a solemn pledge: \nto protect and defend the American people.\n  This is the most important oath we take as elected officials--and, to \nhonor this promise, we must do everything in our power to stem gun \nviolence in our nation.\n  Yet, after another mass shooting and countless acts of gun violence \nin communities across our country every day, House Republicans are \nstill unwilling to act to stop gun violence and save lives in American \ncommunities.\n  The Democrats have been calling for an immediate vote on the \nbipartisan King-Thompson Public Safety and Second Amendment Rights \nProtection Act to strengthen the life-saving background checks that \nkeep guns out of the wrong hands.\n  This Congress has a moral obligation to do our part to end the gun \nviolence epidemic.\n  Now is the time for Republicans to join Democrats in protecting the \nlives of Americans by taking common sense steps to save lives.\n  The Administration has announced two new executive actions that will \nhelp strengthen the federal background check system and keep guns out \nof the wrong hands.\n  I have introduced two bills that will hopefully enhance these \nexecutive actions and support the President's recently announced action \non gun violence.\n  H.R. 4315--Mental Health Access and Gun Violence Prevention Act--\nauthorizes $500 million for mental health treatment access and to \nassist in the reporting of relevant disqualifying mental health \ninformation to the FBI's background check system NICS.\n  H.R. 4316--Gun Violence Reduction Resources Act--authorizes the \nhiring of 200 additional ATF agents and investigators for enforcement \nof existing gun laws. The President included these specific requests in \nyesterday's announcements and these bills respond to those requests.\n  Additionally, the Department of justice (DOJ) is proposing a \nregulation to clarify who is prohibited from possessing a firearm under \nfederal law for reasons related to mental health.\n  And the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) is issuing a \nproposed regulation to address barriers preventing states from \nsubmitting limited information on those persons to the federal \nbackground check system.\n  Ending gun violence in America requires a comprehensive approach--we \nmust come together and work towards this common goal.\n  Too many Americans have been severely injured or lost their lives as \na result of gun violence.\n  While the vast majority of Americans who experience a mental illness \nare not violent.\n  However, in some cases when persons with a mental illness does not \nreceive the treatment they need, the result can be tragedies such as \nhomicide or suicide.\n  We must continue to address mental health issues by:\n  Supporting expanded coverage of mental health services and enhanced \ntraining and hiring of mental health professionals; and\n  Continuing the national conversation on mental health to reduce \nstigma associated with having a mental illness and getting help; and\n  We must also continue to do everything we can to making sure that \nanyone who may pose a danger to themselves or others does not have \naccess to a gun.\n  The federal background check system is one of the most effective ways \nof assuring that such individuals are not able to purchase a firearm \nfrom a licensed gun dealer.\n  To date, background checks have prevented over two million guns from \nfalling into the wrong hands.\n  The Administration's two new executive actions will help ensure that \nbetter and more reliable information makes its way into the background \ncheck system.\n  The Administration, however, has acknowledged the need for collective \naction and continues to call upon Members of Congress to pass common-\nsense gun safety legislation and to expand funding to increase access \nto mental health services.\n  I too call upon my colleagues to come together and pass legislation \nthat will help stop the loss of innocent lives.\n  While we have made some progress in strengthening the National \nInstant Criminal Background Check System (NICS), which is used to run \nbackground checks on those who buy guns from federally licensed gun \ndealers to make sure they are not prohibited by law from owning a \nfirearm, we must do more.\n  I am a strong supporter of a right of privacy and I am particularly \nsensitive and protective of patient privacy rights.\n  I support the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act \nthat was passed by Congress in 1996, and includes privacy protection \nfor medical records, which includes mental healthcare information.\n  However, there are specific areas under federal law that allow the \ndisclosure of medical information to authorities, and in these \ninstances there should be an agreement that when a person poses a \nthreat to themselves or others (as determined by a court or \nadjudicative authority with the medical and legal knowledge and \nauthority to make a determination that a person poses a threat to \nthemselves or to others) should not be allowed to purchase a fire arm.\n  Technology that could be deployed to access court records and arrest \nrecords as they relate to mental health and violent behavior should not \nrely upon a list that may become out dated or could be used in ways \nthat are not consistent with the intent of enhancing gun safety.\n  The ability to access information that is accurate and available for \nthe limited purpose of affirming or rejecting a request to purchase a \nfirearm without indicating the source of the decision or the reason for \nthe rejection would still protect privacy rights while also protecting \nthe public.\n  The president's proposal on mental health and gun violence is to \nenforce the laws already in place.\n  Under a federal law enacted in 1968, an individual is prohibited from \nbuying or possessing firearms for life if he/she has been ``adjudicated \nas a mental defective'' or ``committed to a mental institution.''\n  A person is ``adjudicated as a mental defective'' if a court--or \nother entity having legal authority to make adjudications--has made a \ndetermination that an individual, as a result of mental illness: 1) Is \na danger to himself or to others; 2) Lacks the mental capacity to \ncontract or manage his own affairs; 3) Is found insane by a court in a \ncriminal case, or incompetent to stand trial, or not guilty by reason \nof lack of mental responsibility pursuant to the Uniform Code of \nMilitary Justice.\n  A person is ``committed to a mental institution'' if that person has \nbeen involuntarily committed to a mental institution by a court or \nother lawful authority. This expressly excludes voluntary commitment.\n  It should be noted, however, that federal law currently allows states \nto establish procedures for mentally ill individuals to restore their \nright to possess and purchase firearms (many states have done so at the \nbehest of the National Rifle Association, with questionable results).\n  It is undoubtedly true that people who are a danger to self and/or \nothers because of mental illness should be prohibited from owning \nfirearms.\n  It is less clear, however, how to tailor new policies to better \nprotect the American public while at the same time avoiding the \nstigmatization of Americans with mental illness.\n  Any strategy to address the lethal intersection between guns and \nmental illness should focus on the key facts:\n  On average, more than 100,000 people in America are shot in murders, \nassaults, and other crimes.\n  More than 32,000 people die from gun violence annually, including \n2,677 children under the age of eighteen years old.\n  Suicide is the leading cause of gun related deaths in America.\n  60 percent of deaths by guns in America are the result of individuals \nusing these weapons as a means to commit suicide.\n\n[[Page H272]]\n\n  Some of these deaths might have been prevented if there were adequate \nbackground checks.\n  Each year hundreds of law enforcement officers lose their lives to \ngun violence been shot to death protecting their communities.\n  Millions of guns are sold every year in ``no questions asked'' \ntransactions and experts estimate that 40 percent of guns now sold in \nAmerica are done so without a background check.\n  National Instant Criminal Background Check System (NICS) was created \nin 1998 to require potential gun buyers to pass an instant screening at \nthe point of purchase.\n  Ensures that purchasers are not felons, domestic abusers, mentally \nill, etc.\n  NICS has blocked sales to more than 2 million prohibited people.\n  NICS stops 170 felons and 53 domestic abusers from purchasing guns \nevery day.\n  The most serious issue facing NICS is the ``private sale loophole''.\n  This allows anyone who is not a federally-licensed dealer to sell \nguns without a background check.\n  An estimated 40% of gun transfers--6.6 million transfers--are \nconducted without a background check.\n  Armslist.com is the largest online seller of firearms.\n  66,000 gun ads are posted by private sellers on a given day, 750,000 \nper year.\n  Nearly 1/3rd of gun ads on Armslist.com are posted by high-volume \nunlicensed sellers (approx. 4,218 people).\n  High-volume sellers posted 29% of the gun ads.\n  High-volume sellers posted 36,069 gun ads over 2 months.\n  This would equate to around 243,800 guns each year by unlicensed \nsellers.\n  50% were familiar with federal laws but decided they didn't apply to \nthem.\n  1/3rd of ``want-to-buy'' ads are posted by people with a criminal \nrecord.\n  More than 4 times the rate at which prohibited gun buyers try to buy \nguns in stores.\n  Approximately 25,000 guns are in illegal hands.\n\n                       [From Slate, Jan. 8, 2016]\n\n         The Absurd Logic Behind Florida's Docs vs. Glocks Law\n\n\n            The Second Amendment trumps all other amendments\n\n                  (By Dahlia Lithwick and Sonja West)\n\n       Gun-rights advocates have made a lot of claims over the \n     years about the broad scope of their constitutional rights. \n     They say, in effect, that the Second Amendment means they can \n     buy virtually any gun they want and take it pretty much \n     anywhere. But in an ongoing legal battle in Florida, they lay \n     claim to a newfangled Second Amendment right--the right not \n     to have anyone talk to gun owners about their guns. \n     Specifically, gun advocates don't want doctors discussing \n     guns, or the potential harms those guns may cause, with their \n     patients.\n       And while mere talk about guns might seem to have nothing \n     to do with the right to keep or bear arms, the advocates \n     contend that the Constitution is on their side. Last month, \n     for the third time in the same suit, a federal court of \n     appeals agreed.\n       This very bizarre case is filed under the name of \n     Wollschlaeger v. Governor of the State of Florida, although \n     First and Second amendment buffs may recognize it under the \n     cutesy nickname Docs vs. Glocks. It started when some gun \n     owners (and the National Rifle Association) told Florida \n     legislators that their doctors were harassing them by asking \n     about gun safety.\n       The legislators responded by passing a law that bars health \n     care workers from discussing or recording anything about \n     their patients' gun ownership or safety practices that could \n     be deemed in bad faith, irrelevant, or harassing. (Twelve \n     other states have considered enacting similar legislation, \n     but only Florida has actually passed such a law.)\n       The result was the Firearms Owners' Privacy Act. The law \n     provides that licensed health care practitioners and \n     facilities: ``may not intentionally enter'' information \n     concerning a patient's ownership of firearms into the \n     patient's medical record that the practitioner knows is ``not \n     relevant to the patient's medical care or safety, or the \n     safety of others,'' and ``shall respect a patient's right to \n     privacy and should refrain'' from inquiring as to whether a \n     patient or their family owns firearms, unless the \n     practitioner or facility believes in good faith that the \n     ``information is relevant to the patient's medical care or \n     safety, or the safety of others.'' Violations of the act \n     could lead to disciplinary action including fines and \n     suspension, or revocation of a medical license. Proponents of \n     such laws say these doctor-patient dialogues violate the \n     patients' Second Amendment rights.\n\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman for the \ntremendous work you continue to do on the Judiciary Committee. I look \nforward to partnering with you.\n  As you point out, the Second Amendment protects the right to bear \narms. It should not protect the ability of others to utilize weapons, \noften of mass destruction, in doing harm to Americans without a license \nor any legal bases for doing so. All we want is rational gun safety and \ngun violence prevention. I look forward to continuing to work with you \nin that regard.\n  It is now my honor and privilege to yield to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Kelly), one of my classmates. She has been a tremendous \nand forceful advocate for gun violence prevention measures, not only as \nthe chair of the CBC Health Braintrust, for which she has been tireless \non so many different issues, but also in her capacity within the House \nDemocratic Caucus, as well as a chair of the CBC Gun Violence \nPrevention Task Force, someone who stood up countless times for the \nchildren in Chicago and the many others who have been dealing with \nunacceptable levels of gun violence.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. I thank my good friends, the gentleman from \nNew York (Mr. Jeffries) and the gentlewoman from Ohio (Mrs. Beatty) for \nthis important Special Order hour tonight.\n  Congressman Jeffries, you have chaired these Special Order hours for \nthe Congressional Black Caucus in my first term, so it is good to see \nyou back in the driver's seat with our classmate, Representative \nBeatty.\n  Last year, I had the privilege of leading the Special Order hour with \nour colleague, the Honorable Donald Payne of New Jersey. In the course \nof that year, we came to this floor to reflect on gun violence on one \ntoo many occasions because it is an epidemic in communities across the \ncountry.\n  In fact, we are 11 days into 2016, and there have already been 80 \nshootings in my hometown of Chicago. Four people were shot and killed \nin less than 24 hours.\n  I applaud President Obama's bold executive action that has been \ntalked about tonight. I believe these policies will keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals and dangerous individuals.\n  If you listen to some, they will say they are trying to take our \nguns. There is nothing in the executive action that says that. The \nopposition is pushing fear, not fact.\n  With over 30 Americans killed by guns every single day inaction is \nnot an option.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  In my nearly 3 years in Congress, the majority party has refused to \ndo anything on gun violence--not one hearing, not a single vote. To \nright what Congress has, unfortunately, made wrong, President Obama did \nwhat was necessary to address the threat to our long-term national \nsecurity and economic stability. While we can't stop every criminal \nfrom committing every crime, we can take actions that will save lives.\n  While President Obama's executive actions are crucial steps in \nreducing the senseless gun violence that is plaguing our Nation, they \ndo not absolve Congress of its moral responsibility to act. There are \ngaps in existing gun laws that leave us all vulnerable to gun violence. \nThese holes are ones that only Congress can plug.\n  I have two commonsense bills that will complement President Obama's \nexecutive actions and that will help bring a reduction in firearm \nmortality.\n  The first bill, H.R. 224, the Recognizing Gun Violence as a Public \nHealth Emergency Act, would require the Surgeon General to submit an \nannual report to Congress on the public health impact of gun violence. \nThe bill currently has 135 cosponsors, and I hope that this commonsense \nproposal can get an up-or-down vote this year.\n  Also, I recently introduced H.R. 225, the Firearm Safety Act, which \nwould close the loophole which prevents the Consumer Product Safety \nCommission from creating rules regarding the safety of firearms.\n  Quite simply, if the Consumer Product Safety Commission can regulate \nteddy bears, bicycle helmets, and car seats, it should be able to \nregulate firearms. Simply improving safety lock quality and improving \nstorage safety will reduce accidents, misfires, and will prevent theft, \nsaving thousands of lives.\n  Senseless gun violence has been plaguing our Nation for far too long. \nIt is simply unacceptable in the United States of America that gun \nviolence is the leading cause of death for people under 24. It is time \nfor us to come together to end the gun violence that is\n\n[[Page H273]]\n\ntaking a generation of young Americans.\n  I often ask: Just how many and just who has to die before we take \naction?\n  I urge my colleagues to attend a funeral to see and to feel the hurt \nand loss. Your standing for moments of silence and then your sitting in \nsilence does nothing to deal with this issue. Let's stop the hypocrisy \nand take action and save lives.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank the distinguished gentlewoman, my good friend \nfrom Illinois, for the very powerful presentation and for her steadfast \nleadership.\n  Madam Speaker, one of the reasons we believe that Members of Congress \nneed to act is that State laws are so inconsistent from one \njurisdiction to the other.\n  In New York, we experience gun violence in certain communities at \nunprecedented levels notwithstanding the fact that we have tremendously \nsignificant and robust gun violence prevention measures in place.\n  But the overwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in the \nBrooklyn communities, represented by me and Yvette Clarke, actually \ncome from the neighboring States of Pennsylvania as well as up the I-95 \ncorridor from States in the Deep South.\n  Chicago, as Robin Kelly has indicated, has been experiencing \nunprecedented levels of gun violence. Illinois actually has pretty \nrobust gun safety-gun violence prevention laws on the books, but the \noverwhelming majority of guns used to commit crimes in Chicago come \nfrom the neighboring States of Indiana and Wisconsin, which have lax \nlaws.\n  Out in south central Los Angeles, the situation has gotten better \nover the last decade or so. California has pretty strong gun safety-gun \nviolence prevention laws. The overwhelming majority of guns used to \ncommit crimes in south central Los Angeles and in east LA actually come \nfrom the neighboring State of Arizona. That is why we need Congress to \nact in order to deal with what is a national problem.\n  Madam Speaker, it is now my great honor and privilege to yield to my \ngood friend and colleague, my sister from the neighboring congressional \ndistrict of mine and who has been such a forceful advocate on behalf of \nthe communities that she represents in Brooklyn, the distinguished \ngentlewoman from the Ninth Congressional District of New York, \nCongresswoman Yvette Clarke.\n  Ms. CLARKE of New York. Let me first start by thanking my brother \nfrom the neighboring district in Brooklyn, New York (Mr. Jeffries), \nalongside my sister from Ohio, Mrs. Joyce Beatty, for their leadership \nin our Congressional Black Caucus Special Order hour, discussing gun \nviolence and gun safety measures.\n  Let me also commend the Honorable Robin Kelly of Illinois for her \nleadership in doing the work that she is doing not only with our Health \nBraintrust, but by being an outspoken and forceful advocate for the end \nto gun violence not only for her district in Chicago, Illinois, but for \nall communities across this Nation.\n  Madam Speaker, gun violence in the United States has reached epic \nproportions in the 21st century. The death, the trauma, the devastation \nthat we are witnessing can no longer be tolerated. Congress must act \nnow.\n  Over the past decade in America, more than 100,000 people have been \nkilled as a result of gun violence and millions more have been maimed \nby the reckless and unlawful discharging of firearms.\n  I applaud President Barack Obama for taking this historic executive \naction to address gun violence in our Nation. These actions will save \nlives and will make America a safer place. The President's actions will \nstrengthen lifesaving background checks, improve mental health \nservices, and expand smart gun technology.\n  We have all that we need in the United States to observe the Second \nAmendment rights of Americans and, at the same time, to take our Nation \ninto the 21st century with responsible gun ownership that leaves little \nroom for the illegal gun activity that we see taking place in terms of \ngun trafficking, in terms of the use of deadly arms in the hands of \nthose who are unlicensed to hold them.\n  As it relates to background checks, the proposals focus on new \nbackground check requirements that will enhance the effectiveness of \nthe National Instant Criminal Background Check System, the NICS, and \nthe greater education and enforcement efforts of existing laws at the \nState level.\n  Specifically, it directs the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives to require any business that engages in the sale of guns to \nobtain a Federal license to do so and to conduct background checks.\n  It calls for the increased funding for the ATF in the hiring of 200 \nnew ATF agents and investigators to help enforce existing gun laws, and \nit requires the ATF to issue a rule requiring background checks for the \npurchasers who purchase certain dangerous firearms and other items \nthrough a trust, a corporation, or other legal entity. It encourages \ngreater communication between Federal and State authorities on criminal \nhistory information.\n  What could be wrong with that? That is within the boundary of our \nlaws, within our constitutional rights, and it makes our Nation safer.\n  I come to this floor today as one who considers herself to be a \nvictim of gun violence. We need to confront this right away because, \nfor many in our communities, it is not only those who have been \nphysically harmed by gun violence, but those who have been traumatized \nby being a witness to gun violence.\n  I had the unfortunate privilege, if you will, of being in the Council \nChambers of the New York City's City Council when my colleague, the \nHonorable James E. Davis, was gunned down before all of his \ncolleagues--workplace domestic terrorism.\n  That incident has been with me from that day forward. To this day, at \na moment's notice, I can recall the trauma of that day, what it meant \nto see my colleague's life taken from him and to hear the gunplay that \ntook place in the New York City Council's chambers.\n  I am not alone. There are millions of Americans who are witnesses to \ngun violence or who may have been maimed by gun violence and who did \nnot necessarily die as a result of it, but whose lives have been \nchanged dramatically.\n  We should not have another generation of Americans who can speak to \nthe unspeakable horror of what it is to either be impacted directly in \nthe loss of a loved one or to be the families who have to recount the \ntimes when they have had to be at the hospital with someone who is \ntrying to recover from being gunned down.\n  It is our obligation, our responsibility, as lawmakers for this \nNation to get this right for future generations.\n  So I applaud President Obama for doing what he could do within the \nparameters of his authority. It is now time for the United States House \nto do its job.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I thank my good friend and colleague for a very \npowerful presentation and for pointing out the sensibility of \nsupporting all of the President's efforts, but particularly as they \nrelate to the ATF, which is the Federal agency charged with enforcing \nour Nation's gun laws.\n  Two hundred additional agents is the bare minimum that we can hire to \nmake sure that the ATF has the manpower and resources necessary to \nprevent the illegal trafficking of guns into places like the \nBrownsville and East Flatbush neighborhoods that Congresswoman Yvette \nClarke so passionately represents.\n  If you block funding for the ATF, what you essentially are doing is \nsupporting the efforts of the merchants of death who rely on \nunderenforcement by the ATF, because of an absence of resources, in \norder to flood communities like Chicago; south central Los Angeles; \nparts of Brooklyn; Newark, New Jersey; and many other neighborhoods \nwith illegal weapons.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield to my good friend and colleague, Congressman \nDonald Payne. I thank him as well as R. Kelly. D. Payne and R. Kelly \nmade a fantastic combination. We thank them for their distinguished \nservice last year in leading the CBC Special Order hour.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey.\n  Mr. PAYNE. Let me thank the gentleman from New York, who passed the \nbaton to R. Kelly and me in 2015. We have rounded the corner and have \nput it back in his capable hands, along with our classmate's, the \nhonorable\n\n[[Page H274]]\n\ngentlewoman from the great State of Ohio, Joyce Beatty, who is \ndemonstrating day in and day out why she was such a great leader in the \nOhio legislature. She has brought those talents to bear on the entire \nNation.\n  Madam Speaker, these are very serious times. I want to start out by \ncommending the President of the United States, President Obama, in the \nface of insurmountable odds, for not being hampered in wanting to do \nsomething with this terrible, terrible scourge that we suffer from in \nthis Nation.\n  Gun violence impacts many different communities in this Nation, some \nmore than others, but it impacts us all. I was proud to see the \nPresident step forward and not be hampered in doing something. If the \nobstructionists on the other side of the aisle want to continue in that \nmanner, then let them be, but he was going to do something.\n  I also commend my colleagues in the Congressional Black Caucus for \nuniting with the President in this great effort.\n  We understand in our communities what this means. We are trying to \narticulate it to the American people, but we understand it. We live it. \nWe feel it. We see it.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  The President's executive actions on gun control are a step in the \nright direction, but it is the responsibility of Congress to pass gun \nreform that makes our communities safer.\n  I have joined, along with Robin Kelly, who mentioned two pieces of \nher legislation in terms of gun control--after Sandy Hook several years \nago, I proposed a piece of legislation that did not really see the \nlight of day. Since the President has not given up on this effort, I \nwill not either.\n  I have a piece of legislation, which is called the Safer \nNeighborhoods Gun Buyback Act. It would keep guns out of the hands of \nthe wrong people by creating a voluntary Federal gun buyback program. \nUnder my bill, State and local governments, as well as gun dealers, \nwould distribute smart, prepaid debit cards to gun owners in exchange \nfor their firearms.\n  My bill incentivizes gun owners to voluntarily get guns off the \nstreets. This will make our communities safer for our children, family, \nand our businesses. Commonsense proposals like my bill are critical to \nending our Nation's epidemic of gun violence. This epidemic impacts \nevery community in America, including in my district.\n  Last year in the city of Newark shootings increased 19 percent from \n2014 and homicides rose by 8 percent. In 2015, there were at least 76 \ngun deaths in my district. One-third of all of the gun deaths in New \nJersey last year happened in my district.\n  Gun violence has had a disproportionate impact within the African \nAmerican community and other urban areas. That is clear when you look \nat what is happening in my district and throughout other African \nAmerican communities in New Jersey.\n  We need a Federal approach to gun violence because it is a problem \nacross State lines. Case in point, New Jersey is a net importer of \ncrime guns. In other words, more illegal weapons confiscated by law \nenforcement came from out of the State than there were purchased from \nin the State.\n  Reducing gun violence is vital to the safety and security of American \ncommunities. My colleagues on the Republican side of the aisle should \ndrop the politics and pandering. They should instead join with \nDemocrats in supporting the President and his commonsense reforms and, \nlike my gun buyback program, to address gun tragedies in all \ncommunities.\n  Let me just say, Madam Speaker, no one wants to take guns away from \nanyone. We understand the laws and liberties that have made this Nation \ngreat. If we don't do something in reference to gun control, then it is \nshame on us.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. I yield to the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. \nPlaskett), a dynamic new Member of the House.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of our \nPresident's actions toward making our communities safer by ensuring \nguns are less likely to end up in the hands of people that shouldn't \nhave them.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Jeffries and Congresswoman \nBeatty, for bringing this hour here in Congress. I am thankful for the \nCongressional Black Caucus' Special Order hour for taking time to \neducate the American people of the importance of our President's \naction.\n  While this Congress and, in particular, our Republican colleagues \nhave hemmed and dithered and engaged in political inertia and, at the \nend, failed to act in this matter, suspected terrorists are free to \nlegally purchase combat-style weapons. American cities and other areas \nof this country are besieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are \ncut short.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as \nmany deaths in young people as cancer, 5 times as many as heart \ndisease, and 15 times as many as infections. Yet, we afford no funding \nfor research and empirical data collection, while at the same time we \nspend hundreds of millions researching and mitigating the effects of \nthose other maladies.\n  Every day this Congress fails to act more American families mourn, \nmore American lives are cut short, many in their prime, and more \nAmerican cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics.\n  Even in America's paradise, my home district of the United States \nVirgin Islands, this is so. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the \nU.S. Virgin Islands. On a per capita basis, that homicide rate is more \nthan double that of the city of Chicago.\n  Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles, and in other \nplaces, along with the United States Virgin Islands, sadly are a near \ndaily occurrence. While we pause for moments of silence after mass \nshootings like the ones in Newtown or San Bernardino, the thousands of \nvictims of mass shootings that play out daily in cities like New York \nCity and the U.S. Virgin Islands go largely unnoticed and unrecognized.\n  While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know \nthat communities like our own and the many other minority communities \nacross this country, there needs to be more comprehensive action to \naddress the underlying issues that are at the root of gun violence.\n  I want to ask that this Congress act on these things. This Congress \nhas in its power the ability to save thousands of lives. Let us not \nallow the nearly daily occurrence of mass shootings to become the new \nnorm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation in this \nCongress this year.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise today in support of the President's action \ntoward making our communities safer by ensuring guns are less likely to \nend up in the hands of people who shouldn't have them.\n  While this Congress fails to act on this matter, suspected terrorists \nare free to legally purchase combat-style weapons, American cities are \nbesieged by gun crime and thousands of lives are cut short.\n  According to the American Academy of Pediatrics, guns cause twice as \nmany deaths in young people as cancer, five times as many as heart \ndisease and 15 times as many as infections.\n  Yet we afford no funding for research and empirical data collection, \nwhile at the same time we spend hundreds-of-millions researching and \nmitigating the affects of those maladies.\n  Every day this Congress fails to act, more American families mourn: \nmore American lives are cut short--many in their prime--and more \nAmerican cities continue to mount homicide and shooting statistics.\n  Even in America's paradise: my home district of the U.S. Virgin \nIslands. In 2015, there were 40 homicides in the U.S. Virgin Islands. \nThat's a per capita homicide rate more than double that of the city of \nChicago.\n  Gun violence in cities like Chicago, Los Angeles and the U.S. Virgin \nIslands, sadly, are a near daily occurrence. And while we pause for \nmoments of silence after mass shootings like the one in New Town or San \nBernadino, the thousands of victims of mass shootings that play out \ndaily in cities like New York City and the U.S. Virgin Islands go \nlargely unnoticed and unrecognized.\n  There were 353 mass shootings in this country in 2015--three of which \noccurred in my home district of the U.S. Virgin Islands. One occurred \non a crowded boardwalk on a beautiful day in May.\n  The second mass shooting took place in a housing community, where \nchildren played just after 5 p.m. one afternoon this past September.\n  The third took place on a busy highway two days after Thanksgiving.\n  A mass shooting occurs just about everyday in this country, yet there \nare no moments of silence or thoughts and prayers extended to many of \nthe victims.\n\n[[Page H275]]\n\n  While the President's actions will undoubtedly save lives, we know \nthat in communities like the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the many other \nminority communities across this country, there needs to be more \ncomprehensive action to address the underlying issues that are at the \nroot of gun violence.\n  The citizens living in these communities experience inexcusable \nlevels of poverty. In the U.S. Virgin Islands, more than 30 percent of \nchildren are living below the poverty level and in Chicago, most of the \nSouth and West sides have 40 to 60 percent of residents living below \nthe poverty level.\n  If we are serious about making our communities safer and reducing gun \ncrime, we must take comprehensive action to not only reduce the \nlikelihood of mass shootings like San Bernadino or New Town, but also \naddress the systemic divestment of resources, education, support in \ncommunities of color across this country that lead the scourge of gun \nviolence that play out on our inner-city streets everyday.\n  In addition to The President's action, this congress needs to make it \na priority to make adequate investments in early childhood education \nand other programs aimed at lifting children out of poverty.\n  Additionally, making meaningful reforms to our criminal justice \nsystem and increasing resources to reduce the flow of drugs and illegal \nguns through our ports will help fight back the firearm black market.\n  This is not about the second amendment: an overwhelming number of \nAmericans--most gun owners themselves--agree, that we must do something \nto stop guns from getting into the hands of people who shouldn't have \nthem.\n  This Congress has in its power, the ability to save thousands of \nlives. Let us not allow the near daily occurrence of mass shootings to \nbecome the new norm. We must act to pass comprehensive gun legislation.\n  Mr. JEFFRIES. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Madam Speaker, last week, \nPresident Obama announced a series of executive actions aimed at \nreducing gun violence across the United States. President Obama laid \nout these much-needed steps in the face of Congressional inaction, \nwhich will help to reduce the senseless gun violence that affects \ncountless communities across our nation.\n  In 2014, firearms claimed the lives of more than 33,000 Americans. \nOver 2,800 of those fatalities took place in my home state of Texas. \nPerhaps there will be a time when we no longer will have to read \nheadlines about mass murders in our schools or movie theaters. But \nuntil then, our nation must take concerted steps to strengthen \nbackground checks, improve mental health services, and keep firearms \nout of the hands of criminals and the mentally ill. This is what \nPresident Obama has sought to achieve and I truly believe that this can \nbe done without infringing on law-abiding citizens' right to bear arms.\n  There have been numerous critics of President Obama's executive \nactions to reduce gun violence. However, we can no longer stand by as \ngun violence claims the lives of more innocent Americans. The President \nis limited in what he can achieve through executive actions alone. That \nis why Congress has the responsibility to pass comprehensive gun safety \nlegislation now and put our nation on the path to preventing such \nviolence from happening again.\n  Mr. Speaker, gun violence affects individuals of all backgrounds in \ncommunities all across the United States. It is not a Democratic issue \nnor is it a Republican issue. It is an issue that affects every \nAmerican in one form or another. Successfully reducing gun violence in \nthis country will take more than just legislative action from Congress. \nIt will take the collective effort of every American to change the \ncourse of our history and end gun violence in America once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H275-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H275-H276]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RADICAL ISLAMISTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for half the time remaining before 10 p.m.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, we have now learned that the \nadministration is releasing or has released Muhammad al-Rahman al-\nShamrani, a 40-year-old citizen of Saudi Arabia. He was transferred to \nSaudi Arabia on January 11, 2016.\n  Apparently, The New York Times had gotten ahold of documents \nregarding--and this is from an October 2008 recommendation for the \ncontinued detention under the Department of Defense control for \nGuantanamo detainee, and then it gives the long number--it is Muhammad \nal-Rahman al-Shamrani.\n  If you read what purports to be secret--I don't know how The New York \nTimes got it--but you read over in his file that this Guantanamo \ndetainee--that would be Mr. Shamrani--on 14 October 2007 stated: ``When \nI get out of here, I will go to Iraq and Afghanistan and will kill as \nmany Americans as I can. Then I will come here and kill more \nAmericans.''\n  He also stated: ``I love Osama bin Laden and Mullah Omar, and if I \never get out of Guantanamo, I will go back to fight the Americans and \nkill as many as I can.''\n  The detainee stated he hated all Americans and will seek revenge if \never released from Guantanamo. The detainee said that, if he is \nreleased, he would again participate in jihad against the enemies of \nMuslims, to include the United States. The detainee is proud of what he \nhas done, and he is willing to do anything to fight against the enemies \nof Muslims. The detainee stated he decided to become more religious \nbecause of his dislike of the U.S. and its citizens.\n  So for those who have been confused about the rules of civilized \nwarfare, there is nothing illegal, unconstitutional against the Geneva \nConvention for holding people who are part of a group who are at war \nwith your country until the group they are a part of announces they are \nno longer at war with you.\n  Now, war was declared, as some of my Muslim leader friends in the \nMiddle East and Africa tell me. It is obvious to the rest of the world \nthat radical Islam declared war on the United States back in '79 after \nPresident Carter laid the foundation to allow what he called a man of \npeace to come in and take over ruling Iran. His name was Khomeini. It \nwas after that that our American Embassy was attacked and over 50 \npeople taken hostages, Americans. Basically, we did nothing about it.\n  So I know the President likes to say that Guantanamo is used as a \nrecruiting tool, but the fact is, oh, basically, if we get rid of \nGuantanamo, then that pretty much eliminates anger at America.\n  The fact is that while President Clinton was sending American \nmilitary to protect Muslims who were being unfairly treated, there were \nnot only attacks against Americans. There was planning going on, not \nonly to attack the USS Cole, but to attack America, our facilities, our \nembassies, our buildings, and they were planning 9/11. There were no \ndetainees at Guantanamo.\n  Yet, all of this plotting and planning--and from my discussions with \npeople in the Middle East when I have been over there, with people who \nare from Iran, Iraq, Syria, Lebanon, when I have been in those \ncountries--I haven't been into Syria, but I have been right there at \nits border--but they all say the same thing. What they use to recruit \nis in 1979 we were attacked by radical Islamists. We did nothing under \nPresident Carter.\n  In '83, we were attacked and around 300 marines were killed in \nBeirut. Congress, under Democratic control, said we are getting our \npeople out. So President Reagan ordered the evacuation from Beirut. \nInstead of fighting back, we ran home. I understand that Reagan felt \nthat was one of the big mistakes of his Presidency.\n  So the attacks have been ongoing. The World Trade Center attack in \n1993, the attack on the Khobar Towers, so many attacks under President \nClinton. He sent a lot of tow missiles, blew up some tents. It seems \nmaybe like there was an aspirin factory.\n  It was not Guantanamo that was the driving force in all of those \nyears, decades of war against the United States. It didn't exist. The \nelimination of Guantanamo will not end the animosity and the desire of \nradical Islamists to eliminate America from the map along with Israel.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  And just to be clear, today the story from Susannah George, ``Islamic \nState Claims Responsibility for Baghdad Mall Attack,'' they are still \nat war. Whether they are JV or not, they are killing people.\n  Adam Kredo from the Free Beacon reports today, ``Obama Administration \nStonewalling Investigation into 113 Terrorists Inside United States'':\n  ``Senators Ted Cruz and Jeff Sessions disclosed Monday that they had \nbeen pressuring the Obama administration for months to disclose the \nimmigration\n\n[[Page H276]]\n\nhistories of these foreign-born individuals implicated in terror \nplots.''\n  Senators Cruz and Sessions wrote to the Secretaries of State and \nHomeland Security and the Attorney General: ``The American people are \nentitled to information on the immigration history of terrorists \nseeking to harm them.'' They note that we already knew 14 of the people \nthat were brought over as refugees turned out to be terrorists, foreign \nterrorists, radical Islamists, but they were given legal entrance as \nrefugees.\n  We have a right to know how many of those 113 that have now been \narrested for terrorism were foreign born, how many of them came in as \nrefugees. These are all important.\n  Then we see the story from yesterday by Jonah Bennett that almost \nhalf of California driver's licenses went to illegal immigrants in \n2015. Wow. Under the REAL ID Act, that means nobody from California \nshould be able to use their driver's licenses to get on airplanes to \ntravel in interstate commerce or foreign travel.\n  And then the story from Philadelphia, January 8, absolutely tragic. A \nman walks up shooting police. A discussion today that there may be \nother people that were involved. The gunman said he shot the \nPhiladelphia officer for the Islamic State. The police have said that. \nHowever, despite the fact that this radical Islamic terrorist has said \nhe shot the police officer repeatedly in an ambush for Allah and for \nthe Islamic State, here is the headline from a story by Dave Boyer from \ntoday: ``Obama Administration Wondering whether Shooting of Philly Cop \nWas Terrorist Act,'' because they don't take the radical Islamist \nterrorist who shot the policeman for Allah and for the Islamic State. \nPerhaps they think he is confused. He doesn't sound confused. He sounds \nlike he knew exactly what he was doing when he walked up and ambushed, \ntrying to kill by repeatedly shooting a Philadelphia policeman.\n  The story of January 8 from Jay Solomon in The Wall Street Journal, \n``Nuclear Deal Fuels Iran's Hard-Liners,'' and it makes clear, as it \nsays down here: ``As much as $100 billion in frozen revenues are \nexpected to return to Iran after sanctions are lifted, which U.S. \nofficials said could happen in coming weeks. The White House hoped the \ncash windfall would aid Mr. Rouhani's political fortunes.''\n  Madam Speaker, mark my words. If that $100 billion to $150 billion is \nprovided by this administration here in the United States of America to \nIran, to its current radical Islamic leaders who hate the United \nStates, who have not signed the deal that President Obama is so proud \nof--and they have breached it repeatedly already, we know--that money, \nsome of that money will be used to finance the killing of Americans and \nIsraelis.\n  Now, back when I was a judge--years and years ago, a prosecutor--we \nwould say, if you fund somebody who says they are going to use some of \nthat money, as Iran has, to fund Hamas and Hezbollah, which we know are \nterrorist organizations, been named as such, and you know they are \nterrorist organizations, you know the money you are providing is going \nto, in turn, be provided to terrorist organizations.\n  See, back when I was a prosecutor or judge, we would say: You know \nwhat? If you are knowingly providing money to someone who has already \nsaid they are going to give it to terrorists who are going to kill \npeople, well, it sounds like there is a case to be made for you being \nas guilty as they are. Certainly, it goes beyond the pale of gross \nnegligence, but that is hypothetically speaking.\n  I am not a prosecutor. I am not a judge. I am not a chief justice \nanymore. But when is the sanity going to return when people who say \nthey are your enemies who want death to America, continue to say \n``death to America,'' continue to say we are going to provide more \nmoney, once you give us that $100 billion, $150 billion, once you give \nus that, we are going to fund more terrorism, and it is already being \nreported. Just the announcement that the money is coming has already \nstimulated more attacks on those who would hope to be free in Iran. It \nis tragic, just tragic.\n  But, in any event, we are living in perilous times. Many understand \nthat there are radical Islamists who are at war with us. It is time to \nrecognize that the release of a man who has said he wants to kill \nAmericans and will after he is released should be taken at his word.\n  I know there is some claim that he may not have said the things that \nare attributed to him by our own officers, our own personnel that were \nmonitoring him, but let me just say that is a real easy one. There is \nvideo somewhere, unless that has been lost with some of the emails that \nwere being pursued by Congress. Unless it has been lost with emails \nthat have been deleted to try to avoid turning them over to Congress, \nthose videos can be consulted, and we can know for sure whether this \nIslamic radical that President Obama has released from Guantanamo said \nthe things that our people said he said.\n  I was hearing some of my friends' comments about the gun laws. I know \nwe all share the desire to lessen and eliminate gun violence in \nAmerica. The thousands of felony cases that came through my court \ncaused me repeatedly to think back. I don't recall anybody who \ncommitted a crime with a gun that got it legally. Outlaws don't get \nguns legally.\n  It has been made clear that the things our President has proposed \nwould not have stopped one of these mass murderers that he now says \nspur him on to take action. I would encourage my friends: Let's work to \ntake action that will actually stop the mass murders, that will \nactually stop the gun violence, but that will not occur by taking guns \nout of the hands of law-abiding citizens.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H276-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H276-H278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        ARMED STANDOFF IN OREGON\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer) until 10 p.m.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to come \nto the floor this evening to speak about an armed standoff that is \ntaking place in my State of Oregon.\n  This is the ninth day of armed occupation of the Malheur National \nWildlife Refuge where we have some lawless, reckless behavior on the \npart of out-of-State zealots who have taken over a Federal resource.\n  This is really hard to comprehend for a moment. As has been mentioned \nby numerous commentators, imagine what would happen if armed protesters \nwho were of a different color or of a different religion occupied a \nFederal facility in Chicago or Washington, D.C., or Philadelphia. We \nwould not tolerate that behavior. We would watch people move in to \nremove them. And yet, here, we are talking about the ninth day with \nimpunity these people have undertaken to exert their own vision for an \namazing region, this high desert plateau in eastern Oregon, a region of \nvast, arid, high desert with many key lakes and wetlands, that is the \nlocation of a wildlife refuge that was created in 1908 by President \nTeddy Roosevelt. It was deemed important to protect this critical \nflyway, this wildlife habitat. We found people there slaughtering \nwildlife to take the feathers to decorate women's hats.\n  Now, I understand that there are some people who are involved who \nhave some frustrations about issues of management of Federal resources. \nI appreciate that. This is a large, vast country, with 323 million \npeople. In much of the West, a significant portion of the land is \nowned, managed, and administered by the Federal Government on behalf of \nall 323 million of us.\n  I have no doubt that occasionally there is frustration, there is a \ndifference of philosophy. Occasionally, there are mistakes made. One of \nthe problems we face is that my Republican friends in Congress for \nyears have refused to adequately fund these programs, being able to \ntake care of them appropriately, and that leads to frustrations as \nwell.\n  But I think it is important to note that, contrary to the actions of \nthese armed thugs, this land doesn't belong to them. It doesn't belong \nto the 7,000 residents of Malheur County or even 4 million Oregonians. \nThis land is in trust for 323 million Americans.\n  If we overrule these interests and get the Federal Government out of \nthis\n\n[[Page H277]]\n\nequation, it is not going to revert to a few of the people in the \nregion. The people who have first claim on this land are the Paiute \nIndians, who resided on it for thousands of years before the Federal \nGovernment came in and crowded them out.\n  This vast high desert area is worthy of protection, whether it is \nmonument or wilderness. Many Oregonians, including people in eastern \nand central Oregon, agree that this is worthy of protection. I met with \na number in central Oregon this year who were organized, Friends of the \nOwyhee, for instance, people who think that this largest area in the \nlower 48 States of pristine beauty, of great environmental import, is \nthe largest unprotected area in the lower 48 States.\n  Now, I listened to my friend from Oregon who represents the area, \nCongressman Walden, express his concern and frustration. He talked \nabout his challenges with the Steens Wilderness Area and talked about \nhis deep concern that the administration may consider a monument in the \nfuture for this area, monument status for hundreds of thousands of \nthese acres.\n  It is interesting to note, I was involved with that process, but not \nas deeply as my friend Congressman Walden, who I think can justly claim \ncredit for having been the driving force behind protecting the Steens \nWilderness Area. But it never would have achieved wilderness status \nwithout the prospect, the looming threat, of a monument status.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  I was pleased in a small way to have helped facilitate that going \nforward. We are all better off as a result of the process that took \nplace.\n  I was rather surprised that, in the course of his extensive comments \non the floor of the House a week ago, while talking about the \ncooperative effort and the value of the work for Steen's Wilderness, he \ndid not reference at all the process that has been taking place in the \nMalheur Basin, where we have seen advocates for local ranching \ninterests, environmentalists, and people in the refuge management \nitself all come together from 2010 to 2013, developing a vision to \nprotect this area, having one of the largest water projects in the \ncountry over the next 15 years: a plan, a vision, a commitment. And it \nwas done on a cooperative basis.\n  You can review what is going on with the ongoing media coverage or \nwith these armed, out-of-State thugs who have invaded the wildlife \nrefuge with no hint of what has happened there to be able to build a \nconsensus, a vision, to protect and enhance this area.\n  The notion somehow that government ought to get out of the way and \nturn this all over to the private sector is a bit strained.\n  First of all, it should be noted that about half the jobs in this \nlittle county of 7,000 people are themselves government jobs. Many of \nthem in the wildlife refuge are some of the best jobs in the region.\n  They may not make much difference in Portland, Eugene, Seattle, or \nWashington, D.C., but in a region like this, it is having hundreds of \nfamily-wage jobs with good benefits, pensions. It makes a huge \ndifference to the local economy.\n  I am concerned that we are just passing over this expectation that we \nhave an opportunity to be able to work with the affected people, move \nit forward, protecting this area as opposed to having folks who are \nthreatening public employees and who have engaged on a personal basis \nin threatening people. We have had to shut down a number of government \noperations. It is sad, it is unfortunate, and it is wrong.\n  We don't need outsiders coming into Oregon or politicians enabling or \nencouraging people to behave in this reckless, lawless fashion. We \nshould, as a matter of fact, cut them off.\n  There should be no electricity to the compound. They shouldn't be \nusing the computers of public employees. We shouldn't have them \nordering out for pizza or delivering food. This is goofy. It wouldn't \nhappen in any other area if armed thugs took over a Federal facility.\n  I have great sympathy with my friend and colleague, Peter DeFazio, \nwho felt that, by the Federal Government not acting on the Nevada \nlawbreakers who refused to pay the heavily discounted grazing fees--a \nfraction of what they would pay if it were in private hands--and \nallowing this to go on unabated, they are encouraging this lawless, \nreckless behavior.\n  I am pleased this evening that I am joined by my friend and colleague \nfrom California, Congressman Huffman, who, prior to coming to Congress, \nhad a long, distinguished career dealing with environmental protection \nand dealing with balancing these interests and solving problems while \nwe protect public interests.\n  I yield to the gentleman for his comments this evening.\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. I want to thank my friend from Oregon for his leadership \nand advocacy and calling us together for this important discussion \ntonight.\n  I want to thank him also for bringing up our great conservation hero, \nTeddy Roosevelt, a Republican President who I can't help but think is \nrolling in his grave over the fact that cornerstones of his legacy--the \nprotection of public lands, the protection of wildlife--are under \nconstant assault by too many of our friends across the aisle and, for \nthe last 2 weeks, by some very wrong-headed individuals who are heavily \narmed at a wildlife refuge in southern Oregon.\n  Many Americans who turned on their TVs last week I think were \nprobably surprised to see that this heavily armed extremist group had \ntaken over a national wildlife refuge and that they were threatening to \nkill anyone who stands in their way.\n  They were led, of course, by Ammon Bundy, the son of the infamous \nCliven Bundy, that great philosopher who romanticizes slavery, refuses \nto pay legally required grazing fees, and organized his own armed \ninsurrection in Nevada a couple of years ago.\n  Americans were surprised to see that this group, which was part of a \nlarger protest against Federal authority, public land policy, and \nenvironmental land violations, was so violent and so heavily armed and \nso extreme in their demands.\n  I think so many Americans are just surprised to find that people \nwould be so violently opposed to our Federal Government's role in \nprotecting public lands and wildlife that they would do this kind of \nthing.\n  But as a member of the House Natural Resources Committee, I have to \ntell you I am disgusted by these reckless, dangerous, and criminal \nactions, but I am not totally surprised. I am not totally surprised.\n  Because on any given week in the Natural Resources Committee, you can \nhear the intellectual underpinnings of these dangerous, violent \nactions. You hear the divisive, over-the-top antigovernment rhetoric \nthat is spewed by too many of our colleagues across the aisle, Members \nof Congress who may now be criticizing ever so gently the tactics of \nthe armed criminals in southern Oregon.\n  But out of the other side of their mouth they justify their actions \nby arguing that their anger and frustration with the government is \nsomehow justified and legitimate and that we should essentially \nsympathize with them rather than be outraged by their seditious, \nviolent actions.\n  I am amazed and grateful for the fact that our Federal land \nmanagement and law enforcement authorities have been so patient and so \npassive and so deferential because of their determination to try to \nbring this to a peaceful resolution. I admire and respect that. I know \nwhere they are coming from.\n  But let's be clear about this. There has to be accountability for the \noccupiers. This armed group of thugs occupying a refuge in the State to \nmy north can't be allowed to do this without consequences.\n  Because many people--you mentioned our colleague, Peter DeFazio--\nbelieve--correctly, in my view--that this wouldn't have happened had \nthere been some consequences to the Bundy ranch standoff 2 years ago.\n  Unfortunately, despite a very similar action, despite all of the same \nheavily armed threats and violence and the near avoidance of a tragedy \nthat could have cost untold numbers of lives, there really were no \nconsequences.\n  My understanding is that Cliven Bundy still owes well over $1 million \nin ranching fees to the Federal Government and that he is still grazing \nhis cattle without permission.\n  And because there has been no consequences, his son and the current \ngang that is occupying the refuge obviously took the lesson that they \ncould do it\n\n[[Page H278]]\n\nagain. And they will do it again and again, as long as we continue to \ngive them a pass.\n  So there has to be accountability. There has to be some type of \nconsequences for people that do this. But there also should be \naccountability for politicians who tacitly fuel incidents like this \nwith their inflammatory and hyperbolic rhetoric that always casts \nenvironmental protection as an assault on individual rights and that \nfalsely describes our national public lands as some type of a threat to \nState and private property owners. It is not right.\n  The truth is, in California and across the West, our public lands are \na cornerstone of lots of local and State economies, including those in \nmy district. I have huge tracts of Federal public lands in the Second \nCongressional District of California, from vast national parks and \nrecreational areas to three different national forests, to numerous \nnational monuments and lots and lots of BLM lands.\n  For many of my constituents, Federal lands help them put dinner on \nthe table. It helps them pay their bills. Ninety-one percent of western \nvoters surveyed responded that they believe public lands are an \nessential part of their State's economy. We need to remember this.\n  So I want to protect public lands, and I want to work cooperatively \nwith the Federal agencies that manage them to iron out differences.\n  Our Federal Government isn't perfect. They make mistakes. Sometimes \nthey are not the best neighbors. Sometimes they aren't always as \nresponsive and respectful to the communities and individuals that live \nnearby.\n  Part of our job as Members of Congress who represent those \ncommunities is to try to make sure that the government, for its part, \nis doing the right thing: listening, being a good neighbor.\n  I have seen it work time and time again. And the notion that the only \nway to resolve differences with Federal land management agencies is to \ntake up arms and threaten a violent insurrection is just absolutely \nnonsense.\n  So those are a few of my thoughts. I certainly could go on at length \nabout some of the success stories I have seen in my district, where \ncommunities have come together and actually collaborated with the \nFederal Government, not just as a neighbor, but as a partner to do \nthings, including things that brought jobs to those communities.\n  I have seen it in Trinity County with a process called the Trinity \nCounty Collaboration, where, believe it or not, environmentalists are \nworking together with folks in the forest products industry and with \nFederal agencies and with all sorts of other interests and they have \nagreed to cut thousands of acres of trees as part of a comprehensive \nstewardship plan.\n  It can work. It is very unique, but it can actually work. And it can \nwork in other places. It almost worked in the Klamath, which is another \npart of southern Oregon where we saw this historic coming together of \nfarmers and fishermen and tribes and government agencies.\n  The problem is that collaboration depended on an act of Congress to \nactually happen. Sadly, under current management, Congress is where \ncollaboration goes to die. And so we were unable to do the right thing \nthere. But it can be done.\n  I again want to thank the gentleman for his leadership in trying to \ninterpose a little bit of sanity into this debate.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I appreciate your joining me in this conversation on \nyour past activity and what we need to do in the future.\n  You are right. These are, if done correctly--and you have had some of \nthese experiences in California--huge economic opportunities.\n  There are 47 million bird watchers in this country. They spend \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of $40 billion a year. In the Malheur \nWildlife Refuge, almost 24,000 people made that long, long, long, long \njourney. And I will guarantee you they wouldn't have been sightseeing \nthere but for the wildlife refuge.\n  You referenced the Klamath. It is a lost opportunity if we are not on \nour toes. Removing those four dams that have obstructed the flow of \nspawning salmon, prohibiting us from meeting our obligation to Native \nAmericans, would create hundreds and hundreds of family-wage jobs for \nyears in northern California.\n  It is just one more example of where Congress is missing in action \nand where Congress hasn't appropriately funded these agencies to be \nable to fully meet the opportunities.\n  It is hard for me to express my wonderment that some people will come \nto the floor and somehow try and celebrate the Hammond family, people \nwho were convicted of arson and who have a record of having broken the \nlaw before.\n  Public records show behavior that is not that of people you want for \nyour neighbors. These folks do not have clean hands. Yet, we have out-\nof-State, armed thugs taking over this facility to somehow talk about \nthese convicted felons and undercut this process.\n  I am hopeful that we can work together for people to focus on the \nopportunities and have the administration step up, act responsibly, cut \nthese people off and remove them, and to take action against other \nlawbreakers like we would in other areas of the country.\n  I appreciate you joining me today to have a little bit of \nconversation here to try and round out the picture that is missing from \nthe media. It is probably not going to get us on Fox News, but these \nare things that the American public needs to know.\n  Because there is a path forward. There has been a regional consensus \nthat has developed. There is a vision to protect the wildlife refuge \nand its economic activities and future. It is one that we should \nsupport.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H278-1", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Clyburn (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today on account of \nattending a funeral.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "11"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/01/11/house-section/article/H278-2", "month": "01", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H278]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER.
