Mr. Speaker, this morning, I ask all my colleagues \nto join me in supporting H.

This means that nearly half of the preschool children of \npoverty will get a head start on their future. These children will \nreceive preschool training and prepare them for regular school in \nSeptember. They will get medical and dental attention that they badly \nneed, and parents will receive counseling.\n  Again, we have set out to make certain that poverty's children would \nnot be forevermore poverty's captives.\n  Today, 160,000 enrolled in Early Head Start, 910,000 enrolled in Head \nStart, 20,000 American Indian-Alaska Native children, 4,000 American \nIndians, 32,000 migrant or seasonal workers, and 40,000 homeless \nchildren.\n  We must continue this infrastructure, and I want to thank AVANCE and \nthe Harris County School District in my district because they believe \nin helping children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I conclude by thanking those who have fallen in battle \nfor the United States of America as we memorialize them on Memorial \nDay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3510-5", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3510-H3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATING MAJOR STEPHEN J.

Bonner of the U.S. Air \nForce, who has earned the Congressional Gold Medal for his \ndistinguished service as an American fighter pilot with the Flying \nTigers squadron in World War II.\n  Growing up in the 1930s and during World War I, Major Bonner had \nalways dreamt of becoming an ace. When he graduated from flight school \nin 1943, his dream came true when he was assigned to fly with the 76th \nFighter Squadron in China, battling Japanese fighter pilots in his P-40 \nWarhawk.\n  During his time with the Air Force, Major Bonner became a member of \nthe American Fighter Aces, who have been renowned as our country's most \ndistinguished fighter pilots. In both world wars, along with the Korean \nwar and the Vietnam war, these individuals have not only courageously \ndefended our Nation, but have also made outstanding achievements in \naerial combat.\n  Major Bonner, now 96, lives with his daughter Jane just outside \nCarlinville in my district in central Illinois. I am proud to \ncongratulate Major Bonner for his outstanding accomplishments as an \nAmerican Fighter Ace.\n\n[[Page H3511]]\n\n  The bravery and dedication he displayed as a pilot in World War II \nmake him a very deserving recipient of the Congressional Gold Medal, \nand I am proud and thankful to have such brave veterans like them in my \ndistrict.\n  Congratulations, Mr. Bonner.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3511-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START\n\n  (Ms. KELLY of Illinois asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, family income shouldn't dictate a \nchild's educational outcome; but today, study after study shows that \nchildren from lower-income families face unique social, emotional, and \nfinancial challenges that lead them to start school already behind \ntheir peers.\n  We began addressing this problem in 1965 when President Lyndon \nJohnson established the Head Start program. Fifty years later, over 30 \nmillion of our most vulnerable children have benefited from Head Start \nand a more level playing field.\n  In Illinois today, there are 48 Head Start programs across the State. \nThese programs not only provide opportunities for more than 40,000 \nIllinois children and their families each year, but they also give tens \nof thousands of passionate educators the chance to give our most needy \nchildren a shot at success.\n  This week, as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of Head Start, I urge \nmy colleagues to stand with me in support of this vital program. I look \nforward to ensuring that all children can have an equal opportunity to \nsucceed.\n  I want to salute our troops, our veterans, and those who gave their \nlives as we move into Memorial Day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3511-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1015\n                      PROBLEMS AT THE IRS CONTINUE\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, while it may feel like a case of deja vu, \nthe sad fact of the matter is, we are once again talking about real \nproblems at the IRS. This time, the Treasury inspector general reports \nthat 1,600 IRS agents in a 10-year period did not pay their taxes.\n  While it is bad enough to think that those tasked with collecting our \ntaxes can't manage to pay their own, what makes this case worse is that \na majority of these employees were given reduced penalties instead of \nfacing the full consequences of their actions. A number of these \nemployees even received promotions and bonuses.\n  Mr. Speaker, taxpayers deserve better than a government agency that \ncan't seem to follow the rules, and hard-working Americans should be \ntreated with more respect. It is time for more oversight and more \ntransparency at this agency and holding employees accountable who break \nthe rules.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3511-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3511]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     50TH ANNIVERSARY OF HEAD START\n\n  (Ms. LEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 50th anniversary of \nHead Start, which President Johnson announced May 18, 1965. Head Start \nis our Nation's commitment that every child--regardless of their ZIP \nCode--has an opportunity to succeed.\n  Since its creation, Head Start has prepared more than 30 million \nchildren for success in the classroom and beyond. My former district \ndirector, a brilliant African American man, was a Head Start graduate. \nHis story and millions of others demonstrate just how important early \nchildhood education programs are.\n  Yet nearly 57,000 children across the country have lost access \nbecause of draconian sequester cuts, and the 2016 Republican budget \nmakes it worse by removing another 35,000 children from the program, \nincluding 4,500 from my home State of California.\n  Our children deserve better. How in the world will they compete with \nchildren throughout the world if we deny them an early start?\n  Mr. Speaker, we know high-quality, early childhood education is one \nof the best investments we can make. So on the 50th anniversary of Head \nStart, I urge my colleagues to fully support this critical program and \nleave no child behind.\n  I, too, want to commemorate and remember my dad, a veteran who served \nin two wars. And also, I want to commemorate and thank our veterans, \nour young men and women on duty, and those who have paid a very serious \nprice on behalf of this country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3511-4", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3511-H3534]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nSPURRING PRIVATE AEROSPACE COMPETITIVENESS AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ACT OF \n                                  2015\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Pursuant to House Resolution 273 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2262.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1018\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2262) to facilitate a pro-growth environment for the developing \ncommercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment and \ncreating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions, and for \nother purposes, with Mr. Graves of Louisiana in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy) and the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I was a child, I learned that there was more to \nour universe than just my home and my town. There were people in great \ncities. There were buildings that stretched to the clouds. There were \nmachines that could explore the character of atoms and telescopes that \nsaw into distant galaxies. There is so much in the world.\n  And in recent decades, we have grown accustomed to seeing it all. \nEntire continents and countries are a plane ride away. The Internet is \na window to the world from the comfort of our homes. In this time of \ninnovation, what was once unimaginable is now common, and what was once \ndistant now feels so close.\n  But we all know there is still so much left to learn. In my heart, I \nbelieve man's journey of exploration and discovery has barely begun.\n  For generations, dating back to the dawn of humankind, every man, \nwoman, and child has looked up to the stars in wonder. We imagined that \nthe dots of light could reveal a glimpse of the future. And we thought \nthat each night, we saw the whole heavens stretching above us.\n  But as technology has given us new eyes to see the universe, we \ndiscovered that even on the clearest of nights, we can only see a \nfraction of the stars in one small section of our galaxy.\n  I still look up at the stars with wonder. And I know that we are only \nat the start of our mission into this great frontier.\n  You see, I spent time in school, just like every kid in America, \nlearning about our first voyages into space and the Moon landing. I \nremember how much pride I felt, knowing that America did it first and \nthat our flag still flies up there today.\n  But that is not where we were meant to stop.\n  America has always led because it is in our nature to lead. We \ncrossed over the mountains of Appalachia and into the Great Plains. We \nclimbed the Rockies to the golden coast of California and beyond, \ncreating a Nation in\n\n[[Page H3512]]\n\nthis land that has far surpassed all others in truth, hope, and \nliberty.\n  We are a beacon of freedom and human dignity to every person that \nlongs for the right to choose their own future, and we are a force for \ngood unlike anything this world has ever known.\n  And yet in space, we are losing our ability to lead. We once stood up \nto the challenge of the Soviet's Sputnik and made it to the Moon. But \ntoday our astronauts use Russian rockets, and other nations are working \nto put people on Mars and beyond.\n  But we must go beyond. We must face the great unknown with that \nAmerican spirit of adventure and hope.\n  To paraphrase President Kennedy, we must lead mankind into space--not \nbecause it is easy, but because it is hard and because that goal brings \nout the very best of our Nation.\n  There are people--scientists, engineers, astronauts, and \nentrepreneurs--out in the deserts of California who have a goal, the \nsame goal so many Americans have had before them. It was our \nforefathers' goal at the founding of this Nation conceived in \nliberty. It was our goal when two young bicycle repairmen rose above \nthe sand and waves of a North Carolina beach to fly. It was our goal \nwhen Chuck Yeager raced through the skies over California and broke the \nsound barrier.\n\n  That goal is to make our dreams a reality.\n  Today these 21st century explorers in California and across the \nNation want to bring man above the clouds, above the Earth, and above \nthe Moon, itself. And we should let them.\n  Government has great power; that is true. But in America, we believe \nthat power is limited. It cannot, should not, and will not be used to \ndiminish our dreams.\n  I stand here before you today, Mr. Chairman, presenting a bill. This \nbill asks us to make a decision: Do we concede our future to one of \nmanaged decline where others lead? Or do we make a future where America \nand her people guide us in our journey to the stars?\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act of 2015. And I am \nactually quite saddened by that. It is not the outcome I had hoped for. \nLike the gentleman from California, I share in the enthusiasm and the \nwonder of space.\n  I would note that the Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related \nAgencies Appropriations Subcommittee has just cut $230 million from the \nPresident's request for these activities.\n  It was my sincere belief that the Science, Space, and Technology \nCommittee could have reached bipartisan agreement on a commercial space \nbill. Indeed, during the past few weeks, there was a concerted attempt \non both sides of the committee to reach common ground on tackling these \nissues and developing a bipartisan bill.\n  However, with the backdrop of meeting the majority's floor schedule \nas the top priority, there was insufficient time given to negotiate a \ncompromise before last week's full committee markup.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think most of us on both sides of the aisle share in \nthe excitement and enthusiasm about the commercial space industry, and \nwe want it to succeed. Indeed, hundreds of millions of dollars have \nbeen paid by taxpayers into this industry to get it off the ground. \nAmerican taxpayers have a lot of skin in the game when it comes to the \nsuccess of commercial space.\n  Since the very beginning, the Federal Government has supported the \nprivate space industry, at both the State and Federal level, with \nfunding, data, and guidance with best practices.\n  Since the Commercial Space Launch Act was passed in 1984, followed by \nthe Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of 1988 and 2004, it is \nclear that the commercial space industry has made significant strides.\n  Even in 2004, few would have predicted that NASA would be relying \ntoday on commercial space transportation to deliver critical supplies, \nspare parts, and research material to the International Space Station.\n  Who knows what developments will occur in the commercial space arena \nin the coming years. What we do know is that it won't just be \ncommercial cargo transported into space; in fact, it will also be \npeople. That is why it is up to Congress to develop responsible \ncommercial space policies that both encourage the commercial space \nindustry and protect those who participate as the users of the \nindustry's services and activities.\n  Sadly, this bill just doesn't measure up to that responsibility. \nInstead, it takes a fundamentally unbalanced approach to the issues \nfacing the commercial space launch industry.\n  Two key areas should concern all Members, Republicans and Democrats \nalike.\n  The first area pertains to safety. A moratorium on the FAA's \nauthority to regulate the safety of crew and spaceflight participants \nwas initially included in the Commercial Space Launch Act Amendments of \n2004 in order to allow the commercial space industry the time to \nacquire experience and data that would inform the development of safety \nregulations.\n  However, initial expectations of industry progress simply were not \nrealized. So in 2012, Congress extended the moratorium for 3 more years \nas part of the FAA Modernization and Reform Act of 2012. The end of \nthat learning period is set to expire on September 30, 2015.\n  H.R. 2262, the bill in front of us, would extend the learning period \nto December 31, 2025, a decade-long moratorium on FAA's ability to even \nstart proposing a safety framework.\n  This is very dangerous. This unprecedented regulation-free period for \na decade for the commercial and human spaceflight industry puts no \npressure on the industry to establish industry consensus standards, \nstandards that could potentially be used as self-regulation measures \nfor the industry.\n  In addition to providing the industry with 10 years of no safety \nregulations, H.R. 2262 negatively affects the rights of individuals on \nimportant safety matters by requiring spaceflight passengers to waive \nliability against launch providers and other parties.\n  What that means is that spaceflight participants have to waive their \nrights to sue the launch provider and related parties for claims, even \nif there is negligence involved.\n  Mr. Chair, H.R. 2262 puts policy in place that favors industry over \npolicy that ensures balanced consideration for those people the \nindustry will serve. That is a position that I and all of my Democratic \ncolleagues on the committee oppose.\n  Another area of concern pertains to space resource utilization, such \nas asteroid mining.\n  Mr. Chair, there is merit to positioning ourselves to answer \nquestions associated with space mining, the property rights that accrue \nfrom such activities, and the harmonization with our treaty \nobligations.\n  However, establishing prescriptive policies, as H.R. 2262 would do, \nis simply premature.\n  To preclude the proverbial placement of the cart before the horse, it \nwould be prudent to establish an interagency review to help identify \nappropriate roles and responsibilities and a proposed organizational \nstructure for the Federal Government's oversight and licensing of \ncommercial space resource exploration and utilization.\n  And it would also be prudent, Mr. Chair, to hold hearings on these \nissues and on this legislation, as well as to have a subcommittee \nmarkup, what we sometimes refer to as regular order. H.R. 2262 skips \nthese steps.\n  Proponents of the space resources utilization provisions in H.R. 2262 \nargue that the range of issues has been adequately vetted and reviewed \nby the executive branch.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Mr. Chairman, it is my understanding that while several individuals \nin the executive branch have offered technical drafting comments in \nresponse to queries about the bill, no Federal agency has taken a \nposition on the bill.\n  Indeed, the administration says: ``While the administration strongly \nsupports the bill's efforts to facilitate innovative new space \nactivities by U.S. companies, such as the commercial exploration and \nutilization of space resources to meet national needs, the \nadministration is concerned about the ability of U.S. companies to move \nforward with these initiatives absent additional authority to ensure \ncontinuing supervision of these initiatives by the\n\n[[Page H3513]]\n\nU.S. Government as required by the Outer Space Treaty.''\n  In addition to these concerns, we have received a number of letters \nfrom legal scholars, consumer interest groups, and attorneys who have \nraised concerns or are opposed to H.R. 2262 as written. I am submitting \nfor the Record letters from Professor Joanne Gabrynowicz, Director of \nthe National Center for Remote Sensing, Air and Space Law; the American \nAssociation for Justice; the Center for Justice & Democracy; Consumer \nWatchdog; the National Consumers League; the Network for Environmental \nand Economic Responsibility of United Church of Christ; Protect All \nChildren's Environment; and Public Citizen.\n\n                                         520 Deer Creek Drive,\n\n                                         Oxford, MS, May 12, 2015.\n     Hon. Eddie Bernice Johnson, \n     Ranking Member, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Johnson: At the request of \n     Congressional Staff I am submitting this letter as a citizen \n     expert for your consideration. I was requested to review H.R. \n     1508 and provide a comment. I am currently Professor Emerita \n     at the University of Mississippi School of Law where I taught \n     United States National Space Law, International Space Law, \n     and Remote Sensing Law from 2001 to 2013. Prior to that I \n     taught similar courses in the Space Studies Department at the \n     University of North Dakota Odegard School of Aerospace \n     Sciences from 1987 to 2001. I was the Editor-in-Chief of the \n     Journal of Space Law from 2001-2013. My complete curriculum \n     vitae is attached for your reference.\n       1. Outer Space Treaty Art. II prohibition of national \n     appropriation by ``any other means''.\n       This comment addresses the most important issue raised by \n     the Bill on its face. The Bill provides, ``[a]ny asteroid \n     resources obtained in outer space are the property of the \n     entity that obtained such resources, which shall be entitled \n     to all property rights thereto, consistent with applicable \n     provisions of Federal law.'' The Bill defines a ``space \n     resource'' as a ``natural resource of any kind found in situ \n     in outer space.'' It further defines an ``asteroid resource'' \n     as ``found on or within an asteroid.'' The bill is addressing \n     unextracted resources.\n       The United States is a State-Party to the Treaty on \n     Principles Governing the Activities of States in the \n     Exploration and Use of Outer Space, Including the Moon and \n     Other Celestial Bodies. It prohibits ``national appropriation \n     by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by \n     any other means.'' The Bill attempts to grant U.S. \n     jurisdiction over ``any asteroid resource'' in situ in order \n     to authorize and require the ``President . . . to facilitate \n     the commercial exploration and utilization of space resources \n     to meet national needs''. Making unextracted, in situ \n     ``asteroid resources'' subject to U.S. Federal law and \n     requiring the President ``to meet national needs'' is a form \n     of national appropriation by ``other means''.\n       2. The Bill does not provide for any specific licensing \n     regime.\n       Unlicensed U.S. commercial space activities are \n     unprecedented in United States space law. All commercial \n     space activities to date require appropriate licensing by an \n     authorized agency. Specific statutes delegate licensing \n     authority to specific agencies. For example, the Commercial \n     Space Launch Act authorizes the FAA to license commercial \n     launch activities. The 1992 Land Remote Sensing Policy Act \n     authorizes the Department of Commerce to license commercial \n     remote sensing systems. Licensing is how the U.S. meets its \n     obligations to authorize and continually supervise the space \n     activities of non-government entities under the Outer Space \n     Treaty.\n       In particular, it is important to note that the license \n     requirement imposed on the licensee that it maintain \n     `operational control,' as the term is defined in Section \n     960.3, is an implementation of U.S. obligations under the \n     United Nations Outer Space Treaty of 1967. That treaty \n     provides that the U.S. Government, as a State party, will be \n     held strictly liable for any U.S. private or governmental \n     entity's actions in outer-space. Consequently, NOAA requires \n     that licensees under this part to maintain ultimate control \n     of their systems, in order to minimize the risk of such \n     liability and assure that the national security concerns, \n     foreign policy and international obligations of the United \n     States are protected.\n       The lack of a specific licensing regime also fails to meet \n     the State Department's concern raised in a letter to Bigelow \n     Aerospace from the FAA: the lack of a national regulatory \n     framework with respect to private sector activities on \n     celestial bodies.\n       3. The Bill only provides for a report.\n       The Bill requires the President to submit a report to \n     recommend which Federal agencies will be necessary to meet \n     U.S. international obligations. This may be sufficient. It is \n     worth noting that reports are not the equivalent of licensing \n     regulations that go through the Administrative Procedure Act \n     process. However, this is a Federalism question, not a space \n     law question so I will only point out the issue and note it \n     is worth questioning and seeking the view of a relevant \n     expert.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         Joanne Irene Gabrynowicz,\n     Prof. Emerita.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                             American Association for Justice,\n\n                                                     May 20, 2015.\n     Re Support the Edwards Amendment to the SPACE Act of 2015 \n         (H.R. 2262)\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: The American \n     Association for Justice (AAJ) supports the Edwards substitute \n     amendment which substitutes the text of S. 1297, a bipartisan \n     Senate companion for the SPACE Act of 2015 the ``Spurring \n     Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of \n     2015'' or SPACE Act of 2015. The American Association for \n     Justice (AAJ), formerly the Association of Trial Lawyers of \n     America (ATLA) with members in United States, Canada and \n     abroad, is the world's largest trial bar. It was established \n     in 1946 to safeguard victims' rights, strengthen the civil \n     justice system, promote injury prevention and foster public \n     health and safety. AAJ is an advocate for a strong civil \n     justice system in order to protect the health and wellbeing \n     of all Americans.\n       Commercial space travel is an emerging industry that will \n     allow for members of the general public to visit space for \n     recreational or business purposes and AAJ recognizes the \n     challenges of trying to give a new industry the flexibility \n     to grow and innovate. However, Section 8 of the SPACE Act of \n     2015 requires passengers on commercial spacecraft to waive \n     any right to damages for personal injury, property damage or \n     death resulting from commercial space travel. While it may be \n     acceptable for businesses with equal footing and negotiating \n     power to execute cross waivers limiting their responsibility \n     to each other, this waiver language should not extend to \n     passengers. This provision is unfair and harmful to \n     individuals. As a result, AAJ is supporting the Edwards \n     substitute amendment, which does not contain the harmful \n     cross waiver provision.\n       The SPACE Act of 2015 as introduced contains a provision \n     which would provide the commercial space industry total \n     immunity. This provision will be eliminated by the Manager's \n     Amendment to the bill. We applaud Chairman Smith for \n     protecting the American public. As the commercial space \n     travel industry grows, safety should be put first and \n     foremost. Industry interests should not be valued over that \n     of the passengers.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Linda Lipsen,\n     C.E.O.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 20, 2015.\n     Re Opposition to H.R. 2262 the ``Spurring Private Aerospace \n         Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015'' or \n         SPACE Act.\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: The undersigned \n     organizations are writing to express opposition to HR. 2262, \n     the ``Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and \n     Entrepreneurship Act of 2015'' or SPACE Act. While some of \n     our organizations may have concerns about various parts of \n     this legislation, this letter addresses two sections in \n     particular: Sections 7 and 8.\n       The sweeping immunity proposed by these provisions is \n     alarming. The commercial space industry's safety record has \n     been shoddy with normal rules in place. The last thing \n     Congress should be doing is passing legislation that removes \n     this industry's financial incentive to conduct safe \n     commercial space operations. And it is particularly troubling \n     that this legislation was passed out of the House Committee \n     on Science, Space, and Technology without a single hearing \n     held.\n       Section 7 of the bill states: ``Any action or tort arising \n     from a licensed launch or reentry shall be the sole \n     jurisdiction of the Federal courts and shall be decided under \n     federal law.'' Given that no federal tort law exists in such \n     cases, this provision will immunize the private space \n     industry for any harm it causes. It wipes out any tort remedy \n     for death, injuries or property damage suffered as a result \n     of a negligent or reckless launch or reentry. And space \n     passengers are not the only individuals covered by this \n     language. Anyone, from innocent bystanders watching a rocket \n     launch, to people who happen to be at the wrong place at the \n     wrong time, suffering any harm, whether that be losing a \n     house, limb, or life, will be left without recourse. Imagine \n     the vast radioactive carnage that could result from an \n     exploding nuclear rocket, which the industry is discussing \n     for future rocket propulsion.\n       Section 8 of the SPACE Act requires both companies and \n     passengers on commercial space flights to cross-waive \n     liability claims. It is one thing for companies with equal \n     bargaining power to establish liability agreements between \n     them. However, it is unfair to force passengers into such \n     agreements. This provision does not protect passengers--it \n     strips away their rights.\n       Supporters of the bill say immunity is needed to spur \n     innovation and save jobs. This is nonsense. If the civil \n     justice system\n\n[[Page H3514]]\n\n     were harming the industry in some way, this would already be \n     evident. But according to the most recent Space Foundation \n     report, ``The global space economy grew to $314.17 billion in \n     commercial revenue and government budgets in 2013, reflecting \n     growth of 4 percent from the 2012 total of $302.22 billion. \n     Commercial activity--space products and services and \n     commercial infrastructure--drove much of this increase. From \n     2008 through 2013, the total has grown by 27 percent.''\n       This industry should be subject to the same civil justice \n     system that applies to every other dangerous industry in \n     America. If a private space company is grossly negligent and \n     harms people, it should be accountable for the harm it \n     causes. For these reasons, we strongly oppose H.R. 2262 the \n     ``Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and \n     Entrepreneurship Act of 2015'' or SPACE Act.\n           Very sincerely,\n         Alliance for Justice; Center for Justice & Democracy; \n           Consumer Watchdog; National Consumers League; Network \n           for Environmental & Economic Responsibility of United \n           Church of Christ; Protect All Children's Environment; \n           Public Citizen.\n\n  Ms. EDWARDS. In closing, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 2262 is an unbalanced \nbill that simply doesn't adequately protect the public's interest, \nwhether in matters pertaining to the safety of the general public or in \nmatters pertaining to the safety of the future consumers and customers \nof the industry, and incorporates prescriptive provisions on space \nresource utilization that are indeed premature.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my fellow Members to oppose H.R. 2262, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill that comes before us today took some time in \ndrafting. In over four hearings in a bipartisan manner, this committee \nreached out to the minority in October of last year and gave them a \ndraft of the bill. Unfortunately, Mr. Chairman, the minority party did \nnot come back for 5 months. But we want to make clear that everybody \nunderstood the bill.\n  We also want to make clear that people didn't make misstatements \nbecause, in this bill, the section provides FAA's ability to regulate \ncommercial human spaceflight in order to protect the uninvolved public, \nnational security, public health and safety, safety of property, and \nforeign policy. It also preserves FAA's ability to regulate spaceflight \nparticipant and crew safety as a result of an accident or unplanned \nevent.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Texas, Chairman \nSmith, the man who has led this committee in a bipartisan manner.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia for yielding, and our thanks go to Majority Leader Kevin \nMcCarthy for introducing such an important piece of legislation. In \nfact, we have made him an honorary member of the Science, Space, and \nTechnology Committee.\n  Mr. Chairman, space commercialization, this bill, is the future of \nspace. This bill will encourage the private sector to build rockets, to \ntake risks, and to shoot for the heavens. H.R. 2262, the Spurring \nPrivate Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, or \nSPACE Act, facilitates a progrowth environment for the developing \ncommercial space sector. It creates more stable regulatory conditions \nand improves safety, which, in turn, attracts private investment.\n  Members of Congress should know that earlier this week the \nadministration officially stated--and this is the most important thing \nin my view that the administration said, and it was, unfortunately, \nomitted from the statement awhile ago that the ranking member quoted. \nHere is what the administration said:\n\n       It does not oppose House passage of this bill.\n\n  The SPACE Act secures American leadership in space and fosters the \ndevelopment of advanced space technologies. The SPACE Act preserves the \nFederal Aviation Administration's ability to regulate commercial human \nspaceflight in order to protect national security and public health and \nsafety. The act preserves FAA's ability to regulate spaceflight \nparticipation and crew safety in the event of an accident.\n  The bill calls for a progress report on the knowledge the industry \nand FAA have gained about the operation and licensing of commercial \nhuman spaceflight. This allows the commercial space industry to develop \nstandards and coordinate with the FAA so the industry can grow in a \nstable regulatory environment without the threat of arbitrary \nregulations that would adversely impact their ability to innovate.\n  Mr. Chairman, international law places liability for damages that \nresult from space accidents on the launching nation. All spacefaring \nnations require some form of third-party liability insurance for \nlaunching entities.\n  The current U.S. risk-sharing structure expires in 2016. This act \nextends indemnification to the year 2025 and requires an update on how \nthe FAA calculates the maximum probable loss associated with launches. \nIndemnification has never been utilized and is subject to future \nappropriations. This provision will prevent U.S. space companies from \ngoing overseas where other nations have more favorable liability \nprotection.\n  The SPACE Act also closes a statutory loophole that negates an \nexperimental permit once a launch license is issued for the same \nvehicle design. This fosters greater innovation and allows an \nexperimental permit holder to continue testing while a license holder \nconducts operations. Current law only allows for two categories of \nindividuals carried within a spacecraft: crew and spaceflight \nparticipants. Now that NASA is allowing other astronauts access to the \nInternational Space Station, a new category is necessary to outline the \nroles, responsibilities, and protections for astronauts on a commercial \nhuman spaceflight launch.\n  This bill also closes a loophole that carved out an exception for \nspaceflight participants from indemnification coverage. By including \nthese individuals in the indemnification provision, spaceflight \nparticipants who may participate in a launch as a result of a contest \nor for other reasons are not burdened with financial exposure above the \nlimits. This bill also ensures that Federal courts review lawsuits that \nresult from accidents since the Federal Government is ultimately the \nresponsible party, not the States.\n  Current law requires that all parties involved in a launch waive \nclaims against each other. This bill adds spaceflight participants to \nthe cross-waiver requirement to ensure consistency and reinforce the \ninformed consent requirements.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. All space community stakeholders have expressed \nsupport for this bill. They include Blue Origin, Virgin Galactic, \nMojave Air and Space Port, SpaceX, the National Space Society, and the \nCommercial Spaceflight Federation, which represents more than 50 \ncommercial space companies across the United States. The bill also \nincludes many bipartisan provisions recently considered by the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee.\n  The bill is the product of over 3 years of work, numerous committee \nhearings, and input from industry, education groups, and grassroots \ncitizen advocacy groups. Virtually every stakeholder group, again, has \nsupported this bill.\n\n  H.R. 2262 will keep America at the forefront of aerospace technology, \npromote American jobs, reduce red tape, promote safety, and inspire the \nnext generation of explorers. I urge my colleagues to support this \nbill, and once again thank the majority leader for introducing it.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I would note, before yielding to the ranking member, \nthat it should be no surprise that the entire commercial space industry \nis supporting the majority bill because it is incredibly generous to \nthe industry without due consideration to the safety of the public and \nto spaceflight passengers who also might travel on their vehicle. So it \nis not a surprise.\n  I think all of us here want to see the support of the commercial \nspace industry. We want a regulatory environment that respects their \ninnovation but also protects United States taxpayers' interest. As I \nhave said, taxpayers have, to the tune of hundreds of millions of\n\n[[Page H3515]]\n\ndollars, our skin in the game. It is up to us to act responsibly.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I rise in \nopposition to H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act of 2015.\n  This bill amends the Commercial Space Launch Act, which is one of the \nseminal achievements on this committee. That act opened the doors to \nestablishment on the commercial space industry, which is poised to \nbecome a major part of the 21st century economy.\n  I agree that both our committee and the Congress as a whole need to \naddress the Commercial Space Launch Act. We haven't comprehensively \naddressed these issues since 2004. I also want to be clear that I am a \nstrong supporter of the commercial space industry. I think Members on \nboth sides of the aisle want this industry to succeed because this \nindustry's success is good for our Nation. However, the issues being \ndealt with in this bill are not straightforward. They are complex and \nrequire thoughtful consideration.\n  Unfortunately, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology hasn't \ngiven these issues thoughtful consideration. We have not held any \nhearings so far this Congress to examine the issues being debated \ntoday. We also haven't had a subcommittee markup to try to work through \nsome of the underlying issues in the legislation. That is really very \nunfortunate, because we could be considering a bipartisan piece of \nlegislation today if the majority had simply laid the proper groundwork \nfor moving complex legislation. Instead, we have rushed this bill to \nthe floor to meet some arbitrary timetable established by somebody, \nperhaps the Republican leadership.\n  So what does this bill do? In every possible measure, H.R. 2262 gives \nmaximum preference to the priorities of the commercial space launch \nindustry--at the expense of the safety of the general public and the \nsafety of the future customers of this very industry, and it does so at \nthe expense of the American taxpayers.\n  Mr. Chairman, this bill proposes to provide the commercial space \nlaunch industry with another decade--decade--of regulation-free \noperations with respect to protecting the safety of spaceflight \npassengers. There won't be any passengers when they find out that they \nhave no protection.\n  Some will state that the industry does not yet have enough experience \nto establish these regulations. That is rubbish. Both the United States \nand Russia have been launching humans into space for more than five \ndecades. There has been literally hundreds of space launches on \nnumerous different types of spacecraft during this time. The FAA has \nhad more than enough data to rely on to set commonsense regulations on \nspaceflight passenger safety.\n  In addition, this bill also provides a lengthy 9-year extension of \ncommercial space launch indemnification provisions. Congress has \nextended these provisions many times since they were originally crafted \nin 1988. Since 1988, the liability exposure of the U.S. Government \nunder this regime has grown each and every year. What began as an \napproximately $1 billion backstop for the industry has now grown to \nmore than $2.5 billion, and this will continue to grow for 9 more years \nunder this bill. I think this is something that deserves a little more \nattention. Generally, as an industry matures, you would think their \nreliance on the U.S. Government for subsidies would decrease rather \nthan increase.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, this bill takes steps into the uncharted \nwaters involving space property rights. I am not against asteroid \nmining or space resource utilization. Those activities will come in \ntime. However, I am for getting any legislation that addresses these \nareas right.\n  We are not at all close to resolving the many unanswered questions \nand issues concerning space resource utilization and property rights. \nAt the single hearing the majority held on this topic last Congress, \nseveral of the invited witnesses expressed their views that there were \nmany unsettled issues with the majority's draft legislation. Moving \nthis legislation without really ever addressing these issues is, I \nbelieve, negligent on the part of the Congress.\n  Some on the other side of the aisle may point to the fact that the \nadministration's Statement of Administration Policy did not include a \nveto threat against this bill. But I would note that the \nadministration's statement also had serious concerns about sections of \nthe bill and notably did not endorse the bill.\n  With respect to the asteroid mining provisions, the statement noted: \n``the administration is concerned about the ability of U.S. companies \nto move forward with these initiatives absent additional authority to \nensure continuing supervision of these initiatives by the U.S. \nGovernment as required by the Outer Space Treaty.''\n  Mr. Chairman, Ms. Edwards will be offering an amendment in the nature \nof a substitute that I will speak on one more time later. It may not \nhave everything that industry desires, it may not reflect all of our \npriorities for commercial space launch policy, but it is a clear route \nto getting a balanced, bipartisan, bicameral commercial space launch \nbill enacted into law, because ultimately that is what we are trying to \ndo is get a bicameral agreement.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  We can argue over differences, or we can just join together to pass \nbipartisan, bicameral commercial space legislation.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2262 in its present form and \ninstead take a bipartisan approach to enacting commercial space launch \nlegislation.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Before I yield, I do want it noted, 1969, what all America felt when \nthey watched America make a step on the Moon, on an American rocket and \nAmerican ingenuity. Unfortunately, today, we pay Russia for an \nastronaut from America to ride on their rockets. Some may be content \nwith that, but, Mr. Chairman, I am not. That is why this bill today \nallows us to have some change and growth to make that happen.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nHultgren).\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Mr. Chairman, I want to take a moment to thank the \nsponsor of this bill, Majority Leader McCarthy, for his great work. \nThis is very important.\n  I also want to thank our great chairman, Lamar Smith, who has had an \nunprecedented week in the House of Representatives of passing bills of \ninnovation, advancing science. Congratulations to him as well.\n  The space industry represents hundreds of billions of dollars in \neconomic investment and thousands of jobs across the United States, but \nit is not just large companies.\n  Cain Tubular--a small, multigenerational, family-owned business in my \ndistrict--is doing the innovative work necessary for safe, weld-free \ncondensing coils for the next generation of rocket engines.\n  Scot Forge is another business in my district, working under an \namazing employee ownership model, that is forging the heavy metal parts \nand casings for multiple launch systems throughout the supply chain.\n  The space industry is an engine of economic growth throughout the \ncountry, and our opportunity to do this right is vitally necessary to \nmaintain American competitiveness as other nations begin to catch up.\n  That is why I rise today to urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2262, \nthe Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act \nof 2015. The SPACE Act facilitates a progrowth environment for the \ncommercial space sector. It fosters a safety framework that will \nprotect the American public, while encouraging the development of new \nspace technologies. This will ensure America's exceptional role is \nmaintained as the most innovative Nation in the world.\n  This legislation also extends the current risk-sharing structure set \nto expire next year and requires an update on how the FAA calculates \nmaximum probable loss associated with potential spaceflight accidents. \nThis ensures that U.S. space companies won't be forced to go overseas \nto compete.\n  The SPACE Act also establishes a legal framework for government \nproperty rights of resources obtained from\n\n[[Page H3516]]\n\nasteroids, giving U.S. companies the legal assurance they need to \ninvest in and develop in situ space resource exploration and \nutilization technologies. The successful exploration and use of in situ \nasteroid resources is an important step in humanity's development and \nis in the national interest of the United States.\n  The SPACE Act helps develop the commercial space industry, ensures \ncommercial space lawsuits are treated fairly, and allows the commercial \nspace industry to grow like never before.\n  For these reasons, I strongly recommend my colleagues support \ncommercial space with a vote for the SPACE Act of 2015.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time each \nside has remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Maryland has 14 minutes remaining. \nThe gentleman from California has 17 minutes remaining.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to, for the Record, because I think it is important for \nthe American people that we don't mix apples and oranges, the Bush \nadministration actually canceled the program that would have enabled us \nto make sure that we have American rocket vehicles going to the space \nstation.\n  In the interim period, those requests have been severely underfunded, \nso I think it is important for us to put into perspective what is \nhappening in the space industry.\n  Now, I--as somebody who long ago worked in the industry, worked at \nNASA--understand the importance of investing in science and research \nand funding the activities of NASA and supporting the industry. I also \nunderstand that we have put--this Congress, in fact--has placed burdens \nboth on the industry and on the agency to perform without putting the \nmoney to do that.\n  I would note that this SPACE Act doesn't have any money that goes \nwith it. In fact, on the appropriations side, as I stated earlier, $230 \nmillion has actually been cut from the President's request.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Eddie Bernice \nJohnson), my colleague and the ranking member.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I simply wanted to \nrespond to the statement that we have to rely on Russia.\n  We are relying on Russia because we won't pay for it in this country, \nbut we are willing to allow a private commercial spaceship to fly at \nthe expense of the government and at the risk of every person who would \nhire a trip. We are paying them to take supplies to a space station \nbecause we refuse to fund space station flight for human flight from \nthis country.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, we pay Russia $70 million for one astronaut to go to the \nInternational Space Station. As commercial space begins to grow, we \nwatched others get into the market--SpaceX--so they could do it for \nmuch less. That is what this bill talks about, allowing the commercial \nspace others to join in.\n  I don't think all the answers come from Washington. I think \ngovernment should be limited, but we should not limit our ability to \ngrow. Why should we complain if we can use private sector money to even \nincrease our capabilities to go higher into space?\n  Mr. Chairman, the next person I am going to yield to knows a great \ndeal about this. He represents aerospace corridor. He comes from a \nfamily that is renowned in the development of space in America.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nKnight), the son of Mr. Pete Knight, who still holds the record for the \nfastest man on Earth in an X-15.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the majority leader for \nbringing this forward. This is a vital piece of legislation.\n  The majority leader brings up a subject that is always very important \nto me. It happened on December 17, 1903. It happened in a little \nbicycle shop in Dayton, Ohio. Two innovators took their invention \nacross part of the country out to a little place in North Carolina in \nKitty Hawk, and they flew a man-powered controllable aircraft for the \nfirst time.\n  Now, why is that important? It is because the government had thrown a \n$50,000 grant to get this done, and they couldn't get it done, but two \ninnovators could get it done by nothing other than the brains that they \nhad, the energy, and their two hands.\n  America needs to ensure that it will continue to be the leader in the \nspace industry. Business and innovation want stability, and this bill \ndoes just that, by extending the FAA learning period and duration of \nindemnification to 10 years.\n  When I speak to fifth graders--and I think we all do at least a \ncouple times a year; I try to speak to at least 50 schools a year--but \nwhen I talk to the fifth graders, I ask them how long it takes to fly \nfrom LA to Tokyo. There is always a 2-hour or a 20-hour or anything \nlike that.\n  I tell them it takes about 10\\1/2\\ hours. I said: But in your \nlifetime, it is going to take about an hour and a half.\n  They said: Well, that is great. That is great. I would love to be in \nan airplane for just an hour and a half or a spacecraft when, today, we \nhave to do 10\\1/2\\ hours.\n  Well, do you know what, that will happen if we let it happen. Right \nnow, it is happening. Innovation is flourishing. These things are \nhappening. We are doing jousting programs that is dispersing the \nsupersonic wave which means, at some point, we will be able to fly over \nthe continent at more than Mach 1.\n  That means we will be able to fly home to California in an hour and a \nhalf. Now, I know all of us Californians would love to do that instead \nof the 5\\1/2\\ hours it takes today, just like it took in 1970.\n  This bill allows the FAA to gather sufficient data to ensure the \nregulations will help foster growth in the industry. I support this \nbill.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We have been listening to this discussion, and I think, when the \nother side reclaims their time, it would be really helpful to explain \nwhy it is that, if this is so important and that it is so urgent, why \nit is that the majority has cut $230 million from commercial crew. I \nwill wait to hear the answer, as I am sure the American people are \nwaiting.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman.\n  I thank the managers of this bill, including the majority leader.\n  I just want to say that I come from Space City. Houston, Texas, has \nas its motto--its defining moment besides railroads--is Space City. I \nserved 12 years on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, and I \nhad a strong commitment and continue to have a strong commitment to \nhuman space exploration--in particular, the research that is garnered \nout of that mighty effort.\n  I have traveled to most of the NASA centers across the Nation, and I \nhave seen outstanding researchers. There is no reason for any of us, \nDemocrats or Republicans, to oppose the idea of space exploration and, \nin this instance, commercial space exploration.\n  What I will say to you, Mr. Chairman, and to my good friend, the \nmajority leader, let us walk step-by-step together.\n  Certainly, I am concerned as someone who offered and wrote \nlegislation to promote more safety on the International Space Station--\nproudly so--legislation that was ultimately passed and I believe has \nmade the space station more enduring, to be able to suggest that this \nbill limits to a certain extent the safety requirements that I believe \nwould make this industry a better industry, to say also that we are \nhighlighting or offering the commercial space industry over the \ninvestment in NASA, which I have great concern, as we look forward to \nthe implementation of the Orion and the opportunities for further space \nexploration.\n  I would want to make sure that this legislation does not undermine \nour work with NASA and, frankly, that the safety elements that are so \nimportant, not only to the civilian population--because I have \ncommercial space entities in Texas just a few hundred miles away from \nHouston, Texas, but I also have the NASA Johnson Space Center--and I \nwould want to know whether or not there is a conflict between the \nsafety\n\n[[Page H3517]]\n\nrequirements that we have to implement and the safety requirements and \nsecurity requirements in commercial space exploration.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. The other thing that I would offer to suggest, as \nthis bill moves to the Senate, is the investments that are made, the \nprofits that may ultimately be made by commercial space exploration, it \nwould be appropriate to use those moneys to invest in R and the \nFederal Government for it to continue its very important, unrestrained \nresearch that has been so mighty to helping so many different people \nunder NASA.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman for yielding, but I would ask the \nquestion: Can we not provide a safety matrix for commercial space \nexploration as we have done in the public sector?\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Chairman, several weeks ago, we passed a NASA \nauthorization bill that returns NASA to its core mission, human space \nflight.\n  The bill before us, H.R. 2262, builds on that good work. We have many \nAmerican businesses employing thousands of American workers right now. \nThese businesses are pursuing their own space missions, both orbital \nand suborbital.\n  Some of these entrepreneurs have plans to reach below low Earth \norbit, such as taking the first steps toward missions to mine asteroids \nfor precious metals. This landmark legislation will do more to secure \nAmerica as the home of commercial space exploration than any other \nlegislation that Congress has considered. These endeavors are a great \ncomplement to Federal investments in civil and military space \ninitiatives.\n  Let's face it, in any field, no American entrepreneur is going to \ninvest billions of dollars of their own money where there is regulatory \nuncertainty. The SPACE Act of 2015 creates a regulatory framework and \nprovides certainty for these privately financed endeavors to take the \nnext steps.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  This legislation will bolster thousands of high-tech American jobs, \nbuilding a stronger economy, advancing technological leadership, and \nstrengthening our Nation's industrial base.\n  I want to recognize the hard work of our colleagues--Majority Leader \nKevin McCarthy, Bill Posey, Dana Rohrabacher, and Jim Bridenstine. \nThese folks have worked hard for several years on key commercial space \nprovisions that have been incorporated into this bill. Their efforts \nwill create an environment for these private sector companies to \nflourish.\n  I would also like to thank our chairman, Lamar Smith, and Space \nSubcommittee chair Steven Palazzo for their leadership in moving this \nlegislation through the committee and in bringing it to the House \nfloor.\n  America has always prospered because we have not stood in the way of \nvisionaries. Rather, we have found a way to enable them to take a \nchance and succeed on their own.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. BABIN. A vote for this bill is a vote to ignite the flame of \ncommercial space and propel the American entrepreneurial spirit beyond \nour world and into the final frontier of space. Passing this bill tells \nthe world that America is the home for commercial space.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to be really, really clear with the American people \nbecause I think sometimes we talk about the commercial space industry \nas though it exists on its own. In fact, it exists because the Federal \nGovernment and Federal taxpayers have been incredibly generous for this \ninnovative, creative, and growing industry. It is because, as \ntaxpayers, Mr. Chairman, we support the industry.\n  $3 billion alone in inflation-adjusted dollars goes as a backstop for \nindemnification, which is in case there is an accident or whatever--a \n$3 billion backstop by the Federal taxpayer. Billions of dollars have \ngone into the development as the industry has grown. Indeed, some \nprojections say that 9 of every 10 dollars that have gone into the \ndevelopment have actually come from the American taxpayer. Hundreds of \nmillions of dollars support the infrastructure, the launch facilities \nthat are maintained for the industry and--who knows?--countless dollars \nfrom State tax credits on down the line.\n  It would be really inaccurate to say that any of us--Republicans or \nDemocrats or any American taxpayer--does not support the commercial \nspace industry. We want it to be safe. We want to make sure that \nliability is taken care of. We want to make sure that, in fact, the \nskin in the game of the taxpayers is met with responsible public \npolicy. To correct the record, it is $243 million that the Republican \nmajority has actually cut from Commercial Crew.\n  Again, I would say, if you support the industry, then please explain \nwhy it is that you have also supported a cut to the very thing that \nwould continue to grow the industry.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Stewart). The gentleman from California has \n11\\1/2\\ minutes remaining. The gentlewoman from Maryland has 7 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, let me note that the commercial space \nindustry has not cost us taxpayers' money. The commercial space \nindustry has generated billions and billions of dollars worth of income \nto honest citizens who then pay their taxes--who wouldn't have jobs \notherwise--not to mention, of course, the billions of dollars the \ncommercial space industry has saved us simply by doing a more efficient \njob at launching satellites and at supplying the space station than \ncould be done by the public sector--by NASA and other government \nemployees.\n  H.R. 2262, the SPACE Act of 2015, builds on the House Science, Space, \nand Technology's bipartisan tradition of promoting economic growth in \nAmerica. Today, we are talking about that economic growth in terms of \nan emerging, new, entrepreneurial industry that is tremendously \nbeneficial to the bottom line of America--the billions of dollars that \nit is creating with a new, innovative approach to an industry that goes \ninto space in order to accomplish its missions. The SPACE Act of 2015 \nspecifically continues the streamlined regulatory regime that Congress \nput in place for commercial human spaceflight just a decade ago in the \nCommercial Space Launch Amendments Act of 2004.\n  I am proud to have been the one to have authored that legislation, \nlegislation which passed in Congress with bipartisan support. I would \nhope that bipartisan support continues because, in 2004, it was Bart \nGordon of Tennessee and Nick Lampson of Texas--both Democrats--who made \nit possible for us to get this legislation passed as well as Silvestre \nReyes from Texas. Of course, there are a lot of Texans here today \ninvolved in this debate because there are a lot of people in Texas who \nare hired and who have great jobs because of what we did then.\n  When we talk about and when we hear that we have cut $243 million, \nno, no. We were willing to keep that in the budget. Republicans would \nhave been willing if we had found other areas that had been less \nimportant. But the reason these things happen is that our colleagues on \nthe other side of the aisle cannot seem to prioritize. We prioritize \nthis.\n  Mr. Chairman, we prioritize launching new industries, creating new \njobs, saving billions of dollars in money that would be spent \notherwise, because the commercial space industry, like SpaceX and other \nchampions of space entrepreneurship, has done a great deal of benefit \nto the United States of America.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I just want to be very, very clear. I was not originally much of a \nsupporter\n\n[[Page H3518]]\n\nbefore I knew anything about the industry. I didn't know about the \nindustry. Indeed, it was through the bipartisan work on the Science, \nSpace, and Technology Committee that I got to know the industry and to \nvalue the role that the commercial space industry plays.\n  I, actually, don't have a quibble with the American taxpayers in \ntheir providing the kind of support in the development work and in \nresources that are available through NASA to support the industry. I, \nactually, think it is a good thing for us to do. But I don't want to \nhide the fact that, given that and that kind of responsibility, it is \nalso our responsibility to provide an important safety framework for \nthe industry to proceed, especially as we go into the future, imagining \nthat we will have many other players.\n  I would also say that I am concerned about what we do around \nliability--how we create both a safety regulatory regime but also place \nliability where it belongs. Although, in the manager's amendment, the \nmajority does try to deal with the question of Federal court \njurisdiction, what we don't deal with is this idea of cross-waivers. \nThat is, if you are a passenger--you could be a researcher, not anyone \nwho is particularly wealthy--and if something happens, then you have \nwaived all of your liability even in a case where there would be \nnegligence involved. This, I think, ought to raise great concerns.\n\n  The reality is that, at the end of the day, if there is any kind of \ncatastrophic accident, the American taxpayers will, of course, bear the \nresponsibility as we always have for those accidents.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My friend on the other side makes a good point in that a lot of \npeople may not know about spaceflight or commercial spaceflight, and \nthey may not know about this bill. That is why this is a great \nopportunity to explain, and that is why the majority on this side gave \nthe bill to the minority last October. Unfortunately, it was 5 months \nbefore anything came back.\n  There is one point that was brought up--indemnification. That has \nbeen extended 9 times in the last 25 years, and it has never been used. \nThe one thing that needs to be noted is that we are in competition with \nthe rest of the world. We are more stringent in this than is any other \ncountry with their space. If we plan on being the leader, we need to \nhave the legislation move forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. \nPosey).\n  Mr. POSEY. I thank the majority leader for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, earlier this morning, during debate, there have been a \nnumber of letters--a litany of letters--by various organizations \noffered for the Record, so I thought it would be appropriate, in the \ninterest of intellectual honesty, actually, to enter a couple of \nrecords myself.\n  Let me read from one of them here:\n\n       On May 13, 2015, the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology conducted a markup of four critical space-related \n     bills. Among the bills considered was H.R. 1508, the Space \n     Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015. During the \n     markup--I will leave the Member's name out--submitted a \n     letter for the record from Joanne Gabrynowicz, a former \n     professor of space law at the University of Mississippi. \n     After reviewing the letter, we, the undersigned, feel it is \n     important to clarify some errors in Ms. Gabrynowicz' \n     interpretation of H.R. 1508 and to highlight some \n     constructive elements of the bill. There is a duplicate bill \n     in the Senate cosponsored by Senators Patty Murray and Marco \n     Rubio. Our comments apply to both.\n       The basic claims made in the letter rest on two issues: an \n     allegation that the bill violates article II of the Outer \n     Space Treaty and an allegation that the U.S. Government has \n     no licensing regime in place for commercial space activities \n     envisioned by the bill.\n       Both statements are based on a misreading of the intent and \n     words of the bill.\n\n  They go on with another four or five pages to clarify what was \ncompletely misleading there.

Among the bills considered was H.R. 1508, the Space \n     Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015. During the \n     markup Ranking Member Johnson submitted a letter for the \n     record from Joanne Gabrynowicz, a former professor of space \n     law at the University of Mississippi. After reviewing the \n     letter we, the undersigned, feel it is important to clarify \n     some errors in Ms. Gabrynowicz's interpretation of H.R. 1508 \n     and highlight some constructive elements of H.R. 1508. There \n     is a duplicate bill in the Senate, S. 976, co-sponsored by \n     Senators Patty Murray and Marco Rubio. Our comments, below, \n     apply to both H.R. 1508 and S. 976.\n       The basic claims made in the letter commenting on H.R. 1508 \n     and, by extension, S. 976 rest on two issues:\n       1. An allegation that the bill violates Article II of the \n     Outer Space Treaty (OST), and\n       2. An allegation that the U.S. Government has no licensing \n     regime in place for commercial space activities envisioned by \n     the bill.\n       Both statements are based on a misreading of the intent and \n     words of the bill.\n       1. With regard to the allegation that the bill violate the \n     OST by enabling national appropriation:\n       The bill does not grant U.S. jurisdiction to an asteroid or \n     any asteroid resource. It does grant U.S. jurisdiction to \n     companies that fall under U.S. jurisdiction as specifically \n     defined in Sec. 51301 with the intent of adjudicating claims \n     of ``harmful interference'' between those companies if such \n     allegations are made in the future. Protecting entities from \n     ``harmful interference'' is consistent with, and indeed \n     furthers, the purposes of the OST, that requires ``due \n     regard'' be given to other's space activities and requires \n     advance consultations if a proposed activity ``would cause \n     potentially harmful interference.''\n       The letter states that the bill is addressing ``unextracted \n     resources.'' In fact, there are several steps: identifying \n     the resources, extracting resources, and then using/\n     delivering them. The words of the bill are ``resources \n     obtained'', leaving the unknown technical details to be \n     specified in the future when they can be better defined and a \n     process can be developed for regulatory actions as needed. In \n     any event, ``obtained'' is inconsistent with ``unextracted.''\n       The use of the word ``in situ'' in defining space resources \n     simply means resources in place in outer space; but any such \n     resource within or on an asteroid would need to be \n     ``obtained'' in order to confer a property right. The use of \n     the word ``in situ'' in merely defining a space resource in \n     the bill is not equivalent to claiming sovereignty or control \n     over celestial bodies or portions of space. Further, there is \n     clear Congressional direction in the bill that the President \n     is only to encourage space resources exploration and \n     utilization, including lowering barriers to such activity, \n     ``consistent with'' and ``in accordance with'' US \n     international obligations--which precludes Ms. Grabynowicz' \n     interpretation of the impact of the term ``in situ.''\n       The bill does not, in any manner, claim sovereignty over a \n     celestial body or portions of outer space; it only provides \n     for rights for private entities to use the resources on a \n     celestial body (specifically asteroids) just as States have \n     in the past. Article I of the Outer Space Treaty states that \n     ``the Moon and other celestial bodies, shall be free for \n     exploration and use by all States''. This Article has been \n     interpreted as allowing for the extraction of natural \n     resources.\n       Examples: return of Moon rocks and soil by U.S. and Russia \n     (Soviet Union); return of asteroid materials by Japan. Each \n     government has declared that these are their property and has \n     enforced that action:\n       United States Government has treated the theft of moon \n     rocks as a criminal offense\n       Russia has in the past put moon rocks up for a public \n     auction\n       Japan has put its asteroid materials in a Japanese museum A \n     customary international law of the right to claim ownership \n     over extracted natural resources has emerged due to the \n     collections of moon rocks by the United States and the \n     subsequent gifting of these rocks to foreign nationals \n     without any objections from any states.\n       In the ``One Lucite Ball'' case, the United States District \n     Court for the Southern District of Florida, Miami Division, \n     upheld the right of Honduras to assert ownership over a moon \n     rock (unpublished Case No. 01-0116-CIV-JORDAN). The court \n     discussed two sales of lunar rock samples involving private \n     parties (one involving a slide of lunar dust sold at \n     Sotheby's auction and the second involving the lunar sample \n     and plaque given by the U.S. to Nicaragua that was purchased \n     by a private buyer from the middle east).\n\n[[Page H3519]]\n\n       The NASA proposed Asteroid Recovery Mission involves \n     similar technologies and the current proposal is to move a \n     boulder from an asteroid to a lunar orbit. Some of these \n     activities may be done in partnership with private entities \n     in the United States.\n       These activities, ranging from scientific missions to \n     commercial sales have never been judged to be in violation of \n     Article II of the OST.\n       If governments and private companies are ever going to \n     ``use'' space for benefits to all humankind, the extraction \n     of resources from celestial bodies will have to be allowed, \n     and this foreseeable future is provided for in the space \n     treaties. There is no prohibition on private entities or \n     profit-making entities performing these services either for \n     themselves or for their governments.\n       However, government(s) are responsible for the continuing \n     supervision of non-government activities in outer space (Art. \n     VI of the OST), and the United States Government has the most \n     complete and comprehensive set of regulations for space in \n     the world.\n       There already exist regulatory requirements for commercial \n     companies that want to get to space and to use space. The \n     particular U.S. regulatory mechanisms vary with each \n     application but include launch payload reviews, spectrum/\n     communications approvals, and, when appropriate, national \n     security and export control approvals.\n       Since there are a variety of related new proposed \n     activities in outer space (e.g. on-orbit satellite servicing) \n     proposing a specific licensing requirement for resource \n     utilization alone in this bill would be inappropriate until \n     all new activities are reviewed together.\n       The required report in the bill is the first step in \n     developing new procedures and processes for activities in \n     outer space that have not been done before by private \n     entities.\n       The criticism that this bill is to meet ``national needs'' \n     alone is incorrect. Those words are taken out of the context \n     of Sec. 51302. That section focuses on what the Federal \n     agencies should do to encourage private activities in space \n     and refers to the economic incentives for those companies. \n     The global needs and information obtained from the science \n     and technology behind resource extraction and use may indeed \n     benefit all humankind through knowledge, through the future \n     global provision of currently scarce minerals, and through \n     expanded space exploration. Further, private foreign \n     companies subject to the jurisdiction of the United States--\n     and thus facing exposure to non-interference claims--also can \n     be beneficiaries of non-interference rights under the bill.\n       Last month the U.S. State Department made a statement at \n     the United Nations Committee On the Peaceful Uses of Outer \n     Space (COPUOS) that clearly outlines a responsible path to \n     balancing the requirements of our Treaty obligations with the \n     needs of new commercial entities in space:\n\n       ``My Government sees great promise in private investment in \n     path-breaking new activities to advance our understanding of \n     the solar system and to unlock new space applications that \n     benefit all mankind. The history of space exploration--and \n     innovation--teaches us that it is difficult, if not \n     impossible, to foresee the technological innovations, and \n     downstream applications, arising from efforts to push the \n     envelope of exploration--and that the benefits of these \n     innovations and applications are enjoyed across the Earth. As \n     the United States goes about encouraging private investment--\n     from all nations--in the peaceful exploration and use of \n     outer space, and evolves its national mechanisms for \n     authorizing and supervising non-governmental space \n     activities, we will continue to be guided by the four core, \n     and widely accepted, treaties on space--the Outer Space \n     Treaty, the Rescue and Return Agreement, and the Liability \n     and Registration Conventions. Under the legal framework of \n     these treaties, the use of space by nations, international \n     organizations, and private entities has flourished. As a \n     result, space technology and services contribute immeasurably \n     to economic growth and improvements in the quality of life \n     around the world.'' [Emphasis added]\n\n       The Space Resource Exploration and Utilization Act is in \n     complete compliance with all existing international \n     obligations of the United States. The bill further insists \n     that actions taken pursuant to the bill, both by the \n     Executive Branch and U.S. commercial space resource \n     utilization entities (to benefit from non-interference \n     rights), be consistent with international obligations of the \n     United States. The bill also compliments and furthers the \n     position of the Executive Branch. As Ms. Gabrynowicz notes in \n     her letter regarding the Presidential report requirement, \n     ``This may be sufficient.'' Indeed, it is not only sufficient \n     but the most pragmatic path forward for the U.S. Government \n     to create a process, informed by industry and international \n     concerns, that creates the legal framework necessary to meet \n     our existing international obligations. Creating such a legal \n     framework right now would be shortsighted and likely hamper \n     or destroy our growing space resource industry. Placing a \n     legal framework in this bill is not needed to meet any \n     current United States international obligations. There are \n     adequate interim means of meeting those obligations through \n     existing authorities should new activities in outer space \n     begin before constructing a new legal framework.\n       The U.S., between 1980 and the effective date of the \n     Commercial Space Launch Act, October 1984, set precedents for \n     OST-compliant control in the absence of explicit legislation \n     or activity-specific regulation. Two suborbital launch \n     vehicles were privately developed and tested in the U.S. \n     during that time period, Space Services Inc.'s Percheron \n     (1980) and Arc Technologies' (later Starstruck, Inc.'s) \n     Dolphin (1983-84). The U.S. Government licensed both \n     activities. In each case, the Government used existing \n     regulatory requirements and mechanisms (FAA airspace control, \n     FCC radio licenses, OMC export permits) to review the \n     proposed activities and impose conditions such as liability \n     insurance on the launch operators. Lessons learned from these \n     licensing exercises were incorporated in the drafting of the \n     Commercial Space Launch Act.\n       Therefore, there is U.S. precedent for control of space \n     activities, adequate to satisfy OST requirements for \n     supervision and control, even in the absence of specific \n     statutory law or regulation describing the particulars of the \n     activity in question. Using these interim mechanisms can \n     serve to provide an experience base for crafting better \n     legislation subsequently.\n       In summary, the bill is a necessary step to begin to \n     address our obligations of continuing supervision for \n     commercial space activities and to fulfill our commitments \n     under the terms of the OST.\n       It is also important to note the many constructive things \n     that H.R. 1508 and S. 976 accomplish:\n       1. Advance U.S. Technology and Leadership\n       a. H.R. 1508 and S. 976 provide a legal foundation that \n     provides private U.S. companies to ability to raise funds, \n     protect their investments, employ aerospace professionals, \n     and develop cutting edge aerospace technologies.\n       b. Other nations, such as China and Russia, have stated an \n     intent to recover resources from objects in space. H.R. 1508 \n     and S. 976 give U.S. industry a legal foundation that \n     provides a head start to compete with these nations.\n       2. Create Constructive Dialogue for International \n     Frameworks for Commercial Space Resource Exploration and \n     Utilization\n       a. As stated by the U.S. delegate to COPUOS, the U.S. will \n     need to develop a framework that meets existing international \n     obligations and creates an environment in which all nations \n     can benefit from space resource exploration and utilization. \n     H.R. 1508 and S. 976 allow the U.S. to lead and direct this \n     international discussion.\n       A failure to pass H.R. 1508 and S. 976 will create \n     uncertainty about the U.S. Government's position on space \n     resource exploration and utilization. This uncertainty would \n     be extremely detrimental to our developing space resource \n     industry and it would provide encouragement for other nations \n     to challenge our leadership in this area.\n       It is apparent that considerable effort has gone into \n     drafting H.R. 1508 and S. 976. These bills create a valid \n     legal foundation to begin the processes necessary to create \n     informed oversight mechanisms, which are required by the \n     treaties, and are in compliance with all existing U.S. \n     international obligations.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               Henry R. Hertzfeld,\n               Co-Chair of the American Branch, International Law \n              Association, Research Professor of Space Policy and \n           International Affairs, Elliott School of International \n      Affairs and Adjunct Professor of Law, The George Washington \n                                                       University.\n                                                 Matthew Schaefer,\n          Law Alumni Professor of Law, Director--Space, Cyber and \n           Telecommunications Law Program, University of Nebraska \n       College of Law, Co-Chair, American Branch of International \n                                  Law Assoc.--Space Law Committee.\n                                     James C.

There is a similar letter, and I will submit that also. It \nis by Dennis J. Burnett, District of Columbia Bar Association; J.D., \nUniversity of Nebraska; LL.M., Georgetown University; Adjunct Professor \nof Law, University of Nebraska College of Law--U.S. Trade Law and \nCommercial Space Law; Vice Chairman, Advisory Board, Space, Cyber and \nTelecom Program, University of Nebraska College of Law; Secretary and \nDirector, International Institute of Space Law.\n\n                                                     May 16, 2015.\n       Dear Majority Leader McCarthy, Chairman Smith, Ranking \n     Member Johnson, Chairman Palazzo, and Ranking Member Edwards: \n     On May 13, 2015, the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology conducted a mark-up of four critical space-related \n     bills. Among the bills considered was H.R. 1508, the Space \n     Resource Exploration and Utilization Act of 2015.\n       During the markup Ranking Member Eddie Bernice Johnson \n     submitted a letter for the record from Joanne Gabrynowicz, \n     Professor Emerita of space law at the University of \n     Mississippi. After reviewing H.R. 1508 and Professor \n     Gabrynowicz's letter, I would like to comment on several \n     issues of international law related to the proposed \n     legislation.\n\n[[Page H3520]]\n\n       In particular, I will comment on the following issues: (1) \n     whether recognition of property rights in asteroid resources \n     would result in a ``national appropriation'' in violation of \n     Article II of the Treaty on Principles Governing the \n     Activities of States in the Exploration and Use of Outer \n     Space, Including the Moon and other Celestial Bodies (the \n     ``Outer Space Treaty''); and (2) whether the absence of the \n     creation of a licensing regime by H.R. 1508 would result in a \n     failure to authorize and supervise the activities of \n     nationals of the United States in the exploration and use of \n     outer space as is required by Article VI of the Outer Space \n     Treaty.\n       Is the use of asteroid resources and acquisition of \n     property rights in asteroid resources is not a violation of \n     Article II of the Outer Space Treaty?\n       It should be clearly stated that there is no provision of \n     the Outer Space Treaty that explicitly prohibits the \n     acquisition of property rights in asteroid resources. To the \n     contrary, the Outer Space Treaty explicitly recognize the \n     right of ``exploration and use'' of outer space, including \n     the moon and other celestial bodies. A right of use is a \n     well-recognized property right in both common law and civil \n     law.\n       While it may be asserted that granting property rights in \n     asteroid resources is a national appropriation, this \n     assertion is inconsistent with state practice. For example, \n     Moon rocks and soil returned to the Earth by U.S. and Russia \n     (Soviet Union), and asteroid materials return to Earth by \n     Japan have been treated as property of those governments. The \n     United States has prosecuted theft of moon rocks and Russia \n     has auctioned moon rocks. These actions have never been \n     judged to be in violation of Article II of the Outer Space \n     Treaty.\n       Does the absence of a licensing regime in H.R. 1508 result \n     in a failure to authorize and supervise the activities of \n     nationals of the United States in violation of Article VI of \n     the Outer Space Treaty?\n       It is quite clear that Article VI of the Outer Space Treaty \n     requires the United States to authorize and supervise the \n     activities of its nationals in outer space. It also is clear \n     that H.R. 1508 does not authorize any executive agency or any \n     independent commission to regulate (i.e., authorize and \n     supervise) the activities of U.S. nationals in outer space \n     that are not already regulated.\n       It is my understanding that there are a variety of new \n     proposed activities in outer space (e.g on-orbit satellite \n     servicing, space tourism, moon habitation, solar satellites, \n     etc.). It may be argued that these activities need \n     appropriate authorization and supervision by the United \n     States if conducted by nationals of the United States. At \n     this time it appears that there is no agreement on basic \n     issues of what authority is required, which agency, if any, \n     should authorize and supervise, which agency should have \n     which responsibility and what resources would be required to \n     implement those responsibilities.\n       In lieu of imposing a solution when the problem is not \n     fully understood, it is my understanding that the drafters of \n     H.R. 1508 propose that the President prepare a report to \n     Congress as the first step in developing new procedures and \n     processes for activities in outer space for which there may \n     be no existing agency authority to authorize and supervise. \n     It appears that the drafters are attempting to create a valid \n     legal foundation to begin the processes necessary to create \n     appropriate mechanisms for any authorization and supervision \n     that may be required by the Outer Space Treaty and other \n     existing U.S. international obligations.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                                Dennis J. Burnett.\n\n  Mr. POSEY. I think that, clearly, they reflect that there has been \nsome misleading information put forth in objecting to this bill, and I \nurge my colleagues to take that into consideration and to vote \nfavorably for this badly needed historic and constructive legislation \nto make America's space program and commercial space industry much \nbetter.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Just for the record, I would note that the letters that have been \nsubmitted by the majority are interesting. I would note that one of the \nauthors, in fact, is paid by one of the companies that is involved in \nthis legislation, so we should take that into consideration.\n  I also want to point out that, with respect to indemnification, \nagain, the United States in current--today's--dollars bears a \nresponsibility for about $3 billion in indemnification should there be \nan accident.\n  Lastly, of course, it is really important for us to understand that \nthese liability concerns are not small potatoes. In fact, the Judiciary \nCommittee should have taken a look at this when it came to looking at \nFederal court jurisdiction. We should have had additional hearings on \nthis when it comes to looking at the impact on international treaties. \nWe have not had any hearings in that regard. I just think we ought to \nproceed more responsibly.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Lucas).\n  Mr. LUCAS. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support H.R. 2262, the \nSpurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of \n2015, or the SPACE Act.\n  Since 2004, when Congress last amended the Commercial Space Launch \nAct, commercial space companies have made significant contributions to \nspace technology development and helped to strengthen American \nleadership in space. Congress must keep up with the changes in the \nindustry, and the CSLA needs to be updated to ensure that the space \nsector can flourish in the years to come.\n  Currently, all major spacefaring nations require some form of third-\nparty liability insurance for launching entities. The indemnification \nregime of the CSLA expires next year. The act would extend \nindemnification to 2025 in order to prevent U.S. launches from going \noverseas and taking high-tech American jobs with them.\n  In a letter praising the act's extension of the indemnification, Tom \nStroup, president of the Satellite Industry Association, wisely stated \nthat the act is ``an important step in maintaining U.S. innovation and \nleadership in satellite launch and one that promotes overall access to \nspace.'' Several other groups, such as the Commercial Spaceflight \nFederation, have had similar comments praising the extension.\n  Moreover, this bill promotes stability and flexibility in the \ncommercial space market through regulatory reform. By extending the \nlearning period to 2025, the Federal Aviation Administration and \nindustry will have more time to collect information and develop a \nsafety framework for commercial spaceflight. This will ensure that the \ngrowing commercial space market will not be overburdened with \nuninformed regulations.\n  Space-based technology has become a vital part of our economy. \nAmericans rely on it every day, from GPS to weather forecasting to land \nremote sensing, in everything we do.\n  The SPACE Act gives the private sector a chance to expand this \ngrowing portion of our economy by allowing commercial spaceflight \ncompanies to take passengers to and from space and by setting the \ngroundwork for a comprehensive safety framework that will guide future \nspacefaring activities.\n  Now is not the time to turn our backs on the innovators and the \nentrepreneurs who have made this Nation great. If we care about \nAmerican leadership in space and the American space economy, I urge you \nto support this important piece of legislation.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers, and I yield \nmyself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise here today because, as I said in my opening \nremarks, that I think that most of us on both sides of the aisle share \nthe excitement about the commercial space industry and we do indeed \nwant it to succeed.\n  We all work for the taxpayer; and the American taxpayer, as I have \nstated, has a vested interest in the commercial space industry because \nwe have laid out hundreds of millions of dollars, billions of dollars \nto support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, the Senate yesterday marked up a bipartisan compromise \nbill with very few changes to it. On the other hand, this bill, if it \npasses the House unchanged, is going to be dead in the water. But if we \npass the substitute that we are considering later on, that I offer \nlater today, we will have a great chance to do some real lawmaking. It \nwill not have addressed all of the industry concerns. It will not have \ndone anything to get in the way of the advance of commercial space.\n  So I urge my fellow Members to support a bipartisan process that \nbegan over in the Senate. Vote for the substitute amendment later on \nand say, you know, we can start fresh here, not with something that \njust disadvantages consumers and taxpayers. Let's try to be on the same \npage when it comes to the strong support that I think each side feels \nwith respect to the commercial space industry.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I have one question for everyone here: Do you believe America is \nexceptional?\n\n[[Page H3521]]\n\n  Fifty-four years ago, President Kennedy spoke to a joint session of \nCongress in this very Chamber, and he set forth an astounding goal: to \nput an American on the Moon before the end of the decade.\n  Many doubted our ability to do that. But like America has done \nthroughout our history, we proved them wrong. So on July 20, 1969, Neil \nArmstrong took one small step and changed the course of history.\n  You see, President Kennedy's vision is part of America's fundamental \ncharacter. We are pioneers. We always move forward. We never back down \nfrom a challenge, and beating the odds is in our DNA.\n  This was the case for our very founding. We brought forth a new \nnation in pursuit of a more perfect union. With the winds of freedom at \nour back, we headed west to unchartered lands, relying on the same \nspirit of adventure that endures in the Central Valley of California to \nthis day.\n  We watched as two bicycle repairmen flew above the sand and waves on \na beach in North Carolina, not because of government grants or \nWashington connections, but because they had the audacity to make a \ndream a reality.\n  Today, dorm room startups and tech entrepreneurs are connecting our \nentire world, paving the way to tomorrow.\n  The world looks to America because we give them a reason to look to \nus. We show them a vision of the future, and we deliver. But we can't \ntake our global leadership and innovation for granted. Today we pay \nRussia $70 million for one seat on their rocket.\n  Right now there is a new generation of pioneers. They want to embark \non the next stage of space exploration, and we should not hold them \nback. The truth is Washington never comes up with the next big idea, \nbut we can support those innovators who do and create the best \nenvironment possible for them to succeed.\n  Steve Jobs, one of America's great innovators, once said ``innovation \ndistinguishes between a leader and a follower.'' That is true for \npeople and for a country. Those words carry special meaning for \neveryone who ever dared to venture off the beaten path. It means \nsomething to the small-business owners working at their kitchen tables \nand the inventors tinkering in the dorm rooms and garages. It means \nsomething to every kid who ever dreamed of space and who still dreams \nof leading us in a journey to the stars.\n  So for all American pioneers, those who will lead our Nation through \nthe 21st century, I again ask: Do you believe America is exceptional? \nBecause I do.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, printed in the bill, \nit shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of \namendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-17.

INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH COMPETITIVENESS.\n\n       (a) Purpose.--The purpose of this section is to provide for \n     updating the methodology used to calculate the maximum \n     probable loss from claims under section 50914 of title 51, \n     United States Code, with a validated risk profile approach to \n     provide reasonable maximum probable loss values associated \n     with potential third party losses from commercially licensed \n     launches. An appropriately updated methodology will help \n     ensure that the Federal Government is not exposed to greater \n     financial risks than intended and that launch companies are \n     not required to purchase more insurance coverage than \n     necessary.\n       (b) Maximum Probable Loss Plan.--Not later than 180 days \n     after the date of enactment of this Act, the Secretary of \n     Transportation shall provide to the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the \n     Senate a plan to update the methodology used to calculate \n     maximum probable loss from claims under section 50914 of \n     title 51, United States Code, through the use of a validated \n     risk profile approach. Such plan shall include, at a \n     minimum--\n       (1) an evaluation of the reasonableness of the current \n     single casualty estimate and, if needed, the steps the \n     Secretary will take to update such estimate;\n       (2) an evaluation, in consultation with the Administrator \n     of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration and the \n     heads of other relevant executive agencies, of the \n     reasonableness of the dollar value of the insurance \n     requirement required by the Secretary for launch providers to \n     cover damage to Government property resulting from a \n     commercially licensed space launch activity, and \n     recommendations as to a reasonable calculation if, as \n     determined by the Secretary, the current statutory threshold \n     is insufficient;\n       (3) a schedule of when updates to the methodology and \n     calculations for the totality of the Maximum Probable Loss \n     will be implemented, and a detailed explanation of any \n     changes to the current calculation; and\n       (4) consideration of the impact of the cost of its \n     implementation on the licensing process, both in terms of the \n     cost to industry of collecting and providing the requisite \n     data and cost to the Government of analyzing the data.\n       (c) Independent Assessment.--Not later than 270 days after \n     transmittal of the plan under subsection (b), the Comptroller \n     General shall provide to the Committee on Science, Space, and \n     Technology of the House of Representatives and the Committee \n     on Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate an \n     assessment of--\n       (1) the conclusions and analysis provided by the Secretary \n     of Transportation in the plan required under subsection (b);\n       (2) the implementation schedule proposed by the Secretary \n     in such plan;\n       (3) the suitability of the plan for implementation; and\n       (4) any further actions needed to implement the plan or \n     otherwise accomplish the purpose of this section.\n       (d) Launch Liability Extension.--Section 50915(f) of title \n     51, United States Code, is amended by striking ``December 31, \n     2016'' and inserting ``December 31, 2025''.\n\n     SEC. 103. LAUNCH LICENSE FLEXIBILITY.\n\n       Section 50906 of title 51, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (d), by striking ``launched or \n     reentered'' and inserting ``launched or reentered under that \n     permit'';\n       (2) by amending subsection (d)(1) to read as follows:\n       ``(1) research and development to test design concepts, \n     equipment, or operating techniques;'';\n       (3) in subsection (d)(3), by striking ``prior to obtaining \n     a license'';\n       (4) in subsection (e)(1), by striking ``suborbital rocket \n     design'' and inserting ``suborbital rocket or rocket \n     design''; and\n       (5) by amending subsection (g) to read as follows:\n       ``(g) The Secretary may issue a permit under this section \n     notwithstanding any license issued under this chapter.

ORBITAL TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that, as none currently exists, there may be a need for a \n     framework that addresses space traffic management of United \n     States Government assets and United States private sector \n     assets to minimize the proliferation of debris and decrease \n     the congestion of the orbital environment.\n       (b) Study Required.--Not later than 90 days after the date \n     of enactment of this Act, the Administrator of the National \n     Aeronautics and Space Administration shall enter into an \n     arrangement with an independent, private systems engineering \n     and technical assistance organization to study frameworks for \n     the management of space traffic and orbital activities. The \n     study shall include the following:\n       (1) An assessment of current regulations, Government best \n     practices, and industry standards that apply to space traffic \n     management and orbital debris mitigation.\n       (2) An assessment of current statutory authority granted to \n     the Federal Communications Commission, the Federal Aviation \n     Administration, and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \n     Administration and how those agencies utilize and coordinate \n     those authorities.\n       (3) A review of all space traffic management and orbital \n     debris requirements under treaties and other international \n     agreements to which the United States is a signatory, and \n     other nonbinding international arrangements in which the \n     United States participates, and the manner in which the \n     Federal Government complies with those requirements.\n       (4) An assessment of existing Federal Government assets \n     used to conduct space traffic management and space \n     situational awareness.\n       (5) An assessment of the risk associated with smallsats as \n     well as any necessary Government coordination for their \n     launch and utilization.\n\n[[Page H3523]]\n\n       (6) An assessment of existing private sector information \n     sharing activities associated with space situational \n     awareness and space traffic management.\n       (7) Recommendations related to the framework for the \n     protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the public \n     and economic vitality of the space industry.\n       (c) Report to Congress.--Not later than 1 year after the \n     date of enactment of this Act, the Administrator shall \n     provide to the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology of \n     the House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate the report required \n     in subsection (b).\n       (d) Department of Defense Authorities.--Congress recognizes \n     the vital and unique role played by the Department of Defense \n     in protecting national security assets in space. Nothing in \n     this section shall be construed to amend authorities granted \n     to the Department of Defense to safeguard the national \n     security.\n\n     SEC. 109. STATE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH FACILITIES.\n\n       It is the Sense of Congress that State involvement, \n     development, ownership, and operation of launch facilities \n     can help enable growth of the Nation's commercial suborbital \n     and orbital space endeavors and support both commercial and \n     Government space programs. It is further the sense of \n     Congress that State launch facilities and the people and \n     property within the affected launch areas of those State \n     facilities are subject to risks if the commercial launch \n     vehicle fails or experiences an anomaly. To ensure the \n     success of the commercial launch industry and the safety of \n     the people and property in the affected launch areas, it is \n     the further sense of Congress that States and State launch \n     facilities should seek to take proper measures to secure \n     their investments and the safety of third parties from \n     potential damages that could be suffered from commercial \n     launch activities.\n\n     SEC. 110. SPACE SUPPORT VEHICLES STUDY.\n\n       Not less than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General shall submit to the Committee on \n     Science, Space, and Technology of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate, a report on the use of space \n     support vehicle services in the commercial space industry. \n     This report shall include--\n       (1) the extent to which launch providers rely on such \n     services as part of their business models;\n       (2) the statutory, regulatory, and market barriers to the \n     use of such services; and\n       (3) recommendations for legislative or regulatory action \n     that may be needed to ensure reduced barriers to the use of \n     such services if such use is a requirement of the industry.\n\n     SEC. 111. STREAMLINE COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH ACTIVITIES.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     eliminating duplicative requirements and approvals for \n     commercial launch and reentry operations will promote and \n     encourage the development of the commercial space sector.\n       (b) Reaffirmation of Policy.--Congress reaffirms that the \n     Secretary of Transportation, in overseeing and coordinating \n     commercial launch and reentry operations, should--\n       (1) promote commercial space launches and reentries by the \n     private sector;\n       (2) facilitate Government, State, and private sector \n     involvement in enhancing U.S. launch sites and facilities;\n       (3) protect public health and safety, safety of property, \n     national security interests, and foreign policy interests of \n     the United States;

Annual reporting.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Smith) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment contains minor \ncorrections to the underlying bill and is generally technical in \nnature. The amendment provides clarity to some of the reports in the \nbill on the learning period, orbital traffic management, commercial \nremote sensing, and the inclusion of classified annexes.\n  Additionally, this amendment ensures that Federal courts handling \nlegal disputes will look to substantive State law to resolve claims \nthat arise from a federally licensed launch.\n  Finally, this amendment includes a reporting requirement from the \nGovernment Accounting Office about the inclusion of State and municipal \nlaunch facilities in the indemnification regime.\n  This technical amendment will improve the clarity of multiple \nsections of the bill and ensure continued support for the growing \ncommercial space industry. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Maryland is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The amendment partially addresses the concerns that we have had with \nthe Federal jurisdiction provision in H.R. 2262. Maintaining ``under \nFederal law'' would have resulted in eliminating the rights of \nindividuals to bring almost any type of legal action against companies \nrelated to commercial spaceflight accidents due to the lack of any \napplicable Federal law.\n  I would also like to highlight another change in the manager's \namendment that goes beyond a technical remedy or a simple \nclarification. The amendment adds a requirement for the Secretary of \nCommerce to provide an annual report on its review of applications for \nlicenses for commercial remote sensing. The manager's amendment now \nmakes accommodation for the inclusion of classified annexes as \nnecessary.\n  Mr. Chair, while this is a necessary addition to protect the \ndisclosure of sensitive or classified information, it is only necessary \nbecause this amendment adds the requirement for the Secretary of \nCommerce to provide information related to the interagency adjudication \nprocess of a commercial remote sensing licensing request.\n  I highlight these two changes because they demonstrate that the \nprocess of developing H.R. 2262 has, in fact, been rushed and not very \nwell thought out. Had we taken the time to hold hearings and sort \nthings out, we actually could have had an opportunity to consider these \nchanges as part of the committee process.\n  That said, I support the chairman's amendment to make some needed \nimprovements to the bill, though I firmly believe it still needs an \nawful lot more work.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Grijalva\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part A House Report 114-127.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 9, lines 18 through 20, amend paragraph (1) to read as \n     follows:\n       (1) in subsection (d), by striking ``that will be launched \n     or reentered'' and inserting ``or reusable launch vehicles \n     that will be launched into a suborbital trajectory or \n     reentered under that permit'';\n       Page 10, lines 1 and 2, amend paragraph (3) to read as \n     follows:\n       (3) in subsection (d)(3)--\n       (A) by striking ``prior to obtaining a license''; and\n       (B) by inserting ``or vehicle'' after ``design of the \n     rocket'';\n       Page 10, line 5, insert ``, or for a particular reusable \n     launch vehicle or reusable launch vehicle design,'' after \n     ``rocket design''.\n       Page 10, line 5, strike ``and''.\n       Page 10, line 6, redesignate paragraph (5) as paragraph \n     (6).\n       Page 10, after line 5, insert the following new paragraph:\n       (5) in subsection (e)(2), by inserting ``or launch \n     vehicle'' after ``the suborbital rocket'';\n       Page 10, line 11, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; and''.\n       Page 10, after line 11, insert the following new paragraph:\n       (7) in subsection (h), by inserting ``or reusable launch \n     vehicle'' after ``suborbital rocket''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentleman \nfrom Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Arizona.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment to \nsupport and facilitate innovation in cutting-edge American enterprises. \nMy amendment will expand the eligibility for experimental permits for \nreusable rockets to include reusable launch vehicles.\n  Experimental permits currently have three uses: the research and \ndevelopment of new test designs, concepts, equipment, or operating \ntechniques; to show compliance with requirements as part of the process \nfor obtaining a license; or to train crews before they receive a \nlicense for launch or reentry. However, the FAA currently does not have \nthe ability to grant experimental permits for launch vehicles.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Under current law, they are restricted to granting permits for \nreusable suborbital rockets. This can require industry and the Federal \nGovernment to go to extraordinary lengths to find ways to conduct \ntests. In some cases, there is no alternative for testing.\n  Expanding access to these permits will help innovators develop new \nand important technologies right here in America. These permits will \ncreate new opportunities for American businesses and will help harness \nthe tremendous potential of our space exploration industry.\n  I want to thank Chairman Lamar Smith, Ranking Member Eddie Bernice \nJohnson, and their staffs for their assistance with this amendment, and \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, although I don't oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment ensures that the \ncommercial space industry is not pigeonholed into specific vehicle \ndesigns. By allowing different types of vehicles to be included in the \nlaunch license flexibility regime, we will allow the industry to grow, \ninnovate, and continue to improve safety designs.\n  This amendment is reasonable and consistent with the spirit of the \nlicense flexibility provisions of the underlying bill. I support the \ngentleman's amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Rohrabacher\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n\n[[Page H3526]]\n\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 14, after line 12, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 106. INDEPENDENT STUDY OF INDEMNIFICATION FOR SPACE \n                   FLIGHT PARTICIPANTS.\n\n       Not later than 1 year after the date of enactment of this \n     Act, the Comptroller General shall provide to the Committee \n     on Science, Space, and Technology of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate a report detailing the results \n     of a study of the issues associated with space flight \n     participants and potential third party claims that could \n     arise from a potential accident of a commercial licensed \n     launch vehicle or reentry vehicle that is carrying space \n     flight participants. The study shall--\n       (1) identify the issues associated with space flight \n     participants and third party liability;\n       (2) identify options for addressing the issues;\n       (3) identify any potential unintended consequences and \n     issues associated with each of the options; and\n       (4) identify any potential costs to the Federal Government \n     for each of the options.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Rohrabacher) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, my amendment calls for a study \nanalyzing our approach to third-party liability with regard to \nspaceflight participants. The study will identify issues, options to \naddress those issues, consequences of those options, and the potential \ncost to the Federal Government for each option.\n  I would note that the idea for this study was originally put forward \nby Ms. Edwards of Maryland, someone whom I deeply admire and listen to \nwhen she makes her points. We heard her make her points during \ndiscussion with our committee, and I felt it was a very good idea, and \nI am moving forward with it today.\n  The underlying bill includes a legislative fix for third-party \nliability and spaceflight participants. That is what our bill does. \nHowever, a study would see if there is even a better way or if we have \ncovered all of our bases with the fix that is in this bill.\n  Right now, a spaceflight participant is financially at risk if the \nvehicle they fly on has some kind of an incident. It doesn't matter if \nyou are a billionaire or someone who has scrimped for a long time to \nget one of these spaceflights, maybe a contest winner or a science \nteacher who wants to share his experience with students or a scientist \naccompanying their experiment.\n  Right now, these folks aren't just paying the fare; they are \npotentially risking everything that their family owns because they may \nbe liable if something goes wrong.\n  As I say, we have a fix about that in the current bill, but this \nstudy would see if there is a better way, along with some other things \nwe can do, to make that fix better. There is no reason at this point to \nbelieve that this approach is any worse than the other approaches, but \nlet's keep our minds open.\n  Right now, we have a hole in the bridge, and this bill puts a patch \non that hole. Let's see if there is a study to see if there is a better \nway to fix the bridge. In the meantime, we have got something in place \nin this bill--a study--to see if we can do a better job.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment, \nalthough I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Maryland is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. I want to note for the record, though I am not in \nopposition, I think the study is a good idea. Ideally, I would think \nthat Congress would choose to study the thing before it actually passes \nthe law, but that is not where we are today. I think it is a good idea \nto proceed forward with this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. I thank the gentlewoman for giving us the idea for \nthis study in the first place, and I yield 1 minute to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Smith), the chairman of the committee.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. I thank my colleague from California (Mr. \nRohrabacher), a member of the Science, Space, and Technology Committee, \nfor yielding me time.\n  I simply want to say that this amendment requires an independent \nreport about the inclusion of spaceflight participants in the \nindemnification regime. This is an important topic, and gathering \nadditional information on this policy would be helpful for future \nlegislation.\n  Requiring this study is reasonable and consistent with the spirit and \nthe policies of the underlying bill, so I support it.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n             Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Castro of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-127.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 15, line 19, insert ``nonprofit,'' after \n     ``independent,''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Castro) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CASTRO of Texas. Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to thank my \ncolleague from San Antonio, Chairman Lamar Smith, and also follow Texan \nEddie Bernice Johnson, the ranking member, for their work on this bill \nand for consideration of my amendment.\n  My amendment amends the section of the bill concerning the orbital \ntraffic management study. The bill, as written, has the Administrator \nof NASA enter into an agreement with an independent private systems \nengineering and technical assistance organization to study frameworks \nfor the management of space traffic and orbital activities.\n  My amendment would include nonprofits, so that nonprofit independent \nresearch organizations can contribute to this critical work. In \naddition to allowing for private contractors to be part of this \ndiscussion, my amendment would also allow for nonprofits to do the \nsame.\n  In Texas, we have become a hub for space research and exploration. \nSome of the private industries or private businesses doing work in this \nbusiness include Lockheed and Boeing, but there are also wonderful \nnonprofits like the Southwest Research Institute, in our hometown of \nSan Antonio, and the Universities Space Research Association, which is \nbased in Houston. My amendment would allow these nonprofits to also be \npart of this work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nalthough I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the orbital \ntraffic management study in the underlying bill to be conducted by an \nindependent, nonprofit, private systems engineering and technical \nassistance organization.\n  Requiring the study to be done by a nonprofit is reasonable and \nconsistent with the spirit of the study requirement in the underlying \nbill.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's amendment; I support the amendment, and \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Castro).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 5 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-127.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the manager of the bill, the chairman \nof the full committee, and the ranking member of the full committee for \nthe hard work they do on issues that are important to our Nation and \ntheir service to this country. Let me also thank the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards) for her astute leadership on many of these \nissues.\n  Let me as well indicate my commitment to space exploration. As I said \nearlier, I hope that we can work on a number of issues, but I hope we \ncan work together on what I think is an important economic engine for \nthe Nation, first starting with John F. Kennedy's challenge to all of \nus and developing, through President Johnson, the NASA centers across \nAmerica, and the enormous research that has been done by NASA over the \nyears.\n  I remember debating this question of funding for NASA really in the \n1990s and 2000s, talking about the research of heart disease, cancers, \nHIV/AIDS.\n  I say that to say that, as we move into commercial space exploration, \nwe certainly want to make sure that opportunities are given to all of \nAmerica. This is commercial, yes; but the provisions of commercial \nspace work are enhanced by the government in the resources that we \nhave.\n  My amendment is to provide that recognition and to conduct outreach \nto the small-, minority-, and women-owned business community. It \nrequires that the provisions of the bill that address future \nlegislation should include work on how to effectively conduct outreach \nto small business concerns owned and controlled by women and \nminorities.\n  As we have all worked hard to encourage small-business owners to \nproduce jobs, this is a great entrepreneurial effort, and therefore, I \nsupport the initiatives that would increase an outreach to small \nbusinesses and create more jobs.\n  There are approximately 6 million minority-owned businesses in the \nUnited States--representing significant aspects of our economy--and \nmany, many more women and small businesses and other minority-owned \nbusinesses.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member \nJohnson for their efforts to advance our nation's space exploration \nhorizon.\n  I am a firm believer that commercial and government unmanned and \nmanned space exploration complement each other.\n  The Internet was initially a federal government research and \ndevelopment project that transitioned to a commercial and public \nresource that has in less than 2 decades fueled economic opportunities \nfor thousands of U.S. companies large and small.\n  The transition to commercial space exploration will need the \ncollaboration and support of the Federal government to be sure that it \nis inclusive, safe and profitable.\n  The commercial space industry must yield opportunities for all U.S. \nbusinesses, which is why I am offering Jackson Lee Amendment Number 5.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment requires that the provisions of the bill \nthat address future legislation also lay the foundation for the \ncommercial space industry to include work on how to effectively conduct \noutreach to small business concerns owned and controlled by women and \nminorities.\n  I have worked hard to help small business owners to fully realize \ntheir current and future potential.\n  That is why I support entrepreneurial development programs, including \nthe Small Business Development Center and Women's Business Center \nprograms.\n  These initiatives provide counseling in a variety of critical areas, \nincluding business plan development, finance, and marketing.\n  Outreach is key to developing healthy and diverse small businesses in \nall sectors of the economy.\n  There are approximately 6 million minority owned businesses in the \nUnited States, representing a significant aspect of our economy.\n  According to the most recent available Census data, minority owned \nbusinesses employ nearly 6 million Americans and generate $1 trillion \ndollars in economic output.\n  Women owned businesses have increased 20% between 2002 and 2007, and \ncurrently total close to 8 million.\n  My home city of Houston, Texas, the home of the Johnson Space Center, \nis also home to more than 60,000 women owned businesses, and more than \n60,000 African American owned businesses.\n  Just as the national highway system and rural electrification has led \nto opportunities for communities to participate in the national \neconomy, so will federal investment in our nation's infrastructure and \ncapacity in space exploration pave the way for a new era of economic \ngrowth and opportunity.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for the Jackson Lee Amendments.\n  I would ask that my amendment be accepted, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, although I don't oppose it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the launch \nlicense streamlining report to include recommendations on how the FAA \nshould facilitate outreach to minority- and women-owned businesses \nabout opportunities in the commercial space industry. I don't object to \nthe gentlewoman's amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. May I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me conclude, Mr. Chairman, by saying that women-\nowned businesses have increased 20 percent between 2002 and 2007. They \ncurrently total close to $8 million. According to the most recent \navailable Census data, minority-owned businesses employ nearly 6 \nmillion Americans and generate $1 trillion in economic output.\n  My home city of Houston, the home of the Johnson Space Center, is \nalso home to more than 60,000 women-owned businesses, 60,000 African \nAmerican-owned businesses, and multitudes of minority-owned businesses.\n  I would offer to say that, if we can include this amendment, that \noutreach to these entities under this commercial space exploration \nlegislation will be adding more jobs to the American economy.\n  I ask for the support of the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chair, my appreciation to all of those who are \non the floor today.\n  My amendment speaks to discussions that this Congress has had over \nmany, many years on the question of science, technology, engineering, \nand math and, in particular, working with more vulnerable communities.\n  My amendment would facilitate the participation of HBCUs, Hispanic \nServing Institutions, National Indian Institutions, in fellowships, \nwork-study, and employment opportunities in the emerging commercial \nspace industry.\n  I remember some years ago that we developed a fellowship for graduate \nand Ph.D. candidates at Texas Southern University to interact at NASA \nJohnson. It was a very effective effort, and certainly, well-received \nby those who were able to participate.\n  That is, again, investing in universities and colleges that interact, \nagain, with vulnerable populations or do outreach to minority students \nand expose them, again, at graduate level and undergraduate level to \nscience, technology, engineering, and math.\n  For over two decades the Nation has known that the economy will be \ndriven, not by the hammer and anvil, but by the ingenuity and hard work \nof our Nation. Therefore, the imagination that fuels invention is so \nvaluable to the well-being of our Nation.\n  My amendment would follow in that spirit by increasing awareness \namong underrepresented groups in STEM employment and education \nopportunities and, I would hope, would create partnerships between the \ncommercial space industry and our HBCUs, our Native American \nInstitutions, Hispanic Serving, and allow work-study and employment \nopportunities in this growing and emerging commercial space industry.\n  I believe it would be an excellent partnership and would be an \nexcellent contribution to the economic engine of this Nation. I ask my \ncolleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, Article 1 Section 8 of the United States \nConstitution states that ``The Congress shall have Power to promote the \nProgress of Science and useful Arts . . .''\n  Too often the interpretation of these words are only about patents \nand inventions, but it extends to our nation's federal investment in \nareas of science that open up new avenues for economic and \ntechnological advancements.\n  I thank Chairman Smith and Ranking Member Johnson for their work to \nadvance the scientific horizon of our nation.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 6, made in order by the Rules Committee, \nwould facilitate the participation of HBCU, Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions; National Indian institutions, in fellowships, work-study \nand employment opportunities in the emerging commercial space industry.\n  For over 2 decades the nation has known that the economy will be \ndriven by the hammer and the anvil, but by the ingenuity and hard work \nof our nation's people.\n  The imagination that fuels invention--is so valuable to the wellbeing \nof our nation that the founders placed it as a key responsibility of \nthe legislative branch.\n  My amendment would follow in this spirit by increasing awareness \namong underrepresented groups in STEM employment and education \nopportunities in the commercial space industry.\n  One of the most enduring difficulties faced by underrepresented \npopulations in the STEM field is a lack of awareness and understanding \nof the connection between STEM and employment opportunities.\n  In 2012, a survey found that despite the nation's growing demand for \nmore workers in science, technology, engineering, and math grows, the \nskills gap among the largest ethnic and racial minorities groups remain \nstubbornly wide.\n  Blacks and Latinos account for only 7 percent, of the STEM workforce \ndespite representing 28 percent of the U.S. population.\n  All of our nation's citizens must be able to tap into, what has been \ndescribed in the Brookings' Metropolitan Policy Program Report as, \n``The Hidden STEM Economy.''\n  This report stated that in 2011, 26 million jobs or 20 percent of all \noccupations required knowledge in 1 or more STEM areas.\n  Half of all STEM jobs are available to workers without a 4 year \ndegree, and these jobs pay on average $53,000 a year, which is 10 \npercent higher than jobs with similar education requirements.\n  Houston, Texas, the home of the Johnson Space Center, has the second \nhighest concentration of engineers (22.4 for every 1000 workers \naccording to the Greater Houston Partnership).\n  Houston has 59,070 engineers, the second largest population in the \nnation.\n  This Jackson Lee Amendment will open up an avenue to allow \nunderrepresented groups in the STEM economy a means of learning about \nthe commercial space industry through the development of fellowships, \nwork study, and employment opportunities for undergraduate and graduate \nstudents.\n  I ask my colleagues to vote for the Jackson Lee Amendments.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment, though I don't oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires the launch \nlicense streamlining report in the underlying bill to include \nrecommendations on how the FAA might facilitate the participation of \nHistorically Black Colleges and Universities, Hispanic Serving \nInstitutions, and National Indian Institutions in the emerging \ncommercial space industry. I don't object to this.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the gentleman for \nhis support for both of my amendments. And I, again, would indicate \nthat every opportunity we have to grow the economy and expand to those \npopulations not fully included, this Congress should take an \nopportunity to do.\n  I see, in this amendment, opportunity for jobs, for partnerships, and \ncertainly opportunities for growing the engineers and other talented \npersons whom we need for, in essence, a new America with a new economy, \ntechnologically-based.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Maintaining use through at least 2024.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 273, the gentlewoman \nfrom Maryland (Ms. Edwards) and a Member opposed each will control 10 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Maryland.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am offering this substitute amendment because I think \nwe have a unique opportunity this week to pass bipartisan commercial \nspace legislation that actually stands a chance of becoming law. That \nis what we need to focus on this morning.\n  The choice before us is really quite straightforward. We can spend \nthe morning, as we have, fighting over the provisions of H.R. 2262, \nseveral of which were opposed by all of the Democratic members of the \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee when its provisions were \nmarked up just last week. And when we are done, Members can\n\n[[Page H3531]]\n\nvote, largely on party lines, to pass the bill.\n  But to what end, Mr. Chairman?\n  The Senate has already made it clear that H.R. 2262 has the \nproverbial snowball's chance of being adopted by the Senate.\n  Pursuing House legislation, House passage of a bill that is going \nnowhere in the Senate seems to me to be the ultimate exercise in \nfutility, and one that does a real disservice to the commercial space \nlaunch industry that all of us are trying to help succeed. But we don't \nhave to go down that path.\n  My amendment would replace the underlying text of H.R. 2262 with \nprovisions of the bipartisan Senate commercial space bill, the one that \nwas marked up in committee just yesterday.\n  Let me repeat that. The language in the substitute amendment, in my \namendment, already has garnered bipartisan support in the Senate. It is \nlanguage that is cosponsored by Senators Ted Cruz, Bill Nelson, Cory \nGardner, and Gary Peters, which is not something you can say about many \nother bills that we consider in the House.\n  Now, the Senate bill doesn't have everything I would like to see in a \ncommercial space bill. I am sure that is the same for my Republican \ncolleagues and for some in the industry. That is actually how \nlegislation is made.\n  However, it has a core set of provisions that I think we and the \nindustry can support, and that is what good compromises are all about.\n  The amendment addresses key issues facing the industry. It extends \nthe ``learning period'' for another 5 years. It extends third-party \nliability and indemnification of the entire regime for another 4 years.\n  It provides commercial space launch licensing and experimental permit \nflexibility. It provides a NASA-sought definition of ``Government \nAstronaut'' and provides a path for streamlining commercial space \nlaunch activities.\n  The Senate provisions also provide for a review of issues related to \ncommercial activities in space, as well as matters related to space \nsituational awareness data.\n  They provide encouragement for the FAA and the industry to work \ntogether to facilitate the development of voluntary consensus \nstandards, and they also ensure the International Space Station can \nremain a viable and productive facility through 2024.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is what my amendment does. It doesn't give the \ncommercial space industry anything or everything that some in the \nindustry might want.\n  But I would remind colleagues that the Senate bill has been endorsed \nby the Commercial Spaceflight Federation, the National Space Society, \nStudents for Exploration and Development of Space, SpaceX, Blue Origin, \nand Virgin Galactic, among others. That is the Senate bill. That is the \nsubstitute that is being offered.\n  So Members today can feel perfectly comfortable that my amendment is \none that the commercial space industry believes meets its legitimate \nneeds.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I said in the beginning of my remarks, we have a \nclear choice today. We can maintain a counterproductive, partisan \ndivide and hold out for provisions that won't move this legislation \neven 1 inch closer to becoming law.\n  Or we can step back, take a deep breath, and embrace the bipartisan \ncompromise that our colleagues in the Senate have worked out. They have \nhanded us a golden opportunity to move past partisan posturing and \nactually deliver legislation that can meet the needs of the commercial \nspace industry and be enacted into law.\n  Mr. Chairman, House Democrats support the provisions of my amendment. \nDemocrats and Republicans in the Senate support the provisions of my \namendment.\n  If my Republican colleagues here today in the House can join us in \nsupporting this substitute amendment, the provisions in the amendment, \nwe can pass bipartisan legislation that could be on its way to the \nPresident for enactment in a matter of weeks.\n  I can think of no better way to end this week, and I urge Members to \nvote ``yes'' on the amendment in the nature of a substitute.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 10 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This amendment seeks to strike and replace the entire underlying bill \nwith Senate legislation which differs with the House bill in many \nrespects.\n  The Senate bill, S. 1297, is a work product of the Senate. It has not \nbeen negotiated with any Member of this Chamber. In fact, the Senate \njust marked up the bill yesterday. This amendment abdicates the House's \nlegislative responsibilities to the Senate.\n  The SPACE Act paves the way for the next generation of explorers and \ninnovators. This amendment prevents the House from providing any \ndirection for the future of space exploration.\n  We must consider what we will forfeit if we accept this amendment. \nThe amendment significantly shortens the extension of the regulatory \nlearning period and the extension of the indemnification regime.\n  These changes reduce certainty in the commercial launch market and \ncould threaten the jobs of thousands of Americans. These are hard-\nworking men and women who depend on the extension of these laws for \ntheir jobs. They count on us to provide some certainty for their \nindustry.\n  This amendment strikes all of the commonsense transparency provisions \nin the SPACE Act and significantly shortens the extension of the \nlearning period. This extension is essential to the health of the \ncommercial space industry.\n  Also, this amendment includes a significant reduction to the \nregulatory flexibility provided in the underlying bill. The underlying \nbill requires assessments from the FAA on the growth of the industry, \nconstructive interactions between stakeholders and the FAA, a glide \npath to a safety framework that enables and encourages innovations, and \nimprovements in safety.\n  These are all part of a development structure that combines lessons \nlearned from the industry with the inherent government function to \nprotect the public.\n  The underlying bill preserves FAA's ability to regulate commercial \nhuman spaceflight in order to protect national security, public health, \nand safety. It also preserves FAA's existing authorities to regulate \nspaceflight participant and crew safety.\n\n  This amendment does not include any comparable benchmarking tools for \nCongress to monitor the growth of the industry. The amendment removes \nthe ability of stakeholders to work with the FAA to develop safety \nstandards that will improve the industry as a whole.\n  The amendment will have a chilling effect on the industry and put \nstakeholders on the defense against an onslaught of government \nintervention and possible lawsuits. This does not support a dynamic \nspace economy or encourage innovation.\n  This amendment assumes that the commercial space industry has not \nplaced a priority on safety. It is unfortunate that the minority looks \nat the American entrepreneurial spirit in this way.\n  Under the Senate bill, spaceflight participants would be exposed to \nsignificant financial risk and liability. This amendment strikes the \nvital provisions of the underlying bill which help ensure that human \nspaceflight is available to anyone who wants to participate.\n  The minority talks a lot about safety. I appreciate that. I think \neveryone involved in the space industry places a high priority on these \nendeavors being as safe as possible. I just wish the minority had a \nhigher opinion of the scientists, engineers, and technicians building \nthese systems.\n  Let's be clear. Space is inherently risky. America's memory is \nimprinted with tragic events such as the Apollo 1 fire, Challenger, and \nColumbia. The appropriate way to improve safety systems and reduce risk \nis to test, launch, learn, study, and repeat.\n  The entire space industry is behind this bill.\n  I do not oppose the gentlewoman's amendment simply because the Senate \nbill has no good qualities. I oppose the gentlewoman's amendment \nbecause it would abdicate the responsibilities of the House.\n\n[[Page H3532]]\n\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose the amendment and not turn their backs \non so many space companies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman has 5\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chair, I yield 4 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Eddie Bernice Johnson), the ranking member.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the \ngentlewoman.\n  I rise in strong support of Ms. Edwards' amendment. This amendment \noffers the possibility of actually accomplishing something worthwhile \ntoday and is an amendment that should garner bipartisan support.\n  Just last week, the Science, Space, and Technology Committee reported \nout H.R. 2262 and H.R. 1508 on party-line votes. Of course, we had \nmoved to markup without any hearings on commercial space issues in the \n114th Congress, nor a legislative hearing on either bill, nor a \nsubcommittee markup. It is, thus, not surprising that they could not \ngarner any significant bipartisan support for these bills.\n  And yet, now here we are on the floor, with these same bills. If we \ntake the same path we took in yesterday's consideration of the COMPETES \nlegislation, we will get a similar result, a partisan vote, and a bill \nthat will never become law.\n  Ms. Edwards offers us another way forward. Just yesterday, the Senate \nCommerce Committee favorably reported out S. 1297, the Senate's \nbipartisan commercial space bill, a bill introduced by Senators Ted \nCruz and Bill Nelson.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  As I said, it is a bipartisan bill that was endorsed by a large \nsegment of the commercial space industry when it was introduced. The \ngentlewoman from Maryland's (Ms. Edwards) amendment simply incorporates \nprovisions of S. 1297 into her amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, instead of engaging in a meaningful exercise, we could \nvote today to approve bipartisan legislation that Senate Democrats and \nRepublicans are supporting.\n  While the Senate bill is not the bill I would have written, it is a \nvast improvement over the bill we have before us today.\n  As the gentleman said earlier, America is exceptional. And that is \nwhy we have a Congress. That is why we have committee structure. That \nis why we have subcommittees that examine issues and listen to \nwitnesses. That is why we have committee work. It provides really a \nmeans for us to come together.\n  The bill that is in the Senate provides constructive updates to the \nCommercial Space Launch Act.\n  I know that some Members want to go further than the Senate bill in \nsome areas, but the reality is, there is no bipartisan consensus to \ndoing so. And if we proceed to pass H.R. 2262, we will have passed a \nbill that the Senate probably will not take up. We did that with the \nCOMPETES bill yesterday. Do we really want to continue to waste our \ntime in the same way again this morning?\n  Holding out hope that somehow these contentious provisions will find \nfavor in a House-Senate conference is also an exercise in futility. \nTime is not on our side in dealing with the two expiring authorities in \nthis bill, and we know from experience that Congress can act to extend \nthem without passing a commercial space bill.\n  I think that outcome would be unfortunate, but I see little \nlikelihood that the Senate will do anything with H.R. 2262 in its \ncurrent form. And in a conference, I think that House Democrats will be \ndisinclined to support provisions that we are opposing today.\n  Ms. Edwards' amendment offers us an opportunity to avoid months of \npointless back-and-forth between the two Chambers. We can pass \nlegislation that we already know has bipartisan support in the Senate, \nand if we do, we can look forward to seeing a bill head to the \nPresident's desk within weeks. All it takes is my Republican colleagues \nbeing willing to forgo the temptation to posture for that last extra \nbit of advantage and, instead, accept a reasonable compromise bill that \nwill do much to meet the legitimate needs of the commercial space \nlaunch industry.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), who is a member of the Science, Space, \nand Technology Committee and is also the chairman of the Environment \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. I thank the chairman of the Science Committee for \nyielding and for his strong leadership on working this bill through \nregular order so that all of the amendments that we have made, all the \nMembers have had their voices heard in this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to oppose the amendment of the gentlewoman from \nMaryland.\n  The language she is proposing to insert into our House bill is \nauthored by Senator Cruz of Texas, and it does have bipartisan support \nwith Senator Nelson of Florida. But there are provisions that we got \nincluded because of the open process that we went through that are not \nincluded in that bill.\n  I would like to just run through a few of those that I, myself, got \nincluded into this bill, starting with section 110, which was an \namendment I offered at markup that will require a GAO report to capture \nthe role of space support vehicles--training vehicles, if you will--in \nthe commercial space industry; regulatory and statutory barriers to the \nservices these vehicles offer and recommendations for updates that will \naddress these barriers. This is critically important in my neck of the \nwoods. In the State of Oklahoma, we have a spaceport at Burns Flat. \nThere are businesses there that are very interested in doing training \nfor commercial crew and commercial spaceflight participants.\n  This was a provision of the bill that went through an open process. \nIt was an amendment that was accepted in a very bipartisan way. And I \nam hopeful that when the full bill gets to the floor, it also will be \naccepted in a bipartisan way.\n  Additionally, title III of this bill incorporates H.R. 2261, the \nCommercial Remote Sensing Act, which was also bipartisan legislation \nthat I introduced with my friend from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter). This \ntitle sets metrics to give Congress a full picture of the workload \nfacing the Department of Commerce when licensing remote sensing \nactivities and what issues are preventing them from meeting statutory \ndeadlines.\n  Title III also recognizes the importance of seeking input from the \nAdvisory Committee for Commercial Remote Sensing, which is largely made \nup of private sector representatives. This legislation will be crucial \nas industry expands beyond traditional remote sensing satellites and \nactivities and as Congress looks to update the statutes governing these \nactivities for the first time since the 1990s.\n  My case for this being bipartisan is that I worked very hard with the \nother side on the amendments that I ultimately got into this bill. \nThere were some amendments that maybe were not as bipartisan. But I \nwould attest that there is support on the other side of the aisle for a \nlot of the provisions that we got into this bill.\n  I look forward to taking a vote on this bill. I oppose the amendment \nin the nature of a substitute. I encourage all my colleagues to pass \nthe bill that went through regular order in the House of \nRepresentatives. I hear a lot of people talking about regular order. \nThis was a very open process. Everybody had their voice heard. I \nencourage passage of the bill but not passage of the amendment in the \nnature of a substitute.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Chairman, as I have said before, we have offered my \namendment in the nature of a substitute because we are interested not \njust in making speeches here on the House floor, but we are interested \nin passing law and good policy that will be signed by the President, \nthat will set the commercial space industry onto a pathway of continued \ninnovation and success.\n  As has been described, the Senate yesterday, out of committee, marked \nup a bill that is bipartisan in nature. And because of the \nnegotiations, there are not going to be any changes.\n  We want to make law for the industry, and we believe that this \namendment in the nature of a substitute is good policy. I urge a \n``yes'' vote on the amendment.\n\n[[Page H3533]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to oppose this \nsubstitute amendment and to support the underlying bill, which has \nsignificant improvements to the Senate bill, and that is why we should \npass it.\n  I will now enter into the Record an exchange of letters between the \nCommittee on Transportation and Infrastructure and the Committee on \nScience, Space, and Technology regarding H.R. 2262.\n\n                                                     May 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: I write concerning H.R. 2262, the \n     Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and \n     Entrepreneurship Act of 2015. This legislation includes \n     matters that fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure.\n       In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 2262, the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo \n     action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our \n     mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill \n     does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the \n     appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional \n     claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or \n     similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X \n     jurisdiction. I request you urge the Speaker to name members \n     of the Committee to any conference committee named to \n     consider such provisions.\n       Please place a copy of this letter and your response \n     acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on \n     the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 18, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure's \n     jurisdictional interest in H.R. 2262, the ``Spurring Private \n     Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015.''\n       I agree that the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure has valid jurisdictional interests in matters \n     pertaining to the Federal Aviation Administration and the \n     National Transportation Safety Board, and that your \n     Committee's jurisdiction will not be adversely affected by \n     your decision to forego consideration of H.R. 2262. As you \n     have requested, I will support your request for an \n     appropriate appointment of outside conferees from your \n     Committee in the event of a House-Senate conference on this \n     or similar legislation, if in your jurisdiction, should such \n     a conference be convened.\n       Finally, I will include a copy of your letter and this \n     response in the Congressional Record during the floor \n     consideration of this bill. Thank you again for your \n     cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Lamar Smith,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

By the end of this year, roughly 14,000 Americans will lose \ntheir lives due to a brain tumor.\n  Like many others across this country, my family has also been touched \nby this painful disease, but for patients and their loved ones, hope \npersists, whether through increased funding for NIH research, which \njust passed the Energy and Commerce Committee this morning, or through \nthe tireless efforts of nonprofit organizations like the National Brain \nTumor Society.\n  We should not and cannot accept the notion that a brain tumor is \nuntreatable any longer.

Mr. Speaker, since taking office, my top priority has \nbeen to support policies that improve our economy and strengthen the \nInland Empire's middle class.\n  Last month I released my jobs plan, summarizing what I have heard \nfrom small-business owners, job seekers, and community leaders \nthroughout San Bernardino County. Among the many issues people face is \nthe skills gap, the disconnect that exists between potential employees \nand the available job market demands of those who possess specific or \ntechnical skills. That was one of the biggest problems that I heard.\n  That is why yesterday I introduced the On-the-Job Training Tax Credit \nof 2015, a bill that creates a temporary tax credit for employers to \nuse to help pay for the costs of training new hires. This will enable \nlocal owners to expand their businesses and empower employees with \ncritical skills to help them succeed in the 21st century economy.\n  Through apprenticeship programs, vocational schools, community \ncolleges, and more, job seekers who have been locked out of today's \neconomy will be retrained and brought back into the fold in the Inland \nEmpire's economy.\n  Studies tell us that approximately 3\\1/2\\ million manufacturing jobs \nwill be open over the next 10 years, but we will only be able to fill 2 \nmillion of them due to the skills gap. It is time to retrain our \nworkforce and build up the middle class. This bill will help us do just \nthat.\n\n[[Page H3545]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3545-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3545]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n      CONGRESS MUST ADDRESS SECTION 702 OF THE FISA AMENDMENTS ACT\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the PATRIOT Act was designed to \nprotect us from terrorists abroad. Now we have learned that section 215 \nof the PATRIOT Act has been abused by the NSA, and it is spying on \nAmericans, taking metadata.\n  But there is more. There is another law. The FISA Amendments Act of \n2008, section 702, allows the seizure, without a warrant, of the \ncontent of emails, text messages, and phone calls by our government. \nCongress must address this, as it has addressed section 215 of the \nPATRIOT Act. It also allows, under 702, the backdoor search; in other \nwords, NSA can go into Google and seize information about Americans \nwithout a warrant.\n  NSA cannot be trusted to protect and follow America's laws that \nprotect our privacy.

As co-chair of \nthe Congressional Asthma and Allergy Caucus and a senior member of the \nHouse Committee on Energy and Commerce's Health Subcommittee, I want to \ntake this opportunity to bring attention to the prevalence of asthma in \nthe United States, as well as what must be done to control its growth.\n  Asthma is one of the most serious chronic diseases in the country. It \naffects almost 26 million Americans and nearly 7 million children. It \ncan cause shortness of breath, coughing, wheezing, chest pain, and even \ndeath.\n  In my home State of New York, asthma takes a particularly heavy toll, \nespecially in my home county of the Bronx. About 390,000 children and \n1.4 million adults in New York have asthma. The total cost of asthma-\nrelated hospitalizations in New York in 2007 was a staggering $535 \nmillion.\n  I have been a strong supporter of the Centers for Disease Control's \nNational Asthma Control Program, which helps States implement systems \nto monitor and treat asthma. This program's work has resulted in $23.1 \nbillion in asthma healthcare costs since 2001.\n  We must continue to increase awareness and preventative measures to \nhelp people manage their disease. We must work collaboratively across \nsectors to address the burden that asthma creates.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in a \nbipartisan fashion to ensure that adults and children across the United \nStates can live healthier and more successful lives and that we can \nconquer the scourge of asthma.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3546-3", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3546]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TRIBUTE TO MAJOR GENERAL R.

Mr. Speaker, nearly 3 years, on September 11 and \n12, 2012, the United States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, were the \ntarget of terrorist attacks. These attacks resulted in the deaths of \nfour Americans: Sean Smith; Tyrone Woods; Glen Doherty; and the U.S. \nAmbassador to Libya, Chris Stevens, as well as two other Americans \ncritically injured.\n  It comes at a time close to Memorial Day, when this country can honor \nthese individuals that gave their life and their service not just for \nthis country, but for the freedom and democracy around the world of \nothers.\n  The gravity of the attacks raise serious questions regarding the U.S. \npresence in Benghazi, Libya, particularly as those questions related to \nthe policies, decisions, and activities of the administration and \nrelevant executive branch agencies before, during, and after the \nattacks.\n  For nearly 2 years, Congress sought answers to these questions. \nHowever, the administration's valid response has exposed the limits \nencountered by our standing committees.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  These responses revealed a less than competent or transparent \naccounting about the attacks. Consequently, the House created, with the \nsupport of our Democratic colleagues, the Select Committee on the \nEvents Surrounding the 2012 Terrorist Attacks in Benghazi, Libya.\n  Everywhere I go, Mr. Speaker, I have people ask me: What is taking so \nlong? What is taking so long for us to get the facts about what \nhappened in Benghazi?\n  We are going to do our best today to explain to the American people \nand to the public and to you, Mr. Speaker, why it has taken so long, \nwhy it is requiring us to continue to subpoena and beg and plead for \nthe information that we need to be able to deliver this report to this \nbody and to the American people.\n  The Speaker appointed me and six of my Republican colleagues to this \ncommittee. The minority leader appointed five of our Democratic \ncolleagues. We have been directed by the House to conduct a complete \ninvestigation across the spectrum of all, A-L-L, all relevant executive \nbranch agencies and issue a definitive final report on the events \nsurrounding the September 11-12, 2012, terrorist attacks in Benghazi, \nLibya.\n  Specifically, we are directed to investigate and report on: all \npolicies, decisions, and activities that contributed to the attacks on \nUnited States facilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 and 12, \n2012, as well as those that affected the ability of the United States \nto prepare for those attacks; number two, all policies, decisions, and \nactivities to respond to and repel the attacks on United States \nfacilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 and 12, 2012, including \nefforts to rescue United States personnel; number three, internal and \npublic executive branch communications about the attacks on the United \nStates facility in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 and 12, 2012; \nnumber four, accountability for policies and decisions relating to the \nsecurity of facilities in Benghazi, Libya, and the response to the \nattacks, including individuals and entities responsible for those \npolicies and decisions; number five, executive branch authorities' \nefforts to identify and bring to justice the perpetrators of these \nattacks on the U.S. facilities in Benghazi, Libya, September 11 and 12, \n2012; number six, executive branch activities and efforts to comply \nwith congressional inquiries into the attacks on the United States \nfacilities in Benghazi, Libya, on September 11 and 12, 2012; \nrecommendations for improving executive branch cooperation and \ncompliance with congressional oversight investigations; information \nrelated to lessons learned from the attacks and executive branch\n\n[[Page H3548]]\n\nactivities and efforts to protect United States facilities and \npersonnel abroad; and any other relevant issues relating to the \nattacks, the response to the attacks, or the investigation by the House \nof Representatives into the attacks.\n  I think that number nine is a particularly relevant point. It says \n``all other relevant issues.'' That is one of the questions that we \nhave been receiving: Are we stepping out of bounds on what this \ncommittee was supposed to do? The answer is absolutely not.\n  Using these instructions as a guide, the committee requested and \nreviewed a substantial volume of information that was previously \nproduced to the House, and new information never before produced to \nCongress.\n  The committee has reviewed more than 20,000 pages of emails and \ndocuments produced by the State Department never before released to \nCongress. This new material includes emails that were sent to or \nreceived by the former Secretary of State relevant to Benghazi, as well \nas documents and emails that were part of the State Department's \nAccountability Review Board proceedings.\n  In addition, hundreds of pages of emails never before seen by \nCongress have been produced by the White House. The Department of \nJustice and the intelligence community have also produced documents \nnever before seen by Congress.\n  Further, the committee has interviewed executive branch personnel, \nincluding survivors of the Benghazi terror attacks, none of whom have \never been interviewed by previous committees. The committee has also \ninterviewed others who have been able to provide indispensable \nfirsthand details of the U.S. presence in Benghazi, Libya.\n  We know that this is not a complete universe of information held by \nthe executive branch. Our investigation has uncovered new witnesses, \nnew documents, and new facts related to the Benghazi terror attacks.\n  Ironically, the largest impediment to getting this investigation done \nin a timely manner and being able to write a final, definitive \naccounting of what happened before, during, and after the terrorist \nattacks in Benghazi is the executive branch itself.\n  The committee has issued letters, subpoenas, has threatened to hold \nand has held public compliance hearings, with slow to little to no \naction at all.\n  Take the State Department, for example--the State Department is a \nnecessary focus of this investigation; yet their compliance posture \nwith the committee and Congress has proved unpredictable at best.\n  When this committee was formed 1 year ago, the State Department had \nyet to fully comply with two outstanding subpoenas issued in 2013 by \nanother committee. One subpoena dealt specifically with documents \npertaining to the State Department's Accountability Review Board, known \nas the ARB.\n  The other subpoena dealt with documents that had previously undergone \nlimited congressional review, where Members' access to the documents \nand information was restricted to certain dates and times set by the \nState Department. These subpoenas were still legally binding on the \nState Department when this committee was created; yet the Department \nhad not fulfilled them.\n  In an effort to expedite the Department's fulfillment of these \nsubpoenas, the select committee prioritized the Department's production \nof documents under these two subpoenas, as opposed to issuing new \nrequests.\n  In addition, by directing the Department to identify documents under \nthese existing subpoenas, the committee was better positioned to \nreceive new documents in a more expeditious manner while, at the same \ntime, judiciously reviewing the work of past committees.\n\n  These negotiations resulted in the State Department providing 15,000 \npages of new documents to the committee in August and September of last \nyear. This production also fulfilled the Department's obligation for \none of the two subpoenas.\n  The review of these documents was enlightening, both in what it \ndisclosed and what it did not. Here is what it did disclose. For the \nfirst time, the Department produced eight emails, eight to or from \nformer Secretary Clinton.\n  Additionally, the committee became aware that former Secretary \nClinton had used a private email account to conduct official State \nDepartment business. Importantly, the committee did not release the \nexistence of the private email account because of its commitment to \ninvestigate all the facts in a fair and impartial manner.\n  Here is what it didn't disclose. From the review of the 15,000 pages, \nhowever, the committee recognized that there were significant omissions \nin the documents. Notably, there were very few emails between and among \nformer Secretary Clinton's senior staff and the Secretary.\n  As a result, last November, the committee requested the State \nDepartment produce specific documents and emails related to Benghazi \nand Libya for the Secretary and 10 of her senior staff. In the 2 months \nfollowing the committee's request, committee staff consistently relayed \nto the Department that its new top priority was all of Secretary \nClinton's emails.\n  Almost 3 months later, on February 13, 2015, the Department produced \napproximately 300 emails to and from the former Secretary during her \ntime as the head of the State Department. Remember, these are emails of \nwhich the State Department never possessed and didn't have to look for; \nyet it took that length of time.\n  They didn't produce a single document to the committee related to the \nremaining portions of the November request. What was the State \nDepartment doing during the time the former Secretary was going through \nher emails?\n  After they produced these emails, the State Department asked what our \npriority was. We continued to inform them that the 10 senior officials \nidentified in the November request were our priority, including Cheryl \nMills, Jake Sullivan, Huma Abedin, and Susan Rice. The State Department \ntold committee staff that this request was too broad and that it was \nunable to search for these documents.\n  On March 4, 2015, the committee issued a subpoena for the documents \nand emails first requested in November. This subpoena sought documents \nand emails for the 10 senior State Department officials, including \nthose named previously.\n  Despite the committee indicating emails and documents from the \nsubpoena were its top priority, the Department informed the committee \nthat it would instead begin producing documents pursuant to the \noutstanding ARB subpoena. Remember, this subpoena was first issued in \nAugust of 2013 and reissued on January 28, 2015, since it expired at \nthe end of the previous Congress.\n  I would also point out that the law requires that these records--and \nthis is the records from the ARB--and, Mr. Speaker, it is very \nimportant that you understand this, that the law says that these \n``records shall be separated from all other records of the Department \nof State and shall be maintained under appropriate safeguards to \npreserve the confidentiality and classification of information.''\n  This means the records should have been sitting on a shelf somewhere, \neasily identifiable. Unfortunately, it took them 2 years to find where \nthis ARB report was supposed to be segregated and put up. The committee \ncontinued to indicate that its priority was for the emails from the \nsenior State Department personnel that were first requested in \nNovember.\n  The Department's response: it could not search for these documents. \nInstead, the Department ignored the committee's request; and, on April \n15, 2015, nearly 2 years after Congress first issued a subpoena for the \nARB's documents, the State Department finally produced more than 1,700 \npages of documents related to the ARB.\n  Again, instead of responding to the committee's request, on April 23, \n2015, the Department produced an additional 2,500 pages of documents \nrelated to the ARB. The Department has said that, with minor \nexceptions, it has now fulfilled the requirements of that subpoena.\n  Notwithstanding the ARB production, the committee continued to press \nthe Department. Its top priority is the documents from the original \nNovember 2014 request and the March subpoena.\n  The State Department, however, has done little but talk about the \nbreadth\n\n[[Page H3549]]\n\nof the subpoena and the inability to adequately search for documents.\n  The Department continues to state that it does not have the technical \ncapabilities to do such a wide search without specific search terms; \nyet the Department never used any search terms to conduct in its \nsearch, nor has the Department ever suggested any search terms to the \ncommittee.\n  To help the committee better understand the Department's technical \ncapabilities--or lack thereof--the committee has taken several \ndifferent steps. We asked the State Department to bring its technology \nexpert and its records officer to a meeting to discuss how records were \nkept, retrieved, and produced.\n  Specifically, we requested a meeting ``with the relevant people from \nwithin the State Department who can explain in detail how the State \nDepartment maintains its records and how it has researched for \ndocuments pursuant to this committee's November request and further \ndetail the limitations of the Department's ability to fully respond to \nthe Chairman's document request. These people would likely include \nindividuals from Legislative Affairs, Office of the Legal Adviser, \nBureau of Information Resource Management, and possibly the records \nofficer and any other individual who will be able to answer detailed \nquestions on the topic. This meeting will help us further sequence and \nprioritize the information and issues in the committee's request, as \nyou suggested we do in your letter of February 13 to Chairman Gowdy,'' \nthat the State Department sent us.\n  We also included a list of 13 questions to the Department to help \nguide the discussion. Samples of these questions include ``the size of \nthe universe of potentially relevant hard copy and/or electronic field \nfor each person from the data range period, keyword or phrase searches \nthe Department plans to use for production,'' and ``any limitations \nimposed on the type of data to be searched.''\n  These are some pretty straightforward questions.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  When the State Department appeared for the meeting, they did not only \nbring those subject matter experts with them, the staff they did bring \ncould not answer these basic questions. In fact, it was during this \nmeeting for the first time that the committee learned that the State \nDepartment was not in possession of the former Secretary's emails. \nHowever, there was no mention of her use of a private server.\n  The committee again asked the Department to meet with these \nindividuals. Again, the Department did not provide them. At an April 10 \nmeeting between committee staff and the Department, the State \nDepartment brought in an individual. Yet when pressed by committee \nstaff on these specific questions, the Department refused to provide \nthe specific answers.\n  Last week, we continued the pressure. We told the Department that \nmembers of the committee, including myself, would travel to the State \nDepartment to view firsthand how they search for documents and have a \ndiscussion about the shortcomings they claim to have.\n  But what did the Department do when we told them that we were coming? \nThey scrambled and did everything possible to deter our visit.\n  Earlier this week, however, we did learn more about the Department's \ninternal process for identifying and reviewing documents, but we didn't \nget this information from the Department. Instead, we had to learn it \nfrom a lawsuit.\n  This past week, on May 18, the State Department's Acting Director for \nits Information Programs and Services filed a sworn declaration in a \nFOIA lawsuit, the Freedom of Information lawsuit. That declaration \noutlined the steps the State Department had taken since it received \napproximately 55,000 pages of emails from former Secretary Clinton in \nDecember of 2014 to review those documents for public release under the \nFreedom of Information rules.\n  Also, in that sworn statement, the State Department asserted that it \nhad dedicated, on a full-time basis, a project manager, two case \nanalysts, and nine Freedom of Information reviewers to review all \n55,000 pages of emails since April. These 12 individuals are precisely \nthe 12 FTE positions that were recently funded by the State \nDepartment's $2.5 million reprogramming request.\n  Let me say that again. The State Department repeatedly complained to \nthe committee that a lack of staff and other resources prevented it \nfrom making more timely production of documents to the committee, so \nthe committee supported a reallocation of funds to enable the State \nDepartment to hire additional staff to work on document production to \nprovide to this committee.\n  However, we continued to press the State Department for answers. Last \nmonth, we went so far as to put in writing 27 specific questions that \nthe State Department needed to answer regarding its ability to produce \ndocuments to the committee and the use of the private email account by \nSecretary Clinton.\n  These were simple questions that fell into three simple categories. \nThese categories are: the State Department's initial approval, if any, \nof Secretary Clinton's email server arrangement; the State Department's \nknowledge about this email server arrangement, its attempt to retrieve \nher email, and the lack of candor by the Department towards the \ncommittee about this, despite the committee's persistent requests for \nthese emails; and number 3, details of the Department's review of her \nemails to ensure the Department is properly marshaling resources to \nrespond to our requests.\n  Yet here we are, more than 1 month later, and the Department hasn't \neven been able to answer a single one of the 27 questions in writing.\n  In addition, we have attempted on multiple occasions to direct the \nDepartment toward specific key documents that we are after. We have \nprioritized our subpoena from 10 names down to 4 names, and then again \ndown to 3 names. We have prioritized dates of documents from 2 years, \ndown to 1 year, down to 3 months.\n  But again, here we are, 2\\1/2\\ months after we issued a subpoena and \n6 months after we first sent the letter, and the Department has still \nnot produced any of these priority documents. First, we moved a foot, \nthen we moved a yard, and now we have moved our position one mile, but \nthe State Department has not budged 1 inch.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just like to show a little chart that shows the \nnoncompliance that the State Department has done so far:\n  On 11/18 of 2014: The committee requests from the Secretary 10 senior \nofficials' documents and emails--response, nothing.\n  On 12/17, we got a response: Let's meet. No documents produced.\n  2/13/2015: State produced Clinton emails acquired from her attorney.\n  3/4/2015: We subpoenaed the documents and emails of the 10 senior \nofficials.\n  The State Department response: Let's meet. No documents produced.\n  3/26/2015: Three outstanding requests, ARB documents, 10 senior \nofficial documents and emails and server questions.\n  4/10: Briefing on document retention policies and procedures. No \ndocuments produced.\n  4/14: Compliance needed on both subpoenas.\n  4/15: Part of ARB documents produced 2 years after requested.\n  4/18: Two subpoenas outstanding. Full ARB compliance and documents. \nEmails of 10 senior officials.\n  4/22: Subpoenas outstanding for full ARB compliance and documents and \nemails of 10 senior officials.\n  State response: Just beginning to assess volume of emails. No \ndocuments produced.\n  4/24/2015: Response, second part of ARB documents produced 2 years \nafter requested.\n  4/27/2015: Reminder of priority of 10 senior officials.\n  4/29: Response: Estimate given for volume of emails for 2 of the 10 \nsenior officials. No documents produced.\n  5/4/2015: Lack of compliance on document request is unacceptable.\n  Response from the State Department: State responds but fails to \nidentify any steps taken to produce documents. No documents produced.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have done everything we know to do to get these \ndocuments so we can finish this investigation. I don't know that \nanybody has any more right to know what has gone on than the American \npeople and especially those families of those four great Americans that \nlost their lives.\n\n[[Page H3550]]\n\n  The only thing holding us up from getting a definitive report of \nthose actions before, during, and after those attacks is this executive \nbranch and their Department of State. We are begging them. And as we \nhave said before, we have moved an inch, we have moved a foot, we have \nmoved a yard, we have moved a mile, and they have not moved one iota.\n  So our request to them is to listen, to give us the documents and let \nus finish this report.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3550-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3550-H3555]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CONGRESSIONAL ROLE IN TRADE POLICY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, it has been over 12 years since the last \ndebate over trade promotion authority, the last time we considered the \nrole of Congress in trade negotiations. Much has changed since then: \nthe world has changed; trade negotiations have changed; and the role of \nCongress in trade negotiations has changed.\n  We all recognize that trade can be beneficial. The issue is not \nwhether Congress could pass an Econ 101 class, as President George W. \nBush's chair of the Council of Economic Advisers, Gregory Mankiw, \nrecently put it. The issue is whether we are going to face up to the \nfact that our trading system today is much more complex than the \nsimplistic trade model presented in an Econ 101 class.\n  A growing number of prominent economists today recognize those \ncomplexities, from Nobel Laureate economists like Joseph Stiglitz and \nPaul Krugman, to Columbia professor Jeffrey Sachs, former IMF chief \neconomist Simon Johnson, and former White House adviser Jared \nBernstein. But too many want to pretend the question of a trade \nagreement is a ``no-brainer,'' as Professor Mankiw suggests; or that \nthe benefits of trade ``flows from the classic theory of trade gains \nfirst expounded by David Ricardo in 1817''--from a Council of Economic \nAdvisers report in May 2015--because, as Charles Krauthammer recently \nwrote: ``The law of comparative advantage has held up nicely for 198 \nyears.''\n  What do David Ricardo and Adam Smith have to say about the inclusion \nof investor-state dispute settlement in our trade agreements? Nothing, \nto my knowledge. What do they have to say about providing a 12-year \nmonopoly for the sale of biologic medicines? about the need to ensure \nthat our trading partners meet basic labor and environmental standards? \nHow about the issue of currency manipulation? What does the theory of \ncomparative advantage have to say about those issues? Absolutely \nnothing. And yet those are the issues at the crux of the TPP \nnegotiations today.\n  So how do the old ideas on trade fall short? Let me mention a few \nexamples:\n  First, as Joseph Stiglitz pointed out recently, 19th century \neconomics and the theory of comparative advantage assumed a fixed level \nof technology--no technological changes--and full employment. Those \nassumptions don't fit very well in today's world.\n  Second, one of the most critical economic issues facing our country \ntoday is growing inequality and a stagnant middle class. Many trade \neconomists believe that trade contributes to that inequality. But some \ntry to downplay that fact by pointing out that other factors may \ncontribute more to the problem, as if that means we should not worry \nabout the impact trade is having. Consider this from Dani Rodrik, a \nHarvard University economist: ``The gains from trade look rather paltry \ncompared to the redistribution of income . . . In an economy like the \nU.S., where average tariffs are below 5 percent, a move to complete \nfree trade would reshuffle more than $50 of income among different \ngroups for each dollar of efficiency or `net' gain created . . . We are \ntalking about $50 of redistribution for every $1 of aggregate gain. It \nis as if we give $51 to Adam, only to leave David $50 poorer.''\n  David Rosnick of the Center for Economic and Policy Research expects \nTPP will have a very small but positive impact on U.S. economic \ngrowth--0.13 percent of GDP by 2025. However, he notes that economists \ntoday generally agree that trade contributes to growing economic \ninequality in the United States, with estimates ranging from 10 to 50 \npercent of the total inequality growth. When he combines these two \nconcepts, GDP growth but rising inequality from trade, he concludes: \n``under any reasonable assumptions about the effect of trade on \ninequality, the median wage earner, and therefore the majority of \nworkers, suffers a net loss as a result of these trade agreements.'' In \nother words, the economic pie may grow slightly as a result of our \ntrade agreements, but the average American worker gets a smaller slice \nof that pie.\n  Similarly, in September The Brookings Institution published an \neconomic research paper by three economists, two affiliated with the \nFederal Reserve system, that found that trade and globalization \naccounts for the vast majority of labor's declining share of income in \nthe United States over the past 25 years. Specifically, they found that \n``increases in import exposure of U.S. businesses can explain about 3.3 \npercentage points of the 3.9 percentage point decline in the U.S. \npayroll share over the past quarter century.''\n  This underscores that the substance of the trade agreements, the \ninternational rules, matter. Our trade agreements must be designed to \nshape trade, to spread its benefits more broadly.\n  Third, we need to stop pretending that trade only has benefits and \nfew costs. We need to stop talking exclusively about exports and \ndownplaying the negative impact that some imports have, as the Council \nof Economic Advisers did in a recent paper.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Of course, imports can help to lower prices for manufacturers and \nconsumers. But lower prices don't do you much good if you have lost \nyour job or seen your wage decline or stagnate. Again, as Jeff Sachs \nhas said, ``It is true that the benefits outweigh the costs, leading to \nthe argument that winners can compensate losers. But in America, \nwinners rarely compensate losers; more often than not, the winners \nattempt to trounce the losers.''\n  Mr. Speaker, the old economics models are based in part on trade \nbetween countries with similar economic structures. This is no longer \nthe case.\n  The 12 parties involved in the TPP negotiations--accounting for 40 \npercent of the world GDP--include economies ranging from some of the \nworld's largest market-oriented economies to some of the smallest, \nleast developed command economies. We have never been able to establish \na level playing field with Japan--after decades of trying, and multiple \n``agreements'' to solve various problems--and the Japanese market \nstands virtually closed today in key areas like agriculture and \nautomobiles. We have never negotiated a free trade agreement with a \ncommunist country like Vietnam where state-owned enterprises are a \nmajor concern and the Communist Party and the once so-called labor \nunion are one and the same.\n  The issues involved in trade negotiations have also changed \ndramatically. We are no longer simply negotiating tariff levels. As \nProfessor Jeff Sachs of Columbia University said recently, ``Both TPP \nand TTIP would be better described as multinational business agreements \ninvolving three distinct areas: international trade, cross-border \ninvestment, and international business regulation.\n  The TPP negotiations cover a range of subjects far beyond those \nnegotiated in any previous multilateral negotiation, concerning \neverything from intellectual property and access to medicines, to \nfinancial regulations, food safety measures, basic labor and \nenvironmental standards, cross-border data flows, and state-owned \nenterprises. So the economics of trade have changed, and the trade \nnegotiations themselves have changed, and so too has the congressional \nrole.\n  In recent years some of us have had to take it upon ourselves to \nrewrite the rules of trade negotiations. In 2006 when the Democrats \ntook the majority in the U.S. House, we made it clear to the Bush \nadministration that we were not going to consider the Peru, Panama, \nColombia, and Korea Free Trade Agreements as negotiated. Each of them \nwould need to be fixed.\n\n[[Page H3551]]\n\n  Charles Rangel and I worked with our House Democratic colleagues to \ncoauthor what became known as the May 10th Agreement on labor and \nenvironmental standards in trade agreements. For the first time, fully \nenforceable labor and environmental standards would be placed in our \ntrade agreements on equal footing with every other commercial \nprovision. The May 10th Agreement also included important provisions on \nmedicines, investment, and government procurement.\n  After decades of leading the fight to include worker rights \nprovisions in trade agreements, I considered at the time, and still do \ntoday, the May 10th Agreement to be a major breakthrough. In the case \nof our trade agreements with Peru, Panama, and Colombia, their labor \nlaws were changed to come into compliance with ILO standards before the \nCongress voted.\n  Then in 2011, with the Korea FTA, working on a bipartisan basis with \nthen-chairman Dave Camp, with Ford Motor, and the UAW, we urged the \nObama administration to go back and renegotiate the specific automotive \nmarket opening measures with Korea. And they did so, helping to garner \nbroad bipartisan support in Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, we established the foundation for progressive trade \npolicy. We saw the value of intense congressional involvement to \nimprove trade agreements. We want to make sure it is built upon, not \neroded.\n  Mr. Speaker, now we are facing the largest multilateral trade \nnegotiations since the Uruguay Round. The TPP has the potential to \nraise standards and open new markets for U.S. businesses, workers, and \nfarmers--or lock in weak standards, uncompetitive practices, and a \nsystem that does not spread the benefits of trade, affecting the \npaychecks of American families. Once the U.S. lowers its own tariffs as \nbroadly as contemplated in TPP, we will no longer have the leverage to \nbring about lasting change in other countries.\n  In January, I described what I believed to be an effective way to \nresolve outstanding issues in the TPP negotiations. I believed that \nachieving these outcomes could lead to a landmark TPP agreement worthy \nof major bipartisan support and mine. Unfortunately, in 4 months, none \nof these suggestions has been taken on by our negotiators.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, the Hatch-Wyden-Ryan trade promotion \nauthority fails to put TPP on the right track or to help Congress do \nso. Chairman Ryan and Senator Cruz wrote an op-ed entitled, ``Putting \nCongress in Charge on Trade.'' Senator Hatch declared TPA to include \n``strict negotiating objectives'' that give the American people a voice \non trade priorities. But saying it is so doesn't make it so.\n  On all the major issues in the negotiations, the negotiating \nobjectives are obsolete or woefully inadequate. They are basically a \nwish list. And even worse, at the end of the negotiation, TPA allows \nthe President to certify whether his own negotiators achieved the wish \nlist. And the provisions relating to congressional withdrawal of TPA \nare meaningless. They are never going to be used because they are \nunusable.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA gives up congressional leverage at exactly \nthe wrong time. Instead of pressing USTR to get a better agreement or \nsignaling to our negotiating partners that Congress will only accept an \nagreement that ensures reciprocity and helps to spread the benefits of \ntrade, the Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA puts Congress in the backseat and \ngreases the skids for an up-or-down vote after the fact. Real \ncongressional power is not at the end of the process; it is right now, \nwhen the critical outstanding issues are being negotiated.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must meaningfully address currency manipulation--\nprotracted, large-scale, official, one-way intervention in the currency \nmarkets to weaken a currency for the purpose of boosting exports and \nlimiting imports. Currency manipulation has cost the U.S. millions of \njobs over the past decade and a half. Many people had trouble finding \nnew jobs or had to accept jobs at lower wages.\n  China manipulated its currency most dramatically in this time period, \naccumulating the largest stock of foreign exchange reserves the world \nhas ever known. In earlier episodes, Japan, South Korea, and others \nmanipulated their currencies on a protracted, grand scale. Japan's \ncurrency manipulation and other trade-distorting practices kept its \nauto and other markets closed while Japan had access to a very open \nU.S. market. This one-way trade decimated the U.S. tool and die \nindustry and seriously injured other segments of the auto industry, \nincluding U.S. automakers themselves.\n  The International Monetary Fund has up-to-date guidelines that define \ncurrency manipulation and are intended to prevent it. There is nothing \nwrong with the spirit or even the letter of those guidelines. \nUnfortunately, the IMF cannot enforce those guidelines because currency \nmanipulators are able to essentially stall action in that forum.\n  Arguments that prohibiting currency manipulation in TPP is \nimpossible, for technical or political reasons, remind us of previous \nclaims about trade agreements not being able to help defend forests or \ndiscourage child labor. For example, some people--prominent people--\nhave asserted that U.S. monetary policy would be put at risk if \ncurrency is included in TPP. I responded to that argument in a highly \ndetailed blog months ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to include that in the Record.\n\n                  [From the Huffington Post Blog Post,\n                             Feb. 6, 2015]\n\nThe Need To Address Currency Manipulation in TPP, and Why U.S. Monetary \n                         Policy Is Not at Risk\n\n                         (By Rep. Sander Levin)\n\n       Over the past decade, currency manipulation by foreign \n     governments has resulted in an increase in unfairly traded \n     imports into the United States and has made it more difficult \n     for U.S. exporters to compete in foreign markets. The \n     practice has cost U.S. workers between one million and five \n     million jobs--and is responsible for as much as half of \n     excess unemployment in the United States. It has contributed \n     to stagnant wages and to inequality in the United States. And \n     it contributed to the global financial crisis.*\n       Bipartisan majorities in the House and the Senate have \n     urged the Administration to include strong and enforceable \n     currency obligations in the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), \n     which includes a number of former currency manipulators, such \n     as Japan. Other countries interested in joining TPP in the \n     future--such as China, Korea, and Taiwan--are also current or \n     former currency manipulators.\n       The IMF already prohibits currency manipulation and has \n     developed guidelines to define when it occurs. The problem is \n     that the IMF lacks an enforcement mechanism.\n       I have proposed taking the existing IMF guidelines, \n     building upon them, and establishing an enforcement mechanism \n     through the TPP. Other groups and economists, such as the \n     American Automotive Policy Council (AAPC) and Fred Bergsten \n     of the Peterson Institute, have tabled similar proposals. \n     Economists on the right and left support including currency \n     disciplines in TPP. And the Commission on Inclusive \n     Prosperity recently stated: ``New trade agreements should \n     explicitly include enforceable disciplines against currency \n     manipulation that appropriately tie mutual trade preferences \n     to mutual recognition that exchange rates should not be \n     allowed to subsidize one party's exports at the expense of \n     others.'' Currency manipulation must become a subject in the \n     TPP negotiations.\n       A chief concern about including strong and enforceable \n     currency disciplines in TPP is that U.S. monetary policy \n     could be successfully challenged by our trading partners, \n     given that our expansionary monetary policy (in the form of \n     `quantitative easing') may have had the secondary effect of \n     weakening the dollar. What follows is a factual response to \n     that concern.\n       Again, my proposal is to take the IMF guidelines and make \n     them enforceable. Under the IMF guidelines, currency \n     manipulation is about government interventions in the foreign \n     exchange markets, not about other policies that may have a \n     secondary impact on foreign exchange rates. The IMF \n     guidelines clearly distinguish between currency \n     manipulation--government intervention in foreign exchange \n     markets--and monetary policy.\n       Article IV of the IMF's Articles of Agreement states that \n     ``each member shall . . . avoid manipulating exchange rates . \n     . . to gain an unfair competitive advantage over other \n     members.'' The IMF has gone on to provide seven factors in \n     its Guidelines to determine whether a country is manipulating \n     its currency. The following review of each factor identified \n     in those guidelines demonstrates that U.S. monetary policy, \n     including quantitative easing, cannot be described as a form \n     of currency manipulation.\n       Factor 1: Protracted Large-Scale Intervention, in One \n     Direction, in Currency Markets.\n       The United States intervenes in the currency market less \n     than almost any other\n\n[[Page H3552]]\n\n     country in the world. The United States has only intervened \n     in the currency markets a total of three days since the late \n     1990s: June 17, 1998 (during the Asian exchange rate/\n     financial crisis); September 22, 2000 (after the euro was \n     introduced and concerns grew over the euro's significant \n     depreciation against the dollar); and March 18, 2011 (in \n     connection with a Japanese earthquake and tsunami). These \n     three interventions over nearly 20 years cannot be described \n     as ``protracted'' interventions. Compare this record with, \n     for example, China's interventions over the past decade, \n     which have occurred almost daily, and almost always in the \n     same direction, to weaken their currency.\n       The circumstances surrounding these three interventions are \n     consistent with the Federal Reserve's Foreign Currency \n     Directive: interventions ``shall generally be directed at \n     countering disorderly market conditions.'' They are therefore \n     not consistent with the objective of ``gaining an unfair \n     competitive advantage'' over its trading partners, which is \n     what currency manipulation is about. In fact, the IMF \n     recommends and encourages members to intervene ``to counter \n     disorderly conditions.'' It is also worth noting that in \n     these three instances, the United States coordinated its \n     intervention with the other countries involved, again \n     demonstrating that the action was not taken to gain a \n     competitive advantage. Indeed, in all three cases the other \n     country requested the intervention of the United States.\n       While the United States has a flexible exchange rate (i.e., \n     it lets the market determine its value), it is also important \n     to note that the IMF Guidelines do not prevent other \n     countries from establishing a fixed or managed exchange rate. \n     The Guidelines only provide that the rate cannot be set at a \n     consistently artificially low level (i.e., countries may \n     engage in ``protracted, large scale'' interventions, so long \n     as all of these interventions are not all in the same \n     ``direction'').\n       Factor 2: Excessive Accumulation of Foreign Exchange \n     Reserves.\n       Despite the fact that the United States has the largest or \n     second largest economy in the world, the United States holds \n     fewer foreign exchange reserves than Thailand, Algeria, and \n     Saudi Arabia, among others. Further, China has 25 times as \n     many foreign exchange reserves (nearly $4 trillion) as the \n     United States ($126 billion).\n       Economists generally use four benchmarks, cited by Treasury \n     in 2006 and 2014 reports, to determine whether a country's \n     reserves are excessive. U.S. reserves are well below each \n     benchmark:\n       Benchmark #1--Reserves may be excessive if they exceed 100% \n     of short-term external debt (commonly referred to as the \n     ``Guidotti-Greenspan Rule''). U.S. reserves are equal to 2% \n     of its short-term external debt ($1.2 trillion). If only \n     taking into account debt denominated in foreign currencies, \n     U.S. reserves would equal 38% of short-term debt. Note, \n     however, that this benchmark was designed with emerging \n     markets in mind, not the U.S. economy.\n       By way of comparison, China's reserves are about 700% \n     (i.e., seven times greater than) its short-term external \n     debt.\n       Benchmark #2--Reserves are excessive if they exceed 5-20% \n     of money supply, commonly referred to as M2. U.S. reserves \n     are 1.1% of U.S. M2 ($11.7 trillion). China's reserves are \n     43% of its M2.\n       Benchmark #3--Reserves are excessive if they exceed 20% of \n     GDP. U.S. reserves are less than 1% of U.S. GDP (around $17 \n     trillion). China's reserves are 42% of its GDP.\n       Benchmark #4--Reserves are excessive if they exceed 3-4 \n     months of imports. U.S. reserves equal less than a single \n     month of U.S. imports (about $200 billion). China's reserves \n     equal 23 months of its imports.\n       Factor 3: Restrictions on/Incentives for Transactions or \n     Capital Flows for Balance of Payments Purposes.\n       The United States has one of the least restrictive \n     regulatory structures in the world concerning the free flow \n     of capital. In fact, the World Economic Forum ranks the \n     United States first in the world in terms of capital account \n     liberalization and second in the world under a more general \n     `financial development' index.\n       Factor 4: Encouragement of Capital Flows through Monetary \n     Policy for Balance of Payments Purposes.\n       This is the only guideline that even mentions monetary \n     policy. And while the United States--and every other country \n     in the world--does have a monetary policy, the purpose of \n     U.S. monetary policy is neither to encourage capital flows \n     nor to achieve a balance in payments. The goals of U.S. \n     monetary policy are spelled out in the Federal Reserve Act, \n     which specifies that the Board of Governors and the Federal \n     Open Market Committee should seek ``to promote effectively \n     the goals of maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate \n     long-term interest rates.''\n       Indeed, the IMF has explicitly supported U.S. monetary \n     policy (including each round of quantitative easing since the \n     ``Great Recession''). As the IMF said in its most recent \n     report ``[IMF] Directors agreed that the current highly \n     accommodative stance of monetary policy is appropriate, \n     consistent with the Federal Reserve's objectives of maximum \n     employment and price stability.'' The IMF has also noted that \n     U.S. monetary policy has been good for other nations \n     (`positive spillover effects') because it has helped to \n     sustain global growth. Similarly, the G-20 (which includes \n     China, Japan, Korea, the United States, and three other TPP \n     countries) has distinguished between monetary policy and \n     exchange rate policy--and has recognized ``the support that \n     has been provided to the global economy in recent years from \n     accommodative monetary policies, including unconventional \n     monetary policies.''\n       Factor 5: Fundamental Exchange Rate Misalignment.\n       If anything, the U.S. dollar is properly valued or even \n     overvalued, not undervalued, according to the most recent IMF \n     data and estimates. Further, given the continued weakening of \n     the yen and euro, many expect the dollar to further \n     strengthen in value in 2015.\n       Factor 6: Long and Sustained Current Account Surpluses.\n       The United States has had just one current account surplus \n     since 1981. In fact, the United States has been running large \n     current account and trade deficits for almost four decades. \n     Indeed, those imbalances are a major cause of concern to many \n     economists--and currency manipulation by other countries has \n     contributed substantially to the U.S. trade deficits in \n     recent years.\n       Factor 7: Large External Sector Vulnerabilities from \n     Private Capital Flows.\n       While the United States does have external sector \n     vulnerabilities (i.e., private and public sector debt owed to \n     foreigners), as reflected in the large current account \n     deficit, much of those vulnerabilities stem from purchases of \n     U.S. debt by foreign governments--not private capital flows. \n     And much of those purchases by foreign governments are the \n     result of foreign government intervention in the currency \n     markets that result in the accumulation of foreign reserves. \n     Thus, if anything, this factor, like Factor 6, tends to \n     suggest that the United States is a casualty of other \n     governments' currency manipulation, not that it is \n     manipulating itself.\n                                  ____\n\n       The IMF Guidelines demonstrate that the United States is \n     not manipulating its currency and would not be at risk of \n     losing a dispute. The far greater risk is that more middle \n     class jobs will be lost in the United States as a result of \n     foreign governments' currency manipulation. We need strong \n     and enforceable disciplines in TPP to help prevent that from \n     happening.\n\n\n                                endnote\n\n       * China's currency manipulation ``is arguably the most \n     important cause of the financial crisis. Starting around the \n     middle of this decade, China's cheap currency led it to run a \n     massive trade surplus. The earnings from that surplus poured \n     into the United States. The result was the mortgage bubble.'' \n     Sebastian Mallaby, ``What OPEC Teaches China,'' Washington \n     Post op-ed (Jan. 2009). The Bush Administration White House \n     also drew the connection: ``the President highlighted a \n     factor that economists agree on: that the most significant \n     factor leading to the housing crisis was cheap money flowing \n     into the U.S. from the rest of the world, so that there was \n     no natural restraint on flush lenders to push loans on \n     Americans in risky ways. This flow of funds into the U.S. was \n     unprecedented.'' Statement by White House Press Secretary \n     Dana Perino (Dec. 2008). Most of the cheap money flowing into \n     the United States came from foreign governments (not the \n     private sector) accumulating foreign exchange reserves and \n     other official assets. See Joseph E. Gagnon, ``Global \n     Imbalances and Foreign Asset Expansion by Developing-Economy \n     Central Banks,'' Peterson Institute for International \n     Economics (Mar. 2012).\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I have seen no serious rebuttal of the points \nI made in that post or to similar and related points made by Simon \nJohnson, Fred Bergsten, and many other notable economists ranging from \nArt Laffer to Paul Krugman. Nevertheless, those who oppose currency \ndisciplines continue to raise this false argument.\n  Mr. Speaker, TPP should address instances in which countries buy \nlarge amounts of foreign assets over long periods of time to prevent an \nappreciation of their exchange rate despite running a large current \naccount surplus. The Federal Reserve does not engage in such practices. \nThat is why the U.S. already agreed to and even insisted upon what is \nin the current IMF guidelines.\n  And now there is the claim that including currency disciplines in TPP \nwould be a poison pill and that our trading partners would walk away \nfrom the table. There is no way to accurately judge this issue until it \nis properly brought to the negotiating table. To the contrary, the fact \nis that the administration says this only creates the risk of a self-\nfulfilling prophecy.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  It is irresponsible to make this claim. Indeed, our trading partners \nin TPP would greatly benefit from these disciplines. Many of them are \nthe victims of manipulation in every bit as much as we are.\n  A progressive trade agreement for workers and the middle class must \naddress currency manipulation, which has caused millions of job losses \nand contributed to waste stagnation over the last decade. President \nObama is right that we should write the rules and not accept the status \nquo; but, if\n\n[[Page H3553]]\n\nwe fail to do address currency manipulation in TPP, we are essentially \nletting China write the rules and are accepting an unacceptable status \nquo.\n  It is vital that our trade agreements balance strong intellectual \nproperty rights and access to affordable, lifesaving medicines. Absent \na change in course, the final TPP text is likely to provide less access \nto affordable medicines than provided under the May 10 agreement. My \nstaff has just reviewed a new version of the text that raises some \nserious new questions; but even the last version of the text raised \nserious concerns.\n  For example, developing countries would likely be required to \n``graduate'' to more restrictive intellectual property rights standards \nbefore they become developed, a clear inconsistency with May 10. There \nare also a number of concerns that the TPP agreement will restrict \naccess to medicines in the U.S. and other developed countries, for \nexample, by encouraging second patents on similar products, by having \nlong periods of data exclusivity for biologic medicines, by allowing \ndrug companies to challenge government pricing and reimbursement \ndecisions.\n  Oxfam, a coalition of 17 international development organizations, \nrecently said:\n\n       TPP would do more to undermine access to affordable \n     medicines than any previous U.S. trade agreement, and the \n     intellectual property provisions in TPP reverse the positive \n     step taken under the May 10 agreement in 2007 . . . and thus \n     are a step backwards for public health.\n\n  And amFAR, the Foundation for AIDS Research, said this:\n\n       Our gains in reducing global HIV infections would never \n     have been realized if the proposed provisions under the TPP \n     were the intellectual property standard in 2001.\n\n  For most of the past 15 years, our trade deficit with Japan has been \nsecond only to our deficit with China, and over two-thirds of the \ncurrent deficit is in automotive products.\n  Japan has long had the most closed automotive market of any \nindustrialized country, despite repeated efforts by U.S. negotiators \nover decades to open it. At a minimum, the U.S. should not open its \nmarket further to Japanese imports, through the phaseout of tariffs, \nuntil we have time to see whether Japan has truly opened its market.\n  The administration has not stated a specific period of time for when \nthe phaseout in U.S. tariffs for autos, trucks, and auto parts would \nbegin or when they would end. The parties are also still working to \naddress certain nontariff barriers that Japan utilizes to close their \nmarket.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA bill broadly states that the U.S. should \n``expand competitive market opportunities for export of goods.'' Such a \nbroad negotiating objective provides no guidance regarding how to truly \nopen the Japanese automotive market.\n  On the related issue of rules of origin, there are a number of rules \nof origin being negotiated in the TPP for different products, including \nin the sensitive textile and apparel, agricultural, and automotive \nsectors. Some of the rules are largely settled while others, including \nthe rules for automotive products, remain open and controversial.\n  Rules of origin define the extent to which inputs from outside the \nTPP region--for example, China--can be incorporated into an end product \nfor that product to still be entitled to preferential/duty-free \ntreatment under the agreement.\n  The rule should be restrictive enough to ensure that the benefits of \nthe agreement accrue to the parties to the agreement. The automotive \nrule of origin in TPP should be at least as stringent as the rule in \nNAFTA, given that TPP involves all three of the NAFTA countries, plus \nnine others.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA bill provides no guidance whatsoever on any \nrule of origin on any product in the TPP negotiations. It appears that \nthe U.S. and Japan will agree that Japan will reduce tariffs, but never \neliminate them, on hundreds of agricultural products, far more carve-\nouts than under any U.S. trade agreement in the past.\n  Canada, on the other hand, has not put any offer on the table for \ndairy products, which is causing some concern in the dairy industry.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA bill has as its objective, ``reducing or \neliminating'' tariffs on agricultural products; thus even Japan's \nopening offer, to reduce but never eliminate tariffs on nearly 600 \nproducts, satisfied this objective, demonstrating that it is \nmeaningless.\n  The TPP negotiations are taking a different approach on environment \nthan we did in the May 10 agreement and in our FTAs with Peru, Panama, \nColombia, and Korea, where we stated simply that each country was \nobligated to implement seven multilateral environment agreements.\n  TPP negotiators are trying to build the same obligations from \nscratch, and we still do not know if they have succeeded. Words like \n``endeavor'' and ``take steps to'' are not going to lead to the \nrevolutionary changes we have been told to expect.\n  The President said at Nike recently that the TPP environmental \nchapter would ``help us do things that haven't been done before.'' \nActually, we have done these things before. In May 10, Peru included a \nspecial annex on deforestation. It needs more vigorous enforcement.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA bill is obsolete in providing instructions \nsince the TPP is already taking a different approach. The TPA bill also \ndoes not address whether or how climate change issues should be handled \nin TPP, an issue raised by other countries in the TPP negotiations.\n  There are now more cases of private investors challenging \nenvironmental, health, and other regulations in nations, even nations \nwith strong and independent judicial systems and rule of law.\n  Just last month--just last month--an investor won a NAFTA ISDS case \nin which the government of Nova Scotia denied a permit to develop a \nquarry in an environmentally sensitive area.\n  Other investment disputes involve ``plain packaging'' of tobacco \nproducts in Australia aimed at protecting public health and \npharmaceutical patent requirements in Canada. This issue is receiving \nheightened scrutiny among negotiators and from a broad range of \ninterested parties.\n  Some of our TPP partners do not support ISDS or are seeking \nsafeguards to ensure that nations preserve their right to regulate. The \nEconomist magazine, the Cato Institute, and the Government of Germany--\nthe birthplace of ISDS--have also recently expressed concerns with \nISDS.\n  As far back as 2007, when the May 10 agreement was reached, we \nrecognized growing concerns over investment and ISDS. We insisted that \nour trade agreements with Peru, Panama, Colombia, and Korea include new \npreambular language clarifying that the investment obligations in those \nagreements are not invented to provide foreign investors with greater \nsubstantive rights than investors have under U.S. law.\n  Over the past few years, our concerns over the investment text and \nISDS have become even greater. Nevertheless, our negotiators have \nrefused to include the May 10 preambular language in TPP, and the text \nof the investment chapter in TPP is basically the same model as adopted \n10 years ago, even though conditions have changed dramatically in the \npast 10 years and calls for changes to or elimination of the chapter \nhave intensified.\n  Despite proposals to include new safeguards in the ISDS mechanism, \nthe administration has not made any attempts to incorporate them.\n  The Hatch-Wyden-Ryan TPA investment negotiating objective is the same \nas it was 12 years ago and, again, is obsolete.\n  TPP does not ensure compliance by TPP parties that have labor laws \nand practices that fall short of international standards contained in \nthe May 10 agreement, even though TPP is expected to include the May 10 \nlanguage.\n  Vietnam presents the greatest challenge we have ever had in ensuring \ncompliance. Workers there are prohibited from joining any union \nindependent of the Communist Party. While the administration is \ndiscussing these issues with Vietnam, Members of Congress and \nstakeholder advisers have not yet seen any proposal to address these \ncritical areas.\n  On a recent trip to Vietnam, I met a woman who had been thrown in \njail for 4 years for trying to organize workers into an independent \nunion. We cannot simply have the right written obligation in the \nagreement and expect that\n\n[[Page H3554]]\n\nsome future dispute settlement panel is going to ensure meaningful \nchange on the ground for workers.\n  The administration has not committed to ensuring that all changes to \nlaws and regulations are made before Congress votes, as was true with \nPeru, Panama, and Colombia.\n  The administration also does not make available to Members of \nCongress any ``consistency plan'' they are discussing with Vietnam so \nthat we can evaluate the changes to Vietnamese laws and practices they \nare seeking.\n  From what I understand, any plan will fall far short of bringing \nVietnam into compliance with basic ILO standards, as required under the \nMay 10 agreement. For example, I am concerned Vietnam may refuse to \nallow industrywide unions to form, a clear inconsistency with ILO \nstandards. Our negotiators also have refused to accept our suggestion \nthat an independent panel be established from the beginning to ensure \ncompliance with the labor obligations and expedite a dispute.\n  Without such a structure, future cases will need to be built from \nscratch by outside groups and submitted to the U.S. Government, a \nprocess which has taken several years for the Department of Labor to \nact on in Honduras and Guatemala.\n  The President said recently that Vietnam ``would even have to protect \nworkers' freedom to form unions, for the first time,'' but the TPP that \nUSTR is negotiating seems far from ensuring those words will become \nreal.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mexico also has a long way to go. Americans know that Mexico competes \nin manufacturing. According to Professor Harley Shaiken at UC Berkeley:\n  ``Under NAFTA, the auto industry in Mexico has grown rapidly, and it \nis in the midst of an unprecedented expansion. Mexico assembled over 3 \nmillion vehicles in 2013--more than Canada--and exported over 80 \npercent of them, mostly to the U.S. Global automakers plan to invest \n$6.8 billion in Mexico between 2013 and 2015. As a result, Mexico is on \ntrack to become the leading source of imported vehicles for the U.S. \nmarket by 2015, surpassing both Canada and Mexico. Moreover, Mexico \nexported $44.8 billion in auto parts to the U.S. last year, more than \nJapan, Korea, and Germany combined.''\n  The wage rate in Mexico is about 20 percent of a comparable rate in \nthe U.S.\n  The administration likes to say that TPP will renegotiate NAFTA. I am \nall for that, but, again, words in the agreement are not enough. Mexico \nhas to change their laws and their practices. For example, they have to \nget rid of so-called ``protection contracts'' that serve to block real \nrepresentation in the workplace, and they need to fundamentally reform \nor replace the conciliation and arbitration boards that are responsible \nfor resolving disputes over workplace representation and other labor \nissues. This is vitally important because U.S. workers compete directly \nwith Mexican workers in critical manufacturing and other sectors. While \nI understand the administration has started conversations with Mexico, \nI am not informed of any consistency plan that would detail the changes \nMexico needs to make to their laws.\n  TPP negotiators are also working on disciplines for state-owned \nenterprises, or SOEs. Countries that rely heavily on state-controlled \nand state-funded enterprises are able to give those champions an \nenormous and unfair advantage over private companies that compete \nagainst them in the marketplace.\n  The TPP would include disciplines on SOEs that are expected in \nlanguage to go beyond anything we have ever included in past \nagreements, but the extent to which an SOE provision will help to level \nthe playing field will be determined by the degree to which parties \nseek very broad, country-specific carve-outs for particular SOEs. As \nconcerning, the definition of ``SOEs'' is too narrow, allowing \nenterprises that are effectively controlled by foreign governments--but \nwhere the government owns less than 50 percent of the shares--to \ncircumvent the obligations.\n  There are several other TPP issues that need to be addressed. Food \nsafety is one of them. There is a very broad consensus that not enough \nresources are being devoted to ensure the safety of our imports. What \nare we going to do about this issue? It is a real issue in the debate. \nUnfortunately, specific portions of the negotiations and the \nshortcomings in TPP are often difficult to discuss because the \ndocuments are classified.\n  I have not argued that the entire negotiations should be open to the \npublic. I understand that, in a wide range of contexts, from peace \nnegotiations to labor negotiations, it is widely assumed that \nnegotiations at times need to be held behind closed doors, and at this \npoint, I am not convinced that trade negotiations are different. The \nnegotiators need to communicate frequently and effectively with \nstakeholders to ensure that they are seeking the right provisions in \nnegotiations. In a number of respects, our negotiators were not doing \nthat when the TPP negotiations were in the early or even not so early \nstages.\n  Thanks to constant pressure from Members of Congress over the past \nseveral years, we have made some progress in this regard. For example, \njust a couple of years ago, USTR refused to share the bracketed text--\nlaying out the positions of various parties--with any Member of \nCongress. We got them to change that. Much more recently, they refused \nto let staff from personal offices assist their Members with the text \neven where the staff member had a top secret security clearance. We got \nthem to change that.\n  Still, there remain unreasonable and burdensome restrictions on \naccess to the text. For example, Congress created a system of \nstakeholder advisers many years ago to provide advice to our \nnegotiators and to Congress on the negotiations, but those advisers \nstill can only see U.S. negotiating proposals. They cannot see the \nproposals of our trading partners. It is very difficult, if not \nimpossible, for them to provide negotiating advice if they can't know \nwhat the other side is seeking. Moreover, personal office staff with \ntop secret security clearances still cannot see the negotiating text \nuntil the Member is present.\n  Let me say a few more words about this.\n  I am not at all confident that our negotiators are sharing with \nMembers of Congress or the stakeholder advisers all of the texts that \nare being exchanged with other TPP countries. For example, we know our \nnegotiators, as I have said, have been discussing a labor consistency \nplan with Vietnam for many months now at least, but there is still no \ntext for Members of Congress to review. This is one of the major \noutstanding issues in TPP, and yet there is no text to review despite \nthe fact that USTR has told us for at least a year now that the \nnegotiations were nearly complete. At a recent meeting to discuss \nVietnam, it was classified so that the status of negotiations on this \nissue cannot be discussed publicly. Many of us left less confident that \nthere has been any progress in the negotiations.\n  Or take currency manipulation. For years, literally, we have pressed \nwhat the administration's position is on the issue given that \nmajorities in both the House and the Senate have urged that strong and \nenforceable currency disciplines be included in TPP. For years, the \nadministration said it was still deliberating on the issue and had no \nanswer. Now, when pushed through the TPA debate in Congress, the \nadministration claims that they could not possibly include enforceable \ndisciplines in TPP because they would be a poison pill.\n  Finally, I do not understand why the administration is selectively \nable to reveal to the public certain aspects that they think the public \nwill like, but those of us who have concerns cannot reveal them. We \nhave examples of officials revealing to the press very specific things \nfrom the negotiating text, like when tariffs will be eliminated on a \nparticular product. In my view, as to the Environment Chapter, the \nproblem with that chapter is that many of the verbs used in those \nobligations--the essence of the commitments--are very weak, but I, \npresumably, can't tell you what those verbs are.\n\n  So one has a hard time understanding the rationale for this process. \nThe way it has been handled by the administration does not make Members \nand other key parties real participants with a meaningful role, \nunderstanding and impacting decisions undertaken in this important \nnegotiation.\n\n[[Page H3555]]\n\n  Let me say a word regarding an issue that has come up recently. In \naddition to falling short in getting TPP on the right track, the TPA \nbill also presents dangers with other agreements. This TPA will be, \nessentially, in place for 6 years. It gives the President a great deal \nof latitude in deciding which agreements to negotiate with whatever \ntrading partners the President wants and covering whatever subject the \nPresident wants.\n  Recently, Senator Elizabeth Warren drew heavy criticism for \nexpressing the concern that TPA could be used by a Republican President \nto undermine Dodd-Frank. The concern was dismissed as speculative and \ndesperate, but as explained below, the concern is genuine and \nlegitimate.\n  In ongoing trade agreement negotiations to establish a TTIP, European \nofficials, U.S. and European banks, and some congressional Republicans \nhave expressed an interest in harmonizing U.S. and EU financial \nservices in a way that would water down U.S. laws and regulations. \nSimilarly, some Republican Presidential candidates have expressed an \ninterest in weakening or in repealing Dodd-Frank, although not simply \nthrough the TTIP negotiations. Of course, doing so through TTIP \nnegotiations would give the President the excuse that agreeing to \nweaken Dodd-Frank was simply part of a quid pro quo to get something we \nwanted from Europe.\n  According to an article from Politico: ``White House and pro-trade \nofficials on the Hill say that the fast-track bill currently before \nCongress includes language that expressly forbids changing U.S. law \nwithout congressional action.'' But this language is nothing new. \nLegislation to implement trade agreements typically includes similar \nlanguage. The purpose of the language is simply to make clear that, \nunder U.S. law, our trade agreements do not have ``direct effect'' and \nare not ``self-executing,'' meaning that domestic laws and regulations \nneed to be amended to give effect to any obligation in an international \nagreement.\n  Implementing bills typically make changes to U.S. tariff laws to \ncomply with the tariff obligations of trade agreements, but some \nimplementing bills make more substantial, behind-the-border changes to \nU.S. laws to comply with the obligations in our trade agreements. That \nhas been true of changes to U.S. patent laws and changes to the \nImmigration and Nationality Act.\n  With all of these concerns in mind--and, above all, my determination \nto do everything I can to get TPP in shape to garner broad, bipartisan \nsupport in Congress--the Ways and Means Democrats offered a substitute \namendment during the markup of the TPA bill. That amendment, the Right \nTrack for TPP Act, includes negotiating instructions, not merely \n``negotiating objectives'' like the TPA bill, on each of the 12 major \noutstanding issues, some of which I have described earlier. It provides \nthat the President will not get an up-or-down vote unless and until \nCongress determines that the instructions have been followed. It also \nincludes real mechanisms to ensure that a poorly negotiated TPP \nagreement will not be placed on a fast track.\n  Regrettably, our substitute amendment was blocked in committee based \non a highly questionable procedural determination from the chair. In \nessence, while the Republican majority was free to mark up a bill that \nwas in both the jurisdiction of our committee and the Rules Committee, \nwe were denied the right to do the very same thing. Our chair was \nconcerned about stepping on the jurisdiction of the Rules Committee, \nand yet the Rules Committee has waived jurisdiction over the TPA bill.\n  As is often the case with trade debates, they become about something \nthey are not. This debate is not about being for TPP or against. I am \nfor the right TPP, and that is why I want Congress to be in a position \nto press negotiators to secure a better outcome.\n  This debate is not about letting China write the rules. I wrote the \namendments to the bill granting China PNTR to try and ensure China did \nnot write the rules when they entered the WTO.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  This debate is not about isolationism. Neither I nor any colleague of \nmine is arguing that we should pull up the drawbridge and isolate \nourselves. Indeed, most of us who currently oppose TPA right now have \ndemonstrated on a broad range of issues that we are internationalists, \nperhaps more so than those who support TPA.\n  This debate is not about national security or the pivot to Asia. I \nunderstand the national security issues. Indeed, what happened was \nyears ago Wilbur Mills said let's take trade negotiations out of the \nState Department and put them in USTR in order to be sure that the \neconomic advantages were not traded away for political advantages.\n  In the world today, I don't see how a trade agreement can be in our \nnational security interest if it isn't in our economic interest. Fifty \nyears ago, when the U.S. was an economic superpower, unlike any other \nnation in the world, maybe we could grant our trading partners \ndisproportionate and nonreciprocal conditions in exchange for political \nadvantages. That is what Wilbur Mills said. That is not the case today. \nOur economic security is critical to our national security.\n  Proponents of TPA are trying to sell TPA by selling TPP itself. \nUnfortunately, that is the problem. TPP is not yet on the right track. \nIt has not earned ``the most progressive trade agreement in history'' \nmoniker that the President has given it. The best course for Congress \nis to withhold fast track until we know TPP is on a better course, to \npress the administration to work with us and really respond to our \nconcerns by changing the course of negotiations, to send a signal to \nour negotiating partners that the Congress has set a high bar for \nnegotiations, that we are demanding the best deal; and, in a number of \nareas, I think these countries will welcome the improvements I have \nsuggested.\n  At the end of the day, the goal is to achieve a Trans-Pacific \nPartnership worthy of support, a TPP that spreads the benefits of trade \nto the broadest swath of the American public and addresses trade's \nnegative impacts. That is really what this negotiation is all about. \nThis is what really, really very much motivates my concern to get TPP \nright, not to give away our leverage until TPP is correct.\n  Voting now for TPA, when there is so much yet to be done to make TPP \nright, essentially gives away our leverage, essentially is a kind of a \nblank check to the administration. I feel so deeply about the \nimportance of trade, the importance of getting it right, that I really \nurge that should be our focus.\n  So I urge my colleagues not to give away our leverage, not to vote \nfor TPA until TPP is done correctly. That is the challenge before us. \nThat is the challenge likely to be before the House of Representatives \nthe week after next. That is a challenge that we must surmount. That is \na challenge that we must meet. That is a reflection of the years of \nmany of us in trying to make trade be put on the right track.\n  That motivated us years ago when we put together the May 10 \nagreement; that motivated us when we negotiated the agreement with \nPeru, we who negotiated it. That is our dedication. We support trade \nwhen expanded trade is shaped so that all benefit. That is not true \ntoday of this TPP, and therefore I hope my colleagues will join \ntogether in voting ``no'' on TPA until TPP is gotten right. That is our \ngoal; that is our purpose--that is our only purpose--and I think that \nis our challenge, and I hope the week after next we are going to meet \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3555-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3555-H3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Mooney) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, America is a beacon of hope \nand opportunity to the world for a reason. Our military veterans, whom \nwe honor this Monday during Memorial Day, put their lives on the line \nfor our freedoms and constitutional rights. Our Founders put in place a \nConstitution that is inspired by the fundamental Judeo-Christian belief \nthat men and women are created in God's image, with the right to life, \nproperty, freedom to worship, and carry out their\n\n[[Page H3556]]\n\nreligious convictions without government interference or persecution.\n  We may take this idea for granted today, with 250 years of history at \nour backs, but at the time of our Nation's founding, the idea of \nreligious freedom was radical. The world was a different place then. \nGod-fearing, peaceful citizens around the world were commonly \npersecuted for their beliefs. They were tortured and thrown in prison \nwithout a fair hearing. In short, they did not have freedom. These are \nrights and freedoms that many in our country take for granted. They \nwere denied what our Founders held to be basic human rights.\n  So at a great risk to themselves and their families, but with deeply \nheld optimism for a new and better future, they sailed the Atlantic \nOcean for the shores of the New World, for America.\n  Here they planted a new society based on freedom. Centuries later, we \nin this legislative body, are the guardians of this legacy. We are here \nto advance freedom and protect liberty. But we must be vigilant in this \ntask.\n  President Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       Freedom is never more than one generation away from \n     extinction. We didn't pass it to our children in the \n     bloodstream. It must be fought for, protected, and handed on \n     for them to do the same, or one day we will spend our sunset \n     years telling our children and our children's children what \n     it was once like in the United States where men were free.\n\n  I agree with President Reagan, and that is why I rise today. Our \nbasic freedoms are under attack. We must stand up and fight. We don't \nneed to search long to find the wreckage of a society that does not \nvalue freedom.\n  I recently met with a group of constituents, Syrian Americans who \nlive in Charleston, West Virginia. Many of them have family members and \nloved ones in Syria. Their stories provide a strong warning to us. In \nSyria, a cruel and brutal dictator, al-Assad, is attempting to silence \nopposing views. He has resorted to chemical weapon attacks on his own \npeople. He has gunned down his own citizens. He has bombed hospitals \nand apartment complexes full of women and children. We can learn an \nimportant lesson from Syria: once tyranny grabs hold, it will grow and \nexpand its reach. And the consequences can be drastic. In Syria, 4 out \nof 5 people live in poverty, more than 200,000 have been killed, a \nmillion wounded, and more than 3 million have fled the country.\n  But we should not be so arrogant as to think that our liberties here \nat home in the United States are safe. The evidence that our basic \nfreedoms are under siege is growing, and I would like to share just a \nfew stories that have recently come to my attention. For example, an 8-\nyear-old second grade student in a New Jersey public school wanted to \nsing ``Awesome God'' at her after-school talent show, but she was told \nshe couldn't because of the song's religious lyrics.\n  The Arizona Republic reported in July of 2012 that the pastor of a \nchurch in Phoenix, Arizona, was jailed and fined $12,000 for hosting a \nBible study meeting in his private home. They outrageously claimed it \nviolated zoning and fire code ordinances.\n  Five men in Richmond, Virginia, were threatened with arrest by local \npolice officers for sharing their faith on a public sidewalk.\n  The University of Missouri threatened to withhold a student's diploma \nbecause she refused to participate in a class assignment that required \nher to write a letter to the Missouri legislator in support of \nhomosexual adoption.\n  In a New York hospital, a pro-life nurse was coerced into providing a \nlate-term abortion, even though her workplace had agreed in writing to \nhonor her religious beliefs.\n  And in the beautiful Second Congressional District of West Virginia, \nwhich I have the honor of representing, Joe Holland, a businessowner, \nis currently being pushed to violate his religious views and values by \nan ObamaCare regulation that requires him to provide abortifacient \ndrugs to his employees as a part of so-called health care. A regulation \ncommonly known as the HHS mandate requires him to provide the drugs or \nface a penalty of $100 per day per employee. For a company of 150 \nemployees, that is about $5.5 million a year, or about $36,000 per \nemployee.\n  These are just a few of the alarming stories about the religious \nfreedoms of peaceful, God-fearing Americans being snatched away by a \ngovernment that has lost its way. It is no coincidence that the very \nFirst Amendment to the United States Constitution says: ``Congress \nshall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or \nprohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of \nspeech, or of the press, or the right of the people peaceably to \nassemble, and to petition the government for a redress of grievances.''\n  Religious freedom was protected in the First Amendment to the \nConstitution. Our Forefathers valued that. They knew what could happen \nif we didn't protect our religious freedom.\n  We must take action and recommit ourselves to this basic right. \nCongress actually has taken action in the past on a bipartisan basis. \nIn 1993, Congress passed the Religious Freedom Restoration Act, signed \nby President Clinton. The law says the government should not force \nanyone to violate their sincere religious beliefs, whether those \nbeliefs are considered widely shared or not. This legislation \nunanimously passed this Chamber, United States House of \nRepresentatives, and it passed the Senate by a vote of 97-3 on October \n27, 1993.\n  The broad support is because the legislation simply affirms our \nconstitutionally endowed rights. But now support for this formerly \nbipartisan, widely supported law is eroding to the point that it has \ncome under attack around the country, the recent events in Indiana \nbeing the recent highest profile example.\n  I believe that this Congress must be a Congress of action in \ndefending religious freedoms. I understand that my good friend and \ncolleague from Idaho, Mr. Labrador, is working on a bill to protect \ninstitutions and individuals who believe that marriage is between one \nman and one woman. I support this effort, and I look forward to being \nan original cosponsor when he introduces the bill.\n  I am also a proud cosponsor of the Child Welfare Provider Inclusion \nAct, which will ensure that adoption and foster care providers are not \nexcluded by States for offering their services based on their religious \nbeliefs. Unfortunately, some States have already begun punishing faith-\nbased organizations that provide these services because of their \nreligious beliefs. These religious freedom protections are needed now, \nand I hope they will be allowed a vote in this Chamber.\n  We can't do this alone. We do need the President, President Obama, to \njoin with us to protect religious freedom. The President said on June \n26, 2013, regarding the U.S. Supreme Court decision to strike down the \nDefense of Marriage Act the following about religious freedom: ``On an \nissue as sensitive as this, knowing that Americans hold a wide range of \nviews based on deeply held beliefs, maintaining our Nation's commitment \nto religious freedom is also vital.''\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  If the President really believes that religious freedom is ``vital,'' \nhe must back his words up with action. That hasn't happened. In fact, \njust the opposite has occurred, with the administration's attack on the \nReligious Freedom Restoration Act, which attacks those who believe in \nreligious freedom, through its HHS mandate and its attack on the \nDefense of Marriage Act. He is not protecting religious freedom. We \nhave to do that here.\n  We have a sacred obligation to pass on to our children and \ngrandchildren a country that has the same love for liberty and \nreligious freedom as the one we inherited, but this won't happen on its \nown. We need to stand up and fight with courage and conviction, fight \nright here and right now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3556-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3556]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW\n\n  Mr. MOONEY of West Virginia.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the\n\n[[Page H3557]]\n\ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Beyer) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the remarkable life \nand accomplishments of Mr. Albert Melvin Miller, who passed away on \nSunday, May 10, at Inova Alexandria Hospital.\n  Melvin was a well-known political and community leader in the city of \nAlexandria, Virginia. One of his crowning achievements was his work \nwith the Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority, protecting and \nexpanding affordable housing programs across the city.\n  Mel was a civil rights advocate, a mentor, and a beloved father. He \nwas also a character: kind, interested, ever present, honest, hard-\nworking, inspirational, and--above all--witty. Mel Miller was a person \nyou wanted to spend time with.\n  Mel grew up in Haddonfield, New Jersey, but his heart belonged to \nRaleigh, North Carolina, where his alma mater, Saint Augustine's \nUniversity, is located, and to his adopted hometown of Alexandria, \nVirginia.\n  Graduating from Saint Aug's in history and political science, he \nremained deeply involved with the school by serving on the board of \ntrustees for 35 years and encouraging Alexandria's students to attend \nhis beloved university.\n  After earning his JD from Howard University School of Law, Melvin was \nadmitted to the Virginia State Bar and moved to Alexandria in 1958. \nEarly in his Alexandria life, Melvin begin his civil rights activism \nand community involvement by doing pro bono work on school \ndesegregation issues.\n  This work led him to join an underground association unofficially \nnamed the ``Secret Seven,'' which met to discuss possible ways to \ndiscuss civil rights and liberties in Alexandria and the surrounding \nareas. This early local involvement led him to become a prominent \nfigure in Alexandria's education system and the authority and champion \nfor affordable housing.\n  Melvin's work for the Department of Housing and Urban Development and \nthe Alexandria Redevelopment and Housing Authority helped to provide \nhousing for hundreds of Alexandria's poor. His crowning achievement was \na deal by Melvin between the city of Alexandria and ARHA, which \nrequired any affordable housing that was destroyed to be matched one-\nfor-one with new developments. That deal still stands largely untouched \ntoday.\n  Mel was a tireless mentor of Alexandria's students and an avid high \nschool sports fan. He could often be seen and heard giving advice to \nlocal students and cheering at high school sporting events. He also \nserved on the Alexandria school board from 1986 to 1993, serving as \nboard chair from 1990 to 1992.\n  Mel is survived by his daughter, Ericka Miller; his son, Marc Miller, \nand wife, Mary; his grandchildren, Max, Chris, Zachary, and Bennett \nMiller; his daughter-in-law, Vicky McCauley; and a host of other \nrelatives and many friends.\n  Melvin was preceded in death by son, Eric. His wife of nearly 5 \nyears, Eula Miller, passed away in 2011. Eula was also a tremendous \nadvocate for education in northern Virginia, having helped create many \nprograms supporting caregivers and young mothers in local high schools \nand Northern Virginia Community College.\n  I offer my condolences to his family and all the people who have been \naffected by the loss of this amazing man. Mr. Albert Melvin Miller is a \nshining example of the effect one person can have on so many local \nlives. I hope his memory lives as an inspiration for local leaders to \ncome.\n  At his funeral yesterday, former T.C. Williams High School legendary \nfootball coach Herman Boone ended his eulogy with the call to \n``Remember the Titan,'' Melvin Miller.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3557-1", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mrs. Napolitano (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "21"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/05/21/house-section/article/H3557-2", "month": "05", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3557]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 178.
