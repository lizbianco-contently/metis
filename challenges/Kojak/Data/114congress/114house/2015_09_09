The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, our vote on the nuclear agreement with \nIran will be the most important decision I have made in Congress since \nvoting against the disastrous Iraq war.\n  I am under no illusions that the clerics and military that run Iran \nare friends of the United States. To the contrary, they are engaged in \nactivities that are opposed to the United States interests and those of \nmany of our friends and allies.\n  This agreement does not resolve all our differences, change Iranian \nbehaviors, or provide greater freedom for its people. What it does do \nis give the world 15 years of security to prevent Iran from developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  It also demonstrates our ability to work with our international \npartners--France, Great Britain, Germany, especially Russia and China--\nto bring Iran to the negotiating table, to force them to make important \nconcessions, and to retain the ability to re-impose crippling sanctions \nif they violate the agreement.\n  It has a strong mechanism for surveillance and snapping back \nsanctions to give us confidence that it is strongly in the Iranians' \ninterest to comply.\n  Fifteen years is not forever. But taking the current nuclear breakout \ntime of less than 15 weeks for Iran to a minimum of a year and having \nassurance for 15 years is a remarkable achievement.\n  The alternative is not ``a better deal.'' There is no evidence that \nthere is something beyond this agreement that the Iranians would agree \nwith or, most critically, that has the support of the other five \ncountries that made this agreement possible in the first place.\n  The alternative is for the United States to lose the support of our \nallies so that Iran gets access to its money anyway, the partnership \ndissolves, and this important moment is lost.\n  The United States still retains the ability to walk away from the \ndeal if it is rejected or violated by Iran. This puts us in a much \nstronger position to re-impose sanctions with more leverage going \nforward.\n  In the final analysis, the United States or Israel, for that matter, \ncan always resort to military force. But it is far better, however, to \nmake this agreement work, to monitor and enforce it, and build on this \nunique international partnership.\n  Our work will not be done in the Middle East with Iran, even if this \nagreement is adopted and Iran abides by it. We still must be prepared \nto confront Iran where they are involved with aggressive action against \nother countries, especially our allies.\n  We must be prepared to support our friends in the Middle East, like \nIsrael and Saudi Arabia. We must be prepared to make the diplomatic \nefforts and demonstrate commitment and resolve wherever it is \nnecessary.\n  Those who would resort to force in the first instance will always \nretain that option.\n  We risk little trying to make diplomacy with rigorous inspections \nwork and to strengthen the partnership with countries that made this \nagreement possible, to redouble our ongoing efforts to stabilize this \ndeeply troubled Middle East region.\n  The agreement doesn't solve our problems, but it simplifies one of \nthe greatest threats to the Middle East, not just Iranian nuclear \nweapons, but a potential nuclear arms race with potentially \ncatastrophic results.\n  I am comfortable being in agreement with some of the most \ndistinguished leaders of past American administrations, both Republican \nand Democratic, who have agreed, notwithstanding their reservations and \ncautions, that the acceptance of this agreement is the best path \nforward for the United States and world peace.\n  It is sad that, for the very first time, a critical American foreign \npolicy decision has become so partisan in Congress. But the weight of \nevidence is for the agreement to be adopted, and we should do so.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5853-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5853-H5854]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        APOLOGY TO THE VICTIMS OF THE ``IRANIAN NUCLEAR ATTACK''\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Johnson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, because speeches made here on the\n\n[[Page H5854]]\n\nHouse floor are preserved for history, I want to speak to the future, \nto present a plausible scenario and an apology, an apology to be heard \nby the survivors, an apology to every victim of what will forever be \nknown as the Iranian nuclear attack.\n  I expect it will be after the year 2030 before anyone takes any real \nnotice of this apology. Someone will find it while surfing what remains \nof the Internet, maybe in Israel, Western Europe, or here in the United \nStates, someone surrounded by the smoking ruins of leveled buildings, \nthe incinerated corpses of those lucky enough to have been killed in \nthe first seconds of the blast, and the wails of anguish of those left \nto die and mourn.\n  It is especially ironic and heartbreaking to be speaking about this \nas today, in 2015, we prepare to remember those killed in the 9/11 \nterrorist attacks.\n  So to the people of 2030, on behalf of America, I am truly sorry. I \nam sorry we failed to stop President Obama from releasing $150 billion \nto fuel the destructive fantasies of terrorist leaders in Iran that lit \nthe fuse.\n  During my 26-year career in the United States Air Force, America's \nleaders believed in mutually assured destruction, the MAD theory.\n  We thought, if one nation such as the Soviet Union launched nuclear \nmissiles, the other nation would do so as well and both would be \ndestroyed. This potential of mutual destruction kept those missiles in \ntheir silos.\n  But that theory does not apply to dealing with the leaders of Iran, \nwho are dangerous fanatics, motivated by evil, not self-preservation.\n  So the madness in Iran means the MAD theory doesn't apply in 2015. \nAnd that is why I am sorry that we who lead America in 2015 failed to \nstop President Obama from helping Iranian terrorists and Iranian \ntyrants build an intercontinental ballistic missile system.\n  I am also sad to say that the people hearing my message in 2030 will \nbear witness to the fact that Iranian missiles can, indeed, deliver \nnuclear holocaust to America's soil.\n  In the Air Force, I worked alongside other military strategists to \nensure that missiles would never strike here. But, in 2015, America's \nPresident and his supporters discarded those concerns.\n  So to our countrymen of 2030 and to our friends in Israel whose land \nnow lies fallow and wrecked, let me now say we were wrong. We struggle \nto imagine what you must be going through. The death and destruction \nthat once haunted your nightmares now plays out before you.\n  Families and friends are either dead or lined up at makeshift morgues \nto claim the bodies of loved ones. Food and water are scarce or \ncontaminated with radiation. Refugees from the blast area stagger down \ngridlocked highways where traffic stopped when the detonation occurred.\n  We thought we had seen the worst of humanity's hate on September 11, \n2001, but that atrocity now pales in comparison. The similarities \nbetween the tragic missteps of Barack Obama and Neville Chamberlain, \nwho foolishly trusted Nazi Germany, are obvious.\n  Mr. Obama says his deal with Iran will somehow lead to peace. Mr. \nChamberlain made the same assertion, claiming that his pact with the \nNazis would lead to ``peace for our time.''\n  In 2015, I spoke in opposition to the deal that led to the 2030 \nIranian nuclear attack because I well remember the words of the \ntheologian Bonhoeffer who eventually died in a Nazi torture chamber.\n  In confronting the murderous madmen of his time, he declared that \n``Silence in the face of evil is itself evil: God will not hold us \nguiltless. Not to speak is to speak. Not to act is to act.''\n  In 2015, many of us spoke, many of us acted, but the powers of evil \nstill won the day. And now the innocent dead of 2030 call out with just \none question: How could the leaders of 2015 let this happen?\n  The answer is simple and sad: Because, despite our best efforts, we \ncouldn't stop the deal that funded, armed, and unleashed nuclear hell \nfrom the madmen of Iran. We allowed the power and persistence of the \nfoolish to deliver a corrupt contract with a nation of terror. And, in \n2030, the day of reckoning arrived. And for that I am truly very, very \nsorry.\n  May God have mercy on us all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5854-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5854-H5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              IMMIGRATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, you know in the movies when someone has \nto make a choice and a little devil and a little angel appear on their \nshoulder to give good and bad advice? Well, that is what I feel America \nis going to feel like in a couple of weeks when His Holiness Pope \nFrancisco comes to visit us, including an address in this very room.\n  On one shoulder, we have a billionaire out there saying Mexicans are \nmurderers; immigrants come to this country to get on welfare; our best \ndays are behind us; and just getting tough and insulting people will \nsolve all of our problems and make us great again.\n  And almost everyone else in his party is scrambling to catch up so \nthey don't miss out on the wave of populist anger he is tapping and \nfeeding with a mix of untruths, half-truths, and good old-fashioned \nracism.\n  On the other shoulder is a man who is not afraid to touch the feet of \nthe poor and recognizes their humanity even in their poverty. He is a \nman who sees actual human problems, like our environment, and tries to \nbring us together to do something about it. He is a man who, through \ndeeds, declarations, and his own demeanor says in a clear voice: \nWelcome the stranger, and come onto me.\n  He does not blame a nation's problems on the strangers at the gate or \nsays ``get the hell out.'' In many ways, Pope Francis represents the \nAnti-Trump, the antidote to his venom.\n  I, like a lot of my Democratic colleagues and a lot of my Catholic \ncolleagues and, frankly, the majority of American of all faiths and \npolitical stripes across the Nation, am very much looking forward to \nthe Pope's visit and the Pope's words because our Nation needs a \ncounterbalance, a counterweight, to what has become the ugliest, most \nxenophobic, and most anti-immigration campaign in anyone's memory.\n  You can also throw in large helpings of anti-woman, anti-\nenvironmental, and anti-poor attacks in there as well.\n  Shortly after The Donald announced with great fanfare and extreme \ninsult and unvarnished racism that he would inflict his campaign for \nthe White House on the Nation, I came to this well to address my \ncolleagues on July 9.\n  I discussed a reasoned approach to dealing with the immigrant \ncriminals who must be locked up and deported and distinguishing them \nfrom the vast majority of America's immigrants who live peacefully and \nhelpfully among us.\n  They come here to work and to make a better life for themselves and \ntheir families, as my parents did when they left Puerto Rico in the \nfifties to seek a better life, eventually landing in Chicago.\n  It is the strength and the advantage of our Nation that we come from \neverywhere, but we have put together the best Nation on Earth by \nworking together. It is what defines us as a people.\n  Most of our ancestors came to this land of their own free will, and \nsome did not. Most came here seeking a dream or running away from a \nnightmare or sometimes both.\n  Most of us came here legally, sometimes waiting in lines that lasted \nyears. And some of us, when legality was not an option and there was no \nline to stand in, came anyway because work and freedom are so \nplentiful.\n  But in the United States, we came together from many nations and \ntraditions and languages and religions and made the one Nation that \nstands above all others as the defender of liberty, the engine of the \nworld economy, and the beacon of freedom recognized in every corner of \nthe globe.\n  We are proud of our accomplishments, as we should be, despite our \nhumble beginnings, when no one and no other nation thought we could \nsurvive to take our place among the nations of the world.\n  As the Pope joins us this month to deliver his message of peace and \ninclusion, I urge all of us to remember the many challenges we have \nfaced as a Nation and the many obstacles we have overcome.\n\n[[Page H5855]]\n\n  Just a few decades ago the thought of a Catholic President was \noutrageous and the thought of a Pope addressing a Joint Session of \nCongress was far-fetched, just about as far-fetched as a Black \nPresident of the United States, a woman President, or a Latino Pope \nfrom Latin America.\n  Over the decades, in fits and starts, marching forward, being pushed \nback, marching forward again arm in arm, we have spent more time \nlistening to our better angels and their advice, taking us toward a \nbrighter future as a Nation and less time listening to our darker \ninfluences who lament progress and seek to divide us from one another.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I think, in this Capitol Building, in this Chamber, when the Pope \nspeaks to us, we will see two paths in very sharp relief. Build a wall \nor build a bridge? Help our brother or turn our backs? Belittle our \nsister or share her heavy load? Incite distrust and division or foster \nunity to face our challenges because we are stronger together?\n  For this Catholic American, for this man who has sometimes struggled \nwith the church and is not always welcome because of my support for \nwomen's health, a woman's right to a legal abortion, LGBT, I am so \nlooking forward to the Pope's visit because I feel my Nation needs him \nmore than ever before.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5855-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5855]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHINA'S AGGRESSIVE SOUL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, there are five entities that have \nmischief and aggression on their minds--of course, ISIS, Iran, Russia, \nNorth Korea, and China.\n  Recently, while the President preached climate change in Alaska, \nthree Chinese combat ships got closer to the Alaskan coast than ever \nbefore. Military experts say this was the first time Chinese ships were \nin that area, just the latest example of China expanding its military \noperation globally.\n  One expert said:\n\n       The Chinese Navy is taking on more and more of an \n     expeditionary character . . . the Chinese Navy is going \n     global.\n\n  He is correct. China has massively built up its military and uses it \nto project its power in Asia and other places. Like Russia's invasion \nof Ukraine, China is taking over territory while the United States just \nwatches.\n  There has been a fivefold increase in China's military expenditures \nsince 1997. It is stockpiling nuclear weapons. A recent Pentagon report \nrevealed that China is upgrading its ballistic missile delivery systems \nwith multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles, or MIRV, \ntechnology. What that means in layman's terms is they can send one \nmissile with several nuclear warheads; one could hit New York, and one \ncould hit Texas.\n  The Beijing Navy is taking control of disputed areas and intimidating \nother countries in the region who have rightful claims to the South \nChina Sea. This is a poster, Mr. Speaker, of 1999--I know you can't see \nthe background, but this is Beijing in the South China Sea area from \nAustralia to almost Alaska and east and west Guam to Indonesia--1999 \nmilitary might of the Chinese depicted here by planes, ships, and \nsubmarines and U.S. military might about the same in 1999.\n  What is it today? Let's look at the same map, superimposed with \nChinese buildup since 1999. In 2015, you don't have to be real smart to \nunderstand the Chinese are building more airplanes, now aircraft \ncarriers, more ships, and lots of nuclear submarines and conventional \nsubmarines. The United States, we are about the same with our military \nmight in the area. That is today.\n  This ratio here is a missile that can be fired in this region.\n  Now, let's project just 5 years and see what the Chinese will have in \n2020 in the same area, same region. United States, we are about the \nsame--but, look, planes, nuclear carriers, now intercontinental \nballistic missiles, more ships, more submarines, Chinese military \nmight, 2020 and today or in 1999.\n  We should be concerned about Chinese aggressive tendencies. In \nDecember 2013, China also began a bold land-reclaiming project in the \nSouth China Sea in an effort to increase its influence. What does that \nmean? That means that the Chinese are going in the South China Sea and \nthey are dredging areas and making islands in the South China Sea. On \nsome of these islands, it intends to build runways. I wonder what for.\n  Not only does China claim these newly created lands, but it also \nclaims exclusive maritime rights in vast surrounding areas in the South \nChina Sea. This has rightfully rattled our allies in the region. Not \nonly has China become an economic giant, but it is a military bully in \nthe area.\n  China, of course, is a state-run communist country. There is no \ntelling what China could do and what would happen to the global economy \nif China insists on controlling the sea lanes. Is China becoming like \nthe Barbary pirates of old that used to control the Mediterranean? Is \nthat what China is going to do in the South China Sea? Who knows.\n  Other countries in the area are looking for the United States to \nlead. They haven't forgotten what China did the last time China was an \nimperial power. For over 1,000 years, until the 20th century, China \nrequired other countries that wanted to trade in Asia to pay tribute to \nChina. That meant kneeling down before the emperor and paying heavy \ntaxes. It was an extortion plan.\n  Our friends in Asia don't want that to happen again. This is not a \ntime to sit back and let the chips fall where they may in Asia. The \nUnited States should care about what China is doing because China's \nbrazen move toward colonization of the South China Sea shows that \nBeijing is determined to expand its military and economic influence in \nthe entire area.\n  What is the United States going to do? Are we going to do the same as \nwe did with Russia and just watch? The region and the world both are \nlooking for the United States to lead. We should lead because that is \nthe responsibility of the world's most important democracy.\n  This should concern the entire world, not just the South China Sea \narea. Also, these lack of resources should concern Americans.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5855-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5855-H5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             END HUNGER NOW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, supporting healthy families and strong \ncommunities starts with access to healthy food, but for many families, \nit is a struggle just to put food on the table. A growing body of \nresearch shows why we should all be concerned with hunger as a health \nissue.\n  For the 49 million Americans who struggle with food insecurity--or \nhunger--access to nutritious food and enough healthy food is a real \nchallenge that can have serious negative health consequences far beyond \njust a growling stomach.\n  Hunger can exacerbate underlying medical conditions like diabetes, \nheart disease, and cancer and can result in life-threatening \ncomplications; not only that, hunger can result in more trips to the \nemergency room and more hospitalizations which only increases \nhealthcare costs across the board.\n  A recent article in the Canadian Medical Association Journal found \nthat households with low food security had 49 percent higher healthcare \ncosts than those who didn't have to worry about where their next meal \nwas coming from. Healthcare costs were an astonishing 121 percent \nhigher for those with very low food security.\n  Similarly, a 2014 article in the journal Health Affairs reported that \nhospitals saw a 27 percent increase in hypoglycemia cases among low-\nincome individuals at the end of the month as compared to the beginning \nof the month.\n  You might wonder why that is. The sad truth is that these cases of \nhypoglycemia--or low blood sugar--are likely more prevalent at the end \nof the month because this is when SNAP benefits run out for many \nindividuals and their families.\n  When families don't have enough to eat, their health suffers. We hear \ntime and time again that the current monthly SNAP benefit is \ninadequate. That families must scramble to cobble\n\n[[Page H5856]]\n\ntogether enough to eat from food pantries and charities.\n  Seniors are especially vulnerable to hunger as a health issue. Many \nseniors live on fixed incomes and are often faced with the tough choice \nof paying for their medications or paying for their food. For seniors, \ntaking medication on an empty stomach can be especially dangerous and \nmay land them in the hospital.\n  It is astounding that some of America's most vulnerable families must \nface these challenges month after month, year after year; but the good \nnews is that hunger can also be one of the most treatable health \nconditions. Hunger is solvable. We have the resources, but we need to \nmuster the political will to end hunger now.\n  One organization that has for years been doing incredible work to \nreframe the paradigm of hunger as a health issue is Community Servings, \na Massachusetts-based nonprofit that delivers free meals to homebound \nindividuals and their families. Their meals are medically tailored to \nmeet the specific dietary needs of the recipients.\n  The Community Servings model addresses two of the biggest barriers \nthat low-income individuals who are dealing with extended illness face: \nshopping for food and preparing meals. Community Servings takes care of \nthat so that patients can focus on getting better without worrying \nabout where their next meal is coming from.\n  The Community Servings model shows great promise in not only fighting \nhunger but also in saving money in our healthcare system. A survey last \nyear of doctors and nurses who care for Community Servings clients \nfound that 96 percent said that the meals improved their clients' \nhealth and 65 percent said they believed the meals had resulted in \nfewer hospitalizations.\n  We also need to do a better job of connecting our hospitals and our \ncommunity health centers and VA hospitals with farmers markets. \nOrganizations like Wholesome Wave are effectively expanding their fruit \nand vegetable prescription program, where doctors can write a \nprescription for fruits and vegetables that individuals could then \nimmediately fill at a farmers market that might be set up on the \nhospital grounds 1 or 2 days a week.\n  Boston Medical Center has addressed hunger as a health issue head on \nwith its Preventive Food Pantry permanently located in the hospital \nitself. Here, low-income families can work with a dietitian to choose \nfoods that meet their dietary needs with an emphasis on fresh fruits \nand vegetables.\n  Food banks and food pantries are finding innovative ways to partner \nwith local farms to provide more fresh produce to low-income families. \nI am proud to represent one such forward-thinking partnership in my \ncongressional district. Every year, the Community Harvest Project, run \nthrough a local farm in Grafton, Massachusetts, donates hundreds of \nthousands of pounds of fresh fruits and vegetables to the Worcester \nCounty Food Bank.\n  Finally, we ought to do a better job of educating doctors and nurses \nabout what hunger looks like. I am always surprised when I talk to \nmedical students, that they only take one or two, if any, classes in \nnutrition. That is why I am a cosponsor of my friend Congressman Tim \nRyan's bill, the ENRICH Act, which would provide grants to improve \nnutrition education among healthcare professionals.\n  Mr. Speaker, as Members of Congress, we talk a lot about finding ways \nto save money in our healthcare system. In that same conversation, we \nneed to do a better job of understanding that food is medicine.\n  We can't just address hunger and health as two separate issues; they \nare two sides of the same coin. Hunger is a health issue, and it should \nbe treated as such. We can and we should do more to end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5856-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, as you know, the House adjourned for the \nmonth of August for time to be in the districts with our constituents.\n  Before that, we saw the breaking story in mid-July of Planned \nParenthood and the videos that came out of the barbaric practices that \nwere happening in there on aborted babies.

Indeed, \nseveral of our committees started immediately taking action in July and \nthen during August with letters transmitted to Planned Parenthood and \nothers to make this more well known to the public, letters to invite \nthem to explain themselves to committees--Energy and Commerce \nCommittee, Judiciary Committee, Oversight and Government Reform \nCommittee--which upon each video, as they became available to the \npublic, Americans were more and more horrified with what was going on.\n  The actions in the House were to ask the first person in the first \nvideo, Dr. Nucatola, to come and present her case of what that video \nwas about and why it happened to the committee.\n  Planned Parenthood responded that they probably wouldn't make Dr. \nNucatola available; but indeed, finally, a month later, on August 27, \nthe committee was able--a month later--to interview Dr. Nucatola.\n  Today, the Judiciary Committee will resume these hearings this \nmorning, almost as we speak now. Indeed, later on, Oversight and \nGovernment Reform later this week and Energy and Commerce Committee \nthis week, will be doing more investigations, more hearings, on this, \nas is our prerogative in the House with Oversight and Government Reform \nbecause the American people, no matter how they feel about the question \non abortion, post-abortion, when Planned Parenthood appears to most \npeople to now be the equivalent of a chop shop for baby parts, they are \noutraged. They are going: Why are my tax dollars going to this \norganization?\n  This isn't about women's health. There are lots of options for the \nhealth issues that women do need that don't have to be funded by an \norganization that is doing these practices.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  The House will continue its work on the investigations that are \nneeded here, and we will continue on our work, seeing to it that tax \ndollars can be pulled back from supporting such an organization with \nsuch barbaric practices and with such a callous attitude as they \ndiscuss them over a glass of wine, on camera, at lunch. Indeed, this is \nour time in Congress, through this investigative process, to stand up \nfor life, for what is right, for what is moral, and we dare not shirk \nfrom that responsibility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5856-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5856-H5857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PILLOW FIGHT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, like slumber parties and sleepovers, a \npillow fight doesn't sound like the type of activity that would leave \n30 of our Nation's most promising future military leaders injured or \ncall into question the management practices of the Army's top academy. \nYet, that is exactly what happened.\n  We just learned that, on August 20, West Point freshman cadets got \ntogether for an annual pillow fight, and according to press accounts, \nthey swung pillowcases packed with large, hard objects, thought to be \nhelmets. This fight badly injured 30 cadets, 24 of them diagnosed with \nconcussions. There were shoulders dislocated, one cadet diagnosed with \na hairline fracture of the cheekbone, some with broken noses and split \nlips. Before the fight, upperclassmen commanders reportedly encouraged \nthe freshmen by telling them, ``If you don't come back with a bloody \nnose, you didn't try hard enough.''\n  The American people deserve to know what happened here. West Point \nand the Army have provided conflicting explanations, saying in one \ninstance, ``Many members of the plebe class spontaneously participated \nin a pillow fight,'' while, in another, they suggested that a pillow \nfight is a hallowed annual tradition, dating back to 1897. Well, which \nis it?\n  West Point, apparently, doesn't know how to run this pillow fight \neither.\n\n[[Page H5857]]\n\nThis rite of passage has a track record of similar injuries, followed \nby ineffective attempts to make this event safer. Two years ago, for \nexample, the 2013 pillow fight was canceled after at least one cadet \nplaced a lockbox as a weapon in a pillowcase. Now it is back, and \naccording to reports, the helmets the cadets were using to give their \nteammates concussions had been mandated as protection after injuries in \nprevious pillow fights.\n  May I remind everyone that this education is being paid for directly \nby the taxpayers of this country. The U.S. Government funds everything \nthe Academy does to the tune of millions of dollars a year. It is \nutterly irresponsible to think that a violent pillow fight is a way to \nbuild camaraderie and create a professional military.\n  West Point has stated that all cadets are back on duty and that it is \npursuing an investigation, but Congress needs to know what kind of \ninvestigation it is pursuing and when we will receive answers. As the \nranking member of the House Armed Services Committee's Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations, I am calling on the Army and the U.S. \nMilitary Academy to provide a clear explanation of the incident and its \ncauses, as well as a full accounting of who was responsible and what \nmeasures are being taken to prevent something like this from happening \nagain.\n  We will not create the world's most feared fighting force by hosting \na concussion-filled slumber party. We must ensure that the august \ninstitution lives up to the exceptionally high standards that it \nrepresents and that our future military leaders live up to the great \nresponsibility that rests on their shoulders. We can and we must do \nbetter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5857-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         HONORING THE LIFE OF TUSKEGEE AIRMAN JOHN WATSON, JR.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Matsui) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nheroism of Airman 1st Class Spencer Stone, Army National Guardsman Alek \nSkarlatos, and college student Anthony Sadler.\n  These three courageous young Americans drew the attention of the \nworld on August 21 when they bravely took action to prevent a terrorist \nattack that could have taken the lives of dozens, if not hundreds, of \ninnocent people on a passenger train in France. By now, most of the \ncountry and the world have heard about the heroic actions of these \nyoung men.\n  Spencer, Alek, and Anthony were on a train from Amsterdam to Paris as \npart of a European vacation. A terrorist, intending to murder \npassengers, boarded their train. When the attacker, armed with at least \ntwo firearms, including an assault rifle with hundreds of rounds of \nammunition, entered the train car, the three young Americans, without \nhesitation, responded.\n  Witnesses say that Alek prompted action by yelling, ``Go get 'em.'' \nSpencer charged and tackled the gunman, with Alek and Anthony close \nbehind. The three men, with the help of another passenger, tackled, \nsubdued, and disarmed the attacker before anyone else was seriously \ninjured. The attacker managed to wound Spencer with a box cutter during \nthe struggle. Despite his injuries, Spencer used his Air Force medic \ntraining to treat the wound of another passenger, likely saving his \nlife.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud that all three of these heroes are from \nthe Sacramento region. They met at a local middle school and have \nmaintained a close friendship ever since. Their friendship and loyalty \nto each other is part of what makes Sacramento and this Nation great.\n  Spencer grew up in Carmichael, which is just outside of Sacramento--a \nsuburb, in fact--and attended Del Campo High School. He currently \nserves as a U.S. Air Force medic.\n  Alek is also from Carmichael and had moved to Oregon. He serves in \nthe Oregon National Guard and had just finished a 9-month deployment in \nAfghanistan.\n  Anthony is studying kinesiology at California State University, \nSacramento. He grew up in Sacramento. His father is a pastor at Shiloh \nBaptist Church, a historical church in our community, and he has been a \nfriend of the Matsui family for many, many years. As he related to me, \nhe always told Anthony to always watch each other's back. That is what \nfriends do.\n  Mr. Speaker, Spencer's, Alek's, and Anthony's actions were nothing \nshort of extraordinary. These young men, who call themselves just \nregular guys, have given all Americans a reason to celebrate. They have \nbeen awarded the French Legion of Honour. My city of Sacramento, which \nis also the State capital, will be throwing them a parade on Friday--\nsignificantly, on 9/11--and I am sure more accolades will follow.\n  However, more important than any accolade is that they have reminded \nus about the importance of service, sacrifice, and selflessness. All \nthree men deserve commendation for the manner in which they have \nrepresented our Nation and have put themselves in harm's way to save \nthe lives of others.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask all of my colleagues to join me in recognizing \nSpencer Stone, Alek Skarlatos, and Anthony Sadler as we honor their \nbravery.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5857-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5857-H5858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           A NUCLEAR-ARMED IRAN IS A THREAT TO EVERY COUNTRY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, there is no higher \npriority for this government than of guaranteeing the safety and \nsecurity of the American people. Allowing Iran--the chief sponsor of \nglobal terror--to obtain nuclear capabilities, which Iran is guaranteed \nto have through this deal, means freedom everywhere is threatened. A \nnuclear-armed Iran is a threat to every country everywhere.\n  Mr. Speaker, any deal must be verifiable, enforceable, and \naccountable, and there is nothing verifiable about this deal.\n  The secret deals between Iran and the U.N. mean Iranians get to \ncertify whether they are complying, and Iran actually provides the \ntesting samples to the U.N. for testing. If the U.S. demands the right \nto inspect facilities, Iran can delay for more than 3 weeks. Our \n``anytime, anywhere'' threshold demand has been watered down during \nnegotiations to what Iran calls ``managed access.''\n  It is not an enforceable deal. Sanctions will have been lifted, and \nit is the sanctions that have forced them to the bargaining table in \nthe first instance. Once lifted, Iran will have billions to complete \ntheir nuclear program and expand their funding of terror. Even if we \ncan prove a violation, a slow bureaucratic process gives them time to \ndelay, deceive, and deter effective enforcement. There are no snapback \nprovisions here, Mr. Speaker, and it is not an accountable deal.\n\n[[Page H5858]]\n\n  Iran is permitted to keep thousands of nuclear centrifuges to enrich \nuranium. As for the $150 billion in unfrozen assets, does anyone think \nthat Iran is going to use that to build schools or hospitals or to \nteach tolerance of other faiths? Instead, how about using it to wipe \nIsrael off the map? How about the chants of ``death to America''? Why \nare we paving the path to weapons that can accomplish these atrocities?\n  Why should we trust Iran? What is it about their history of deceit, \ndestruction, and killings that warrants our bestowing trust that they \nwill be peaceful?\n  Here is a question for those who say this is a good deal: How many \npeople can Iran kill with this money for this to remain a good deal? \nWhat is the under-over death toll threshold for this deal to no longer \nbe a good deal?\n  I ask these questions because, very simply, this money is going to be \nused to kill people, and this deal provides the funding for it.\n  Millions of Americans, throughout the history of this country, have \nfought and died. Families have sacrificed in the name of freedom. \nGenerations of Americans have brought about American strength and \nexceptionalism, and this has engendered a belief in our allies that we \nwill have their backs, and it has kept many of our enemies in check \ngiven our military capability. This strength has always been at the \nvery core of our leverage when dealing with other countries.\n  As for negotiating, the administration simply says we have negotiated \nthe best deal we can, and we are supposed to, as Congress, accept that \nat face value with zero input.\n  Here is a little bit of recent history. We were assured by this \nadministration that al Qaeda had been broken, but it hasn't. Our \nstrategy in Yemen was called a model for combating terrorism, but, at \nthis point, it looks very much like an Iran proxy state. ISIS was \nmocked as a JV team, and now they are murdering thousands. Our \nrelationship with Russia was supposed to be reset, but I don't think \nanyone let Vladimir Putin know that as he invades sovereign countries \nand faces no consequences.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  How about the bright red line in Syria that said we won't allow Assad \nto kill his own people with chemical weapons? This administration \ndecided to ignore that, and we now have a Syrian refugee crisis.\n  This is the recent backdrop from which our leverage, our American \nstrength and exceptionalism, earned through the blood, sweat, and tears \nof generations of Americans, has been brokered by this administration \nin this deal.\n  The U.N. voting on this deal before the United States Congress and \nthe United States Senate, the minority of which is actually considering \nfilibustering a vote on this deal, is an outrage, Mr. Speaker.\n  What does a good deal consist of? Real simple: A complete dismantling \nof their entire nuclear program. Once we have a demonstrated proof of \nthat, then sanctions get lifted. No nonnuclear concessions.\n  Any other outcome is not acceptable. Let's use our leverage to the \nmaximum. We fought for it. Let's be strong and let's be proud of our \nstrength and let's use it to our advantage.\n  Diplomacy isn't compromising to the preferred position of a terrorist \ncountry. Diplomacy must always begin and end with protecting American \nsecurity.\n  This is not about politics, and it is not just about America. A \nnuclear Iran is a global threat to everyone everywhere. All Iranian \nterror must be stopped. We need to reject this deal and go back to the \nnegotiating table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5858-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    MAKE IT IN AMERICA FIELD HEARING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, yesterday Congresswoman DeLauro and I held a \nMake It In America field hearing in Connecticut.\n  We heard from manufacturers from across the State, including leaders \nfrom Click Bond in Watertown, Connecticut, who are committed to growing \ntheir businesses right here in the United States. But they need our \nsupport.\n  Congress needs to be a more effective partner for American \nmanufacturing. We must continue to foster an innovation economy that \ncreates manufacturing careers, not jobs, but careers that are at the \nheart of the middle class.\n  We must reauthorize the Export-Import Bank, a critical financial tool \nfor our companies to remain competitive in the global marketplace.\n  We must work together to create a predictable Tax Code that \nencourages companies to return to the United States and levels the \nplaying field for our small businesses, particularly our family-owned \ncompanies.\n  We must inspire our students in science, technology, engineering, and \nmath so that the United States remains the leader in global innovation \nfor generations to come. By engaging our students in the STEM fields, \nwe can prepare them to be the scientists, entrepreneurs, and innovators \nof the future.\n  These students could become NASA astronauts like Waterbury's own Rick \nMastracchio, who circled the planet on the International Space Station, \nor machinists or Teamsters, who assemble the aircraft that our military \nflies proudly all around the world, or computer programmers, who make \nour world more accessible and connected. Many of my colleagues share my \npassion for STEM education and bolstering our skilled workforce.\n  With Minority Whip Steny Hoyer's leadership, Congress has advanced \nthe Make It In America agenda and passed important legislation to cut \ntaxes, provide small business loans, train skilled workers, and support \nAmerican manufacturing.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who are dedicated to creating and growing American jobs.\n  By rising above partisan politics and focusing on commonsense \npractical policies, our bipartisan efforts can stimulate real economic \ngrowth. We should seize the opportunity to work together to support \nhigh-paying careers in American manufacturing.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5858-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5858-H5859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       WASHINGTON STATE WILDFIRES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Byrne). The Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Mr. Speaker, for the second year in a row, my home \nState of Washington and my Fourth Congressional District are facing the \nworst wildfires in the State's recorded history.\n  One year ago the Carlton Complex fire broke out in Okanogan County. \nAt the time, it was the most destructive in our State's history, \nburning over 250,000 acres, destroying hundreds of homes and \nbusinesses, and devastating the environment.\n  Now the people of Washington are once again enduring another \ncatastrophic wildfire season, far surpassing the scale of the \ndevastation experienced last year.\n  To put it in perspective, the amount of land burning in my home State \nis equivalent to the State of Rhode Island. Many of these fires \ncontinue to burn, even as Federal, State, and local agencies and \nofficials work tirelessly to contain them.\n  Communities across my State are mourning the tragic loss of three \nfirefighters who fell in the line of duty on August 19 while battling \nthe Twisp fire in Okanogan County. We remember and mourn the loss of \nthese brave young men: Andrew Zajac, Richard Wheeler, and Tom \nBeshevsky.\n  Our prayers are with their families and their loved ones. The current \nsituation in Washington is dire, and the heartbreaking loss of life is \na sober reminder of the dangerous conditions facing many residents.\n  Already roughly 1 million acres have burned, along with countless \nhomes and businesses and agricultural operations, forcing thousands of \nresidents to evacuate their homes as the threat continues.\n  While the Governor has declared a state of emergency and the \nPresident approved a Federal emergency declaration, the threat remains \nfor residents of central and eastern Washington, and more resources are \nnecessary.\n  For the first time in history, the Forest Service has spent more than \nhalf\n\n[[Page H5859]]\n\nits budget on wildfire suppression and across the country over 8 \nmillion acres have already burned just this year.\n  The Forest Service reported last week that it has begun the practice \nknown as fire borrowing, which is transferring funds to supplement its \ndiminishing firefighting budget.\n  This practice of fire borrowing leads into a vicious cycle where \nfunding is not available for critical fire mitigation efforts, such as \nthinning dense forests, rehabilitating areas after wildfires, and \nensuring communities are more resilient and prepared for future fires.\n  This leads the next fire season to be worse than the last, a trend \nthat we are now experiencing in Washington, which is why it is more \nimportant than ever to pass legislation to fix this problem such as the \nWildfire Disaster Funding Act.\n  To protect our communities and battle the wildfires, firefighters \nfrom across the U.S., as well as Australia and New Zealand, have joined \nthe fight. We owe them our deepest gratitude and thanks.\n  Additionally, the thousands of first responders and volunteers and \nNational Guard servicemembers who have worked around the clock at great \npersonal risk to fight the blaze deserve recognition for their heroic \nand selfless efforts.\n  I have seen firsthand how our communities have pulled together to \nhelp one another during these trying times. Our communities in central \nand eastern Washington are resolute, resilient, and have come together \nto confront the many challenges facing them.\n  The outpouring of support and effort of volunteers from all over the \nState and country, who provide shelter to survivors, cook meals, and \nunload trucks of relief supplies, is a testament to the spirit and \ndetermination of Washingtonians and our neighbors.\n  However, help is needed still as the current fires have only worsened \nwhat was already a perilous situation, with more and more homes being \ndestroyed, families being displaced, and severe economic hardship \nexpected in the aftermath.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must remember the losses caused by catastrophic \nwildfires of the last 2 years, and Congress must continue to push to \nimprove forest health and to ensure that this does not happen again.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5859-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AMERICAN HEROES OF FRENCH TRAIN ATTACK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Anthony Sadler, Spencer Stone, and Alek \nSkarlatos were the three brave Americans who stopped this attack.\n  Anthony Sadler is a native of Pittsburg, California, which, happily, \nis in my congressional district. These courageous men charged the \nattacker, who was armed with an AK-47 and dozens of rounds of \nammunition, enough to kill everyone on that train.\n  Thanks to Anthony and his friends, no one was killed and injuries \nwere minimized. Each were awarded France's highest civilian honor, the \nLegion d'Honneur.\n  As we reflect on 9/11, 14 years ago this week, the heroic efforts of \nthese young men underscore our Nation's resolve to confront violent \nextremism.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in 48 hours, the House will vote on a \nresolution to stop the Iran nuclear treaty.\n  Now, I know the President chooses not to call it a treaty, but it is \na treaty in everything but name, with international ramifications as \ngreat as any treaty Congress has ever considered.\n  Because treaties have a profound implication to the life of this \nNation, the Constitution requires they be ratified by a two-thirds vote \nof the Senate. Yet, in this post-constitutional era of Obama's America, \nit now require two-thirds of both Houses to reject them.\n  Every Republican in both Houses has taken a stand against this \ntreaty. So rejection or ratification now rests solely on whether enough \nDemocrats are willing to place country ahead of party on a matter of \nthe gravest consequence to world peace.\n  I don't think anyone can dispute the immediate effects of this \ntreaty: $150 billion in frozen assets will be released to a regime \nwhose leaders daily reiterate their intention to wage war on Israel and \nthe United States. These funds will be available to finance Iran's \nmilitary and terrorist activities and to fund its nuclear ambitions.\n  Although the agreement purports to halt production of fissile \nmaterial, it gives Iran the legal right to continue its research and \ndevelopment of advanced centrifuges, the only purpose of which is to \nproduce nuclear weapons.\n  It gives them legal access to traffic in conventional arms in just 5 \nyears and ICBM technology in 8 years, something that Obama's own \nchairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff said should be done ``under no \ncircumstances'' just a week before the treaty was announced.\n  Does anyone deny that the nation most immediately imperiled by a \nnuclear Iran--our ally, Israel--is united in its opposition to this \ntreaty? Israeli political parties are among the most fractured and \ndisputatious in the world. Yet, they stand united on this issue.\n  Does anyone deny that the Iranian regime is notorious for not \nhonoring its treaty obligations? Indeed, Iran signed a nuclear \nnonproliferation treaty and has violated it ever since, which is why we \nare now debating this treaty.\n  Verification therefore must be the central focus of any treaty with \nthis regime. Yet, under its very terms, spot inspections can be delayed \nfor weeks or even months if the regime objects.\n  More recently, we have learned that, under secret side agreements the \nadministration had no intention of sharing, inspections of the most \nimportant nuclear sites are to be conducted by the Iranians themselves. \nThis provision alone guarantees that history will ridicule this treaty \nas the pinnacle of naivety.\n  So I ask my Democratic colleagues, why? Why would anyone who values \npeace support this treaty? The answer I hear is that it reduces the \nchance of war in the next few years or, in Neville Chamberlain's words, \nit guarantees ``peace in our time.''\n  Does anyone really believe this? This treaty gives Israel the \nHobson's choice of launching a preemptive strike or ramping up its own \nnuclear program.\n  The Saudis and Egyptians have already made clear this agreement gives \nthem no alternative other than to initiate their own nuclear programs. \nIt catastrophically undermines the Iranian democratic opposition at \njust the time the regime was faltering from within.\n  Ironically, Mr. Obama tacitly concedes the destabilizing effect of \nthis treaty by following it up with pledges to vastly increase military \naid to Israel, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia.

The constitutional concerns are huge. This sets a dangerous \nprecedent that essentially rescinds the treaty clause of the \nConstitution, a precedent they might live to regret under Republican \nadministrations.\n  A far more immediate danger is the chain of events this treaty would \nset off in the Middle East and quickly spread throughout the world. \nThis treaty bolsters the Iranian regime from within. It infuses it with \n$150 billion with which to finance its nuclear ambitions. It gives it \nthe legal right and guaranteed timetable to pursue nuclear war and \ncannot be verified through inspections.\n  Iran has made crystal clear its intent to destroy Israel and the \nUnited States, a threat reiterated yesterday in no uncertain terms by \nits Supreme Leader.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are running out of time to avert a catastrophe.\n\n[[Page H5860]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5860-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                 SOCIAL SECURITY DISABILITY TRUST FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Reed) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. REED. Mr. Speaker, there are a lot of important issues before the \nHouse this week, but I wanted to take an opportunity to raise an issue \nthat we have been working on in our office for quite some time.\n  We, as a body, Mr. Speaker, will be faced with an opportunity, \nhopefully, to resolve this issue here shortly in the next few months, \nand that is the issue of the Social Security disability insurance trust \nfund.\n  Not a lot of people are aware--and I just read the Social Security \ntrustees report over the summer--that the disability trust fund goes \ninsolvent in 2016. That means millions of Americans who rely on Social \nSecurity disability benefits are looking at a situation where their \nbenefits are going to be cut 20 percent because of the insolvency of \nthe Social Security trust fund--2016, Mr. Speaker, that is right around \nthe corner.\n  When I raised this issue 2 years ago with the White House, with Jack \nLew--our Treasury Secretary--in our Committee on Ways and Means \nhearing, I asked him 2 years ago: What is the plan? What is the \nsolution to this problem?\n  What I was ultimately told was this is what we are going to do: we \nare just going to take money from the Social Security retirement fund \nand move it over to the disability trust fund and bail it out.\n  Well, in my private life in business, I knew a lot of businessowners, \nand what that essentially was, it is robbing Peter to pay Paul because \nthe Social Security retirement fund is on a path to insolvency just a \nfew short years down the road.\n  I said we could do better. That is why I was glad to join with my \ncolleague, Sam Johnson, who chairs the Subcommittee on Social Security \nhere in Washington, to change the rules to make sure that that solution \nwould not be the one that we follow here in 2015 and 2016. We can do \nbetter.\n  You know why we can do better? It is because we care. We care about \nthe people that are in the disability trust fund, and we need to listen \nto those people. This is what their experience is with the disability \ntrust fund today. They are frustrated. It is a bureaucracy. It is a \nmess.\n  We have overpayments. We have fraudulent payments. We have a system \nthat penalizes people returning to work, rather than trying to \nincentivize them and stand with them when they return to work.\n  We had an individual by the name of Mike Zelly come before the \ncommittee and testify to us, and he is in the disability trust fund. He \nwas in a horrific automobile accident 36 years ago and has been in a \nwheelchair ever since.\n  These are the people we should listen to. These are the people that \nknow the disability trust fund the best. What his testimony to us was, \nhe says we should seize this opportunity to fix this problem, take care \nof the bureaucracy, make sure the overpayments don't occur because, \nwhen an overpayment occurs to a disability recipient, guess who has to \npay it back? It is the disability recipient because of the Social \nSecurity Administration's incompetence. That is not right. That is not \nfair.\n  Most importantly, what he talked about in his 36 years in the \ndisability trust fund is that, when he tried to return to work, he was \nfaced with obstacle after obstacle of a bureaucracy that said, if you \ndo that, you will lose your benefit. That is not right.\n  Mike Zelly offered ideas on how we can improve the system to \nstreamline this bureaucracy. This is the process someone in the Social \nSecurity disability trust fund has to go through in order to try to go \nback to work. We need to simplify it, and we need to stand with the \nAmerican work ethic for the people in the disability trust fund that \nwant to return to work.\n  There was a recent Brookings Institution report that came across my \ndesk that I read. There was 40 percent return on the beneficiaries in \nthe disability trust fund that indicated they would like to return to \nwork, but because of the bureaucracy, there was fear. There was a sense \nthat, if they did that, they would lose their benefit, and they just \ncouldn't risk it.\n  That is why we are offering commonsense reforms here out of our \noffice, out of the Committee on Ways and Means, out of this House, \nhopefully, shortly, so that what we can do is make sure that those \ndisability trust fund recipients don't look at a 20 percent cut in \n2016.\n  We will hold them harmless, and we will make sure we do what is \nnecessary in order to make sure that our obligations and promises under \nthe disability trust fund are met to those individuals because that is \nthe right thing to do.\n  We cannot lose this opportunity to modernize the Social Security \ndisability trust fund to make sure that we stand with those that want \nto return to work and believe in the American work ethic like we do.\n  I ask my colleagues to join with us on a bipartisan basis, and there \nhas been an indication of bipartisan work that we have been able to \nshow here in the initial conversations.\n  Let's modernize the disability trust fund; let's cure the waste, \nfraud, and abuse, but most importantly, let's stand with the \nindividuals like Mike Zelly who want to return to work because it gives \nhim dignity and it gives him a sense that he is contributing rather \nthan being in any way a burden on the system.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5860-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The President has been \ninaccurate in describing his dangerous nuclear deal.\n  Sadly, we read tragic stories of men, women, and children fleeing \ntheir homes in Syria. They are escaping a murderous government, the \nsame government propped up by the Iranian regime.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to oppose the nuclear deal that \nthe President and Secretary of State Kerry negotiated with Iran. Since \nthe announcement of the deal on July 14, the world has learned piece by \npiece just how bad it is.\n  Earlier this year, I spoke on the House floor on the elements that \nwould be needed in order to consider an agreement with Iran.\n  One such element was the requirement of anytime, anywhere \ninspections, which would give inspectors 24-hour access to any site \ninside Iran; yet, according to Hillel Fradkin, an expert at the Hudson \nInstitute, Iran could get as many as 63 days--possibly more--before \ninspections. This gives Iran time to hide and destroy any potential \nevidence of nuclear weapons research.\n  Additionally, this deal lifts economic sanctions too quickly and \ngives Iran access to $150 billion in sanctions relief. Iran is a top \nexporter and supporter of terrorism. We should not be making it easier \nfor them to fund groups like Hezbollah and dictators like those in \nSyria, nor should we make it easier for Iran to procure conventional \narms and missiles that have the capability of reaching American soil.\n  Despite our negotiators' assurances that the conventional arms \nembargo would not be lifted, this is precisely what will happen with \nthe UN arms embargo ending in just 5 years. The President is rewarding \nIran with money, access to weaponry, and a 10-year pause on their \nnuclear weapons research--and that is if the Iranians don't cheat.\n  Empowering Iran to fund terrorists and bully its neighbors is not \nwhat I call a good agreement for the United States or allies Israel and \nSaudi Arabia. Congress must end this deal and impose stronger \nsanctions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5862-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                            LAS VEGAS NIGHT\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS.

Mr. Speaker, every day, cutting-edge medical innovation \nis making it possible for patients to live healthy, active lives. One \nof the best examples of this is lower limb prosthetics.\n  Losing a limb is a traumatic and life-altering experience, but the \ncontinued advancement and development of prosthetics has made it \npossible for many of these patients to continue to have significant \namounts of functionality, along with ensuring they won't be confined to \nwheelchairs.\n  However, proposed changes to Medicare rules threaten access to \nimportant medical innovation and medical technology. Recently, a number \nof patients and advocacy groups came to Washington to share what the \nproposed rule changes would mean to them. One patient from Minnesota \nnoted that the proposed rule would turn back the clock and force her to \nuse a prosthetic that she claimed would be the car equivalent of a \n1970s Vega.\n  Mr. Speaker, I share the apprehension that these patients have, and I \nencourage CMS, the agency in charge of administering Medicare, to chart \na different course when it comes to administering lower limb \nprosthetics.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5862-5", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   GOP ATTACKS AGAINST A NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Mr. DOGGETT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Republican self-styled experts like Sarah \nPalin, Glenn Beck, and Donald Trump condemning an agreement to decrease \nthe nuclear threat is hardly new.\n  One Republican Presidential candidate blasted a ``nuclear Munich.''\n  The National Review denounced a ``suicide pact.''\n  The Conservative Caucus founder derided our President as a ``useful \nidiot'' and a ``weak man.''\n  Old George Will lamented the ``cult of arms control.''\n  Sharp words for a President who is negotiating a nuclear agreement \nwith an untrustworthy, terrorist-promoting regime that is bent on \ndestroying America.\n  Yet these shrill Republican attacks were not against President Obama, \nrather they were against President Ronald Reagan for agreeing with the \nSoviets to limit nuclear missiles. What the bomb-first, rejectionist \ncrowd lacks in understanding and creativity they make up for here today \nin fatal consistency.

The deal is before us, and now it has none \nof them.\n  There are no anytime, anywhere inspections. Iran gets to maintain key \nnuclear infrastructure. The most important restrictions begin to expire \nin as few as 10 years. On top of that, Iran will receive $100 billion \nin sanctions relief almost immediately.\n  This agreement is a dangerous gamble for the United States and our \nallies, especially for Israel. Our security is on the line, and the \ndeck is stacked in favor of a sworn adversary. I will be voting to \nreject this disastrous deal, and I call on my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5863-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      DEFEAT THE IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  (Mr. WENSTRUP asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, the details found within the nuclear Iran \ndeal are stunning.\n  The original pledge of anywhere, anytime inspections gave way to a \n24-day lead time for Iranians to hide their activities from inspectors.\n  We now know that Iran has entered into two secret deals with the IAEA \nand that the details are not available to the duly elected Members of \nthis body.\n  We were told that no deal is better than a bad deal. Yet here we are \nwith a very bad deal.\n  The alternative to this deal is not war, as this administration is \nfear-mongering, but through strengthened sanctions to continue \ninternational pressure on the largest state sponsor of terrorism. \nWithout war, we can pursue a nuclear-free Iran through diplomacy by \nengaging with our allies and with peace-loving nations and with the \ndeterrent of military might and effective economic sanctions.\n  ``Do I trust Iran?'' I am asked. Based on the last four decades and \non its recent behavior, I only trust them to cheat.\n  Congress and the American people must defeat this deal in the \ninterest of regional stability and our own national security and for \nthe prospect of peace for future generations of Americans and our \nallies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5863-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5863]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 IN REMEMBRANCE OF TWO INDIANA LEADERS\n\n  (Mr. STUTZMAN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. STUTZMAN.

Jac, a member of the United States Army, \na LaGrange County commissioner and business leader, loved his country, \nState, and community very much.

He will be missed by many, and I \nrise today to honor Jac's service to our State.\n  Indiana also lost Garrett Mayor Tonya Hoeffel on Sunday as well. \nTonya passed away at the age of 52, living a life dedicated to DeKalb \nCounty and the city of Garrett, Indiana. Her heart for serving her \ncommunity represented true Hoosier values and is an example for all of \nus to follow. Her contagious smile will be forever missed.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of \nthe Ridgway Rifle Club, which has been called the ``Silhouette Capital \nof the United States.''\n  This type of target practice involves shooting at steel targets at \nvarying distances. While silhouette shooting has been around for 100 \nyears, the Ridgway Rifle Club has the distinction of being the first \nclub east of the Mississippi River to open this type of a shooting \nrange, in the 1970s.\n  The range has grown over the past 40 years to include silhouettes of \nall shapes and sizes. One of its most recent creations, the Varmint \nBench Rest Silhouette, includes small targets that are placed 1,000 \nyards from the shooter.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Ridgway Rifle Club's silhouette range is very \npopular, with more than 100 people attending matches each month. The \nrange has even attracted national attention, and it was recently \nfeatured on the television program ``Shooting USA.''\n  I wish the club continued success in nurturing a love of target \nshooting, shooting sports, and its support of the Second Amendment in \nour communities and for future generations.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5863-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5863-H5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA ST.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.J. \nRes. 64, Disapproving of the agreement transmitted to Congress by the \nPresident on July 19, 2015, relating to the nuclear program of Iran.\n  First, I would like to commend all of the individuals from the Obama \nadministration and their counterparts across the globe for their \ntireless work in this agreement.\n  Since the Iranian Revolution in 1979, this is as close as our country \nand the international community have come to signing a peace agreement. \nThat progress did not come without significant sacrifice of personal \nand professional time. Unfortunately, Mr. Speaker, I cannot support the \nJoint Comprehensive Plan of Action. While I commend all those involved \nand recognize the importance of a comprehensive nuclear agreement, I do \nnot believe in what we are getting.\n  Over the past 30 years, the international community has been \nsubjected to Iranian threats and bully behaviors. The international \ncommunity has also had to tolerate Iran's constant threats to destroy \nour Nation and the State of Israel, our staunch ally. For too long, the \ncommunity of nations has dealt with Iran's funding of terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East and the world.\n  I am unable to support a deal that would allow the Iranian regime to \ncontinue to perpetrate these actions without repercussions. It is \nimportant to mention that these are not just my beliefs.\n  Since the announcement in July, my office has received hundreds of \ncontacts from constituents opposing the Iran agreement.\n  In the month of August, I held town halls, hosted meetings and \nconducted constituent visits.\n  The majority of those interactions affirmed the people in our \ndistrict do not trust Iran.\n  The State of Israel should not have to worry about more threats and \npotentially expanded attacks funded by Iranian petro-dollars.\n  The United States shouldn't have to provide relief to a regime that \ncontinues to call for our destruction and those of our allies.\n  I believe the delay and dismantlement of Iran's nuclear program is a \nlaudable goal, perhaps one of the most important in the world.\n  I also believe that we should work to alleviate the pressures and \nfoster the goals of the Iranian people.\n  The young people in Iran are being held accountable for the actions \nof an autocratic, religiously-motivated panel of leaders.\n  However, we cannot ignore 30 years of unrelenting threats and \ncondemnable behavior for a decade or less of nuclear concessions.\n  In Texas, perception is often reality and if you are perceived as a \nbully, then you'll be treated as one.\n  We spent too many years bringing Iran to the table through sanctions \nand diplomatic pressures.\n  We cannot easily forget the history between the two countries but we \ncan hopefully work toward a better situation.\n  As long as our friends and allies in the Middle East and around the \nworld feel the threat of Iranian influence, our job as the United \nStates is to hold the regime accountable in every way possible.\n  It is my hope we work together to block this deal and use its \nframework to get a better deal.\n  I urge my colleagues to oppose H.J. Res. 64 and I yield back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/09/house-section/article/H5864-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5864]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. SESSIONS.
