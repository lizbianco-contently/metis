The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Costello) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. \n515, and I commend Congressman Smith for his continued leadership \nefforts to combat human trafficking. It is an issue many of us take \nvery, very seriously.\n  This Congress, the House has passed several commonsense, bipartisan \npieces of legislation to end human trafficking, and we remain dedicated \nto finding solutions to prevent this criminal activity, to protect \nvictims, and to prosecute those individuals who seek to exploit \ninnocent children.\n  One year ago today, I spoke on this critical piece of legislation \nwhen it first came to the House floor. I am glad the Senate has finally \nconsidered it, and I am proud to be standing here again today as this \nlegislation will finally make its way to the President's desk for his \nsignature following the legislation's passage here in the House.\n  Mr. Speaker, human trafficking is not a distant concept. It exists in \ncommunities across America. An estimated 300,000 young Americans are in \ndanger of becoming victims of sex trafficking. The average age, believe \nit or not, is 12 to 14 years old for girls. Last year alone, my home \nState of Pennsylvania had a total of 106 reported cases of human \ntrafficking and 514 calls of human trafficking violations. In fact, \nPennsylvania has stepped up the fight by enacting stricter human \ntrafficking laws, and it was named one of the top five ``most \nimproved'' States by the Polaris Project.\n  The legislation we have passed here in the House is another step in \nthe right direction. We have made progress, but there is more that we \ncan and must do. I look forward to working with my colleagues to \ncontinue the fight against human trafficking.\n\n\n                            Barclay Grounds\n\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I also rise to highlight \nthe success of a local land preservation effort in West Chester \nBorough, Chester County, Pennsylvania.\n  The Barclay Grounds, located in West Chester Borough, is a beautiful \nproperty. The land has a rich history dating back to William Penn's \ncharter from the King. Over the years, it has served as an orchard and \nhas been utilized for agricultural purposes as well as for passive \nrecreation activities. For over 2 years, local officials and grassroots \nvolunteers have worked on a common mission: to preserve the Barclay \nGrounds for future generations.\n  I can recall, when I was a county commissioner, when a gentleman by \nthe name of John Cottage, who founded the Barclay Grounds Preservation \nAlliance, came in to see us, and I and my then-colleagues on the Board \nof County Commissioners, Terence Farrell and Kathi Cozzone, decided \nthat this was a worthwhile endeavor. We provided the seed funding, if \nyou will, to help kick-start the grant application process for several \nfunding streams to make sure that we would be able to preserve the \nBarclay Grounds.\n  I am pleased to stand before this country today and say that a group \nof local officials and local volunteers did something great in a local \ncommunity that is going to preserve for future generations a really \nhistoric, cultural, and environmental gem.\n  I commend the dedicated officials in the West Chester community, \nincluding the West Chester Borough Council, a lot of people involved in \nthe preservation movement, including the grant writing teams at the \nNatural Lands Trust, as well as the Brandywine Conservancy and many \nothers, for their efforts to preserve this passive park.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H435-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Hardy).

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Flonnie Anderson of \nWinston-Salem, North Carolina. This remarkable and talented woman has \nspent her life accomplishing things ahead of her time, from majoring in \ntheater during the 1940s to helping desegregate a community, to \nstarting her own theater group.\n  As a teacher at Parkland High School in 1970, Mrs. Anderson directed \na play that starred both African American and Caucasian students, a \nfirst in the history of Forsyth County schools. As a director, she also \nhelped integrate the theater department at Wake Forest University.\n  She was the first African American actress to perform with the Little \nTheatre of Winston-Salem. From that point on, the Little Theatre became \nknown as a place where the African American community could be treated \nequally.\n  In recognition of her 34 years as an educator, Parkland High School \nin Winston-Salem has named their auditorium for Mrs. Anderson. This \nhonor is well deserved and pays tribute to her lasting impact in the \nlocal community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H436-5", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HUMANITARIAN CRISIS IN MADAYA, SYRIAN\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in order \nto bring attention to the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Madaya, Syria.\n  The inhabitants of Madaya are unable to leave and are threatened \ndaily by regime snipers and antipersonnel mines that surround their \ncity. Over 40,000 civilians have been kept from receiving vital \nhumanitarian aid. And, yes, this has resulted in mass starvation.\n  Sadly, Madaya is not unique in its suffering. There are Madayas all \nover Syria--cities under siege--caught in the middle of this vicious \nfighting, cities with inhabitants in dire need of food, water, and \nmedical attention.\n  I urge Congress, the President, and the international community to do \nmore in response to the humanitarian crisis that is going on in Syria. \nEnough is enough. We have to stop these tragedies from happening. It is \nour collective responsibility to do everything in our power; so let's \ndo it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H436-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                IRANIAN NUCLEAR DEAL SUPPORTS TERRORISM\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, the fantasy Iranian \nnuclear deal went into effect on January 16, giving the Iranian regime \nbillions of dollars to support terrorism, expand its ballistic missile \nprogram, and threaten American families with attacks.\n  Just 2 weeks ago Secretary of State John Kerry admitted that some of \nthe funds would go to terrorist groups. What is worse, the Secretary \nbelieves there is no way to prevent the funds from supporting terrorist \nactivity to kill American families. We must and should be clear that \nthe United States has zero tolerance for terrorism or regimes that \nsupport terrorism.\n  I am grateful to cosponsor the bipartisan Zero Tolerance for Terror \nAct. This critical legislation gives Congress the ability to act \nquickly and effectively when Iran violates the existing restrictions. \nWe should take every effort to protect American families and our \nPersian Gulf allies from an irrational regime that promotes ``death to \nAmerica, death to Israel.''\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H436-7", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GREENSBORO FOUR SIT-INS\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, yesterday marked the anniversary of the \nGreensboro Four sit-ins.\n  Fifty-six years ago four North Carolina A freshmen decided to \npeacefully challenge racial segregation in my hometown of Greensboro \nand the community I'm proud to serve in Congress.\n  Joseph McNeil, Jibreel Khazan, Franklin McCain, and David Richmond \nsat at a whites-only lunch counter inside a Greensboro Woolworth store. \nThese young men sparked a wave of peaceful protests that spanned the \nState and Nation, helping to put an end to racial segregation.\n  I remember traveling through North Carolina as a young girl and going \nto the back door of restaurants because I couldn't sit inside. Because \nof the Greensboro Four, my children, my grandchildren, and future \ngenerations won't have to share in my experience.\n  My bipartisan resolution, H. Res. 128, honors these four courageous \nmen and recognizes their impact.

The injustice of human trafficking \nknows no political party or geographical boundary. It happens right in \nour backyards.\n  Yesterday the House took important steps in passing two bills to \nstrengthen our response to trafficking. I have also recently introduced \nH.R. 4406, the Enhancing Detection of Human Trafficking Act, \nlegislation which ensures the Department of Labor effectively trains \nits employees to recognize and respond to the illegal trade of people \nfor exploitation or commercial gain.\n  It will take close coordination from stakeholders at every level to \neradicate this unthinkable crime.

Schoolchildren, theater \nlovers, and Shakespeare enthusiasts alike will witness with their own \neyes the book that gave us Shakespeare.\n  During the month of February, the 10th District of Illinois is \nhosting the ``First Folio.''

Mr. Speaker, I rise today with good \nnews.

Now, I \nknow that I join many of my colleagues from across the Nation in a \nbipartisan fashion in hoping that this prediction comes true.\n  Groundhog Day means so much to Punxsutawney and the communities which \nsurround it.

Mr. Speaker, our economy has made solid gains \nsince 2009. We have added millions of jobs. Businesses are hiring. Our \neconomy is growing.\n  In the Second District, we are seeing signs of recovery through small \nbusiness growth and new startups like The New Look Restaurant and Bar \nowned by Nate and Cleo Pendleton.\n  But the fact remains that the American Dream still remains out of \nreach for far too many families. Today 8 million Americans are \nsearching for well-paying jobs 7 years after the end of the recession.\n  Each year at my annual jobs fair, I meet hundreds of these qualified \nAmericans who are tired of searching for good jobs. They are single \nmothers in night school. They are fathers working two part-time jobs to \nkeep a roof over their family's heads.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to commemorate 25 years of \nfaithful service carried out by members at Trinity Baptist Community \nChurch International in Crystal Lake, Illinois.\n  Founded in 1991 by Senior Pastor Bishop Dr. Michael J. Love, the \nchurch has been a light to the surrounding community and to people \naround the world, demonstrating in word and deed Christ's command to \nlove one's neighbor as oneself.\n  Through a myriad of initiatives, members have provided job skills \ntraining to struggling workers and relief to the impoverished.\n  Bishop Love's prison outreach ministry is well known to McHenry \nCounty and is a respected partner to the McHenry County Correctional \nFacility. Their diligence demonstrates the integral role faith plays in \nour local communities by bringing people together, united by common \nbeliefs to help each other.\n  Like the Good Samaritan, they understand that ``neighbor'' sometimes \nincludes those outside of their communities. That is why they have been \ninvolved with over 100 ministries across the globe, sharing the gospel \nand serving the people of Haiti, India, and the Dominican Republic, \namong others.\n  May God bless Trinity Baptist in its next 25 years of service.\n\n[[Page H438]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H438-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                 AFFORDABLE CARE ACT IS HELPING PEOPLE\n\n  (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. BASS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to support the Affordable Care \nAct and to urge this House to sustain President Obama's veto of the \nlegislation to repeal it.\n  During our last recess, I visited St. John's Well Child and Family \nCenter, an anchor in the south Los Angeles community that provides \nquality health care for the community regardless of the patient's \nability to pay.\n  The Affordable Care Act has enabled St. John's to expand and improve \nits facilities and increase its services, including updating and \nmodernizing its children's dental services. This is an example of the \ndental clinic.\n  Because California embraced the law, St. John's is now able to serve \nover 53,000 new patients. Repealing the law would be detrimental. As \nSt. John's Executive Director Jim Mangia told me: Repealing the \nAffordable Care Act would strip away health insurance from 26,000 of \nSt. John's patients. That is 26,000 patients from that one clinic \nalone.\n  Our primary goal in Congress should be helping people, not voting \naway their health insurance.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H438-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REMEMBERING DONALD ``BUDDY'' WRAY\n\n  (Mr. HILL asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HILL.

That is why today I am joining with my Republican \ncolleague, Congresswoman Barbara Comstock, to introduce the Secure Our \nSkies Act, a bipartisan bill that will give our airline employees the \ntools that they need to combat human trafficking and close off the \nairways to perpetrators of this heinous crime.\n  The Secure Our Skies, or SOS, Act ensures that all airlines develop \ntraining for their frontline employees on the best ways to recognize \nand report the often subtle signs of human trafficking. This \nlegislation builds on the work of the Blue Lightning campaign, a \nvoluntary program developed by the Departments of Homeland Security and \nTransportation with the assistance of the Association of Flight \nAttendants, who are real champions for this training.\n  Sadly, reported cases of human trafficking are growing here at home \nand around the globe. We all have to play a role in stopping human \ntrafficking, and this legislation will ensure our airline personnel can \nspot the signs and stop the crimes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H438-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             KEEP POUNDING\n\n  (Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina.

During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Rules Committee met and \nreported out a rule for H.R. 3700, the Housing Opportunity Through \nModernization Act of 2015. House Resolution 594 provides a structured \nrule for consideration of H.R. 3700.\n  The resolution provides 1 hour of debate equally divided between the \nchair and ranking minority member of the Committee on Financial \nServices. Additionally, the resolution provides for consideration of 14 \namendments offered to H.R. 3700. Finally, Mr. Speaker, the resolution \nprovides a motion to recommit for the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the resolution and the \nunderlying legislation. H.R. 3700 is a package of several bipartisan \nprovisions that have been voted on by the House Financial Services \nCommittee and received bipartisan support multiple times since 2006 in \nboth Republican and Democratic Congresses.\n  H.R. 3700 cuts down on inefficient and duplicative regulations. The \nbill employs a commonsense approach to mitigating the overlapping and \nredundant procedures that have made rental assistance programs \nunnecessarily burdensome for some tenants as well as private owners and \ninvestors in affordable housing.\n  The portions of H.R. 3700 that are particularly important to me and \nmany of the large metropolitan housing authorities around the country \ncreate positive changes based on project-based vouchers.\n  The Columbus Metropolitan Housing Authority, in my hometown, does a \nlot of vouchers. They have a strong record of converting slums into \nmixed-income neighborhoods. They help make sure that the needs of those \nwho live there come first and that we help build strong communities \naround them.\n  An integral part of this approach is often project-based vouchers \nthat can be provided to encourage the development of mixed-income \nhousing facilities. However, because the Columbus Metropolitan Housing \nAuthority is approaching its cap for project-based vouchers, as many \nmetropolitan housing authorities around the country are, their capacity \nto build new mixed-income communities that are thriving and strong is \nat risk.\n  This bill authorizes public housing authorities to project-base up to \n20 percent of its authorized voucher allocation rather than 20 percent \nof its voucher funding. This change ensures that the unauthorized \nnumber of vouchers is more stable. It will help make it easier for \nhousing authorities to plan their future investments in the communities \nthey serve.\n  Knowing Charles Hillman and the great people at the Columbus \nMetropolitan Housing Authority and the great work they do, I would sure \nhate to see them taken off the front lines in our war against poverty. \nWe need to make this change. It is just one example of something that \nis really good in this bill.\n  According to the Congressional Budget Office, this bill is projected \nto actually save $311 billion in discretionary spending over just the \nnext 5 years. The savings associated with the flexibilities and \nregulatory burden relief provided to local housing authorities will \nresult in substantial improvement in the return on investment for \ntaxpayers and help make sure that the affordable housing programs we \nhave are sustainable.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill passed the Financial Services Committee, which \nI serve on, with a vote of 44-10--a strong bipartisan vote.\n  It is my understanding that the sponsor of this legislation has \nworked over the past few weeks with the ranking member of the \ncommittee, Ms. Maxine Waters of California, to address an amendment \nthat she offered--which has been made in order under the rule--which \nwill alleviate the concerns of some Members about this legislation.\n  So, even though it only passed 44-10--which is pretty good--I think \nwe can actually see a bigger improvement when it hits the floor, \nbecause I think the sponsor has worked with the ranking member, Ms. \nMaxine Waters of California, to alleviate some of those concerns.\n  I look forward to debating this bill with our House colleagues, and I \nurge support for both the rule and the underlying legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I thank my friend, the gentleman from Ohio, for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss H.R. 3700, the Housing \nOpportunity\n\n[[Page H440]]\n\nThrough Modernization Act of 2015. This bill includes modifications and \nupdates to several existing laws pertaining to housing--and low-income \nhousing, in particular.\n  Many of these changes clarify and improve specific regulations for \nthe benefit of those providing low-income housing and those benefiting \nfrom the availability of low-income housing. In fact, this bill \nimproves access to affordable housing for the most vulnerable, such as \nlow-income families and veterans.\n  It is apparent that much work has been involved in finding a balance, \nand the authors and committee members of both parties are to be \ncommended for their efforts. With that being said, it is important to \nnote that a provision of this bill will effectively raise rents for \nthousands of families with children and, ultimately, make it more \ndifficult for some low-income parents to maintain employment.\n  The deduction provisions in this bill, as it is currently worded, \nraise rents for some of the lowest income families in the country. A \nquarter of households facing rent increases of $25 or more a month are \nfamilies with children whose childcare deduction would be reduced.\n  I hope that this important issue of childcare deductions will be \naddressed. My colleague from Ohio just spoke about the work that our \ncolleagues, the chair of this committee and the ranking member, have \ndone to perhaps cause this measure to go forward and not be derailed \nbecause of the measure of reducing the childcare deduction for \nfamilies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to quickly address the issue raised by the gentleman. I \nalluded to it, but I didn't speak to it maybe as clearly as I should \nhave.\n  I believe that there is an agreement between the chairman of the \nsubcommittee as well as the ranking member of the full committee on an \namendment that Ms. Waters is offering with regard to the provision that \nyou refer to. I will tell you, I am going to be voting for that \namendment, and I would urge you to vote for it. I believe it is going \nto pass. It may just be a voice vote. If you are here, vote on it by \nvoice.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is an example, in my view, of what can happen here when parties \nwork together. Obviously, on this issue, the Financial Services \nCommittee has done a tremendous job.\n  If we defeat the previous question, I am going to pivot for a moment \nand offer an amendment to the rule to bring up a bill to help prevent \nmass shootings by promoting research into the causes of gun violence, \nmaking it easier to identify and treat those prone to committing these \nacts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous materials, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, this morning at 9, I held a gun violence \nroundtable. We had extraordinary presenters from those who are \ngathering information and disseminating that information around the \ncountry to address this subject.\n  What the Gun Violence Research Act would do is give the Centers for \nDisease Control the authority to research the causes, mechanisms, \nprevention, diagnosis, and treatment of injuries with respect to gun \nviolence. It would also encourage the improvement and expansion of the \nNational Violent Death Reporting Systems and empower healthcare \nproviders by not inhibiting a physician or other healthcare provider \nfrom asking a patient about the possession of a firearm and speaking to \na patient about gun safety or reporting to authorities a patient's \nthreat of violence.\n  If there is anyone in the House of Representatives who does not \nbelieve that we have a gun violence epidemic in our society, then I \nwould ask him or her if they would speak with me and other Members of \nCongress that have been about the business of trying to cause there to \nbe a reduction.\n  This actually does fit into the circumstances that we are addressing \nin the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Many of the violent \nacts that take place--not just mass shootings, but on a day-to-day \nbasis--regrettably, take place in some of the low-income areas, where \nwe have inadequate housing, inadequate education, and inadequate \neducational opportunity.\n  I hope at least the research can be done that may give us the data \nfor this Congress to have the courage to tell the American people that, \nyes, we have a gun violence epidemic, and, yes, we are going to do \nsomething about it.\n  The bill underlying this rule would enact several incremental reforms \nto the Department of Housing and Urban Development's Section 8 tenant- \nand project-based rental assistance and other public housing programs. \nMany of these reforms have been around for several years and have, as \nmy colleague from Ohio (Mr. Stivers) has pointed out, broad support \nfrom a wide range of stakeholders as well as both parties in Congress.\n  However, returning again to the subject of the matter of deductions \nfor child care, it is an important issue that needs to be addressed. \nRepresentative Waters has an amendment that was made in order yesterday \nby the Rules Committee to resolve this issue. Like my colleague from \nOhio, I plan to vote for that amendment, and I would urge Members to \nrecognize that this makes a good bill better, and I would urge my \ncolleagues to support Ms. Waters' amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and defeat the previous question.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as my colleague from Florida said, this is a good bill. \nIt is a commonsense bill. It reforms our housing programs so they make \nsense for people. It makes them more efficient. It saves $300 billion. \nIt is a no-brainer.\n  I hope that we can pass the previous question so that we can actually \nmove to passing this bill and doing important reforms that will make \ngovernment more efficient and help people in the war against poverty.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the rule, support the previous \nquestion, and support the resolution.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n          An Amendment to H. Res. 594 Offered by Mr. Hastings\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3926) to amend the Public Health Service Act to provide for \n     better understanding of the epidemic of gun violence, and for \n     other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on Energy and Commerce. After general debate the \n     bill shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute \n     rule. All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3926.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To\n\n[[Page H441]]\n\n     defeat the previous question is to give the opposition a \n     chance to decide the subject before the House. Cannon cites \n     the Speaker's ruling of January 13, 1920, to the effect that \n     ``the refusal of the House to sustain the demand for the \n     previous question passes the control of the resolution to the \n     opposition'' in order to offer an amendment. On March 15, \n     1909, a member of the majority party offered a rule \n     resolution. The House defeated the previous question and a \n     member of the opposition rose to a parliamentary inquiry, \n     asking who was entitled to recognition. Speaker Joseph G. \n     Cannon (R-Illinois) said: ``The previous question having been \n     refused, the gentleman from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had \n     asked the gentleman to yield to him for an amendment, is \n     entitled to the first recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n  Mr. STIVERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this question will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H441-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H441-H450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1245\n  RESTORING AMERICANS' HEALTHCARE FREEDOM RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2015--\n          VETO MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the order of the House of \nJanuary 25, 2016, the unfinished business is the further consideration \nof the veto message of the President on the bill (H.R. 3762) to provide \nfor reconciliation pursuant to section 2002 of the concurrent \nresolution on the budget for fiscal year 2016.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on \nreconsideration, pass the bill, the objections of the President to the \ncontrary notwithstanding?\n  (For veto message, see proceedings of the House of January 8, 2016, \nat page H210.)\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Tom Price) \nis recognized for 1 hour.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate \nonly, I yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland \n(Mr. Van Hollen), pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and insert extraneous material on the veto message of the \nPresident of the United States to the bill, H.R. 3762.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. It is \nnot often that the House has the opportunity to so clearly fight to \ndefend the will of the people. This is a day that embraces our \nConstitution and one of its fundamental tenets, our system of checks \nand balances.\n  This issue, the issue of health care, is vital to every single \nAmerican. Health care is so very personal. The American people are \noffended by a Federal Government that says that they know best, that \nthey know and should dictate to folks what kind of health care we \nshould have, who should be treating us, where we should be treated, and \non and on and on.\n  The American people have always opposed the current law. From the \nvery day it was passed and was signed into law, a majority of the \ncitizens of this country opposed this law.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, more people oppose the law now than they did \nwhen the bill was passed. This is truly remarkable. More people oppose \nit now than did when it was passed, which is why we have worked and \nfought so very hard to represent them, to represent our constituents, \nand to carry out our solemn responsibility as their Representatives.\n  The House and the Senate voted to veto this destructive law, a law \nthat is not only destructive to the health and well-being of our \ncitizens, but destructive to the health of our economy, taking jobs \naway, forcing people into part-time work, forcing businesses to \ndownsize or limit who they hire. It is remarkably destructive.\n  In fact, the House voted to repeal it by larger numbers than it voted \nto pass it originally. However, the President vetoed our repeal.\n  The President is the only person standing in the way of what the \nAmerican people want. Let me repeat that, Mr. Speaker. The President is \nthe only person standing in the way of what the American people want.\n  So our job now is to stand up for them, to demonstrate for them who \nis on their side, and who is standing in the way of positive, patient-\ncentered reform.\n  We favor a healthcare system where patients and families and doctors \nare making medical decisions, not Washington, D.C. We favor a \nhealthcare system that gets everyone covered with policies that they \nwant for themselves and for their families, not that the government \nforces them to buy.\n  We favor a healthcare system that embraces the principles of health \ncare, accessibility, affordability, quality, responsiveness, \ninnovation, and choice, principles that are all violated by the current \nlaw.\n  So today, Mr. Speaker, we stand with the American people. We will \nvote to override the veto of the President, an action that runs \nabsolutely counter to the will of the majority of our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this veto override vote and stand \nwith positive solutions based on the principles of health care that we \nall embrace.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The only thing historic about this vote today is it probably breaks \nthe record for the number of times a Congress has voted to try to \noverturn existing law that has been twice upheld by the Supreme Court \nof the United States.\n  Yes, Mr. Speaker, here we go again and again and again. How fitting \nit is that we are here, on Groundhog Day, for the 63rd vote in the \nHouse of Representatives to overturn the Affordable Care Act.\n  And make no mistake. The Congressional Budget Office, the nonpartisan \nentity that analyzes bills, has told us and told the American people \nthat, in overturning the Affordable Care Act, you will eliminate \naffordable health care for 22 million Americans.\n  So this is a historically callous action that, in 1 day, our \ncolleagues are proposing that we would deny affordable health care to \n22 million Americans. It is also the 12th vote this House\n\n[[Page H442]]\n\nhas taken to attack women's health care and defund Planned Parenthood.\n  You know, the American people have got to be scratching their heads. \nThey were told that, with a new Speaker, in the new year, 2016, we \nwould actually begin to address the real challenges facing this country \nand do some serious work.\n  Yet, the very first action taken here on this House floor in 2016 \nwith the new Speaker was to again try to dismantle the Affordable Care \nAct. And, yes, that legislation went through the Senate and the House. \nIt went to the President's desk, and the President vetoed it.\n  Make no mistake. We will not overturn the President's veto today. \nThis is a futile gesture. It is part of an obsession to try to undo \naffordable care for 22 million Americans, and it is not going to \nhappen.\n  Now, what has happened since the last vote we had here to attack \nwomen's health programs and defund Planned Parenthood?\n  We have had a decision by a court in Texas. Here were the headlines \nthat came out of that court decision: ``Vindication for Planned \nParenthood'' and ``Texas grand jury clears Planned Parenthood, indicts \nits accusers.''\n  I have to say, Mr. Speaker, our colleagues have a lot of gall to \nbring this to the floor after that Texas court decision.\n  You know, they went into that Texas court decision, and the Harris \nCounty District Attorney said at the outset of their investigation into \nPlanned Parenthood: We must go where the evidence leads us.\n  It began as an investigation into Planned Parenthood, just as we have \nhad a series of witch-hunt investigations here in the House, where the \nchairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee \nsaid months ago that there was no evidence that Planned Parenthood had \ncommitted any wrongdoing. Now we have a Texas court not only \nvindicating Planned Parenthood, but indicting their accusers.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I tell you, this does take a lot of gall to come back \nhere after that and go after women's health programs not for the first \ntime, not for the second time. This is now the 11th time.\n  This will be the 11th time this House has wasted taxpayer time and \nmoney trying to overturn women's health programs and the 63rd time it \nhas wasted taxpayer time and money trying to strip away affordable \nhealth care to 22 million Americans by undoing the Affordable Care Act.\n  So, yes, this is a shamefully historic day. As I said, Mr. Speaker, I \nthink it probably breaks all the records in wasting taxpayer time and \nmoney where, in a really cruel way, if we actually did overturn the \nPresident's veto, 22 million Americans would be denied access to health \ncare.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to sustain the President's veto. \nDon't take away health care to 22 million Americans, and don't continue \nthis attack on women's health.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I would simply say that what \nwe are interested in is expanding health care for the American people \nthat actually responds to their needs.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Roe), a fellow \nphysician who is the chair of the Health, Employment, Labor, and \nPensions Subcommittee of the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to encourage my \ncolleagues to vote to override President Obama's veto of the Restoring \nAmericans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\n  I practiced medicine in rural Tennessee for over 30 years, where I \ndidn't just talk about health care; I actually provided it for \npatients. The problems that I saw in the system were a major reason why \nI ran for Congress.\n  The premise of the Affordable Care Act was to increase access and \ndecrease costs. Everyone in this room agrees with that. Unfortunately, \nthe President's healthcare proposal was a 2,500-page bill that defined \nwhat kind of health insurance coverage you bought and then fined you \nwhen you didn't buy it, even if you couldn't afford it.\n  Access might be up because Americans are forced to buy into the \nPresident's healthcare law, but so are costs. I hear from east \nTennesseans almost every day who are worse off--not better off--under \nObamaCare.\n  The President was wrong to veto this legislation, just like he is \nwrong when he says Republicans have no ideas for healthcare reform.\n  Republicans have many ideas and have introduced numerous pieces of \nlegislation to put patients and doctors in charge of their healthcare \ndecisions, not the government and not insurance companies.\n  I know I have a comprehensive bill, and so does Dr. Tom Price of \nGeorgia, as many of my colleagues do in the Doctors Caucus. It is time \nto repeal this flawed law and give the American people the viable \nhealthcare options they deserve.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support overriding this veto.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene), who is on the Republican \ncommittee designed to roll back protections to women's health care.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this \nfrivolous and wasteful exercise, which will be our sixth vote to defund \nthe Nation's leading provider of reproductive health care.\n  That is right. House Republicans have now voted six times to defund \nan organization that 2.7 million Americans rely on, even though four \ndifferent Congressional committees tried and have failed to uncover any \nevidence of illegal activity, even though a grand jury last week \ncleared Planned Parenthood of all wrongdoing and, instead, indicted \ntheir anti-choice accusers, even though Republicans' taxpayer-funded \nSelect Investigative Panel on Infant Lives, which they created nearly 4 \nmonths ago, hasn't held a single meeting.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Yet here we are on Groundhog Day, no less, voting for the sixth time \nto prevent women from choosing their own healthcare provider. It might \nbe funny if it weren't so outrageous. Women deserve better. They \ndeserve leaders who actually care about the facts.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no''\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock), a fellow member of the \nBudget Committee.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the Congressional Budget Office just \nannounced for the first time in our history that Federal healthcare \npayments now exceed Social Security benefits. Not coincidentally, it \nalso warned that our deficit is again ballooning out of control.\n  ObamaCare forced millions of Americans out of their low-cost \ncatastrophic coverage and basic employee plans and into Medicaid--the \ndysfunctional government poverty program. The result is skyrocketing \ncosts in that program in which surgical patients are 13 percent more \nlikely to die than those with no health insurance at all, according to \na recent University of Virginia study.\n  Mr. Obama promised, if we liked our plans and our doctors, we could \nkeep them, and that ObamaCare would save an average family $2,500 a \nyear. In fact, millions lost their doctors and their plans while \npremiums have increased an average of more than $3,500 per family.\n  This ain't working, and it is time to move on to something that does.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Yarmuth), a distinguished member of the Budget Committee.\n  Mr. YARMUTH. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this measure does absolutely nothing for the American \npeople. Meanwhile, we have a terribly flawed campaign finance system, \nan unfair justice system, and a broken immigration system. There are so \nmany things we could be doing, rather than passing another messaging \nbill just to make the opponents of ObamaCare feel good.\n  This won't make the American people feel good. As a matter of fact, \nCBO said that by repealing the Affordable Care Act, we will not only \nadd to the deficit, but we will have a demonstrably unhealthier \npopulation.\n\n[[Page H443]]\n\n  We have to remember, this is not just about the 22 million who will \nlose their insurance. This is about the tens of millions of people, \nhundreds of millions of people who will lose the protections that are \npart of this act: the ability to put their children on their policies \nuntil they are 26 years old, an end to lifetime caps, and an end to \nannual caps. There are so many things that we would be damaging without \nan alternative if we pass this measure today.\n  Finally, the only reason that the Republicans are putting this up is \nbecause they know it can't pass because, if it passes, it will wreak \nhavoc on the United States of America and the American citizens, and it \nwill do nothing to help them. There is no alternative, and the \nRepublicans know it.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from the great State of Indiana (Mr. Bucshon), a member of \nthe Energy and Commerce Committee and a fellow physician.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today in support of the \nRestoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act of 2015.\n  Before I came to Congress, I spent my career taking care of patients. \nAs a physician, I want every American to have access to quality, \naffordable care. The legislation before us today marks the next step \ntoward that goal.\n  Last month, for the first time, we put a bill to dismantle ObamaCare \non the President's desk. It is no surprise that he vetoed it.\n  Now, with this veto override vote, we are exercising our \nconstitutional power to the fullest extent and bypassing the President \nto do what is right for our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of this bill to show the American people \nthat the House of Representatives is doing everything in our power to \nstop this disastrous law and replace it with a patient-centered \nhealthcare plan.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Illinois (Ms. Schakowsky), who is the ranking member of the Select \nInvestigative Panel on Infant Lives that Republicans set up to take \naway reproductive healthcare access from women.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. Mr. Speaker, how appropriate that the House \nRepublican leadership decided to vote again on repealing the Affordable \nCare Act and defunding Planned Parenthood on Groundhog Day. In the \nmovie Groundhog Day, Bill Murray's character relived the same day over \nand over again, and we are doing the same thing right here.\n  This is the 63rd vote to undermine or repeal the Affordable Care Act. \nThis is the 12th Republican attack on women's health in this Congress. \nWhile House Republicans have already passed 11 anti-women health \nmeasures and are now voting on their 12th, they have not passed one \nsingle measure that helps women get the health care that they need.\n  So here we are--on only the 12th business day of the session--facing \nthe same Republican attacks on women's access to health care. \nRepublicans have said this bill will show the American people the \ndifference between the political parties in this election year. You bet \nit will. The difference is clear. My Republican colleagues remain \nwilling to play partisan politics at the expense of women's health and \naccess to affordable, quality health care. Women of America are \nwatching, and they don't like what they see.\n  Never mind the fact that three House committees have already \ninvestigated Planned Parenthood following the release of the \nselectively edited videos, and never mind that a grand jury in Harris \nCounty cleared Planned Parenthood and, instead, indicted the two \nindividuals who made the doctored videos.\n  Facts matter. The truth matters. Despite my objection to the Select \nInvestigative Panel on Infant Lives, as its ranking member, I will \ncontinue to fight to protect women's health. That is the promise of all \nDemocrats. We will, once again, reject this legislation. This attempt \nto override is going nowhere, and it shouldn't.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Palmer), a fellow member of the Budget \nCommittee.\n  Mr. PALMER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the veto \noverride.\n  James Madison wrote in Federalist Paper 51: ``It is of great \nimportance in a republic not only to guard the society against the \noppression of its rulers but to guard one part of the society against \nthe injustice of the other part.''\n  As expected, President Obama vetoed a reconciliation bill that would \nrepeal the misnamed Affordable Care Act. This was within his \nconstitutional authority. However, our Founders created a balance of \npowers within the three branches to prevent tyranny by one. With two-\nthirds, we have the opportunity to override a veto that doesn't \ncorrelate with the views of the American public. We have the \nopportunity to listen to the American people and put healthcare \ndecisions back in their hands.\n  With this override, we have the opportunity to begin the process of \nreal healthcare reform that provides the American people with \nhealthcare choices, choices they can afford, choices that allow people \nto keep their doctors, choices that provide a safety net rather than a \nnet that entraps people into a government program, and choices that \nallow people to keep their jobs.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this veto override and put the power to legislate back in the \nhands of the legislators.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Scott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education \nand the Workforce Committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, since the passage of the Affordable Care Act in 2010, \nthe House of Representatives has attempted to dismantle the law 62 \ntimes. Today is number 63, to repeal a major portion of the Affordable \nCare Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, since the Affordable Care Act passed, people with \npreexisting conditions can now get health insurance. The cost of health \ninsurance has been increasing at the lowest rate since they started \nkeeping records about a half a century ago. Those young people under 26 \ncan stay on their parents' policies. Women are no longer paying more \nfor insurance than men. We are closing the prescription drug doughnut \nhole. While thousands of people were losing their insurance every day \nwhen we passed the bill, more than 17 million people have insurance \ntoday.\n  If we vote ``yes'' on this motion, we will cancel all of that \nprogress and at the same time just add to the deficit. Mr. Speaker, we \nshould reject this motion, just as we have 62 previous times.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Roskam), the chair of the Oversight \nSubcommittee of the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I just want to recap quickly how we got \nhere.\n  ObamaCare was passed on a partisan basis through the House and the \nSenate, signed into law, and then it went forward. It created a false \npremise, and the false promise that didn't come to fruition was that \npeople were going to be able to keep their physicians, that premiums \nwere going to go down, and it wasn't going to add to the deficit. We \nall know now that was nonsense.\n  So what did the American public do? They said, ``We are going to \nchange the House of Representatives.'' So they elected a Republican \nmajority in the House to take out ObamaCare. What did they do next when \nthey found an obstacle in the United States Senate? They changed the \ndisposition of the United States Senate.\n  Now, there are some people that say today, ``Oh, this is a complete \nwaste of time.'' No, it is not, Mr. Speaker. This is not a waste of \ntime.\n  This is a demonstration to the American public that there is now one \noffice that stands between them and the repeal of ObamaCare. There is \none office that stands between them and the continued shameful subsidy \nof Planned Parenthood. We have got an opportunity to change that office \nin November.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge us to continue that momentum and to vote with Mr. \nTom Price of Georgia on this bill.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I would remind my colleagues that the \nnonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said that if you actually \noverride this veto, 22 million Americans would lose access to \naffordable health care.\n\n[[Page H444]]\n\n  Under the Affordable Care Act, the number of uninsured Americans has \ndropped significantly. It is a sad day that some people don't see that \nas a good thing, just like the same people apparently want to deny \nwomen access to reproductive health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nNadler), a member of the Judiciary Committee and the Select \nInvestigative Panel on Infant Lives.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, last month I said that my Republican \ncolleagues had declared their verdict against Planned Parenthood \nwithout ever holding a trial. Now it is even worse. A grand jury in \nTexas has not only refused to indict Planned Parenthood, but instead \nindicted two individuals who made this series of blatantly manipulated, \nfalse videos on which the Republicans base their attack.\n  Despite this unequivocal finding by a grand jury, not to mention by \nseveral congressional committees that Planned Parenthood has violated \nno laws and done nothing wrong, the Republicans are forging ahead in \nthis ludicrous effort to cut off all Federal funding.\n  If we override this veto today, we will pass legislation that targets \none organization and cuts it off from all Federal funding, including \nreimbursement for services provided, for no justifiable legislative \nreason beyond punishment for offering a constitutionally protected \nmedical procedure.\n  This is a clearly unconstitutional bill of attainder. The prohibition \non bills of attainder exist to ensure that Congress may not usurp the \npowers of the courts by using legislation to punish an organization or \nindividual that a majority in Congress doesn't like. The Constitution \nis clear. Congress cannot be judge, jury, and executioner.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, it is not our role to declare an \norganization guilty and to impose a punishment. That is for a court. \nNot only is this bill an unconstitutional bill of attainder, it is a \ntravesty and is seeking to punish one of the best, most praiseworthy \norganizations in the country, and punish it for what? For enabling \nwomen to exercise their constitutional rights. This is really not only \nan unconstitutional act, but it is part of the war on women.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the Republican majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank my colleague from Georgia for yielding, for his \nleadership, and for bringing this important bill to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a historic day. This is the first time that the \nHouse of Representatives has had a vote to override President Obama's \nveto. If you look at what the veto is about and what the legislation \nthat was vetoed is about, it is about letting the American people \nactually determine their own healthcare destiny. It is about stopping \ntaxpayer money from going to abortion providers like Planned \nParenthood.\n  What this bill does is something very historic by gutting ObamaCare \nand returning that power back to families.\n  I see in my district, and my colleagues share the same stories, all \nacross the country, millions of Americans have lost the good health \ncare that they had. They were promised by this President ``if you like \nwhat you have, you can keep it.'' Everybody knows that that is a \npromise that was broken by this President in his own healthcare law. We \nrestore that ability back to the American people with this bill.\n  With this bill, we also say that abortion providers like Planned \nParenthood should not be able to get taxpayer money. We completely \ndefund Planned Parenthood in this bill. If this is something that is so \nvital, look at what the bill does. It actually transfers the money to \nfederally approved health centers all across the country--many more, by \nthe way, than Planned Parenthood facilities that exist. These are \nfacilities that actually provide services for women that don't include \nabortion. So if you look at what this bill is doing, it shows very \nclearly to the country what is at stake this November.\n  We sent a bill to President Obama's desk that guts ObamaCare and that \ndefunds Planned Parenthood, and he vetoed it. We are going to have the \noverride today.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  If it is not successful in the vote today with a two-thirds vote, it \nmakes clear what is at stake this November. Just by changing the \nPresident, by having a President who shares our values, Mr. Speaker, \nwho wants to gut this law that is failing Americans, who wants to \ndefund Planned Parenthood, by having a President with those values, we \ncan accomplish those important objectives.\n  I urge everyone to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I really urge my colleagues, Republicans \nand Democrats alike, to read the letter from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office. This is the agency that we all turn to for \nunbiased, nonpartisan advice. On page 9, you will read that their \nestimate is that, by overturning the President's veto and enacting the \nunderlying bill, H.R. 3762, we would increase the number of people \nwithout health insurance coverage by about 22 million people in most \nyears after 2017.\n  When my colleagues say this is a historic moment, it is true. Never \nbefore would this Congress have voted on a veto override that would \nimmediately deny access to affordable health care for 22 million \npeople.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. \nWatson Coleman), a terrific member of the Select Investigative Panel on \nInfant Lives.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had no idea that my colleagues on the other side of \nthe aisle were such great fans of the movie ``Groundhog Day.'' If I had \na little more time right now, I would give the exact same speech I gave \njust 1 month ago, because nothing has changed.\n  The facts remain that Planned Parenthood is a health organization \nserving 3 million Americans each year; that one in five Americans will \nreceive care from Planned Parenthood; that despite arguments to the \ncontrary, there are simply not enough health centers to fill the gap; \nthat defunding Planned Parenthood snatches care away from millions of \nfamilies; and that today's bill says to women once again how and when \nthey get health care is not their choice.\n  Like then, this has no chance of becoming law; and, like then, I urge \nmy colleagues to abandon the merry-go-round of attacks on women and \nfamilies. Enough attacks on health care, enough attacks on women, and \nenough attacks on families.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis).\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman.\n  I rise today in support of a vote to override the President's veto of \nthe Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act.\n  With his veto, the President sent Congress and the American people a \ndisappointing--but unsurprising--message. Protecting the rights of \npatients, families, the unborn, and American taxpayers is clearly not a \npriority for this administration.\n  It is, however, a priority for me and for Congress. We worked to pass \nthis legislation with bicameral support. We worked to help reduce \ngovernment spending and reduce the burdens of the President's \nhealthcare law on patients and families. We worked together to prevent \ntaxpayer dollars from funding organizations practicing, in my opinion, \nshameful and unethical activities.\n  We must now work together to override the President's veto and give \nthe power of healthcare decisions back to the people.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, it is hard to see how giving power to \nthe people is stripping 22 million Americans of their affordable health \ncare.\n  I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nSpeier), a member of the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  Are we able to distinguish the plot of ``Home Alone'' from \ncongressional proceedings? Today, I am not so sure. I find myself \ncomparing the bumbling criminals trying to break into a house\n\n[[Page H445]]\n\nto the misleading criminals and bumbling legislators who seem to have \nbroken this House. But while ``Home Alone'' is a comedy, the \nconsequences of today's votes attacking women's health and the health \ncare of hardworking Americans is a tragedy.\n  In each case, we have people who do the same thing over and over but \nonly succeed in hurting themselves. In Home Alone, the criminals are \ntricked with booby traps and misdirection; but in real life, \nRepublicans are stumbling into their 63rd vote to undermine the \nAffordable Care Act and the 12th vote to attack women's health by \nfilmmakers who have been indicted for their illegal activities.\n  I am pleased to see that the Texas grand jury exonerated Planned \nParenthood and indicted the real criminals--the video creators. If \nthere were an Oscar for the most fraudulent film, the so-called Center \nfor American Progress would be thanking the Academy.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to kick these criminals out of our \nHouse, disband the taxpayer funded Select Investigative Panel on Infant \nLives, and get back to the business of governing.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Black), a fellow healthcare \nprofessional and a member of the Committee on the Budget and the \nCommittee on Ways and Means.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, minority leader Nancy Pelosi famously called \nObamaCare a jobs bill, yet the Congressional Budget Office says it will \ncost our economy the equivalent of 2 million jobs. The President \nhimself promised that ObamaCare would save families an average of \n$2,500 in healthcare costs per year, yet the largest insurer in my \nState just upped premiums by 36 percent.\n  Mr. Speaker, this law was built on a grand deception. Nearly 6 years \nlater, the lofty promises have faded, and what is left behind are real \nstories and real people whose lives and livelihoods are impacted by the \ngovernment-knows-best law they continue to reject.\n  The President's veto of our reconciliation bill to repeal ObamaCare \nmay be what is in his best interest for his political legacy, but my \nconstituents have told me loud and clear it is not what is best for \nthem.\n  Today, let's call his bluff, and let's override this veto.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, facts are stubborn things. Since the \nAffordable Care Act was passed, which our Republican colleagues said \nwould be a jobs killer, we have actually seen millions and millions of \njobs added in the economy, and the unemployment rate has come way down. \nThe notion that the Affordable Care Act was going to wreck the economy \nis just blatantly false for everybody to see. Just look at the \nstatistics around the country.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Levin), someone \nwho cares about the facts, the distinguished ranking member of the Ways \nand Means Committee.\n  (Mr. LEVIN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished minority, the \ngentleman who has worked so hard on budgets, for yielding.\n  The majority whip referred to November. We are serving notice in this \ndiscussion: We are proud to defend healthcare reform and will do so \nbetween now, as we did before, and November.\n  Since health care began, the uninsured rate has declined from 20.3 to \n11.4, nearly 18 million people now covered who were before uninsured.\n  Now this has also happened: 137 million Americans have free \npreventive services.\n  The ACA ends lifetime and annual limits on coverage for 105 million \nAmericans.\n  Also what it does--let me just emphasize this--129 million Americans \nwith preexisting health conditions no longer have to worry about being \ndenied care.\n  I met, last weekend, a woman who had breast cancer. She lost her job \nand lost health insurance. Because of healthcare reform, she received \nhealth insurance. Her breast cancer came back. She looked at us and \nsaid to us squarely, one on one, each of us: ``I wouldn't be here \nexcept for healthcare reform.''\n  That is what this is all about. This veto will be sustained. It will \nbe sustained because healthcare reform responded to the needs of \nmillions of Americans. We in the Democratic Party are proud of that and \nwill, from now until November, say so with immense ardor.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Smith), a pro-life champion in our \nNation.\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the age of ultrasound imaging and benign life \nenhancing healthcare interventions for the baby in the womb, how is it \nthat Planned Parenthood first dehumanizes and then massively kills \nunborn children--more than 7 million since 1973--and then demands that \ntaxpayers subsidize the organization to the tune of about $500 million?\n  Caught on numerous videos, Planned Parenthood abortionists describe \nhow they dig with knives and cut out the inner organs of babies all \nwhile altering pain-filled dismemberment procedures so as to preserve \nintact baby hearts, lungs, and livers for a price.\n  This isn't the first time Planned Parenthood has been caught red-\nhanded. In 2011, videos by Live Action exposed several Planned \nParenthood clinics eager to facilitate secret abortions for undercover \npimps for child sex trafficking. In 2012, more videos by Live Action \nexposed Planned Parenthood advising undercover investigators how to \nprocure sex selection abortions for little girls.\n  Have we lost our capacity to be shocked? Can we not empathize with \nthe child victim?\n  Support the override.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I would encourage everybody to read the \nresults of the Texas grand jury proceeding. Here are some headlines \nfrom what happened: ``Vindication for Planned Parenthood,'' and ``Texas \nGrand Jury Clears Planned Parenthood, Indicts Its Accusers.''\n  It is a charade that we are back on the floor after that grand jury \ndecision. It is rare, my colleagues, to see a grand jury investigate \none entity--in this case, Planned Parenthood--and turn around and \nindict its accusers. Despite that, we are back here in this evidence-\nfree zone.\n  I yield 1 minute to gentlewoman from North Carolina (Ms. Adams), a \ndistinguished member of the Education and the Workforce Committee.\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Today, we find ourselves rereading the same chapter from a Republican \nextremist book that seems to have no end. Today's vote represents the \n63rd time the GOP has tried to repeal or undermine the Affordable Care \nAct and the 12th time the GOP has voted to attack women's health care \nin the 114th Congress alone.\n  Partisan games and divisions are transgressions on our communities. \nWe must work together to seize the opportunity that exists in our great \nNation. We can't do that by wasting time and energy on radical agendas.\n  Attacking Planned Parenthood is part of a ploy to roll back women's \nrights. No one should control a woman's right to make decisions about \nher own body. I won't stop advocating for women's comprehensive health \ncare or a woman's right to control her own body.\n  This war on women must stop.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), a champion of patient-\ncentered healthcare reform, the Republican leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank the chairman for his work on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, today the House is keeping its promise to the American \npeople. We showed we can defund abortion providers like Planned \nParenthood and increase funding for thousands of women health centers \nacross the country, and we showed we can send a bill repealing \nObamaCare to the President's desk even when Democrats are trying to \nstop us.\n  Now, this is big. That means that when a Republican President takes \noffice next year, we know we can get this passed. We don't have to \nworry about the filibuster. We don't have to worry\n\n[[Page H446]]\n\nabout a veto. With simple majorities and the stroke of a pen, ObamaCare \ncan be gone once and for all.\n  Democrats see that. They know that ObamaCare, in particular, is \nhanging by a thread. And do you know what? They are terrified.\n  You are going to hear a lot of mocking on the other side of the aisle \ntoday. Mr. Speaker, they are saying that Republicans are at it again \ntrying to repeal ObamaCare. They are trying to make it seem like this \nvote doesn't matter.\n  They tried to stop us at first with arguments and debate, but they \nhave lost that debate.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The people aren't happy with what the Democrats sold them, as few are \nenrolling, premiums are skyrocketing, and deductibles are so high it \ncan make insurance practically worthless.\n  So, the Democrats, they have given up on debate. They have seen that \nthey have lost, and they have tried their next tactic. They have tried \nto tell us that there is nothing we can do, that ObamaCare is the law \nof the land, and that we had better just give up.\n  But then they realized we didn't give up. Year after year, we \nlistened to the American people, and the people voted for \nRepresentatives to repeal ObamaCare; and year after year, the American \npeople saw the healthcare promises that Democrats in Congress and \nPresident Obama made were just exactly what they were--empty: you can \nkeep your doctor; you can keep your plan; your premiums will drop. \nNobody--not even the President--believes that anymore.\n  So we didn't give up. We fought for the American people, and we put a \nbill repealing this law on the President's desk.\n  Now the Democrats have no more defenses. Their law is failing. The \npeople aren't on their side. The end of ObamaCare is coming, and, in \nits place, we can create something that delivers so much more than just \nbroken promises.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The Republican leader said we don't have to worry about the veto. The \nreality is the President's veto will be sustained today. Apparently, \nour Republican colleagues are not worried about the 22 million \nAmericans who will lose access to affordable health care. I don't know \nwhat the Republican leader's definition of ``mockery'' is, but if \nanybody is mocking the Republican bill here, it is the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, which wrote to each and every Member of \nCongress that, if you actually overrode the President's veto and \nenacted this legislation--and I am sorry to repeat it again, but it is \nhere in black and white from the nonpartisan Congressional Budget \nOffice--you would increase the number of people who are without health \ninsurance coverage by 22 million people. That is what our Republican \ncolleagues are talking about here.\n  So, no, we don't want to do that, and the President doesn't want to \ndo that, and that is not going to happen here today, but it certainly \ndoes indicate the stakes in the 2016 elections, because, on the one \nhand, you have a Republican-controlled Congress that would, at the snap \nof a finger, like to get rid of affordable health care for 22 million \npeople, and, apparently, it wants to ignore the facts that we learned \nfrom the Texas grand jury that vindicated Planned Parenthood and said \nthat their accusers, instead, should be indicted.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Pitts), the chair of the Health \nSubcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce.\n  Mr. PITTS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the millions of families \nacross the country who have had their health insurance disrupted by the \nPresident's health law and in support of the millions more Americans \nwho don't want the government giving their tax money to abortion \nproviders.\n  Some 6 million households across the country have lost the health \nplans they liked or have lost their doctors even though President Obama \npromised 37 different times that this would not happen. Hundreds of my \nconstituents have contacted me to tell me about higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, and coverage lost outright:\n  Michael Cain of Lancaster contacted me recently to tell me that his \npremiums have nearly doubled just in the 2 years since the \nimplementation of the President's health law;\n  Jennifer Hoy of Ephrata wrote to me that her family lost three out of \nfour of her children's doctors. Imagine the stress of a mother in that \nsituation;\n  Deborah Kennedy of Columbia contacted me to tell me that, in \nNovember, she spent countless hours trying to operate the broken \nhealthcare.gov Web site. She lost her insurance and had to buy \ninsurance nearly 50 percent more expensive while she lives on a fixed \nincome.\n  These are hardworking Pennsylvania families who have done nothing \nwrong but who have been victimized by the arrogance of a Federal \nGovernment that thinks it knows better than the people and that tries \nto bully hardworking American families.\n  The legislation we are considering today saves taxpayers money and \ntreats them with respect. Mr. Speaker, 84 percent of this country \nsupports restrictions on abortions. However, this administration is \ngiving their tax dollars to organizations that kill innocent babies. \nToday's legislation channels taxpayer money away from organizations \nthat provide abortion and toward something that all Americans can \nsupport--federally qualified health centers. These centers are focused \non caring for the poorest in our communities, and they actually care \nfor women's health. Unlike Planned Parenthood, they actually do \nmammograms.\n  A vote for this bill is a vote for the millions like Deborah Kennedy, \nJennifer Hoy, and Michael Cain, who have borne the consequences of an \nout-of-control Federal Government. Vote to override the President's \nveto.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I heard the word ``bullying'' used. It is ironic that that word would \nbe used in a vote that would deny 22 million Americans access to \naffordable health care.\n  Again, I want to underscore for our colleagues, some of whom may not \nhave read the Congressional Budget Office's report, that this comes \nfrom the nonpartisan entity that advises both parties in Congress. In \nfact, the head of the Congressional Budget Office was appointed by our \nRepublican colleagues. It is they who are telling us that, with this \nvote, 22 million Americans would be denied access to affordable health \ncare. That seems to qualify as bullying if anything does.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's review the situation with respect to Planned \nParenthood.\n\n  This Republican-controlled House had its standing committees \ninvestigate Planned Parenthood, including the Committee on Oversight \nand Government Reform. They had hearings, and they hauled up the head \nof Planned Parenthood to some of these hearings. At the end of those \nhearings, the Republican chairman of that committee concluded that \nPlanned Parenthood had engaged in no wrongdoing. He said that on \nnational television. Despite that finding, back in January, our \nRepublican colleagues went ahead and launched this attack on women's \nreproductive health and defund Planned Parenthood.\n  That was bad enough.\n  Since that time, we have had even more evidence. We have had the \ngrand jury proceeding in Texas that exonerated Planned Parenthood. They \nbegan the investigation against Planned Parenthood, and they said they \nwould go where the evidence led them. At the end of that evidence-\nseeking effort, they exonerated and vindicated Planned Parenthood and \ncalled for the indictment of the people who had wrongly accused them. \nThat was the result.\n  Yet here we are on this House floor today as if nothing had \nhappened--ignoring the evidence that the grand jury heard and \ncontinuing on this witch hunt of the special committee's against \nPlanned Parenthood.\n  So, yes, maybe this day is making history. It is probably one of the \nsaddest examples of a Congress run amuck, when, for the 62nd or 63rd \ntime now, we are trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act--ObamaCare--\nand,\n\n[[Page H447]]\n\nfor the 12th time, trying to launch this attack on women's reproductive \nhealth and on Planned Parenthood despite all of the intervening and \npreviously existing evidence.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, one of the saddest days that \nthe American people remember on the floor of this House was a day in \nMarch of 2010. It was when this House voted in a hyperpartisan way to \npass a healthcare bill that took away patient-centered health care and \nput Washington in charge of health care across this country.\n  I now yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, millions of Americans have endured \nskyrocketing premiums, higher deductibles, limited networks, failing \nco-ops, and dropped coverage because of the Affordable Care Act, like \nthe mom in my district who now has to pay $400 for her son's lifesaving \npeanut allergy medication when it used to cost her $10 under the plan \nthat the President promised she could keep.\n  While some have gained coverage under this failing law, it has been \nat the expense of far too many others. Just last Monday, the \nCongressional Budget Office announced that 40 percent fewer Americans \nsigned up for health coverage this year than was predicted. In fact, \nmany Americans are choosing to pay a penalty instead of signing up for \nthe so-called affordable healthcare coverage mandated by this law. We \nneed to empower all patients with more choice while offering solutions \nfor the uninsured and those with preexisting conditions.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we vote to override, contrary to what has been \nsuggested, the insurance doesn't end tomorrow. We have provisions in \nthis legislation that would extend credits through the end of 2017, \ngiving us the opportunity to do proper healthcare reform that does \nempower patients and not bureaucrats here in Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), a distinguished member of the Ways and Means \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KIND. I thank my friend for yielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this veto override.\n  Listen, I understand people's objections and concerns about the \nhealthcare reform that we have embarked upon as a nation, but, clearly, \nnow is not the time to take us back to the status quo, which was going \nto leave us in a very bad place in this Nation.\n  Before the Affordable Care Act was passed, the numbers of uninsured \nwere going up. The expense for individuals and businesses was going up. \nHealthcare costs, budgetwise, were going up. Too many people were being \ndenied coverage based on preexisting conditions. Young people--younger \nthan 26--were being dropped from health insurance plans.\n  All of that now is being corrected. Not that this is a perfect \nresponse to the complexity of the healthcare system, but there is a lot \nof good that is being done, including in two areas. One is delivery \nsystem reform so that we move to a more integrated, coordinated, \npatient-centered healthcare delivery system based on models that do \nwork. Secondly, and perhaps most importantly, we are changing, under \nthe Affordable Care Act, how we pay for health care so that it is based \non the quality or on the outcome or on the value of care that is given \nand no longer on the numbers of procedures and how much is done to us \nrather than how well it's done.\n  We are demanding better quality at a better price, and the numbers \nare showing that we are heading in this direction. I say we stay the \ncourse in continuing to benefit by extending affordable healthcare \ncoverage to more Americans and in finally getting a grip on these \nrising healthcare costs. I encourage my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthis veto override.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta), a champion of patient-\ncentered health care.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 3762 and in support of \noverriding the President's veto of this very important bill.\n  The Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act \nrepeals some of the most egregious and harmful aspects of ObamaCare: \nthe individual mandate, the employer mandate, the medical device tax, \nand especially the Cadillac tax--a 40 percent excise tax on certain \nemployer health benefits.\n  In the coming years, the Cadillac tax will be responsible for \nemployees from local governments, small businesses and large, \nnonprofits, and colleges-universities losing their access to high-\nquality, affordable health care. This is unacceptable for my home State \nof New Hampshire--people who want patient-centered health care and \noptions for themselves, their families, not higher premiums, higher \ndeductibles, and fewer doctors.\n  That is why it is so important to override this veto today. The House \nand Senate have worked hard in giving American families and small-\nbusiness owners better care, better options, and greater affordability. \nWe need to continue that approach and ensure that patient-centered \nhealth care is at the center of what America stands for.\n  As a new member of the Budget Committee, I thank my chairman for \ngiving me the opportunity to speak today, and I look forward to working \nwith my colleagues to support this legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Not having access to any affordable health care certainly doesn't \nmeet anyone's definition of patient-centered healthcare.\n  Our Republican colleagues, when they first launched the attacks on \nthe Affordable Care Act and ObamaCare, said: We are going to repeal \nthis, and we are going to replace it.\n  Well, we have voted, as of today, 63 times to dismantle it. How many \ntimes have we voted to replace it? Zero. Zero times to replace it.\n  My colleague, Mr. Kind from Wisconsin, raised an important point. The \nway our healthcare insurance system was working back in the early \n2000s, millions of Americans were denied access to health care because \nof a preexisting condition, because their kid had diabetes or asthma. \nPremiums were going through the roof and skyrocketing.\n  The Affordable Care Act has now provided affordable health care to \nmillions more Americans and, as we have heard from the nonpartisan \nCongressional Budget Office, passing this bill would actually take it \naway for 22 million Americans.\n  Despite all that, despite the 63rd attempt to get rid of it and deny \nthat access to health care, not once have we heard the replaced part of \nthat Republican agenda.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it is a sad day when you want to take away access to \naffordable health care from 22 million Americans and don't have a \nsingle alternative to put on the floor of this House.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Brady), the chair of the Ways and Means \nCommittee, a gentleman who has dedicated so much time and effort to \nresponsible, appropriate health care for the American people.\n  Mr. BRADY of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Price for his \nleadership during this historic effort to dismantle the President's \nburdensome healthcare law and stand for the rights of the unborn. I am \npleased to support this veto override. It couldn't come at a more \ncritical time in our history.\n  The rights of the innocent unborn is the great human rights issue of \nour time. This President has chosen to stand on the wrong side of \nhistory. By vetoing this bill, he continues to funnel taxpayer dollars \nto subsidize the gruesome practices at Planned Parenthood.\n  This country has lost 58 million children to abortion since 1973. \nThat means there are more American deaths from this practice each year \nthat are nearly equal to all of the American casualties from all our \nwars combined. This government-financed war on the innocent unborn has \nto stop.\n  This House has already spoken. Whether you are pro-life or pro-\nchoice,\n\n[[Page H448]]\n\nwe have always agreed you don't use taxpayer dollars for the \ncontroversial practice of abortion.\n  It is up to us to continue to stand with those we represent who don't \nbelieve their dollars should go to this. We are going to stand with our \nconstituents against this terrible healthcare law because they have \nbeen hurt by higher prices, fewer doctors, and less affordable \nmedicine. Frankly, this healthcare law has hurt too many Americans.\n  We know now the path to repeal. We know how to remove the law's \nmandates, tax hikes, and slush funds. Now we just need a new President.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I am embarking on completing my fourth \nyear here in the United States House of Representatives. Four years ago \nI ran for the Congress, in part, to support the Affordable Care Act.\n  There is a group of beneficiaries of the ACA that is often not \ndiscussed, and it is hospitals. I come from a part of northeastern \nPennsylvania where the hospitals bore the brunt--and this is true all \nover America--bore the brunt of having to treat uninsured patients. \nPeople would show up on the doorsteps of the hospital and have to be \ntreated. Well, the hospital has to absorb that when they treat \nuninsured patients.\n  So what we saw over and over in my district in northeastern \nPennsylvania was hospitals were closing. I know why. I sat on the board \nof directors of a small hospital.\n  When you absorb it and you absorb it and you absorb the uninsured \ncare year after year, eventually they start cutting back on nurses, \nstart cutting back on essential services. Finally, there is nothing \nleft to cut and they close the hospital.\n  That is a terrible detriment to your health care when your hospital \nis no longer 10 minutes away and it is 40 minutes away. That can be the \ndifference between life and death. That is why the Affordable Care Act \nis something that I supported. We should not dismantle it.\n  I urge Members to vote against this bill.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Allen), who serves on the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee.\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Chairman, since ObamaCare was forced onto the American \npeople 6 long years ago, Americans have seen their premiums skyrocket \nand access to providers dwindle.\n  In fact, Chairman Price and I were in my district talking to a number \nof physicians at the emergency room. They said: Not a thing has \nchanged, but we are still taking care of the people just like we did \nbefore this terrible bill.\n  Ever since I came to Congress, I have consistently heard from folks \nin the 12th District of Georgia about the burdens of ObamaCare and that \nPlanned Parenthood should not receive one dime of their hard-earned tax \nmoney.\n  I have heard from a family of five whose previous healthcare policy \nwas terminated and buying a new plan means their premiums will go from \n$700 to over $1,000. Those seeking treatment could not even pay their \ndeductible.\n  A small-business owner's premiums more than doubled and benefits have \nbeen reduced. An individual projects 16 percent of his income will go \ntoward health care this year alone.\n  This law is killing the economy. This law is crushing. Even worse, it \nis crushing Americans and American families and their ability to earn a \ngood living.\n  Is the sake of a political legacy worth all of this? I think not. \nAfter 6 years of failed policy, Americans deserve better.\n  That is why I am proud to cast my vote to override the President's \nveto of the Restoring Americans' Healthcare Freedom Reconciliation Act. \nIt is time to move forward in finding a cost-effective and patient-\ncentered plan for our citizens.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have heard a lot of talk about premiums going up. The dirty little \nsecret, which every Member of this House knows or should know, is that \npremiums have been going up consistently for a very long period of \ntime. The issue is: How fast do they go up?\n  If you look at this chart, you will find that, for employer-sponsored \ninsurance, which is what most Americans are on, premium increases were \nhuge between 2000 and 2010, before the passage of the Affordable Care \nAct, 9.5 percent. After the passage of the Affordable Care Act, those \npremium increases have dropped substantially, 4.8, now 2.7.\n  When Members of Congress get up here and talk about premiums going \nup, ask yourself the question: How fast are they going up? Because \nbefore the Affordable Care Act passed, it was through the roof, and \nthey have dramatically slowed.\n  I said our Republican colleagues did the repeal part, but not the \nreplace part. So they want to take out the part that has slowed down \nthe premiums and go back to the day when you had skyrocketing premium \nincreases.\n  So we need to talk in a fact-based conversation here on the floor of \nthe House of Representatives.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman), a fellow member of the \nCommittee on the Budget.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Mr. Speaker, in an era where people are so easily \noffended, where nativity scenes are shut down, where racism is claimed \nat the tiniest of circumstances, it is surprising that, in 2015, the \nFederal Government is still funding Planned Parenthood.\n  Margaret Sanger, the founder of Planned Parenthood, once wrote: ``We \ndon't want the word to get out that we want to exterminate the Negro \npopulation, and the minister is the man who can straighten out that \nidea if it ever occurs to any of their more rebellious members.''\n  You can see that is a little bit out of context, but there is no \ndoubt that Margaret Sanger is connected with some of the ugliest \nperiods in our country's history involving racism or eugenics.\n  Her endorsements of promiscuity and opposition to Christian teachings \nand sexual conduct are well known. To this day, Planned Parenthood \ncounsels minors without parental consent.\n  If you really want to strike a blow for equality and strike a blow \nfor not offending people, we should stop spending the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars we do every year on Planned Parenthood.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the Committee on the \nJudiciary who is focused on an evidence-based approach to all of these \nissues.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished gentleman \nfrom Maryland. I do want to say to the gentleman that, as you well \nknow, the Judiciary Committee, in many machinations over the years, has \nlooked at this question of choice and the constitutional right that \ncomes from Roe v. Wade. Unfortunately, our voices--those of us who are \nthere who argue the constitutional premise--have not been heard\n  Let me stand in opposition to, again, a Groundhog Day announcement, \nwhich is again trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The good news \nis that this is my daughter's birthday. So I can celebrate February 2nd \nin a good way.\n  This approach to again try to take away from the millions of people \nin Texas who are uninsured the right to be insured, to have insurance \nwith preexisting conditions, and this horrible provision to defund \nPlanned Parenthood, which is a health prospect and a health project \nthat gives good health care to women, is absurd.\n  Let me also say, Mr. Speaker, that we face some troubling times when \npeople are unemployed, and Planned Parenthood has provided resources to \nthose vulnerable women. I can't understand why this bill continues to \ncome up.\n  I am glad to stand in opposition to support Planned Parenthood and \nits funding and to recognize that the Constitution does protect choice. \nWe do need to provide health care.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I think this is the chart that gets to the issue that is before us \ntoday the\n\n[[Page H449]]\n\nmost, and that is what is our responsibility to our constituents.\n  As I mentioned earlier, when this bill passed on the floor of the \nHouse in March of 2010 in a hyperpartisan vote, the American people \nopposed it.\n  The fact of the matter is the American people oppose it by greater \nnumbers now than they did back then. It is because they have seen its \nimplementation.\n  They know that their premiums have gone up. They know that their \nhealthcare costs more. They know that they can't see the doctor that \nthey want to see. They know that they can't go to the hospital or the \nclinic that they want to go to. They know that the quality of their \nhealth care is actually decreasing if they talk to their doctor, and \nthey know that their choices have been harmed in so many ways.\n  So this is a little chart here that demonstrates that 52 percent, \naccording to Gallup in November of last year, oppose this bill. \nAccording to Fox, in August of last year, 54 percent opposed this bill. \nAccording to Quinnipiac, in July of last year, 52 percent opposed this \nbill. Those numbers only increase.\n  Our responsibility, as Representatives of the people, is to represent \nthem. That is what we are doing today. The President is standing in the \nway of the people's wishes on this piece of legislation. The President \nis standing in the way of patient-centered health care.\n  It is our job and our responsibility to stand up for the American \npeople and the will of the American people. We will vote today to \noverride this veto. I urge my colleagues to join in that activity.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, is the gentleman prepared to close?\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time \nremains on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). The gentleman \nfrom Maryland has 1 minute remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has \n5\\3/4\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I share with my colleague \nthat, unless the Speaker shows up, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  What the chairman of the Budget Committee said about the Affordable \nCare Act omitted the fact that a majority of Americans do not want to \nrepeal and dismantle the Affordable Care Act.\n  We would be happy to work with our colleagues in smoothing out some \nof the edges, but our Republican colleagues are only determined to take \nit down entirely without a replacement.\n  In fact, when you ask the American public: ``What one word describes \nhow you feel about the ongoing political debate about the Affordable \nCare Act?'' they respond: ``ridiculous,'' ``waste of time.''\n  It is a waste of time. Here we are for the 63rd time trying to get \nrid of the Affordable Care Act. It is not going to happen. The \nPresident vetoed the bill. We will sustain the veto.\n  To add insult to injury, our Republican colleagues now want to ignore \nall the facts about the grand jury investigation into Planned \nParenthood, which vindicated Planned Parenthood and concluded instead \nthat they should indict Planned Parenthood's accusers.\n  Mr. Speaker, we will sustain the President's veto. We will protect \nhealth insurance for 22 million Americans, and we will protect women's \naccess to reproductive care.\n  Let's sustain the President's veto. Let's get on with doing the \npeople's business here.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I think it is important to appreciate the numbers of individuals who \nare supporting our work on this issue, the folks who support repealing \nthis legislation: Associated Builders and Contractors, Christian \nCoalition of America, Concerned Women of America, the Family Research \nCouncil, FreedomWorks, National Right to Life, American Center for Law \nand Justice, American Commitment, American Conservative Union, American \nPrinciples Project, Americans for Prosperity, Americans for Tax Reform, \nAmericans United for Life, Conservative Women for America, Focus on the \nFamily, Heritage Action for America, Independent Women's Voice, Liberty \nCounsel Action, March for Life, the National Center for Policy \nAnalysis, National Institute of Family and Life Advocates, National \nTaxpayers Union, Population Research Institute, Priests for Life, \nStudents for Life, Susan B. Anthony, The Justice Foundation, Tradition, \nFamily, Property, Incorporated, and Traditional Values Coalition. Mr. \nSpeaker, the majority of the American people oppose the law in place.\n  As I close, the remarks that we make today, this is the time to try \nto set the record straight. We have heard from our friends on the other \nside what the Congressional Budget Office says. I will tell you what \nthe Congressional Budget Office says about jobs. It says that this law \nwill decrease the equivalent of over 2 million jobs in this Nation. \nOver 2 million jobs in this Nation lost because of this law.\n  Our friends talk about the CBO saying that 22 million individuals are \ngoing to lose their insurance. That is because CBO scores things in a \nway that doesn't recognize the other action that will occur, which is \nwhy we have in this bill a transition period to phase in to patient-\ncentered health care; again, health care where patients and families \nand doctors are making decisions, not Washington, D.C.\n  We have a government of, by, and for the people, and we take that \nvery, very seriously. When the President is standing in the way of the \ndesires and the wishes of the American people as it relates to \nsomething as personal as health care, our responsibility is to stand up \nfor the American people, and that is precisely what we are doing today.\n  As it relates to women's health care, our bill actually would \nincrease spending--increase spending--on women's health care across \nthis great land and allow greater opportunity for access to community \nhealth centers by women to receive the kind of health care that they \nneed.\n  Our friends on the other side talk about premiums going up only a \nlittle bit more than they had been in the past. Mr. Speaker, what that \nignores is that the President of the United States promised--promised--\nthe American people that premiums would go down on average $2500 for a \nfamily of four. In fact, what they have done is gone up by nearly \n$3,000 for a family of four.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is not comparing it to anything else. That is \ncomparing it to what the President promised the American people, and \nthe American people expect their Representatives and the President to \nkeep their promises.\n  Deductibles have gone up incredibly. Our friends on the other side \ndon't talk about that because what that means is that folks have health \ncoverage out there, but they don't have health care. If you are a \nfamily of four, if you are an individual out there making $40,000, \n$50,000, $60,000 a year, and your deductible is $10,000 a year or \n$12,000 a year, which is not unusual given this law, Mr. Speaker, you \nmay have health coverage, but you don't have any health care.\n  As a formerly practicing physician, I can tell you I hear from my \ncolleagues all the time about folks across this land who are making \ndecisions, financial decisions because of this law, denying themselves \nand their family the ability to care for themselves and their family \nbecause of this law.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is, we believe that the \nprinciples of health care that we all hold dear ought to be adhered to. \nWe believe in a system that ought to be accessible for folks--\neverybody. We believe in a system that ought to be affordable for \neverybody, that is of the highest quality, and that expands choices for \nthe American people. The American people ought to be the ones who are \ndeciding who is taking care of them when and where and the like.\n  Mr. Speaker, the fact of the matter is that this law violates every \none of those principles. Accessibility is going down across this great \nland. Affordability is going down. Costs are going up. Quality is \ndecreasing. All you have to do is talk to the men and women who are \ncharged with caring for the American people. Choices have been \ndestroyed in our health care system.\n\n[[Page H450]]\n\n  The principles that the American people hold dear, regardless of \ntheir political stripe, have been violated by this law. That is why we \nare standing here today, standing up and representing the American \npeople, standing up on behalf of the American people and demonstrating \nonce again that the only thing that stands in the way of what the \nAmerican people want and what is occurring right now is that the \nPresident of the United States refuses--refuses--to follow the will of \nthe people.\n  I urge a vote in favor of this veto override. We can get on then with \nthe hard work of making certain that we move in the direction of \npatient-centered health care where patients and families and doctors \nare making medical decisions and not Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the American People have spoken and \nthey do not want Obama's high-cost, job-killing, conscience-violating \nhealthcare law.\n  But the President refuses to listen. He vetoed Obamacare \nReconciliation passed by both the House and Senate to dismantle \nObamacare.\n  Americans have lost their insurance plans and their doctors. Their \ninsurance premiums have skyrocketed and some have even lost their jobs \nbecause of Obamacare. Yet the Administration just sits by and watches \nwhile the American people suffer.\n  Today, the House continues to stand up for the people with this veto \noverride. We will continue to fight for our constituents to defeat \nObamacare and defund Planned Parenthood.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this important measure to show the President \nand the America people that we will not stop until Obamacare is \ndefeated.\n  And that's just the way it is.\n  Mr. TOM PRICE of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is, Will the House, on \nreconsideration, pass the bill, the objections of the President to the \ncontrary notwithstanding?\n  Under the Constitution, the vote must be by the yeas and nays.\n  Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further proceedings on this question \nwill be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H450-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H450]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand submit extraneous materials on the bill, H.R. 3700, to provide \nhousing opportunities in the United States through modernization of \nvarious housing programs, and for other purposes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). Is there objection \nto the request of the gentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 594 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 3700.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1437\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 3700) to provide housing opportunities in the United States \nthrough modernization of various housing programs, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Hensarling) and the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Maxine Waters) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, today I rise in strong support of H.R. 3700, the \nHousing Opportunity Through Modernization Act, offered by my friend, \nChairman Luetkemeyer of Missouri.\n  I want to thank him for his leadership on this bill that he has \nworked on for many, many months. It represents a true bipartisan \napproach to housing reform.\n  I also want to thank his fellow Missourian, the ranking member of the \nHousing Subcommittee, again, another gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nCleaver), for his input into this legislation and for his leadership on \nhis side of the aisle as well.\n  H.R. 3700 passed the Financial Services Committee with broad \nbipartisan\n\n[[Page H452]]\n\nsupport back in December. Again, it is designed to help promote greater \nefficiency in our existing housing assistance programs.\n  In many different ways, Mr. Chairman, it modernizes a lot of outdated \nrules and regulations which, in some cases, have not even been updated \nin a generation. And so, in that respect, it takes the resources that \nwe have and targets it to those who need it the most.\n  So you will find provisions here dealing with Section 8 rental \nassistance, public housing, rural housing, homeless assistance, and FHA \nmortgage insurance for condominiums. It is a very broad bill, and, \nagain, it enjoys bipartisan support.\n  Let me talk a little bit about what H.R. 3700 doesn't do or what it \nis not. Few have been more critical about the poor focus of our HUD \nprograms than I have been because, regardless of whatever their good \nintentions may be, the undeniable truth is current Federal housing \npolicy remains fractured, remains costly, remains inefficient, and \noftentimes does not help those who truly need it.\n  In 2012, the GAO found that 20 different Federal Government entities \nadminister over 160 different programs, tax expenditures, and other \ntools that support home ownership and rental housing.\n  The Department of HUD has received approximately more than $1.6 \ntrillion in real dollars since it was born 50 years ago and today \nspends over $45 billion annually on at least 85 active programs, again, \nmany of which have not been modernized or updated in a generation.\n  And the results of all this?\n  Well, all too often housing affordability remains a very real \nchallenge for many Americans. Too many neighborhoods still suffer from \nblight and neglect with substandard housing options for low-income \nfamilies.\n  Most tellingly, the national poverty rate has remained essentially \nunchanged in the 50 years since HUD was first created. Mr. Chairman, we \ncan do better.\n  Now, we all know that the best housing program is a job, a career \npath, one with a future. We know that the best housing program is \neconomic opportunity for all, boundless economic opportunity for all. \nBut there are still some that need assistance.\n  So that is not what this debate is about today. Today the debate is: \nWhat can we do on a bipartisan basis? Where can we come to agreement on \ncurrent existing programs to try to make them work better for the poor \nand for our low-income people who need assistance through the HUD \nprograms? What is it we can do to help move more people out of poverty \nto lives of self-sufficiency? How do we reform HUD's complex \nbureaucratic web of programs? How do we spread economic opportunity to \nall?\n  Those should be what our goals are.\n  H.R. 3700 addresses the question by finding many ways within HUD's \nbureaucracy to streamline the inspection protocol for rental assistance \nunits, to simplify tenant income review so local housing officials can \nfocus on housing, not data collection, and to target assistance, again, \nto households with the greatest need.\n  For the first time, H.R. 3700 will state that any occupant of a \npublic housing unit that exceeds the area median income for 2 \nconsecutive years either gives up their government subsidy or moves out \nof the unit. That provides more resources for those who deserve it.\n  H.R. 3700 also addresses the problem of over-income occupants. It \ncreates for the first time a financial asset test for public housing \nresidents. Currently, there is only a one-time income test.\n  Again, these are just two ways, Mr. Chairman, that we ensure that the \nresources that are devoted to these housing programs are targeted to \nthose who are most in need.\n  I could go on and on about the benefits of the bill. But let me just \nsay that, with any great project, there are those who are always saying \nwe could do more. And, yes, we could do more, and we are working faster \nto implement even more reforms.\n  But today represents a start of a process, not the end of a process, \na very ambitious project to transform how we deliver government housing \nassistance in America and help people graduate from Federal assistance \nto lives of self-sufficiency and financial independence.\n  Again, I congratulate the gentleman from Missouri, the chairman of \nour Housing and Insurance Subcommittee, for his great leadership.\n  I commend the ranking member of that committee as well for working on \na bipartisan basis.\n  I hope all Members will support H.R. 3700. It is a bipartisan first \nstep in fixing a broken housing system that we have.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself as much \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, we are here today to discuss H.R. 3700, but I would \nlike to start by saying how pleased I am that we are focusing on \nhousing.\n  This is the first major housing bill that the Financial Services \nCommittee has considered in the past several Congresses, and I hope \nthat we can spend a lot more time focusing on the dire housing needs of \nlow-income families in America as we move forward.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Today, only one in four households in this country who are eligible \nto receive housing assistance actually receive it, and there is a \nsevere deficit of over 7 million rental units that are both affordable \nand available to extremely low-income Americans.\n  Furthermore, according to HUD's most recent point-in-time count, \nthere are nearly 600,000 Americans who are homeless in this country--a \nstaggering number I find simply unconscionable. These statistics \ndemonstrate that we must come together to make reforms to Federal \nhousing programs, but also to commit new resources to tackle the \nextreme lack of affordable housing in this country.\n  I spend a lot of time visiting and talking with housing and homeless \nservices providers. Recently, I visited the Downtown Women's Center in \nLos Angeles and N Street Village here in D.C. These homeless service \nproviders are helping women and families get off the streets and into \nsafe, decent, affordable, and supportive housing. Organizations such as \nthese are not just applying compassion, they are applying evidence-\nbased approaches to addressing homelessness in the most effective ways.\n  H.R. 3700 is a step in the right direction because it directly \nresponds to concerns that I have heard over and over again from these \nhousing and homeless service providers about how Federal housing \nprograms can better support their efforts.\n  This bill would make several incremental changes across a number of \nFederal housing programs that will allow us to better serve low-income \nfamilies in need of housing assistance while also relieving certain \nadministrative burdens. These changes would affect public housing, \nsection 8 Tenant and Project-Based Rental Assistance, the Federal \nHousing Administration, the Rural Housing Service, and HUD's \nhomelessness programs, among others.\n  Many of the provisions are commonsense reforms that are long overdue. \nFor example, this bill includes the text of my bill, the Project-Based \nVoucher Improvement Act of 2015, which would increase flexibility for \npublic housing authorities to develop new units of housing to serve \nvulnerable populations, including those who are homeless in this \ncountry. It would also help to create housing opportunities in areas \nwhere vouchers are difficult to use.\n  Several national and local tenant advocacy organizations and \naffordable housing industry groups have expressed support for my bill. \nIn addition, a number of other provisions in H.R. 3700 were included in \nprevious section 8 reform bills that I have introduced. I am pleased \nthat my Republican colleagues have expressed their support for these \nprovisions that I have long advocated.\n  At the markup of this bill, I raised a serious concern that I had \nwith one of the provisions in H.R. 3700 because it would effectively \nraise rents for low-income families with children who are living in \ncertain HUD-assisted housing. I voted against the bill in committee. \nAlthough I voted against the bill at the committee markup for this \nreason, I am very pleased to say that I have worked, and my staff has \nworked, with my Republican colleagues so that we could find some common \nground, and\n\n[[Page H453]]\n\nthey have indicated that they will support my amendment that I have \noffered to address this issue.\n  I am encouraged that my Republican colleagues shared in my concerns \nand that we were able to reach a meaningful compromise on this issue.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why I am now urging my colleagues to vote \n``yes'' on H.R. 3700. It is high time we came together to pass a \nbipartisan housing bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), the chairman of the Housing and Insurance \nSubcommittee of the Financial Services Committee. He happens to be the \nauthor of the bill.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman \nHensarling, Ranking Member Waters, and especially my good friend from \nMissouri, the ranking member, Mr. Cleaver. We have had a labor of love \nwith this bill, and it took two guys from the Show Me State to show \nthem how to do it. We are excited about that, and I want to give a \nspecial shout-out to him.\n  Mr. Chairman, when I took the gavel of the Financial Services \nSubcommittee on Housing and Insurance, I told my colleagues I wanted to \nwork with them across party lines to make meaningful changes that \nbenefit all Americans. H.R. 3700 represents a major step forward, one \nto reform a system that is in many instances outdated, duplicative, and \nburdensome.\n  As a body, we should be committed to creating a more efficient \ngovernment and greater opportunity for the American people and American \nbusinesses. H.R. 3700 helps us meet those commitments.\n  This legislation promotes greater efficiency in housing assistance \nprograms and modernizes outdated rules and regulations, which in some \ncases have not been updated in more than a generation. H.R. 3700 \nstreamlines the inspection protocol for rental assistance units, \nsimplifies the income recertification policies for assisted households, \nclarifies homeless assistance program requirements, delegates rural \nhousing loan approval authority, and provides targeted flexibility \nbetween public housing operating and capital funds.\n  H.R. 3700 also gives State and local housing agencies and private \nowners enhanced flexibility in meeting key program objectives such as \nreducing homelessness, improving access to higher-opportunity \nneighborhoods, and addressing repair needs of public housing.\n  The bill also, for the first time in over 30 years of public housing \npolicy, provides a thoughtful limitation on public housing tenancy for \nover-income families. Importantly, this legislation also pays special \nattention to our homeless veterans and children aging out of foster \ncare, two vulnerable communities that need our support today.\n  H.R. 3700 does all of this and still manages to save the taxpayers \nmoney. CBO estimates that the underlying bill saves $311 million over 5 \nyears.\n  I will be the first to point out that H.R. 3700 will not necessarily \nchange the world. It won't overhaul HUD or the Rural Housing Service, \nend homelessness overnight, or meet the overwhelming need for \naffordable housing. But it is a significant step in the long journey to \nreforming a broken system.\n  The majority of the provisions in this bill were agreed to years ago \nby Members of Congress, housing advocates, and industry groups. H.R. \n3700 is a set of solutions on which all parties, in Congress, industry, \nand advocacy, have agreed and can agree.\n  Mr. Chairman, this legislation presents a bipartisan effort that has \nbeen drafted and debated over the past 6 months. I want to thank again \nChairman Hensarling for his support and Ranking Member Waters for her \nwork on the bill, which passed the Financial Services Committee in \nDecember by an overwhelming bipartisan vote of 44-10.\n  I also want to recognize my good friend, the ranking member, Mr. \nCleaver from Missouri. Without his tireless efforts, this bill would be \nvery difficult to have accomplished anything with.\n  Housing policy isn't easy. It is emotional. It touches lives. It sets \nthe stage for future generations. Because it is so important, it isn't \nalways easy to find policies on which we all agree. With H.R. 3700, we \nhave an opportunity to show the Nation that we are committed to working \ntogether, and with a diverse group of stakeholders, for the American \npeople.\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, and I \nurge the Senate to consider it without delay so we can break a status \nquo that benefits too few at the cost of too many.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver). He is the leading Democratic \nsponsor of this bill, a member of the Financial Services Committee, and \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.\n  Mr. CLEAVER. Mr. Chairman, I came to Congress, and because of my own \nexperiences, I only had one ambition other than being a Member of \nCongress, and it was to take leadership in the Subcommittee on Housing \nand Insurance because, experientially, I thought I had experiences that \nmight help. And secondly, having served as mayor, we dealt a lot with \nhousing in Missouri's largest city. I had this opportunity. And I want \nto thank Ms. Waters for the opportunity to be the lead Democrat on the \nHousing and Insurance Subcommittee.\n  I think it was fortunate, maybe even fortuitous, that two Missourians \nended up working together, and we were able to, I think, do some things \nthat probably might not have been done otherwise because I think we \nboth have a spirit of working together, and it ended up in a good \nproduct. But that wouldn't have taken place without the chairman and \nthe ranking member.\n  I lived in 404-B Bailey public housing in Wichita Falls, Texas. I \nwent by on Christmas, and I just parked there for a long time and \nlooked at the kids running around playing, thinking I used to do that \non that same little piece of dirt that we called a yard. I wondered \nabout the kids who were in that unit. Will they eventually have the \nopportunities that I was blessed to have? Or would they suffer the fate \nof many others with whom I grew up?\n  I thought in part we might be able to do some things here that will \nhelp the little boy I saw running around playing in front of the unit I \nonce lived in with my mother, father, and three sisters. I think we \nhave done this. These are probably the most sweeping changes in HUD \nregulations in a quarter of a century, perhaps ever; and what we have \ndone is we have remodeled, or refashioned, or recast, or redesigned \nmany of the programs impacting HUD.\n  I do not disagree with Chairman Hensarling that we do have a great \ndeal of redundancy in programs that we run with HUD and USDA. I do \nthink at some point there is a need for us to get things molded a \nlittle bit better, but that is not going to take place I don't think \nany time soon.\n  I support H.R. 3700 because I had the opportunity to understand what \nthese changes mean. I also need to say before I go any further that I \ndon't believe that compromise means capitulation. In fact, I don't \nthink democracy can work without comity and compromise. I think they \nare inseparable parts of democracy. So there are parts of this bill \nthat I am not as thrilled with, as other parts, but that is what \nhappens in a democracy.\n  Again, I cherish the opportunity to work with people who are willing \nto move and shake and move and shake and shake and move to get \nsomething to the floor.\n  The bill will streamline the inspection and income review process for \nfamilies living in section 8 units. We are making, in this legislation, \nsome very badly needed changes to the project-based voucher program by \nallowing a public housing authority, PHA, to project-base up to 20 \npercent of its authorized voucher allocation, rather than 20 percent of \nthe voucher funding that we give. And then we give PHAs more \nflexibility with their funds by allowing them to transfer up to 20 \npercent of their capital funds to the operating fund.\n  Mr. Chairman, what this allows is for people who are on the ground, \nworking with people, understanding where they need to have funds, the \nopportunity to move those funds around without violating any of the HUD \nregulations.\n  It helps our foster children by expanding eligibility for the Family \nUnification Program from the current\n\n[[Page H454]]\n\nlimit of 21 years of age to 24 years of age, and it increases the \nlength of stay from 18 months to a maximum of 36 months. It also--and I \nthink this is important--expands the eligibility of individuals who \nwill leave foster care within 90 days.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Neugebauer), who is the chair of the Subcommittee on \nFinancial Institutions and Consumer Credit.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Luetkemeyer \nand Ranking Member Cleaver for their work on this very important piece \nof legislation.\n  I have been in the housing business probably for over 40-some-odd \nyears. I have been involved in every aspect of it, from low-income \nhousing, to rental housing, to new housing, to resale housing. One of \nthe things that I have recognized over the years is what an important \npart housing is to the fabric of our country, how important housing is \nto families, and how people enter into the housing market in different \nways. Certainly there are folks that go into market-based rental \nhousing, and then there are folks that aren't quite ready to do that. \nMaybe they are getting started or have had a difficulty in their life, \nso lower-income housing provides an opportunity for them.\n  I think the goal of the housing programs over the years is to provide \nlow-income housing as a stepping stone and not a permanent residence. \nOne of the things I like about H.R. 3700 is that it encourages that \nprocess. It has been brought up in a number of these programs, and over \nthe years sometimes a good idea spreads around. We have spent a lot of \ntime probably creating new housing programs and probably spent a lot of \ntime increasing the funding for housing programs, but in many cases \nmaybe we didn't stop and do the review and make sure that the programs \nthat we had put in place were efficient in delivering the services that \nneeded to be delivered and helping those families accomplish the goal \nof moving through the housing cycle.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  So one of the things that I like about this bill is that these \nfamilies that have--in fact, the goal has been to increase their \nlivelihood, and they have gotten better jobs and their income has \nincreased. It is time, then, for those folks to move on. Because what \nwe know is--and those statistics have been, I think, brought out \ntoday--we have got a number of people in the waiting line to get into \nsome of this housing to better their lives. It is not fair that people \nwhose incomes have far surpassed incomes that it takes to qualify to \nlive in them should continue to do that.\n  So affluent families must pay market rental rates or they have got to \nleave the public housing arena. Higher asset families must leave public \nhousing. That is a normal cause. That is not cruel. That is just the \nway that these programs were designed to work.\n  The other thing, though, is we have a responsibility not only to the \nfamilies and individuals around our country, but we have a \nresponsibility to the United States of America. One of the things that \nI think is important about this piece of legislation is it doesn't \nreally mess with mandatory spending but is, according to CBO, going to \nsave $300 million over 5 years.\n  What that points out--and this is done really without cutting any of \nthe programs, but just cutting some efficiencies in those programs to \nmake sure that those programs are being administered appropriately--is, \nif there are some regulatory things that are keeping people from \noperating some of these public housing facilities in a way that \nmaximizes the benefit, then we give them some flexibility to do that by \nreducing some duplicative regulatory processes and, more importantly, \nempowering the local entities and the local operators of this public \nhousing to be more innovative and creative.\n  As I have had an opportunity to visit some of our public housing \nfacilities in my district, the 19th Congressional District, and sit \ndown with a lot of those administrators, what they tell me is: Randy, \nif we could have more flexibility, we know how to deliver this service \nmuch more efficiently than we have today. But in many cases, the \nFederal regulation is inhibiting their ability to be able to implement \nsome of those things.\n  I want to commend the two gentlemen from Missouri for their \noutstanding work. Yes, we could probably do more, but the good thing is \nwe got started. I think we are off to a good start, so I encourage my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 3700.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), the ranking member of the \nMonetary Policy and Trade Subcommittee of the Committee on Financial \nServices.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Ranking Member Waters for yielding.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 3700, as amended by Ranking Member Waters.\n  This is what you call regular order, folks. This bill came out of \ncommittee with a significant flaw that would have had a very negative \nimpact on families and children and the ability of low-income people to \ndeduct childcare expenses. If it were not fixed, it would have \neffectively raised rent on thousands of low-income families with \nchildren.\n  I just want to commend my colleagues, Ms. Waters and Mr. Cleaver--Ms. \nWaters in particular--for really catching this flaw. But I also want to \ncommend the Republicans who, instead of just taking their position as \nbeing in the majority and saying ``we don't have to listen to you,'' \ncontinued to engage with us to fix this. Literally, the math did not \nwork out.\n  I can tell you as once a single parent and as a grandmother, I know \nabout the budget-busting cost of child care. I also know how central \nhousing policy and access to child care is critical to positive social \noutcomes for children.\n  So often we demand that poor people, and especially women, pull \nthemselves up by their bootstraps. We have programs that are designed \nto help them. But then what we do is we put program features in place \nthat really cancel out the benefits of these programs.\n  But this bill, H.R. 3700, as amended by the ranking member, \neliminates the unintended consequences for poor people who are raising \nchildren. Ranking Member Waters and subcommittee Ranking Member Cleaver \nhave both been powerful advocates for affordable housing on the \nFinancial Services Committee. I am so pleased to join them in fighting \nfor these changes.\n  H.R. 3700 is supported by the National Association of Realtors, the \nNational Alliance to End Homelessness, and the Center on Budget and \nPolicy Priorities, among the over two dozen groups supporting it.\n  I urge adoption of the legislation, as amended by Ms. Waters.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom New Mexico (Mr. Pearce), the vice chairman of the Financial \nInstitutions and Consumer Credit Subcommittee.\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  About 5 years ago, I was in Roswell, New Mexico, at a meeting with \nveteran constituents. We were talking about policies and things like \nthat. After about an hour, suddenly one gentleman overlooked in the \nwhole group blurted out, ``I am living in a rat hole.'' It just caught \nus all by surprise. We dismantled the discussion there, and we went \nimmediately to look at his house. Over the next 2 years, that community \ngathered money and businesses came together. They tore down the man's \nhouse and rebuilt it.\n  The problem is that not everyone out there can get access to \ncommunities and local businesses to help them through the problems, so \nwe have the housing programs which are set up. Unfortunately, they are \nmired in bureaucratic red tape. We soak up the dollars that should be \nhelping people with administrative burdens that make no sense, with \nduplicative requirements to go through the processes.\n  I commend both sides of the aisle, Mr. Luetkemeyer and Ms. Maxine \nWaters of California, for pushing this reform because it will allow us \nto direct the money to where it should be going.\n  Many times we think that we disagree with each other about policies. \nThe truth is there is not significant disagreement that we should be \nhelping those at the lowest income levels to raise themselves up. It is \nthrough their\n\n[[Page H455]]\n\nprogression towards prosperity and towards just making ends meet that \nwe get rid of some of the deepest problems in our social cost of the \ngovernment. It is not that we disagree; it is that sometimes we get \ntrapped and that that program doesn't work very well so we want to cut \nfunds.\n  I really think that this is a very important step today where we are \ntrying to modernize the systems that are delivering help to those that \nneed it the most in the belief that the human spirit will actually take \nthose steps to make their own way out once we help them stabilize.\n  Again, just thanks for the work on both sides of the aisle.\n  I urge support of H.R. 3700.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Alabama (Ms. Sewell), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. \n3700, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act, as amended by \nRanking Member Waters.\n\n  While not a perfect bill, H.R. 3700 has been made considerably better \nby the amendment offered by Ranking Member Waters. There are other \namendments that I would love to see, including my own, but I must tell \nyou that this bill does represent true bipartisanship. It is a major \nbipartisan step towards helping preserve our scarce housing resources \nwhile expanding housing opportunities and homeownership opportunities.\n  More specifically, this legislation makes critical changes that would \nhelp improve and expand the Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing Loan \nProgram. This program helps provide low- and moderate-income households \nwith homeownership opportunities in rural areas, like the Seventh \nCongressional District of Alabama, which I am so proud to represent.\n  The sad reality is that too often, rural America faces severe \nbarriers and obstacles to obtaining quality and affordable housing. \nThis is largely due to the limited access to affordable mortgage \ncredit.\n  The Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing Loan Program is designed to \ntarget rural residents who have a steady low or moderate income yet are \nunable to obtain adequate housing through conventional financing. \nEssentially, this program encourages private lenders to extend credit \nto responsible and creditworthy borrowers in rural America.\n  H.R. 3700 would help the Department of Agriculture improve and expand \nthe Section 502 Guaranteed Rural Housing Loan Program by delegating \nloan approval authority to certain participating lenders. This is \nsimilar to the authority that the Secretary of the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development currently has for Federal Housing \nAdministration's programs, and this legislative proposal was included \nin the President's FY 2016 budget.\n  This is a commonsense and pragmatic measure that will help improve \nthe efficiency of an important rural housing program so that it can \nreach even more rural families. It is critically important that we \ncontinue to provide the necessary tools and incentives to help ensure \nall Americans are able to realize their dream of homeownership.\n  I want to commend my colleague from Missouri. I especially want to \ncommend my colleague Congressman Cleaver for his tireless leadership on \nthis effort. I want to thank the chairman and ranking member for their \nefforts.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to support H.R. 3700.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. I thank Chairman Luetkemeyer for his leadership on \nthis bill, and I appreciate deeply the support and leadership of \nCongressman Cleaver.\n  Mr. Chairman, today I rise in support of H.R. 3700, the Housing \nOpportunity Through Modernization Act, which contains provisions that \nexpand housing opportunities while protecting American taxpayers.\n  This bipartisan legislation provides commonsense efforts for \nstreamlining and reducing regulatory burdens for organizations working \nwith HUD.\n  This bill looks to correct many wrongs within our housing system \nwhile also simplifying certification processes and providing permanent \nauthority for direct endorsement for approved lenders to approve rural \nhousing service loans.\n  Mr. Chairman, condominiums are often the first step on the housing \nladder for first-time homeowners. They also can be the most affordable \nand desirable option for single people, young families, and those \nlooking to downsize. Unfortunately, current FHA regulations prevent \nbuyers from purchasing condos. H.R. 3700 eases restrictions, allowing \nmore opportunity for homeownership.\n  This bill reins in duplicative and overly burdensome regulations, \nwhich not only create a slower process, but also increase government \nworkload all without affecting any changes to direct spending.\n  Mr. Chairman, housing assistance should be solely for those who need \nit most of all, and this bill takes aim at ensuring this. For the first \ntime in 80 years, this legislation provides limitations on public \nhousing tenancy for over-income families.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from California (Ms. Lee), a member of the \nAppropriations Committee and someone who has been focused on dealing \nwith poverty.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me thank our ranking member, Congresswoman \nWaters, for leading and also for her tremendous leadership on the \nFinancial Services Committee as our ranking member. She has been \nphenomenal in terms of making sure that our legislation is bipartisan. \nAlso, I remember serving on the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance \nfor many, many years with Congresswoman Waters, and she constantly \nworked to make sure that people had access to affordable, accessible, \nclean, and safe housing. She has not wavered on that agenda. So I thank \nher very much.\n  The need for affordable housing has never been greater. That is why I \nam very happy to be here today to support the Housing Opportunity \nThrough Modernization Act of 2015. This bill would make critical \nimprovements to our Nation's public and assisted housing programs, and \ntakes steps to ensure that low-income communities have access to safe \nand affordable housing.\n  Now, let me just tell you, in my district in Oakland, California, \nrents have risen faster than anywhere else in the Nation. In fact, if \nthe average Oakland renter had to move tomorrow, they would be spending \na staggering 70 percent of their income on housing--70 percent of their \nincome. That is outrageous. My constituents, like many constituents \naround the country, can't afford this, so this is a crisis.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  This bill takes steps to address this issue by protecting voucher \nholders from losing their subsidies when fair market rents drop, which \nis something that recently had a major impact on my community. \nThankfully, with the help of Congresswoman Waters and our Secretary of \nHUD, we were able to navigate the agency's redtape to find a solution \nso the tenants could keep their assistance and stay in their homes.\n  I support this bill and the critical amendments offered by \nCongresswoman Waters and Congressmen Price and Aderholt.\n  It is also important that we update the formula that is used to \ndistribute funds under the Housing Opportunities for Persons with AIDS \nto reflect the changing nature of the HIV/AIDS epidemic and to ensure \nthose communities in greatest need receive critical HOPWA funds. This \nis one issue that Congresswoman Waters has been working on for many, \nmany years to make sure these funds are targeted to the people and to \nthe communities who need it the most.\n  The bill allows for homeownership for those whose American Dream of \nsuch has been shattered. Thank goodness, in this bill, we now have \nprovisions that will allow that dream to be fulfilled.\n  I thank Congressman Cleaver as well as our majority and minority \nmembers for this bill.\n  From just a very parochial point of view, in my district, I have to \nsay how badly needed this bill is, as\n\n[[Page H456]]\n\ngentrification is a big issue. My constituents constantly ask me what \nthe Federal Government can do, and this is a major step in that \ndirection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ngentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).\n  Mr. BARR. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of H.R. 3700, which is a \nmodest but important first step to improving Federal housing policy \nthrough several commonsense reforms.\n  For the first time in HUD's 50-year history, there will now be a \nflexible formula directing over-income families to pay greater shares \nof their subsidized rents or to move out of public housing. Incomes and \nassets will be reevaluated to target assistance to those who are truly \nin need.\n  There are wait lists across the country for scarce public housing \nresources and Section 8 vouchers. I have listened to homeless advocates \nand to my constituents at the Lexington Housing Authority in Kentucky \nabout the waiting lists that exist in my own district. A 2015 HUD audit \nfound that 25,000 families had incomes too high to qualify for \nassistance; yet the families remained in taxpayer subsidized housing. \nSome of those families actually derived income from renting other \nresidential properties that they, themselves, owned. One family \nhighlighted in the report had a combined income of $498,000.\n  Policy failures such as these not only waste taxpayer dollars, but, \nmore importantly, they hurt those in need who might otherwise have \nroofs over their heads. I hope this bipartisan initiative is a down \npayment on the further reform of Federal housing programs.\n  Several of my colleagues and I are developing an empowerment agenda \nto holistically reform Federal assistance programs from housing to \nnutrition to workforce development. We start with the recognition that \nthe Federal Government now runs more than 80 different antipoverty \nprograms at an annual cost of nearly $1 trillion; yet, after 50 years \nof this strategy, the poverty rate has barely budged from where it was \nin 1965. The goal is to assist Americans to achieve their God-given \npotential and to restore the American Dream to where the condition of \none's birth does not determine the outcome of one's life.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle and with members of this subcommittee in leveraging the \nempowerment agenda to craft additional reforms to Federal housing \npolicies, which will improve outcomes by recognizing that poor \nAmericans are not liabilities to be managed by some remote bureaucracy \nin Washington but who are untapped assets who can achieve the American \nDream.\n  I congratulate Chairman Luetkemeyer and Ranking Member Cleaver for \ntheir work on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3700, and I invite my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to join in additional efforts to \nreform HUD and to more effectively combat poverty.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, with this bill, we have an opportunity to address an \ninequity with how the Department of Housing and Urban Development \ntreats condominiums, particularly in senior communities.\n  Across the country and in my district in the Bay Area, condo \ncommunities have been missing out on access to mortgages due to an \nunnecessarily restrictive rule. The rule's intent is good, but, in \npractice, it unduly harms seniors, families, and communities.\n  One community in my district in the East Bay of the Bay Area, \nRossmoor, is home to thousands of seniors, many of whom need access to \nHUD-backed mortgages to enhance their financial security. I am pleased \nthat this bill is a step in the right direction to allow these \nresidents and residents in other condo communities around the country \nto benefit from the same mortgage rules that are available to other \nhomeowners.\n  I appreciate the hard work done by the chairman and ranking member of \nthe subcommittee on this important issue, and I look forward to working \nwith them to continue to protect these deserving communities.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus), one of our \nyoung and up-and-coming members of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, for decades, the Federal Government has spent over $1.6 \ntrillion in an attempt to accomplish the laudable goal of ensuring that \nall Americans have access to affordable, decent housing.\n  I have visited many affordable housing sites during my time in \nCongress to listen to the concerns of residents, managers, and \ncommunity leaders. In fact, just 2 weeks ago, I visited a public \nhousing facility that is managed by the Housing Authority of Beaver \nCounty. These meetings and visits have underscored the importance of \nour housing assistance programs. If administered correctly, these \nefforts can be truly transformative for hardworking Americans. I have \nmet many Pennsylvanians who have improved their lives and who have \nbrightened their families' futures thanks, in part, to targeted Federal \nhousing assistance provided to them in their time of need.\n  However, there are also cases in which outdated rules, waste, fraud, \nabuse, and general inefficiency have made it difficult to direct \nresources to those who need them the most. There are also instances in \nwhich housing assistance programs have failed to help people lift \nthemselves out of poverty. Members of both parties recognize this \nreality and have worked together to identify areas for improvement. \nH.R. 3700, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act, is a \nbipartisan, commonsense bill that addresses many of these issues.\n  Among other things, this legislation makes it easier for tenants, \nowners, and investors to navigate rental assistance programs by \nreducing duplicative and inefficient regulations that make it harder to \nrent or to operate affordable housing. The Housing Opportunity Through \nModernization Act also incorporates safeguards to prevent well-off \nfamilies from using scarce public housing units. We can all agree that \nhousing assistance programs should be reserved for those who need help \nthe most. This legislation also provides flexibility to public housing \nagencies in using Federal funds to meet local needs more effectively.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of this legislation, and I encourage my \ncolleagues to support this bipartisan effort to improve Federal housing \nassistance. We owe it to the many Americans who rely on these programs \nto enact this legislation's reforms.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  This bill contains several provisions which I wholeheartedly support \nand would like to see passed into law.\n  For example, this bill includes a few provisions that were taken \nstraight from bills that I have authored, including the text of my \nProject-Based Voucher Improvement Act of 2015, which would increase the \nflexibility for public housing authorities to develop new units of \nhousing to serve vulnerable populations, including those who are \nhomeless in this country. It would also help to create housing \nopportunities in areas where vouchers are difficult to use.\n  I introduced the Project-Based Voucher Improvement Act to address the \nsevere lack of affordable housing, which is contributing to the \nepidemic of homelessness across the country. The Section 8 project-\nbased voucher program is a valuable tool to help preserve and create \nmore affordable housing, especially for the poorest and most vulnerable \npopulations. Essentially, it helps housing providers leverage outside \nfinancing in order to create and maintain affordable housing in their \ncommunities.\n  My bill would help us maximize the effectiveness of this critical \nprogram by facilitating the ability of PHAs to enter into agreements \nwith private and nonprofit owners and to partner with social service \nagencies to provide supportive housing. This will, ultimately, help \nprovide stable housing for our most vulnerable populations.\n  Gaining access to affordable housing is becoming harder and harder \nfor far too many families. We are in the midst\n\n[[Page H457]]\n\nof a homeless crisis in my district and in many districts around the \ncountry, and we need more affordable housing to help get vulnerable \npopulations off the streets. By making this Section 8 project-based \nvoucher program easier to use, we could help to overcome this \nchallenge.\n  I hope that the information that has been shared by some of my \ncolleagues has not been lost. I certainly hope that we all heard what \nCongresswoman Barbara Lee said about residents who are paying 70 \npercent of their income for housing, and it has become commonplace \naround this country for our citizens to be paying 50 percent of their \nincome for housing. This is totally unacceptable.\n  I am very pleased that we are focusing on housing. I am very pleased \nas there are certain aspects of this bill that, I think, will be very \nbeneficial to our residents and to our constituents throughout the \ncountry. I am hopeful that we will continue on this track and that this \nwon't be the last housing effort that we make that comes out of the \nFinancial Services Committee. I am very pleased to be a part of it.\n  I am proud of all of the work that has gone into this legislation. I \nam very pleased that we were able to work out any differences that we \nmay have had. I am very proud of Mr. Cleaver and of Mr. Luetkemeyer, as \nthey are two gentlemen from Missouri, for getting together to do this \nbill. It might have helped a little bit that I am from Missouri also. I \nthink this bill is something we can all be proud of.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Williams), one of our junior members of the \ncommittee but one of the senior Members with life experience who can \nbring a lot of good discussion to this debate we are having this \nafternoon.\n  Mr. WILLIAMS. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 3700, the Housing \nOpportunity Through Modernization Act of 2015.\n  Introduced by my good friend Chairman Luetkemeyer and my friend \nCongressman Cleaver, this bipartisan piece of legislation is the first \nstep in many to help reform and modernize our outdated Federal housing \nsystem.\n  Mr. Chairman, for too long, government red tape has made many of \nthese housing programs inefficient and ineffective, hurting the very \npeople they aim to support. If signed into law, H.R. 3700 would seek to \nchange that, all the while saving taxpayer-invested money.\n  First, as mentioned, the CBO projects this bill to be a cost saver. \nWith the Federal deficit reaching almost $19 trillion, the savings in \ndiscretionary spending are a direct result of allowing local housing \nofficials and agencies to better manage their programs. Like most \nFederal programs, inefficient regulations exist that often balloon \noverall costs.\n  Additionally, as previously mentioned, for the first time in 80 years \nof public housing policy, this legislation restricts the use of already \nscarce public housing units to those who actually need them by \nestablishing an earnings cap. Eliminating Federal subsidies for over-\nincome families has always been key to this discussion. While most wait \nlists for public housing stretch into the tens of thousands, families \nwho should not receive subsidies, in fact, often do. Plain and simple, \npublic housing should be reserved for those who are most in need.\n  Finally, H.R. 3700 ensures that our veterans have fair access to HUD \nhousing and homeless assistance programs. With nearly 50,000 homeless \nvets nationwide, we can and need to do more in this area.\n  Mr. Chairman, as a member of the House Committee on Financial \nServices and of the House Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, I \nthank Chairman Luetkemeyer for his leadership on this issue over the \nlast year, as addressing housing reform is something that is not \nwithout controversy.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this measure.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I have no further requests for time \nand am prepared to close.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I would like to close by again thanking my colleagues, Mr. Cleaver \nand Mr. Luetkemeyer, for their leadership in putting together a \nbipartisan affordable housing bill that addresses so many complicated \nissues in a responsible way and brings together so many different \nstakeholders in support of this bill.\n  There is a very long list of organizations that support this bill \nthat includes tenant advocacy groups, public housing authority industry \ngroups, real estate industry groups, rural housing groups, as well as \ncommunity development organizations.\n  To name just a few, the supporters of this bill include the National \nLow Income Housing Coalition, the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, the National Housing Trust, CSH, the Council of Large \nPublic Housing Authorities, the National Association of Realtors, the \nLocal Initiatives Support Corporation, Enterprise Community Partners, \nand many more.\n  The enthusiastic support from such a broad and diverse coalition of \norganizations is indicative of the hard-fought compromises that are \nincluded in this bill. In fact, I do not know of a single organization \nthat is opposing this bill.\n  H.R. 3700 is made up of commonsense reforms that will make much-\nneeded improvements to our housing programs to make them work better \nfor both public housing agencies and the tenants they serve.\n  If this bill is enacted into law, it will make the first major \nreforms to HUD's primary rental assistance programs since 1998, and \nthat is an achievement that we can all be proud of.\n  So there is a lot at stake here. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' \non this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, can you tell me how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Marchant). The gentleman from Missouri has 7\\1/\n2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chair, I apologize to the ranking member. I do \nhave one additional speaker. If the gentlewoman is out of time, I am \nmore than willing to allow the gentlewoman to have some of our time to \nbe able to rebut in case there is something that is an issue.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from California has 5\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to speak in support of H.R. \n3700, the Housing Opportunity Through Modernization Act, sponsored by \nRepresentatives Luetkemeyer and Cleaver.\n  This extremely bipartisan bill makes a number of critical reforms to \nour Federal housing programs. These programs will streamline processes \nand create much-needed efficiencies for government and, most \nimportantly, our consumers.\n  I am happy to see the bill moving so quickly because it will solve a \nnumber of problems low-income Americans continue to face in acquiring \nsafe and affordable housing.\n  This legislation would make commonsense changes to the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development in order to lighten administrative \nburdens for housing agencies and owners to assist low-income \nindividuals and families to live in greater dignity.\n  It is very encouraging to see the bipartisan work that has been done \non this bill. I commend both Chairman Luetkemeyer and Ranking Member \nCleaver of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee. I thank Chairman \nLuetkemeyer for allowing me to speak on this bill.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of H.R. 3700.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I will just take these last few minutes that I have to say to those \npeople who live in public housing that this is an important support \neffort of government to provide public housing for those who cannot \nafford market-rate housing.\n  I have represented over the years many public housing projects in \nCalifornia. While I do not represent them\n\n[[Page H458]]\n\nall anymore, I still pay attention to public housing because I \nunderstand and know how very important it is to the lives of families \nand to the children who depend on having safe housing and affordable \nhousing for them.\n  I would simply like to say that oftentimes people who live in public \nhousing have been demonized. There are folks who think, oh, they could \ndo better if they wanted to. There are people who say that they don't \nwant to remove themselves from public housing.\n  I would like to have people know that many of the folks that I have \nknown who live in public housing work every day for minimum wages. Many \nof them are trying very hard to be independent. Many of them would like \nto have job training. Many of them would like to have more support for \nchildcare efforts. Many of them are working to get their GEDs. Many of \nthem have returned to school.\n  For the people who live in public housing, they don't need to feel \nthat somehow they are getting something they don't deserve.\n  I am proud of this government, and I am proud of this country that \nwill provide a safety net for the least of these and safe public \nhousing to those who cannot afford market-rate housing.\n  I want our Congress to continue to see how we can do a better job \neven of providing safe and secure housing for those who cannot afford \nit.\n  I want us to be able to provide additional support to those who live \nin public housing, for those who are saying to us: Help me with job \ntraining. Help me to ensure that my children can get the kind of \nsupport living in public housing that will give them access to a good \neducation. Help us to have better health care so we can be better able \nto go out and take jobs to support our families. Help us to aspire to \nmove upward and out, even. Help us to understand what is available to \nus out there. When we seek out help for our problems, don't look at us \nas if we are people who are not investing in ourselves, who are not \nrelying on our own abilities. Simply see us as Americans who would like \nto do better. See us as Americans who unfortunately find ourselves in \nsituations where we can't do better for now, but we are looking for the \nopportunity to do better and to have more and to enjoy everything that \nthis country has to offer.\n  So as we support this legislation today--and I support it--I am \noptimistic about the fact that this is going to make a lot of lives \nbetter, but I am also optimistic that this is really a beginning for \nhow we can begin to not only give support, but involve tenants in how \nthey can help to make decisions about the units that they are living in \nand how they can serve on the boards that oversee them, how they can be \na part of government, helping us to understand how we can do a better \njob with the authority that they have given us.\n  So I am very proud. I am very pleased. I thank Mr. Cleaver and Mr. \nLuetkemeyer. I thank Mr. Cleaver for telling his story about public \nhousing. I want him to know that there are any number of Members in the \nCongress of the United States who have lived in public housing or their \nfamilies, such as my family has lived in public housing.\n  I want him to know I have watched public housing that has been very \nhelpful. I have watched public housing that has provided safe, decent, \nand secure opportunities for the people who live there. But I have also \nwatched public housing when it didn't work.\n  The Pruitt-Igoe in St. Louis, Missouri, was an example of what didn't \nwork. I was in that city when it was torn down. The space that it \noccupied is still vacant in that city. It should be a space where we \nhad additional public housing that would support the families who so \ndesperately need it.\n  So I don't take this bill lightly. I don't think about this as just \nanother piece of legislation that we happen to get passed here in \nCongress, even with bipartisan support.\n  I think of this as an important step and a statement, a statement \nthat says both sides of the aisle understand housing, both sides of the \naisle would like to continue to do the best job that they can do to \nprovide safe and secure housing, and that we are not going to stand by \nand watch homelessness continue to grow.\n  It was mentioned several times throughout this debate--maybe here \ntoday and when we were in committee--that, in Los Angeles County, \nhomelessness has increased by 20 percent. People are sleeping on the \nsidewalks all the way up to city hall. We cannot abide that. We cannot \nstand by and watch that happen.\n  While I am pointing to Los Angeles County, there are many areas all \nacross this Nation where homelessness is shameful and unconscionable. I \nam very pleased and proud that we are sending a signal here today that \nwe won't stand for it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to close with a few remarks here. It won't take very long.\n  I think you can see that this is a very important and, also, very \nemotional issue for many, many people and it is extremely important for \nthose folks who are in and around and utilize public housing.\n  In putting this bill together, we tried to listen to all the \ndifferent parties as well as both sides of the aisle and address all \nthe concerns that everybody had. We have a few amendments to go here, \nbut I think we are going to work through those pretty quickly.\n  I think you can see from the support that we have seen on both sides \nof the aisle today, from the discussions we have had that we have come \nto an agreement on what is in the provisions of this bill.\n  You have here a whole list of 30 different letters of support from \ndifferent groups from around the country that represent all the \ndifferent groups, from leased housing to housing authorities, to \ninvestment individuals, to Realtors, to you name it.\n  We have yet to receive a single letter against this proposal. So I \nthink you can see that we managed to find the right balance with the \nbill, to find the middle ground where we can all agree that we can \naccept the provisions that we have.\n  In the bill, we have done things with flexibility that people within \nthe different housing authorities have asked for who manage these \nthings to be able to do things more efficiently, more effectively.\n  We got rid of duplicative rules. We built the condos up so they could \nnow be part of the program. We have cut the costs not by cutting \nprograms, but by cutting out the waste and the duplicative rules and \nhave given flexibility to those groups that need it to be able to do \nthe job.\n  Is this an end-all, be-all? No. We have a lot more to do. We \nrecognize that. This is a good first step. We believe that we need to \nbe empowering people and enabling people to be able to do better and \nhelp themselves. We believe that, when it comes to housing, it is not \njust a place to live, but people need to have a place to have a life.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CAPUANO. Mr. Chair, I have a question for the bill's managers \nregarding the project-based voucher provisions. The bill generally \nlimits a public housing agency's use of voucher funds for project-based \nvouchers to 20 percent of the authorized voucher units for the agency, \nbut contains an exception among others providing that units of project-\nbased assistance that are attached to units previously receiving \nanother type of long-term subsidy provided by HUD will not count \nagainst this limitation.\n  We have an exciting initiative in Boston that would replace our 75-\nyear-old Charlestown public housing development with a substantially \nlarger, new construction mixed-income community on the same site. The \npublic housing units are to be fully replaced with project-based \nvouchers. This will require a large commitment of project-based \nvouchers by the Boston Housing Authority, which would reduce the BHA's \nflexibility to commit project-based vouchers elsewhere as needed if the \nCharlestown commitment is not covered by the exception. Is it the \nintention of the bill's managers that the commitment of project-based \nvouchers to replace the former public housing units in a newly \nconstructed development such as this would fall within the bill's \nexception for units attached to units previously receiving another type \nof long-term HUD subsidy?\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chair, Congressman Capuano has asked whether it \nis the intention of the bill's managers that the commitment of project-\nbased vouchers to replace the former public housing units in a newly \nconstructed development such as one he described in Boston would fall \nwithin the bill's exception for units attached to units previously\n\n[[Page H459]]\n\nreceiving another type of long-term HUD subsidy. The answer is yes. It \nis the managers' intention that the replacement units for the current \npublic housing units would be covered by the bill's exception for units \npreviously receiving long-term HUD assistance, and thus that commitment \nof project-based vouchers to such units would not count against the 20 \npercent limitation.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Financial Services, printed in the bill, it shall be \nin order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute \nconsisting of the text of Rules Committee print 114-42.

INSPECTION OF DWELLING UNITS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 8(o)(8) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(8)) is amended--\n       (1) by striking subparagraph (A) and inserting the \n     following new subparagraph:\n       ``(A) Initial inspection.--\n       ``(i) In general.--For each dwelling unit for which a \n     housing assistance payment contract is established under this \n     subsection, the public housing agency (or other entity \n     pursuant to paragraph (11)) shall inspect the unit before any \n     assistance payment is made to determine whether the dwelling \n     unit meets the housing quality standards under subparagraph \n     (B), except as provided in clause (ii) or (iii) of this \n     subparagraph.\n       ``(ii) Correction of non-life-threatening conditions.--In \n     the case of any dwelling unit that is determined, pursuant to \n     an inspection under clause (i), not to meet the housing \n     quality standards under subparagraph (B), assistance payments \n     may be made for the unit notwithstanding subparagraph (C) if \n     failure to meet such standards is a result only of non-life-\n     threatening conditions, as such conditions are established by \n     the Secretary. A public housing agency making assistance \n     payments pursuant to this clause for a dwelling unit shall, \n     30 days after the beginning of the period for which such \n     payments are made, withhold any assistance payments for the \n     unit if any deficiency resulting in noncompliance with the \n     housing quality standards has not been corrected by such \n     time. The public housing agency shall recommence assistance \n     payments when such deficiency has been corrected, and may use \n     any payments withheld to make assistance payments relating to \n     the period during which payments were withheld.\n       ``(iii) Use of alternative inspection method for interim \n     period.--In the case of any property that within the previous \n     24 months has met the requirements of an inspection that \n     qualifies as an alternative inspection method pursuant to \n     subparagraph (E), a public housing agency may authorize \n     occupancy before the inspection under clause (i) has been \n     completed, and may make assistance payments retroactive to \n     the beginning of the lease term after the unit has been \n     determined pursuant to an inspection under clause (i) to meet \n     the housing quality standards under subparagraph (B). This \n     clause may not be construed to exempt any dwelling unit from \n     compliance with the requirements of subparagraph (D).'';\n       (2) by redesignating subparagraph (G) as subparagraph (H); \n     and\n       (3) by inserting after subparagraph (F) the following new \n     subparagraph:\n       ``(G) Enforcement of housing quality standards.--\n       ``(i) Determination of noncompliance.--A dwelling unit that \n     is covered by a housing assistance payments contract under \n     this subsection shall be considered, for purposes of \n     subparagraphs (D) and (F), to be in noncompliance with the \n     housing quality standards under subparagraph (B) if--\n\n       ``(I) the public housing agency or an inspector authorized \n     by the State or unit of local government determines upon \n     inspection of the unit that the unit fails to comply with \n     such standards;\n       ``(II) the agency or inspector notifies the owner of the \n     unit in writing of such failure to comply; and\n       ``(III) the failure to comply is not corrected--\n\n       ``(aa) in the case of any such failure that is a result of \n     life-threatening conditions, within 24 hours after such \n     notice has been provided; and\n       ``(bb) in the case of any such failure that is a result of \n     non-life-threatening conditions, within 30 days after such \n     notice has been provided or such other reasonable longer \n     period as the public housing agency may establish.\n       ``(ii) Withholding of assistance amounts during \n     correction.--The public housing agency may withhold \n     assistance amounts under this subsection with respect to a \n     dwelling unit for which a notice pursuant to clause (i)(II), \n     of failure to comply with housing quality standards under \n     subparagraph (B) as determined pursuant to an inspection \n     conducted under subparagraph (D) or (F), has been provided. \n     If the unit is brought into compliance with such housing \n     quality standards during the periods referred to in clause \n     (i)(III), the public housing agency shall recommence \n     assistance payments and may use any amounts withheld during \n     the correction period to make assistance payments relating to \n     the period during which payments were withheld.\n       ``(iii) Abatement of assistance amounts.--The public \n     housing agency shall abate all of the assistance amounts \n     under this subsection with respect to a dwelling unit that is \n     determined, pursuant to clause (i) of this subparagraph, to \n     be in noncompliance with housing quality standards under \n     subparagraph (B).

Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Buchanan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to first thank the subcommittee chair of Financial \nServices, Mr. Luetkemeyer, for his leadership on such important issues.\n  As chairman of the Human Resources Subcommittee of Ways and Means, I \nhave the distinct privilege of overseeing a number of means-tested \nprograms aimed at providing low-income individuals and families an \nopportunity to move up the economic ladder.\n  There are a lot of lessons we have learned, and we should be using \nthem to better serve recipients and taxpayers.\n  In June of last year, the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment's Office of Inspector General found that the Federal \nGovernment paid public housing benefits to families with excessive \nincome and assets when those benefits should have gone to low-income \nfamilies in real need.\n  This amendment builds on reforms made by the underlying bill. This \namendment reduces that burden on families by using systems they are \nmost likely already interacting with for other means-tested programs. \nIt also improves accuracy for housing authorities and landlords, \nproviding them with more timely and reliable information.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Ultimately, it ensures that those with assets well above the \neligibility limits will not be using benefits directed to those \nAmericans who need the most help.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment and support \nthe underlying bill.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto this amendment. I have concerns that there are a lot of unanswered \nquestions regarding the new income verification system that is being \nproposed in this amendment, and I think it needs to be addressed.\n  First, it appears that there would be a cost associated with this \namendment. Housing authorities would have to spend some of their \noperating fund dollars to comply with the new requirements in this \namendment, and that takes away from other important things that they \nmust prioritize.\n  It is important to note that the public housing operating fund and \nadministrative fees are severely underfunded, so public housing \nauthorities are already struggling to make ends meet. H.R. 3700 is \nintended to ease administrative burdens, but this amendment seems to be \nincreasing burdens without any additional funding. In other words, it \nis an unfunded mandate.\n  Secondly, it is unclear whether all housing authorities have the \nelectronic infrastructure in place to securely maintain and protect \nresidents' personal financial data, which could include bank account \ninformation, in a manner that is inconsistent with what current \nfinancial regulators have. If housing authorities need to upgrade their \nsystems, that would also cost money that is not provided for in this \namendment.\n  Third, it is not clear how this amendment would work for residents \nwho are unbanked. This amendment virtually ignores millions of \nAmericans that are unbanked.\n  Fourth, this amendment seems to be addressing a problem that doesn't \nexist because I have not seen any evidence that residents are currently \nnot providing accurate information when applying for housing \nassistance.\n  Lastly, H.R. 3700 already includes a provision to address over-income \nhouseholds in public housing to help ensure that taxpayers are not \nsubsidizing these households. For every piece of legislation that we \npass, it should be carefully considered, which is why we should not \nadopt this hasty amendment that has not been thoroughly studied by \ncongressional staff or our housing groups, the administration, and \ncarefully negotiated by both parties.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, let me just say this: We have a good bill \nhere. We have gone a long way in dealing with whatever concerns either \nside may have. We have a compromise piece of legislation. We have a \nconsensus piece of legislation. Let's not mess it up. We don't need \nthis amendment. I would ask for a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer).\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, I would just like to speak in support \nof the amendment.\n  I believe the amendment reduces the burden on families for using \nsolutions that already are likely to be in place with regards to \ninteracting through other means testing programs. I think it improves \nthe efficiency for public housing authorities and landlords, providing \nmore accurate and timely eligibility information. It minimizes the risk \nof waste, fraud, and abuse of tax dollars and ensures limited resources \nare better targeted to families in need by requiring public housing \nagencies to access data used by other means tested programs or by \nassets.\n  This amendment further strengthens the response to the 2015 inspector \ngeneral's audit, which revealed individuals with substantial assets \nwere receiving rental subsidies. This amendment builds on the progress \nmade by the Committee on Financial Services to better target housing \nassistance to the needs of low-income individuals and families.\n  The current system in determining eligibility for rental subsidies is \nburdensome to program recipients to report income that can vary as much \nas every week and time consuming for public housing agencies and \nlandlords to collect and verify this information, unfair to taxpayers \nwho expect tax dollars to be targeted to families most in need.\n  I think you can see what I believe is an asset here from the \nstandpoint it is going to streamline the system. It is going to save \nmoney. I think it makes it easier for the people to access, it is going \nto make it easier for the individuals who are working with those folks \nto be able to do a better job of getting and accumulating the \ninformation as quickly as possible to better ferret out the ones who \nneed the help and ones who don't, and therefore do a good job of \nmanaging our taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, I \nbasically made an appeal to my Republican colleagues to reject this \namendment. I basically talked about the fact that we\n\n[[Page H467]]\n\nhave gone a long way toward reconciling our differences and that we \ndon't need to endanger the bill at all with an amendment like this.\n  I am not sure exactly what the gentleman is attempting to do. We \nalready have systems in existence by which those who wish to live in \npublic housing have to verify their income. I don't know what is being \nattempted here. If the attempt is to try and go to financial \ninstitutions and say to them, is it true that this person only has $5 \nin their bank account or what have you? I am not sure that the housing \nauthority would want to assume that additional responsibility and that \nadditional cost, so I have to continue to oppose this amendment. \nPerhaps there is a better explanation than I have heard, but I have not \nheard a good explanation about why we should adopt it.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BUCHANAN. Mr. Chair, my understanding is PHAs asked for this, but \nlet me just say my amendment will reduce the burdens on families by \nusing solutions they are already interacting with through other means-\ntested programs.\n  I encourage all my colleagues to support this amendment and to \nsupport the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased that the \ngentleman talked about having talked with the public housing \nauthorities because we did, too, and they had no idea what your bill \nis. They didn't know anything about it, they didn't understand why it \nwas being done, so we have a difference of opinion, I suppose, about \nwhat the public housing authorities are saying.\n  I am saying that based on our inquiries, they did not support your \nlegislation because they didn't understand it. They didn't know it \nexists. They didn't know what it was all about.\n  I would, again, ask for a ``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Buchanan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n       Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Maxine Waters of California\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike line 17 on page 20 and all that follows through page \n     21, line 10, and insert the following:\n       ``(B) Minors, students, and persons with disabilities.--\n     $480 for each member of the family residing in the household \n     (other than the head of the household or his or her spouse) \n     who is less than 18 years of age or is attending school or \n     vocational training on a full-time basis, or who is 18 years \n     of age or older and is a person with disabilities.\n       ``(C) Child care.--Any reasonable child care expenses \n     necessary to enable a member of the family to be employed or \n     to further his or her education.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentlewoman \nfrom California (Ms. Maxine Waters) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would \nremove the harmful provision in H.R. 3700 that would effectively raise \nrent for thousands of families with children who are living in HUD-\nassisted housing by limiting the amount they can deduct from their \nincome for childcare expenses. These are parents, particularly single \nparents, who are already struggling to pay for the cost of child care \nin order to work or to go to school.\n  I believe we should not be crippling their ability to juggle these \nresponsibilities. We should be supporting them. I believe that my \nRepublican colleagues share my concerns. We simply did not have the \ndata that we needed at the markup to truly understand how this \nprovision would affect these households.\n  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the Republicans have \nindicated that they will support this amendment, which will remove this \nharmful language and preserve the current law. This will ensure that \nfamilies with children will not be burdened with a rent increase as a \nresult of this bill.\n  I would like to thank my colleagues across the aisle for working with \nme on this issue to find common ground.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, if nothing else, I would just like to \nthrow the ranking member a curve ball and actually accept one of her \namendments, just to show that minor miracles can still occur within the \nHalls of Congress and on the floor of the United States House of \nRepresentatives. Particularly after a very robust debate this morning \non the budget views and estimates, this might be a welcome departure.\n  Anyway, I am prepared to accept the ranking member's amendment. \nAgain, as she said, H.R. 3700 will allow only families to deduct \nchildcare expenses that exceed 5 percent. The ranking member's \namendment would revert back to current law. I think that in this \nparticular case there are some trade-offs to be made, and I am willing \nto accept this particular trade-off and work with the ranking member to \nforward the overall bill.\n  I urge all Members to accept it and vote for it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Velazquez), the ranking member of \nthe Committee on Small Business and a member of the Committee on \nFinancial Services.\n  Ms. VELAZQUEZ. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the \ngentlewoman from California's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, in New York City access to safe and affordable housing \nis a critical issue. Just in Brooklyn, the city's housing shortage has \ndriven rents to over $2,500 a month for a 1-bedroom apartment. As a \nresult, a majority of households spend more than 30 percent of their \nincome on housing, making these individuals and families rent burdened.\n  For this reason, the New York City Housing Authority, the Nation's \nlargest public housing authority, provides a home to more than 4,000 \nNew Yorkers. Unfortunately, tens of thousands of families remain on \nwaiting lists for units.\n  Congress cannot dictate market rents, but we can change Federal \nprograms empowering public housing authorities to address budgetary \nshortfalls, adapt to changing conditions, and better assist current and \nprospective tenants. That is why we provided the Secretary the ability \nto adjust the over-income threshold for public housing tenancy, to \nassist those tenants and families living in public housing where rents \nand incomes are well above average, like New York.\n  While this bill makes several reforms like these to public housing \nand Section 8 rental assistance, many of which are bipartisan and have \nbeen discussed for years, I am concerned about the bill's impact on \nfamilies with children.\n  According to a recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy \nPriorities, H.R. 3700's changes to the childcare deduction could cost \n52,000 families with children to face a rent increase of $25 or more. \nMore than half the families affected are extremely low income and would \nbe hard pressed to afford such an increase. Mr. Chair, $25, $50, or $75 \nmight not sound like a lot of money for us, but for low-income families \nthat have to struggle every day, this is a lot of money.\n  While updating and improving our Nation's rental assistance and \npublic housing programs are important goals--one I will continue \nfighting for--they cannot be accomplished on the backs of the Nation's \nchildren.\n  I, therefore, urge adoption of the gentlewoman's amendment, which \nwill\n\n[[Page H468]]\n\nstrike the burdensome childcare deduction language.\n  I am very impressed with the chairman today. I hope that from now on \nwe can work in a bipartisan, humane way to address the issues of the \nshortage of housing in our Nation. I congratulate the ranking member.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I would simply thank \nall of the Members who have worked on this bill, and I thank all of the \nsupport that I am getting for this amendment.\n  I want to thank the chairman. Despite the fact he had a rather \ndifficult time on committee today, he conducted himself rather well, \nand I enjoyed working with him. I am very thankful that he is here to \ngive support on this amendment and the leadership he has given.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n\n            Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. Sewell of Alabama\n\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Poe of Texas). It is now in order to consider \namendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114-411.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 26, after line 3, insert the following new subsection:\n       (h) Study on Impact on Elderly and Disabled Families of \n     Decreased Deductions in Income.--\n       (1) Study.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     shall conduct a study to determine the impacts, on rents paid \n     by elderly and disabled individuals and families assisted \n     under the section 8 rental assistance and public housing \n     programs under the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437 et seq), of any decreases in the amounts of any \n     deductions from income (for purposes of section 3(b) of such \n     Act (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b))), as compared to such deductions \n     under such section 3(b) as in effect before the effectiveness \n     of this section, resulting from the amendments made by this \n     section.\n       (2) Report.--The Secretary shall submit to the Congress a \n     report setting forth the results of the study conducted \n     pursuant to paragraph (1) not later than the expiration of \n     the 12-month period beginning on the date of the enactment of \n     this Act.\n       (3) Effective date.--Notwithstanding subsection (h) of this \n     section, this subsection shall take effect on the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentlewoman \nfrom Alabama (Ms. Sewell) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Alabama.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of my \namendment to H.R. 3700.\n  My amendment is commonsense and straightforward. It simply requires \nthe Secretary of HUD to conduct a study to determine the impact of the \ndecreased deductions on rent paid by elderly, disabled individuals, and \nfamilies assisted under the Section 8 rental assistance and housing \nprograms.\n  Being able to assess quality, safe, and affordable housing is \ncritically important to all Americans. The Section 8 voucher program \nand other rental assistance programs play a vital role in providing \nthis type of housing for our Nation's most vulnerable citizens, \nincluding seniors, disabled persons, and low-income families. In fact, \nnearly all of the households currently under HUD rental assistance \ninclude children, the elderly, or disabled individuals.\n  These rental assistance programs house over 10 million individuals in \nroughly 4.6 million rental units across the country. It is clear that \nthese voucher and rental assistance programs continue to perform the \ntask for which they were created, which is providing shelter for \nmillions of Americans.\n  In spite of its enormous success, the Section 8 voucher program, \narguably, still suffers under the weight of too many inefficient and \nduplicative requirements that threaten the overall effectiveness of the \nprogram.\n  As drafted, H.R. 3700 takes major bipartisan steps toward helping \npreserve our scarce housing resources while expanding housing \navailability. However, as we attempt to reform these programs, we must \nbe mindful and ever diligent in ensuring that the proposed changes are \nbeneficial to their overall implementation and that there are no \nnegative, unintended consequences on the program's participants. To \nthat end, my amendment allows us to gauge the effectiveness of some of \nthe changes being made here today and their impact on the most \nvulnerable segments of our population: the elderly and disabled.\n  We all know that no program is perfect. We must work together to \nstrike a delicate balance and ensure programs are both workable and do \nwhat they intend to do without adverse impacts on those who are greatly \nbenefited by them. I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for her \namendment. It is a bipartisan amendment. She makes some good points. We \nare happy to accept it.\n  As long as I am here, I would like to point out to the distinguished \nranking member that anytime my side wins all the votes, I am not having \na tough day. I am having a really good day.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. I thank the chairman for accepting my \namendment. I think that all Americans win when we act in a bipartisan \nmanner.

Mr. Chairman, today I rise to offer an amendment to \nH.R. 3700, entitled, the Housing Opportunities Through Modernization \nAct of 2015.\n  I want to thank Mr. Luetkemeyer for his hard work on this bill and \nfor the bipartisan and collaborative way in which he went about this \nimportant housing reform. I also wish to thank\n\n[[Page H469]]\n\nthe ranking member, Ms. Maxine Waters of California, for her hard work \nand for always looking out for those most needy in our society and for \nworking to improve this bill.\n  My amendment would authorize a nominal user fee on lenders accessing \nthe underwriting systems for the Section 502 Single Family Housing \nGuaranteed Loan Program. This fee would not exceed $50 per loan and \nwould enable the United States Department of Agriculture to make much-\nneeded upgrades to their automated underwriting system in order to \nmatch industry standards.\n  Mr. Chairman, I believe that access to safe, decent, and affordable \nhousing can transform lives. Federal programs like the Section 502 \nSingle Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program play a critical role in \nexpanding home ownership and opportunity for our rural communities. \nThis Federal program has helped over 2 million families build wealth \nthrough the equity in their home and encourages lenders to provide \nloans to those who cannot usually obtain conventional financing.\n  Through this program, lenders are enabled and encouraged to serve \nborrowers they might typically reject without the guarantee, increasing \nborrowers' access to home ownership opportunities. We owe it to our \nrural communities to provide the Section 502 program with the resources \nit needs to modernize and to continue expanding home ownership and \nopportunity in our most underserved rural communities.\n  The Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program relies on the \nGuaranteed Underwriting System for determining loan approvals quickly \nand accurately. Unfortunately, the current system is in need of \nsubstantial technological improvements in order to process risk \nrequests more efficiently. Guaranteed Underwriting System development \nis necessary for sound portfolio risk management and will benefit USDA \nfield staff, rural borrowers, and private sector lenders alike.\n  My amendment will cover the cost of developing and maintaining the \nGuaranteed Underwriting System and enable the Single Family Housing \nGuaranteed Loan Program to be administered in a more effective manner, \ndespite recent staffing reductions.\n  The nominal fee authorized by my amendment will be used to enhance \nand maintain the Guaranteed Underwriting System and bring it into the \n21st century. It is expected that a fee ranging between $25 and $50 \nwill generate approximately $4 million a year, starting in 2018. The \nfee will support important program improvements, including the \ndelegation of underwriting to preferred lenders.\n  The fee will also develop the underwriting system's technological \ncapabilities to current standards, including enhanced loan and lender \noversight, metrics, and programatic controls. This efficiency upgrade \nwill allow USDA staff to allocate the necessary time and resources to \nthe most complex underwriting decisions.\n  Finally, Congress has long invested in making rural home ownership a \nreality. The Section 502 Single Family Housing Guaranteed Loan Program \nreceives $24 billion a year and has helped millions of families reach \nthe dream of home ownership.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment supports the USDA fiscal year 2016 budget \nrequest and is supported by prominent rural housing advocacy groups \nsuch as the National Rural Housing Coalition and the Housing Assistance \nCouncil. I urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support \nthis amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the amendment of \nthe gentleman from Texas. I thank him for his leadership in this area \nof rural housing. I think it plays a role in helping develop a more \nmodern and efficient management and underwriting system to assess \nmortgage credit risk, prevent foreclosures, and manage a billion-dollar \nportfolio.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment and a bipartisan bill. We are happy to \naccept it. I urge Members to adopt it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Hinojosa).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 6 Offered by Ms. Meng\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 55, after line 11, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 111. PUBLIC HOUSING HEATING GUIDELINES.\n\n       Section 9 of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437g), as amended by the preceding provisions of this \n     Act, is further amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subsection:\n       ``(o) Public Housing Heating Guidelines.--The Secretary \n     shall publish model guidelines for minimum heating \n     requirements for public housing dwelling units operated by \n     public housing agencies receiving assistance under this \n     section.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Meng) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from New York.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chair, this amendment would require HUD to publish \nmodel guidelines for minimum heating requirements for public housing \nunits.\n  Unfortunately, Mr. Chair, some public housing agencies across this \ncountry have struggled with the fundamental task of providing adequate \nhousing and heating to low-income residents.\n  Less than 2 months ago, the New York Daily News and Reuters published \na series of articles about tenants at the Frederick Douglass Houses in \nNew York City, complaining that they were without heat for several \nfrigid evenings in a row.\n  In response to these complaints, New York City public advocate \nLetitia James and Legal Services New York City filed a lawsuit on \nbehalf of the tenants, and in their filing they quote a November 25 \nemail from Robert Knapp, head of the New York City Housing Authority's \nheating management services unit, stating:\n\n       NYCHA official policy . . . is heat shut off between 10 \n     p.m. and 5 a.m. when the outside temperatures are above 20 \n     degrees. When the outside temperature falls below 20 degrees, \n     heat is given through the night.\n\n  Frankly, this is appalling.\n  Many Democratic Representatives from New York City agreed with me, \nand that is why we submitted a letter, led by my good friends and \ncolleagues, Representatives Engel and Rangel, to the head of NYCHA, \nurging it to completely abandon the current heating policy. That letter \nwas submitted to NYCHA--the largest housing agency in the country, \noverseeing more than 400,000 residents living in 2,500 buildings--more \nthan a month ago, and we have yet to receive a response. That is why I \nhave come to the floor today.\n  While it is not in our authority to mandate what a building's heating \nrequirements should be in any particular city across this vast country, \nclearly some help is needed. Apparently, some local agencies might need \nofficial guidance from HUD outlining the fact that it is a good idea to \nturn the heat on at night when the temperature outside is below \nfreezing.\n  I was hopeful things would not come to this point, but right now, in \nthe middle of winter, when almost one in five public housing residents \nin my city are age 62 or older, and more than a quarter of them are \nchildren under the age of 18, I feel that this matter could ultimately \nbe one of life or death.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  We do not want to return to an age in which tenants of local public \nhousing authorities are forced to revert to heating their homes with \nstoves.\n  Many of us here are all too familiar with the unfortunate tragedies \nthat occur as a result of that practice and the fires that can also \noccur when residents are forced to rely on individual space heaters.\n  For not only the safety of public housing residents across America, \nbut\n\n[[Page H470]]\n\nalso their humanity, heating standards must be improved.\n  It is my hope that this amendment today, which mandates that HUD \nproduce model heating guidelines, will assist in this endeavor. It is \nalso my hope that all of my colleagues will support this effort.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to this amendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I listened very carefully to the \ngentlewoman's comments on the floor. I am prepared to accept the \namendment. She makes some reasonable arguments. I urge its adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MENG. I thank the Chairman for his support.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. MENG. I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me. \nI certainly support what she is trying to do.\n  Last December it came to light that the New York City Housing \nAuthority, NYCHA, has as recently as 2013 shut down boilers in public \nhousing properties unless outside temperatures drop below 25 degrees. \nThis forces residents to go without heat during the coldest months of \nthe year.\n  I grew up in affordable housing. I grew up in city housing. So I am \nparticularly sensitive to everything that the New York City Housing \nAuthority does.\n  I was outraged by this revelation. More than 400,000 New Yorkers live \nin NYCHA buildings, and, what's more, more than half of these residents \nlive below the poverty line.\n  These New Yorkers, along with every American living in public \nhousing, pay rent and, in return, depend on Housing Authority \nleadership to fulfill the very reasonable need, a safe and decent \nshelter.\n  A practice that forces tenants to grapple with bitter temperatures \njust doesn't fail to meet that need, it is reckless and demeaning.\n  Myself, Ms. Meng, and eight other members of the New York City \ndelegation sent a letter to the New York City Housing Authority asking \nthat they immediately issue guidance condemning this practice and make \ncertain that none of their buildings continue to adhere to this \noutrageous policy.\n  It is important, though, that no American living in public housing be \nforced to suffer through the winter months, and that is exactly what \nthis amendment will prevent by requiring the Secretary of Housing and \nUrban Development to issue guidelines on minimum heating requirements.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote for this and ensure that public housing \nresidents' health and safety are protected.\n  I want to thank my colleague from New York (Ms. Meng) for partnering \nwith me on this important issue, and I thank her for her leadership.\n  Ms. MENG. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Mississippi.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Chairman, today's bill to improve public housing is \na strong step in streamlining a massive Federal program. I want to \nthank Chairman Hensarling for allowing us to have this debate.\n  As a former public housing authority executive, I know all too well \nhow important it is to balance financial and managerial responsibility \nand oversight while, at the same time, ensuring residents' needs are \nmet.\n  This amendment is simple and addresses an outdated and misinformed \nstatute in the United States Housing Act that requires the membership \nof directors of a public housing agency contain one member who is \ndirectly assisted by the agency.\n  Opposition to this rule is not new. When HUD proposed these rules in \n1999, PHAs across the United States issued statements of opposition.\n  Some would argue that requiring resident members to serve on the \nboard is a blatant conflict of interest, as he or she would be making \ndecisions that financially impact his or her family and their well-\nbeing. While I agree, I am not here to debate that today.\n  This amendment addresses only the PHAs in three States and one \ncounty. This is because, in our respective State constitutions, there \nare provisions that expressly oppose the idea of a board member of any \ngroup receiving benefits from the very agency upon which he or she \nserves.\n  This amendment does not rob the residents in specified areas of a \nvoice in the affairs of their housing. In fact, it is a Federal \nrequirement that each PHA have a resident advisory board comprised of \nat least one resident who serves as a liaison between the PHA and \nhousing residents. I speak from experience when I say that their input \nis always acknowledged and much appreciated.\n  This commonsense provision is usually passed through the \nappropriations process, as it has been for decades. My amendment simply \nmakes it permanent. I encourage adoption of this commonsense provision.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition \nto this amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H471]]\n\n  \n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chairman and Members, I have \nserious concerns about providing a permanent exemption for the listed \nentities from existing requirements that each public housing authority \nmust have a resident commissioner serve on the governing board.\n  In 1998, Congress passed this requirement into law in recognition of \nthe need for the perspective and participation of tenants in the \ngovernance of public housing authorities. To this day, this requirement \nhelps to ensure that residents are included in board-level \ndecisionmaking.\n  However, in appropriations bills over the last decade, four entities \nhave received an exemption from this requirement so long as they \nmaintain a separate advisory board with at least six residents of \npublic or assisted housing.\n  The Housing Authority of the County of Los Angeles is one of the four \nentities that received this exemption. However, last year I learned \nthat HACOLA was not in compliance with the part of the exemption that \nrequires that they maintain an advisory board of at least six \nresidents, and this noncompliance had been going on for many years.\n  HACOLA's noncompliance resulted in a lack of meaningful engagement by \nresidents on important policy issues affecting programs that HACOLA \nadministers.\n  I successfully offered an amendment in the funding year 2016 housing \nfunding bill to strike HACOLA's exemption. While this amendment was \nultimately not included in the final omnibus, it did put Congress, HUD, \nand the Housing Authority on notice that failure to comply with this \nimportant law is simply unacceptable.\n  This demonstrates that we need to be extremely careful when providing \nexemptions for a requirement as important as this one. The exemption \nfor HACOLA and others was intended to provide them with special \naccommodations while still ensuring meaningful tenant engagement. But \nHACOLA's behavior displayed blatant disregard for the law and the \nintent behind the law.\n  That is why I do not believe that we should be making this exemption \npermanent. Instead, I think we should be thinking about ways to enhance \ncompliance with the existing exemption requirements.\n  For these reasons, of course I am going to urge my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman and Members, it is just inconceivable that we don't \nunderstand that, if you want to not only educate tenants, but want to \ninvolve tenants in decisionmaking and help them to understand how \ndemocracy works and help them to understand the rules of public housing \nand what can and cannot be done and why these rules are adopted--if we \ndon't understand that, we don't understand anything.\n  It is inconceivable to me that we would simply say that we do not \nwant just one commissioner, one resident, to be a part of the governing \nboard, and it is inconceivable to me that we don't understand that we \nallow for exemptions to say: Okay. If you don't want just one \ncommissioner to serve on the board with you, we will allow you to have \nan advisory board of six residents that could involve themselves in the \ndecisions that are made by the governing board.\n  I talk about this importance because I think it is so important, as \nwe engage and lift people out of poverty, that they understand the \nrules of the game. The only way you get to understand the rules of the \ngame is if you get to play. You get to understand how decisions are \nmade. You get to understand what the rules are and how government \nworks. To exclude them does not make good sense to me.\n  Now, I know why my own county would like to have this done. They \nwould like to have this done because--guess what. We discovered that \nthey were trying to sell off 241 units of Section 8-type housing at the \nsame time that they were providing the museum with over $120 million, \nand they said they could not afford the upkeep of those units.\n  They didn't like it that we went out and talked with the residents. I \nwent out to the homes and I said: Did you know that these units are \nabout to be sold? Do you know what is going to happen to you and why \nthe county is giving up these units?\n  No. They didn't know. They didn't have a clue because they didn't \nhave proper notification. They didn't have one resident that served on \nthe governing board. They didn't have an advisory committee, even \nthough L.A. County had gotten an exemption. They refused to even comply \nwith the exemption to simply have an advisory board.\n  This is not right. This does not make good sense. I don't know why \nyou would support something like this. I urge a ``no'' vote on this \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Chair, I want to thank my colleague for expressing \nsome good points. This amendment actually continues to allow residents \nof housing authorities to have a strong voice.\n  It monitors the situation not just in our housing authorities that we \nare trying to exempt under States where their constitution prohibits \nboard members from being able to sit on boards where they have a \nmonetary or fiscal interest in that. It is a huge conflict of interest.\n  We are not going after all 2,700-plus public housing authorities. We \nare just trying to make sure the States that have constitutions \nprohibiting such blatant disregard to common sense and having that \nconflict of interest are protected.\n  Apparently, there is a personal interest in the one jurisdiction. \nHopefully, when my amendment is adopted, if we are going through the \nconference process with the Senate, we can work with my colleague to \nmake sure that her State HA that she is referencing is taken care of.\n  But, again, my amendment I think adds more voices to the governing \nprocess for them to know what is going on in their local housing \nauthority.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Palazzo).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

USE OF VOUCHERS FOR MANUFACTURED HOUSING.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 8(o)(12) of the United States \n     Housing Act of 1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437f(o)(12)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (A), by striking the period at the end \n     of the first sentence and all that follows through ``of'' in \n     the second sentence and inserting ``and rents' '''; and\n       (2) in subparagraph (B)--\n       (A) in clause (i), by striking ``the rent'' and all that \n     follows and inserting the following: ``rent shall mean the \n     sum of the monthly payments made by a family assisted under \n     this paragraph to amortize the cost of purchasing the \n     manufactured home, including any required insurance and \n     property taxes, the monthly amount allowed for tenant-paid \n     utilities, and the monthly rent charged for the real property \n     on which the manufactured home is located, including monthly \n     management and maintenance charges.'';\n       (B) by striking clause (ii); and\n       (C) in clause (iii)--\n       (i) by inserting after the period at the end the following: \n     ``If the amount of the monthly assistance payment for a \n     family exceeds the monthly rent charged for the real property \n     on which the manufactured home is located, including monthly \n     management and maintenance charges, a public housing agency \n     may pay the remainder to the family, lender or utility \n     company, or may choose to make a single payment to the family \n     for the entire monthly assistance amount.''; and\n       (ii) by redesignating such clause as clause (ii).\n       (b) Effective Date.--The Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development shall issue notice to implement the amendments \n     made by subsection (a) and such amendments shall take effect \n     upon such issuance.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom Vermont (Mr. Welch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n\n[[Page H472]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Vermont.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, first of all, I am a strong supporter of the \ngood work that is represented in H.R. 3700, and I congratulate Chairman \nLuetkemeyer and Ranking Member Cleaver for their hard work on this, as \nwell as Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters.\n  This bill is a really solid, bipartisan improvement over the status \nquo. This amendment would extend some of the benefits of H.R. 3700 to \nfolks who live in mobile homes, and that happens to be an awful lot of \nVermonters who are working real hard trying to make ends meet. The idea \nof a bricks and sticks house is a dream for them, but they love the \nmobile home they have, and they have economic challenges in that home. \nI think that is true not just in Vermont but really across rural \nAmerica.\n  What this amendment would allow is for the Section 8 housing vouchers \nto be used for some of the obvious expenses that are associated with \nowning a mobile home, Mr. Chairman. Right now, only the land rent is \nwhat can be included in the voucher. But in addition to that, \nobviously, you have got the true cost of the mobile home that the owner \npays for the housing. In addition to the land rent underneath the home, \nmobile homeowners often pay a number of other costs, including \nutilities, insurance, and financing for their mobile homes.\n  People renting apartments where it is not a mobile home, all of those \nare factored into the rent. So what this amendment would do is allow \nthose costs to be included in the calculation for Section 8 that in our \nview put an unnecessary and unfair limitation on what can be \nconsidered. Compare that to the housing cost vouchers that individuals \nin rental units get. All of those are included in the rent.\n  So this amendment would address that issue by allowing the property \ntaxes on a mobile home, as well as insurance, utilities, and financing, \nto be included as components of the housing costs eligible for a \nvoucher.\n  It would make a huge difference in affordability for Vermonters and \nfor Americans across this country who are working hard every day and \nwhose option for safe shelter is a mobile home.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge that my colleagues support this amendment. I \nthank my colleagues for the bipartisan, solid work they have done on \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim time \nin opposition, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from \nVermont. I appreciate his amendment. I think that this helps equalize \nfor a number of Section 8 users the ability to use manufactured housing \nto help equalize this with other housing options. So I think it is an \nimportant step forward.\n  I thank the gentleman from Vermont for his leadership, and I \nrecommend Members vote for it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Chairman, I just want to thank the gentleman from \nTexas for his gracious remarks. He spent a fair amount of time in the \nGreen Mountain State, so he knows about these mobile homes.

Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment for my \nfriend, Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico.\n  As of 2014, there were over 130,000 veterans living in shelters and \ntransitional housing in the United States. About 56 percent of these \nveterans have a disability. I think we agree that that is unacceptable.\n  Since 2009, the Department of Housing and Urban Development and the \nDepartment of Veterans Affairs have made significant progress to reduce \nthe number of homeless veterans. But more must be done to get veterans \noff the streets and into permanent housing.\n  This can be seen in my home district where we have one of the largest \nhomeless populations in the country, and also perhaps the largest \npopulations of homeless veterans.\n  The underlying bill improves housing services for veterans by \ncreating a new special assistant for veterans within the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development. This new position will coordinate \nveterans' housing efforts within HUD, serve as a liaison with the VA, \nand ensure veterans have fair access to housing programs.\n  The amendment builds upon those improvements to further coordination \nbetween the VA and HUD, both of which provide a range of veteran \nhomeless services and support. The amendment requires the Special \nAssistant to work with the VA and provide recommendations to each \ndepartment and to Congress on how to improve coordination and housing \nservices for our Nation's veterans.\n  We can do much more to not only keep veterans off the streets, but to \nprovide them with the resources and support they need to have a safe, \nstable place to live and build a life after completing their service.\n  In San Diego, organizations like zero8hundred and the Veterans \nVillage of San Diego offer the kind of comprehensive transition support \nto help veterans be successful.\n  These are also the collective goals of many HUD and VA programs, \nincluding the VA's Independent Living Program, which assists veterans \nto become more independent in their homes so they never become homeless \nin the first place.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment to \nensure that HUD and VA coordinate their efforts on addressing the many \ndifferent issues and aspects associated with veteran homelessness.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, we all know on this House floor there \nis not enough we can ever do for our veterans, the brave men and women \nwho served us in uniform. I think that the author of the amendment, in \nattempting to get HUD and the VA to work more closely together to \naddress problems like veterans' homelessness, is an important thing to \ndo. I hope it has some benefit.\n  Mr. Chairman, again, I just want to accept the amendment and urge all \nMembers to adopt it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H473]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his gracious \nsupport and for his work on behalf of veterans.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 68, after line 4, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 405. REOPENING OF PUBLIC COMMENT PERIOD FOR CONTINUUM OF \n                   CARE PROGRAM REGULATIONS.\n\n       Not later than the expiration of the 30-day period \n     beginning on the date of the enactment of this Act, the \n     Secretary of Housing and Urban Development shall re-open the \n     period for public comment regarding the Secretary's interim \n     rule entitled ``Homeless Emergency Assistance and Rapid \n     Transition to Housing: Continuum of Care Program'', published \n     in the Federal Register on July 31, 2012 (77 Fed. Reg. 45422; \n     Docket No. FR-5476-I-01). Upon re-opening, such comment \n     period shall remain open for a period of not fewer than 60 \n     days.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, each Member of this body represents a \ndistrict that is affected to some degree by homelessness. We all work \ndiligently to grow the economy, create high-quality jobs, and create \nopportunity so that no one has to live on the streets. But for many in \nour districts, ending the scourge of homelessness is an ongoing battle \nthat take resources and coordination from our communities.\n  All of our districts are supported by the Continuum of Care program, \nwhich assists local leaders working diligently to distribute funding to \npublic and nonprofit institutions that shelter the homeless, set up \ntransitional housing, and provide support programs.\n  In San Diego we recently completed our Point in Time count. My office \nand other public servants counted the homeless living on the street and \nin shelters to determine how better to serve them as we work to end \nhomelessness. In 2014, this count found that San Diego had the fifth \nlargest homeless population in our country. But in that same year, our \nContinuum of Care program received the 23rd highest level of Federal \nanti-homelessness funds.\n  San Diego is not the only city that is disadvantaged by the formula \nthat is used to determine how Federal anti-homelessness funds are \ndistributed. Other western cities like Houston, Las Vegas, Seattle, San \nJose, and Denver also receive a disproportionately low amount of \nFederal resources.\n  My amendment would require the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment to reopen the public comment period on the Continuum of \nCare formula. This would allow service organizations, housing \nproviders, community faith leaders, and elected officials the \nopportunity to provide input on how HUD's limited and valuable \nresources can be most equitably and effectively used to end \nhomelessness in our country. The amendment would not change the \nformula, and it would not unfairly disadvantage the district of any \nMember of this body.\n  Since coming to Congress, I have been fighting to ensure that every \ncity receives its fair share of Federal funding to help the homeless. I \nhave corresponded with both Secretary Donovan and now-Secretary Castro \nto advocate for changes to the Continuum of Care formula and ask for a \npublic comment period. The people working on the ground to end \nhomelessness deserve the opportunity to weigh in on how this formula is \naffecting them and the work they are doing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment to \nensure we are doing all we can to end the scourge of homelessness in \nthis country.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I think the comment period does need to \nbe reopened. It is an important issue. Voices need to be heard.\n  The gentleman from California is now batting a thousand. I am not \nsure if he has any other amendments. He may be pressing his luck after \nthat.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Chairman, I am well aware of what success looks like \nin this body, and I am finished offering amendments. I want to thank \nall the people, including the ranking member and Chairman Hensarling, \nfor their hard work on this bill. This is a good piece of work.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 11 Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of the bill the following new title:\n\n   TITLE VI--FURNISHING RENT PAYMENT INFORMATION TO CREDIT REPORTING \n                                AGENCIES\n\n     SEC. 504. FURNISHING INFORMATION ABOUT RENT PAYMENTS TO A \n                   CONSUMER REPORTING AGENCY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development or any \n     other person having authorized access may furnish to a \n     consumer reporting agency (as defined in section 603 of the \n     Fair Credit Reporting Act (15 U.S.C. 1681a)) information \n     relating to the on-time performance of an individual in \n     making payments under a lease agreement with respect to a \n     dwelling unit for which any subsidy or assistance for \n     occupancy in the dwelling unit is provided under a program \n     administered by the Secretary of Housing and Urban \n     Development.\n       (b) Additional Requirements for Furnishers.--Any person who \n     furnishes such information shall--\n       (1) ensure that the payment information is reported in a \n     manner that does not by itself identify the individual as a \n     recipient of housing assistance under a program administered \n     by the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development; and\n       (2) notify the individual that such information will be \n     provided to a consumer reporting agency before providing such \n     information to a consumer reporting agency.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota (Mr. Ellison) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman, Ranking \nMember Waters, and Chair Hensarling for their leadership on the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. Chairman, too many people are excluded from the financial \nmainstream. Fifty million Americans lack a credit score. Either they \nhave no credit file at all, or they have too few trade lines to \nestablish a credit score.\n  There have been some real innovations in helping these people we call \n``credit invisibles'' to build an accurate score. FICO, which has a \nlarge presence in my State, has been a real leader in building more \ninclusive and accurate scoring methodology.\n  But credit scoring agencies cannot score information they don't have, \nand they tend to have late payment information but not on-time payment \ninformation. In other words, Mr. Chairman, if somebody doesn't pay a \nbill, probably it is scored. If they do pay it, probably it is not.\n  This is the case for HUD residents. That is why we need to make it \neasier for firms to provide customers' on-time payment data.\n  My amendment specifically aims to help some of the 3 million people \nwho live in HUD-assisted housing. By law,\n\n[[Page H474]]\n\nfamilies, people with disabilities, and the elderly who receive HUD \nassistance pay 30 percent of their income for rent. I want to see them \nget credit they deserve for paying their rent on time. These folks pay \ntheir rent on time, yet it never shows up in their FICO score.\n  Why are we not reporting their on-time rental payment? Because the \nlaw requires each tenant to provide prior written consent before having \ntheir on-time rental payment information reported, but it does not \nrequire the same information to report late payments of rent. So they \ncan get hit for late payment, no credit for on-time.\n  The prior written consent is mandated by the Privacy Act of 1974, \nwhich I believe was a well-meaning and good piece of legislation--\nexcept it needs to be updated. This piece of legislation, the Privacy \nAct of 1974, wants to protect the privacy of affordable housing \nresidents, which is good, and I support that. But in this case, it is \ncausing more harm than good. Requiring each resident to grant written \npermission and then have the housing provider manage all those forms is \na burden.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  We have empirical evidence to show that such rent reporting helps \ntenants. Recently, Credit Builders Alliance led a Rent Reporting for \nCredit Building pilot in eight communities. The Rent Reporting for \nCredit Building pilot reported rent payments of 1,255 low-income \nresidents who lived in assisted housing.\n  The research found that credit-invisible residents who participated \nin the pilot were able to build a high nonprime of 646, or prime score \nof 688 with the inclusion of their rental payment history. Even if they \ndon't want to borrow money, their scores are going up, meaning that \nthey apply for, perhaps, lower interest rates, apply for jobs, and have \na better situation all around.\n  To repeat: from credit-invisible to credit scores above 646, and some \nmuch higher. Even those who had a credit score already saw it go up. \nSeventy-nine percent--a vast majority--saw an increase in credit \nscores. This was an average increase of 23 points.\n  Credit Builders Alliance and other researchers want to expand their \nefforts to help more residents. Another pilot program is pending. HUD \nis partnering with Experian; FICO; LexisNexis; the Policy and Economic \nResearch Council, PERC; and TransUnion to evaluate the impact of \nreporting rental payment history on credit scores of subsidized housing \nresidents and the general population.\n  The Privacy Act requirement has hindered their effort. Already \noverworked housing staffs struggle to maintain the paperwork necessary \nto report renters' on-time payment. Housing staffs find that it is \ndifficult to set up automated payment data transmission between \nproperty managers and the credit bureaus with an always changing \ndatabase.\n  My amendment includes language from H.R. 4172, the Credit Access and \nInclusion Act. H.R. 4172 has 20 cosponsors. Ten are Republican. Seven \nof the ten Republicans serve with me on the Financial Services \nCommittee.\n  In conclusion, please support this amendment because it would do a \nnumber of very important things:\n  It would help credit invisibility for hundreds, if not thousands--\nmillions, even, and that is not an exaggeration--of very low-income \npeople.\n  It makes it easier to provide predictive data of someone's ability to \npay and willingness to repay. And based on solid empirical evidence, \nthat rental payment data can move people from unscoreable to prime or \nnear prime.\n  We should help HUD-assisted tenants enter the financial mainstream. \nLet's implement rent reporting on a large scale.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I listened carefully to the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota. He makes a number of important points. We have had this \ndiscussion previously. I know the gentleman from Minnesota is aware of \nmy commitment that, within the committee, we will have a hearing that \nwill include the subject matter of his amendment.\n  I think the gentleman's amendment, obviously, addresses the Fair \nCredit Reporting Act, which is not part of this underlying housing \nbill. Again, we will debate his issue, research his issue, and take \ntestimony on his issue in the future.\n  I do not believe that this is the appropriate bill for his particular \namendment, so I am going to urge rejection at this time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. HENSARLING. I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Chairman, in listening to the discussion with \nthe gentleman from Minnesota with regard to his amendment, he made the \ncomment that they already report it whenever the people don't make \ntheir payments, and they need to be reporting it when they do make \ntheir payments. Does that mean we are going to have to start reporting \ncar payments, house payments, and all those things, too, when people \nmake them on time? Because this is what he is asking us to do is, every \ntime somebody does something right, suddenly now we have got to be \nreporting that. If you go down that road, then I think we have got some \nproblems.\n  Also, in your amendment here, you indicate that, with the data as \nreported, they are not able to identify if the person is a recipient of \nhousing assistance--we are going to tie their hands, yet force them to \ndo some stuff.\n  I think this is a rather ill-conceived amendment, quite frankly, Mr. \nChairman. I certainly urge the body to reject it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Chair reminds Members to address their remarks \nto the Chair and not to other Members in the second person.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Al Green of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n  TITLE VI--FHA PILOT PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL CREDIT RATING INFORMATION\n\n     SEC. 601. PILOT PROGRAM FOR ADDITIONAL CREDIT RATING \n                   INFORMATION FOR FHA MORTGAGORS.\n\n       Section 258 of the National Housing Act (12 U.S.C. 1715z-\n     24) is amended as follows:\n       (1) Authority.--In the first sentence of subsection (a), by \n     striking ``shall'' and inserting ``may''.\n       (2) Extension of program.--By striking subsection (d).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Al Green) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, this is an amendment that is \nknown to the ranking member as well as the chairman of the committee. I \nwill not complicate it. It is a very simple amendment. It simply says \nthat HUD may--HUD may--develop a pilot program to consider additional \ncredit scoring information.\n  We know that there are people who have insufficient credit files and, \nas a result, they don't get consideration for a light bill, gas bill, \nwater bill, or phone bill. These are some of the things that we have \npeople making payments on quite regularly timely, but they don't get \nconsidered.\n  We are simply asking HUD to develop a pilot program. We say ``may \ndevelop.'' There really is no requirement that HUD do it within some \nstatutory period of time. There is no requirement that HUD will perform \nthis in a certain way. But just see if there is some way to help people \nwho make these payments timely such that this can become a part of the \nadditional credit information.\n  Now, I am emphasizing ``additional'' because, quite frankly, I had \n``alternative'' at one time, ``alternative credit scoring.'' That \ncreated some confusion because we are not using this as an alternative. \nThis becomes additional information.\n\n[[Page H475]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, because the gentleman from Texas is a \nfriend--and you hear Members say that frequently, but in this case it \nis as sincere as it can be--the committee has attempted to work with \nthe gentleman from Texas. Both sides worked in good faith. Regrettably, \nwe did not come to a point of mutual agreement on the resolution of his \namendment, so I am going to oppose it at this time.\n  The amendment would essentially provide a reauthorization of a \nprogram that the Obama administration even believed was too risky to \nestablish because they had years to establish it and they chose not to.\n  I appreciate the effort. I appreciate the sincerity of the gentleman \nfrom Texas. I understand what he is trying to do. But I also fear that, \nultimately, the impact of what the gentleman is trying to do very well \ncould help hasten the insolvency and bankruptcy of the FHA, hurting \ntheir financials.\n  I am happy that the FHA, after 7 years, has finally decided to \nactually obey the law, but I am not sure that the program that the \ngentleman from Texas is advocating could not put further pressure on \nFHA's insurance fund, ultimately hurting those it is designed to help.\n  I would say again that, regardless of one's good intentions, I am \nstill very, very fearful of pilot programs' mays and shalls that \nsomehow get the political process involved in telling lenders, or \ncajoling lenders, or suggesting to lenders what credit standards they \nshould use. That is exactly what helped bring us to the housing crisis \nin the first place.\n  No matter how well-intentioned Federal policy was, ultimately, there \nwas Federal policy that incented, cajoled, and, in some cases, mandated \nfinancial institutions to put people into homes they could not afford \nto keep. It didn't do the economy any good, it didn't do the taxpayer \nany good, and it certainly didn't do the homeowner any good to put them \nin a home they could not afford to keep.\n  Again, I have no doubt that is not the intention of the gentleman \nfrom Texas. But I have fears--I have fears--that once we start going \ndown this road of telling lenders essentially what type of--and, \nultimately, that is what we are doing with FHA. You are, ultimately, \ntelling lenders, or suggesting to lenders, what credit standards they \nshould employ.\n  I am fearful of going down this road. We had discussed a number of \ncompromises. We came close. Unfortunately, we didn't get there with the \ngentleman from Texas.\n  I am going to oppose this amendment, simply because of who he is, \nsomewhat reluctantly. But, nonetheless, the bottom line is the bottom \nline. I will oppose the gentleman's amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) has 3\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Chairman, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nHensarling) is imminently correct. We are friends. I say it in the \nsincerest way as well. He and I have collaborated on many issues, and \nwe have gotten a lot of things done in Congress. I hope that doesn't \nhurt him back home, letting people know that we have worked on things \ntogether.\n  But, obviously, I have a different perch, and from my perch here is \nwhat I see. I see an opportunity for additional credit scoring to be \nused, and if it is negative, it is not going to benefit the person that \nis being scored. It does not prevent any other negative information \nfrom being properly scored. It simply says that HUD may use this \ninformation, indicating that persons have paid a light bill, gas bill, \nwater bill, or phone bill as additional information. That is all it \nsays, that it may do this and it may create the scoring.\n  Now, with reference to HUD, HUD has given me an indication--and I \ndon't have it in writing to hand to you, Mr. Chairman, but I believe \nyou would trust my word--that they are not opposing this.\n  One of the reasons why it wasn't done previously was a function of \nHUD's budget. I believe this to be the reason. And because of budgetary \nconcerns, it did not get done--it was codified in the law--and that is \nwhy I am reintroducing it. But this is a milder version of what I \nintroduced previously, because previously we said HUD shall do this, \nand this time we have made it as mild as possible.\n  The Realtors are very much supportive of it. This will give 50 \nmillion people who are currently with light credit files, don't have \nsufficient credit scores, to have some additional information to be \nconsidered.\n  But it does not in any way require that negative information be \nreceived in a positive manner. If it is negative, it remains negative. \nIf you haven't paid your car note, it is still a negative. If you \nhaven't paid your light bill, gas bill, or water bill, it is still a \nnegative.\n  It only gives the opportunity to add these other things as things to \nconsider for many people who, quite frankly, don't have a lot of \ntraditional credit. They don't have bad credit; they just don't have \ntraditional credit. There are a lot of my constituents who fall into \nthis category.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, as persuasive as my friend is from \nTexas, he wasn't quite persuasive enough. At this particular moment, I \ncontinue to oppose the amendment of from the gentleman from Texas.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas.

REPORT ON INTERAGENCY FAMILY ECONOMIC EMPOWERMENT \n                   STRATEGIES.\n\n       The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in \n     consultation with the Secretary of Labor, shall submit a \n     report to the Congress annually that describes--\n       (1) any interagency strategies of such Departments that are \n     designed to improve family economic empowerment by linking \n     housing assistance with essential supportive services, such \n     as employment counseling and training, financial education \n     and growth, childcare, transportation, meals, youth \n     recreational activities, and other supportive services; and\n       (2) any actions taken in the preceding year to carry out \n     such strategies and the extent of progress achieved by such \n     actions.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the full committee and express my excitement in talking about \nreform and real housing issues.\n  If there is ever an issue that we, as Members of Congress, are \nconfronted with when we go home to our districts, it is about people \nwho need housing, about people who don't have housing, about people who \nhave poor housing, about seniors who need housing, about young families \nwho need housing.\n  I am delighted to be part of this reformation that has been done by \nthe Committee on Financial Services and to acknowledge the chairman and \nthe ranking member of the subcommittee from which this comes and to \ncongratulate this bipartisan process.\n  I am delighted to offer an amendment. I thank the Rules Committee for \nmaking it in order, for I think it adds to the improvement of some of \nthe issues that we are confronted with.\n\n[[Page H476]]\n\n  My amendment indicates that the Secretary of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment, in consultation with the Secretary of Labor and with other \nrelevant agencies, shall submit a report to Congress annually that goes \nto the heart of some of the issues unaddressed of interagency \nstrategies of such departments that are designed to improve family \neconomic empowerment by linking housing assistance with essential \nsupportive services, such as employment, counseling, training, \nfinancial education and growth, child care, transportation, meals, \nyouth recreational activities, and other supportive services.\n  It goes on to say: any actions taken in the preceding year to carry \nout such strategies and the extent of progress achieved by such \nactions.\n  My amendment recognizes that, in addition to housing connecting low-\nincome families to job training and supportive services, such as child \ncare, transportation, it is key to enabling families across the \ncountry--from Texas to California, from New York to California--to \naccess employment and other services that foster upward economic \nmobility and family stability. It allows them to look at their family \nstructure and at people who are in need.\n  My amendment acknowledges and recognizes that helping families \nachieve economic empowerment requires interagency collaboration.\n  Let me cite, Mr. Chairman, two supportive letters from the National \nCoalition for the Homeless and from the Heartland Alliance, which are \nsupporting this constructive and instructive amendment to find out what \nour families need to be strong.\n\n                                         Leading Houston Home,\n\n                                                 February 2, 2016.\n     Speaker Paul Ryan,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon.

Emanuel Cleaver,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance \n         Financial Services Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Ryan and Leader Pelosi: The Coalition for the \n     Homeless of Houston/Harris County is dedicated to preventing \n     and ending homelessness in Houston, Harris County, and Fort \n     Bend County. We are writing in support of H.R. 3700, the \n     Housing Opportunity through Modernization Act. The proposed \n     legislation includes many provisions that would increase the \n     efficiency and effectiveness of critical rental assistance \n     programs that serve extremely low-income households.\n       In particular, we are writing in support of Amendment Four, \n     submitted by Congresswoman Sheila Jackson Lee (TX-18) to the \n     Rules Committee. Representative Jackson Lee's Amendment Four \n     directs the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) \n     to work with the Secretary of Labor to produce an annual \n     report on interagency strategies to strengthen family \n     economic empowerment by linking housing with essential \n     supportive services such as employment counseling and \n     training, financial growth, childcare, transportation, meals, \n     and other support services.\n       Representative Jackson Lee's amendment recognizes that in \n     addition to housing, connecting low-income families to job \n     training and supportive services are key to helping families \n     access employment and economic opportunity and achieve \n     stability. Representative Jackson Lee's amendment also \n     recognizes that helping families achieve economic empowerment \n     requires interagency collaboration. We know that public \n     systems are better at solving big problems when they work \n     together to share capacity, knowledge, and resources. We \n     commend Representative Jackson Lee for encouraging systems \n     collaboration to help ensure that low-income families succeed \n     in housing and employment. We further encourage HUD to \n     collaborate with the Department of Health and Human Services \n     and the Department of Agriculture, as these agencies can \n     offer families critical supports such as child care and \n     nutrition assistance that are necessary for success.\n       The Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County, as \n     a leader of The Way Home, the collaborative model to prevent \n     and end homelessness in Houston, Harris County, and Fort Bend \n     County knows the importance of interagency collaboration and \n     the incredible successes that can be achieved as a result of \n     shared capacity, knowledge and resources. We have made \n     tremendous progress in our community and are happy to serve \n     as a resource moving forward. Thank you for recognizing the \n     important role of employment in helping low-income families \n     achieve housing and financial stability.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact \n     Marilyn Brown (mbrown@homelesshouston.org), President/CEO of \n     the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris County.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Marilyn L.

We are happy to serve as a resource \n     moving forward, and thank you for recognizing the important \n     role of employment in helping low-income families achieve \n     housing and financial stability.\n       If you have any questions, please feel free to contact \n     Melissa Young, Director of Heartland Alliance's National \n     Initiatives on Poverty & Economic Opportunity.\n           Sincerely,\n     Melissa Young,\n       Director, Heartland Alliance's National Initiatives on \n     Poverty & Economic Opportunity.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am delighted to tell the story of Finney from the \nHouston Housing Authority where we gave her supportive services through \nthe Family Sufficiency Program. She has gotten to the point of \nattaining a credit score of 640, and she is now a proud homeowner. What \na legacy.\n  So I would ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Texas has 2 minutes remaining.\n\n\n      Modification to Amendment No. 13 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, unfortunately, as my dear colleague \nfrom Guam missed her time in which to offer her amendment, I ask \nunanimous consent to modify my amendment with the modification by the \ngentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), which I have placed at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the amendment, add the following:\n       Page 55, after line 11, insert the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 111. PREFERENCE FOR UNITED STATES CITIZENS OR NATIONALS.\n\n       Section 214(a)(7) of the Housing and Community Development \n     Act of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 1436a(a)(7)) is amended by striking \n     ``such alien'' and all that follows through the period at the \n     end and inserting ``any citizen or\n\n[[Page H477]]\n\n     national of the United States shall be entitled to a \n     preference or priority in receiving financial assistance \n     before any such alien who is otherwise eligible for \n     assistance.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The amendment is modified.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Guam (Ms. Bordallo).\n  Ms. BORDALLO. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment fixes a misinterpretation of law and gives \nU.S. citizens and nationals a preference over migrants from the \nRepublic of Palau, from the Republic of the Marshall Islands, and from \nthe Federated States of Micronesia when receiving Federal aid.\n  I continue to support allowing these migrants to receive housing \nassistance. Otherwise, our housing situation in Guam and in other \naffected jurisdictions would get even worse. However, it was not the \nintent of Congress to displace our citizens when it extended \neligibility to migrants in 2000.\n  Unfortunately, limited resources have led many U.S. citizens in Guam \nto be displaced by COFA migrants who have entered our country as a \nresult of the Compact of Free Association. Guam's local housing \nauthority has indicated that demand for housing assistance far \noutweighs the resources available.\n  A recent Guam PDN article indicated that homeless data shows that \nlocal residents of Guam make up nearly 42 percent of the homeless on \nGuam, that 536 Chamorros, the indigenous people, and 42 Filipinos were \nconsidered homeless.\n  I ask for the support of my amendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition to the amendment, although I am not opposed.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Chairman, first, in dealing with the amendment \nfrom the gentlewoman from Texas, I often don't have an opportunity to \nwork with her. I am happy to work with her on this matter and to \nrecognize that this report could, indeed, add value.\n  I think anything that we can do to help with family economic \nempowerment in the areas that she has identified, such as in employment \ncounseling and training and the coordination of these areas, can be \nvery valuable.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman's amendment, and I am prepared to accept \nit. The same is true for the amendment offered by the gentlewoman from \nGuam (Ms. Bordallo).\n  I am sorry she missed her opportunity earlier, but I am glad she has \nher opportunity now. I am prepared to accept her amendment as well.\n  I urge adoption.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  I was very pleased to help out the gentlewoman from Guam, and I want \nto indicate that these are two amendments that stand on their own \nright.\n  I close by indicating the purpose of the amendment offered by Ms. \nJackson Lee to again refer to Finney, a woman who tried to get a home.\n  She stayed in the program and completed the criteria that was needed \nfor her to qualify. She earned wages of at least $20,000 and got that \ncredit score and established a savings account of $1,000.\n  This is what we are talking about with regard to supportive services. \nWhat we want to do is to emphasize employment counseling, financial \neducation, growth, child care, transportation, meals, youth \nrecreational activities, and other supportive services.\n  I am very glad to have the support, if you will, of the National \nCoalition for the Homeless of Houston, Harris County, as well as of the \nHeartland Alliance to be able to say that this makes for a better \nroadmap for getting housing to people who are in need.\n  I celebrate the fact that we are on the floor with this reform bill, \ntalking about housing. I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chair, let me express my appreciation to \nChairman Luetkemeyer and Ranking Member Cleaver for their leadership, \ncommitment and effort to modernize and improve Federal Housing programs \nfor millions of Americans who are working their way up to economic \nempowerment and stability.\n  I also wish to thank Chairman Sessions, Ranking Member Slaughter, and \nthe members of the Rules Committee for making in order Jackson Lee \namendment Number 13.\n  Mr. Chair, thank you for the opportunity to explain my amendment, \nwhich provides:\n  The Secretary of Housing and Urban Development, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Labor and other relevant agencies, shall submit a \nreport to the Congress annually that describes--\n  (1) any interagency strategies of such Departments that are designed \nto improve family economic empowerment by linking housing assistance \nwith essential supportive services, such as employment counseling and \ntraining, financial education and growth, childcare, transportation, \nmeals, youth recreational activities, and other supportive services; \nand\n  (2) any actions taken in the preceding year to carry out such \nstrategies and the extent of progress achieved by such actions.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment recognizes that in addition to housing, \nconnecting low-income families to job training and supportive services \nsuch as childcare and transportation are key to enabling families \nacross the country from Texas to California access to employment and \nother services that foster upward economic mobility and family \nstability.\n  Jackson Lee amendment Number 13 acknowledges and recognizes that \nhelping families achieve economic empowerment requires interagency \ncollaboration.\n  I am pleased to submit into the Record letters supporting my \namendment authored by the Coalition for the Homeless of Houston/Harris \nCounty and the Heartland Alliance National Initiatives on Poverty and \nEconomic Opportunity.\n  Mr. Chair, we all know that public systems are better at solving big \nproblems when there is coordination amongst various implementing \nagencies motivated to work together to share capacity, knowledge, and \nresources.\n  My amendment encourages agency collaboration to help ensure that low-\nincome families can succeed in housing, in employment and in life.\n  Interagency collaborations between agencies such as the Department of \nLabor, Department of Health and Human Services and the Department of \nAgriculture can offer families critical support such as child care and \nnutrition assistance that are necessary for family stability and \nemployment success.\n  Livelihood and self-dignity are tied to employment and employment is \ncritical to achieving financial independence and stability and \nstimulation of the economy.\n  My amendment seeks to bridge the opportunities that abound when there \nis interagency/intersystem collaboration and the success that can come \nabout.\n  Take for instance the success story of Fini Tuamokumo, a single \nmother of three children and former Housing Choice Voucher participant, \nenrolled in the Houston Housing Authority's Family Self-Sufficiency \nprogram (FSS).\n  Among other supportive services, the Houston Housing Authority's FSS \nprogram facilitates a pathway for public housing tenants to meet their \nindividual goals by connecting them to community resources and \nhomeownership assistance.\n  Aspiring home owners like Fini receive support and resources towards \nemployment success and homeownership.\n  I am proud to report that Fini began the process, stayed the course \nand completed the criteria needed to qualify for homeownership: earned \nwages of at least $20,000 per year, a credit score of 640 or higher, \nthe establishment of an Individualized Development (savings) Account \nwith a minimum balance of $1,000, and completion of the FSS program's \nFinancial Literacy and First Time Home Ownership classes.\n  Fini is now a proud homeowner and can now pass on the legacy of the \nimportance of a work ethic, grit and homeownership to her children.\n  Fini is just one of many success stories of intersystem/interagency \ncoordination as a nexus towards federal housing and economic \nempowerment.\n  Mr. Chair, my amendment will create the space and opportunity for the \neconomic mobility of federal housing recipients through linking housing \nassistance with essential supportive services such as employment \ncounseling and\n\n[[Page H478]]\n\nopportunities, financial education and growth, childcare, \ntransportation, meals, youth recreational activities and other \nsupportive services.\n  For all these reasons, I urge my colleagues to join me and support \nJackson Lee Amendment Number 13.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n\n\n        Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Price of North Carolina\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 14 \nprinted in House Report 114-411.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, add the following new title:\n\n         TITLE VI--HOUSING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PERSONS WITH AIDS\n\n     SEC. 601.

Pursuant to House Resolution 594, the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Price) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I am offering this \namendment on behalf of our colleague from Alabama (Mr. Aderholt) and \nmyself.\n  I thank the chairman, the ranking member, and the staffs on both \nsides for their cooperation in moving this amendment forward.\n  This is a bipartisan amendment that provides a long, overdue update \nto HUD's statutory funding formula for the Housing Opportunities for \nPersons with AIDS Program, also known as HOPWA.\n  HOPWA is the only Federal program that is solely dedicated to \nproviding housing assistance and related supportive services for low-\nincome people and their families who are living with HIV/AIDS.\n  In short, this amendment would base the distribution of HOPWA funds \non the current number of people who are living with HIV/AIDS, who \ndesperately need this support.\n  This would replace the current formula based, incredibly, on the \ncumulative number of AIDS cases since the epidemic began decades ago. \nLast year more than 50 percent of the people counted in the HOPWA \nformula were deceased.\n  To say the least, this has drastically reduced HOPWA's ability to aid \njurisdictions where the present need is most acute. This is \nparticularly true in rural areas and in cities that are currently \nbearing the brunt of the HIV/AIDS epidemic.\n  Mr. Chairman, Congress has sensibly adjusted other AIDS support \nprograms, including the Ryan White program. So formula funds are \ndistributed based on the number of living HIV and AIDS cases in a given \njurisdiction. Only the HOPWA formula remains out of whack, and it is \ndenying thousands of those\n\n[[Page H479]]\n\nwith HIV/AIDS the housing support they need.\n  The Price-Aderholt amendment makes three changes to the current HOPWA \nformula:\n  Firstly, it utilizes living HIV/AIDS cases as the major basis of \nfunding distribution, consistent with changes made to the Ryan White \nprogram.\n  Secondly, it directs HUD to take into consideration housing costs and \nlocal poverty rates to ensure the HOPWA program can better address \nvaried housing needs within jurisdictions.\n  Thirdly, the amendment provides for a gradual implementation of the \nnew funding formula over 5 years in order to ensure that jurisdictions \nhave adequate time to adjust to the new funding levels. A stop-loss \nprovision is also included so that no jurisdiction can lose more than 5 \npercent of its funding or gain more than 10 percent of its funding on a \nyear-over-year basis.\n  Mr. Chairman, ever since 1997, the Government Accountability Office \nhas identified the need to update the HOPWA formula. The Department of \nHousing and Urban Development has included similar proposals to update \nthe formula in its budget requests year after year. According to the \nDepartment's most recent formula projections, 115 out of 139 \njurisdictions in this country would benefit under the proposed formula \nchange.\n  The AIDS advocacy community also supports updating the HOPWA formula \nto account for living cases of HIV/AIDS. These groups include the \nNational AIDS Housing Coalition, AIDS United, the National Low Income \nHousing Coalition, and the AIDS Institute.\n  In closing, this bipartisan amendment will ensure that our existing \nFederal dollars, without additional spending or new revenue, are \nallocated most efficiently and most effectively and most fairly to help \nthose who are living with HIV/AIDS.\n  HOPWA is often the difference between homelessness and access to \nlifesaving treatment for low-income people with this awful disease. It \nis long past time to update the HOPWA formula to bring it in line with \nRyan White and other AIDS support programs.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, for more than 20 years, I have been an adamant \nsupporter of HOPWA. I share many of Mr. Price's concerns about the \noutdated formula for how HOPWA funding is allocated. However, I cannot \nsupport this amendment.\n  The current formula's reliance on cumulative AIDS cases is \nproblematic and does need to be updated to better reflect the new \nreality of the incidence of the disease.\n  Mr. Price's proposal, while well intended, will just shift scarce \nresources around, cutting off thousands of current beneficiaries to \nmove the money to different parts of the country.\n  If the amendment changed the formula for new HOPWA funds, if there \nwere new HOPWA funds, it would be more acceptable, but the amendment \nwould shift existing funds on which people now rely.\n  New York City is a stark example. This formula change would \neventually cut the city's annual HOPWA funding by nearly 25 percent. \nThat cut would translate into real people.\n  A quarter of New Yorkers living with AIDS and currently receiving \nHOPWA support for their housing would be thrown out of their homes. We \nare talking about people living with AIDS with HOPWA support being \nousted from their present homes.\n  I understand that people in many areas living with AIDS need housing, \nbut Congress should be focused on growing HOPWA and expanding the \nnumber of people enrolled in the program, not on throwing more people \nliving with AIDS out of their present homes.\n  If people living with AIDS in Mr. Price's district and in other \ndistricts need more HOPWA funding--and they do--Congress should provide \nit to them without depriving people living with AIDS in New York, \nAtlanta, and San Francisco of their existing housing.\n  Rather than shifting around limited pools of money and helping \nhomeless people in one part of the country by creating more \nhomelessness in another part of the country, we should be increasing \nfunding for HOPWA to meet the actual needs of the people living with \nAIDS in the United States.\n  That is why every year I offer an amendment to the T-HUD \nappropriations bill increasing HOPWA funding and will continue to do \nso.\n  I recognize Mr. Price's hard work and long years of advocacy for \nHOPWA, but I cannot support this amendment as written today.\n  I hope that, going forward through regular legislative order, we can \nidentify a fair, equitable formula update that does not harm current \nbeneficiaries, that is to say, harm people living with AIDS because of \ntheir HOPWA funding in their homes today.\n  Mr. PRICE OF North Carolina. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. NADLER. I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I inadvertently used the \nlast minute of my time that I hoped to yield to Mr. Quigley. I wonder \nif the gentleman might yield to Mr. Quigley.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, do I have 1 minute remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley).\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Price-Aderholt \namendment, which seeks to modernize the Housing for Persons with AIDS \nProgram to better reflect the current case concentration and \nunderstanding of HIV/AIDS.\n  This will help ensure that funds are directed in a more equitable and \neffective manner. The AIDS population in Chicago certainly stands to \nbenefit from such an update.\n  The HOPWA program is a national safety net for people battling HIV/\nAIDS, providing competitive formula grants since 1992. HOPWA prevents \nhomelessness and permits thousands of households coping with the \ndebilitating and impoverishing impact of HIV/AIDS to access and remain \nin care.\n  It is also a proven prevention mechanism by helping people achieve \nlower viral loads, thus becoming less infectious. This is the \nfoundation for better individual and community health outcomes.\n  It is time for us to change the HOPWA distribution formula from one \nbased on cumulative HIV/AIDS cases to a more updated formula based on \ncurrent HIV/AIDS cases that reflect today's needs.\n  I urge a ``yes'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Announcement by the Acting Chair\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Speaker, I rise today to recognize February \nas American Heart Month.\n  According to the American Heart Association, one out of every four \ndeaths in our great country is cardiac-related, and you may be \nsurprised to hear that heart disease claims more female victims than \nany other disease.\n  But the real tragedy, Madam Speaker, is that so many of these deaths \nare preventable. America's amazing medical researchers, doctors, and \nnurses have been doing their part to stop heart disease and save lives.\n  It is time for the rest of us to step up and do our part. Remember \nthat even small improvements in diet and exercise can have big impacts \non your heart health and overall well-being.\n  So as you think of your Valentine later this month, don't forget to \nlove your heart, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H484-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         WORKFORCE DEVELOPMENT\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, it has been over 3 years since the Carl \nD. Perkins Act expired, the primary source of funding for workforce \ndevelopment programs across the country.\n  We now have the opportunity to remake Perkins in a way that works for \nthe 21st century economy. Perkins reauthorization must deliver student-\ncentered education that provides 21st century skills for successful \ncareers.\n  Across the country students continue to seek out career pathways, but \nfunding has been reduced from its peak level in 2010 of $1.3 billion. \nIf we fail to match this demand for CTE, we run the risk of our economy \nfalling behind as companies pursue skilled workers in other parts of \nthe world.\n  Madam Speaker, our country and our economy need a Perkins \nreauthorization that focuses on skills that matter and work that pays, \nskills that matter and work that pays. Let's get this done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H484-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   SMALL BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT CENTER\n\n  (Mr. OLSON asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. OLSON.

Madam Speaker, the brutal trench hand-to-hand \ncombat of World War I claimed more American lives than Vietnam and \nKorea combined. The war to end all wars between European monarchies was \nat a standstill until the United States entered the war.\n  Texas boys like Corporal Samuel Sampler stood up and fought over \nthere across the sea to successfully break the deadlocked war.\n  On October 18, 1918, in France, this young Army corporal became the \nthird Texan in World War I to be awarded the Medal of Honor.\n  When his company suffered severe, devastating casualties during an \nadvance, Sampler took action. Grenades in hand, he left the line and \nrushed in through enemy machinegun fire until he engaged the enemy \ndirectly.\n  His grenades hit the target, killing two and silencing all the \nmachineguns. Twenty-eight other Germans surrendered, allowing the \nAmerican doughboys to resume their advance.\n  The 100-year anniversary of the great war is upon us. We remember \nTexans like Sampler and all Americans who proudly served our country in \nlands far away 100 years ago and won the ultimate victory in World War \nI.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H484-4", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H484]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 HONORING FORMER CONGRESSMAN TOM BLILEY\n\n  (Mr. BRAT asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BRAT.

Madam Speaker, the trafficking of young girls and boys \ncontinues to be a crime that plagues many of our communities.\n  While I am proud to have led efforts last year to help pass important \nlegislation to combat this problem, law enforcement on the ground needs \nto remain vigilant to stop this horrific crime.\n  With the Super Bowl taking place on Sunday in California, concerns \nare once again being raised that traffickers will bring children in \nfrom out of town for exploitation.\n  It is also an opportunity for law enforcement to reach out to these \nvictims to try to bring them out of the shadows and bring traffickers \nto justice.\n  That is why it is encouraging to see the FBI take a different victim-\ncentered approach this year that focuses on first gaining the trust of \nyoung victims, sometimes as young as 12, 13, and 14 years old. This \nhelps victims get the services they need and brings the traffickers to \njustice with their arrest.\n  Madam Speaker, a victim-centered approach is the right way to attack \nthis problem. I commend the FBI on their efforts during the Super Bowl \nthis week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H484-6", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H484-H485]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONTINUING THE CRUSADE AGAINST BOKO HARAM\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Speaker, almost 2 years ago I led a bipartisan \ndelegation, the first congressional delegation, to Nigeria to assess \nand address the crisis of Boko Haram.\n  At that time, it was in the immediate aftermath of the taking of the \nChibok girls in a previous administration. Boko Haram was doing the \nkind of raiding and rabble-rousing that may have been part of burning \nvillages.\n  That time has now passed. And in the last 48 hours, Boko Haram poured \ngasoline on children and burned them. Boko Haram has now become a \nmarauding and crusading, vile, evil, and vicious group. It takes in the \nspace and areas of Nigeria, Cameroon, Chad, and Niger.\n  It is important for us, as Members of Congress working with the \nadministration, to call upon these nations to again collaborate and \nwork together.\n  They have pledged their support to ISIL.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, news has come out, February 2, Groundhog \nDay, in this article from Adam Kredo entitled, ``The Obama \nAdministration Has Not Prosecuted a Single Palestinian Terrorist Who \nKilled Americans.''\n  ``The Obama administration has not prosecuted a single Palestinian \nterrorist responsible for killing Americans abroad, despite a \ncongressional mandate ordering the Justice Department to take action \nagainst these individuals'' . . . ``Palestinian terrorists have \nmurdered at least 64 Americans, including two unborn children, since \n1993. Yet the U.S. Government has failed to take legal action against \nthose who committed the crimes, lawmakers disclosed during a Tuesday \nhearing on the Justice Department's failure to live up to its mandate \nto bring these terrorists to justice.\n  ``Many of the terrorists continue to roam free across the Middle \nEast, with one hosting a Hamas-affiliated television show in Jordan.\n  ``With criticism mounting from Congress and U.S. victims of \nterrorism, Justice Department officials say they are working to \ninitiate cases, but warn that this could take `many years' to play out.\n  ``The Justice Department has repeatedly declined to comment when \nfaced with questions from Congress about the lack of prosecutions, \naccording to Representative Ron DeSantis of Florida, chair of the House \nOversight and Government Reform Subcommittee on National Security.\n  ``The Justice Department `has not been able to cite one example for \nthis committee of even a single terrorist who has been prosecuted in \nthe U.S. for any of the 64 attacks against Americans in Israel,' \nDeSantis said. `Indeed, many of these terrorists roam free as the \nresult of prisoner exchanges or evasion.\n  `` `This is not what Congress intended' when it created the DOJ's \nOffice of Justice for Victims of Overseas Terrorism in 2005,' DeSantis \nadded. `This is not what the American people want, and this does not \nprovide justice to the victims' families that has been so tragically \nelusive.'\n  ``The Justice Department has sought to evade questions about its \nfailure to prosecute known terrorists responsible for the murder of \nU.S. citizens.\n  ``This includes its failure to level charges against Ahlam Tamimi, \nthe Palestinian woman responsible for blowing up a Jerusalem pizza shop \nin 2001. The attacks killed 15, including a pregnant American woman. \nTamimi currently resides in Jordan and hosts a television show on the \nHamas-owned Al Quds station.\n  `` `When the Oversight and Government Reform Committee questioned the \nDepartment of Justice about this case, the Department declined to \ncomment,' DeSantis said. `If in fact bringing to justice the \nperpetrators of terrorism against Americans in Israel is a high \npriority for the DOJ, then surely people of this nature should be \nprosecuted for their crimes.' '' . . . ``American victims of terrorist \nattacks abroad who testified at the hearing offered sharp criticism of \nthe Justice Department for failing to take on terrorists in the U.S. \ncourts.\n  ``Sari Singer, who was injured in a 2003 Palestinian terror attack on \na bus in Jerusalem, said that she has lost faith in the government.''\n  Singer said, ``I grew up believing that my country would be there for \nme and protect me no matter where I was in the world. These last years \nhave left me feeling let down.''\n  I would insert parenthetically, Madam Speaker, that she shares that \nsame feeling with the victims in our State Department of the attacks at \nBenghazi, and the many hours people waited thinking surely our \ngovernment will come to our aid.\n  So it sounds like victims of terrorists abroad share this, whether it \nis from Benghazi or whether it is from other terrorist attacks, that \nthe administration is not going to be there for you.\n  The article goes on: ``Peter Schwartz, whose nephew Ezra was shot in \nthe head by a Palestinian terrorist in November 2015, said that the \nObama administration has not been forthcoming about any potential \ninvestigations into the incident'' . . . ``The Obama administration was \ncriticized in August when it sought to limit the restitution American \nvictims of terrorism could receive. The administration argued in a \nlegal briefing issued to the court that a large cash award to these \nvictims could complicate the administration's efforts to foster peace \nbetween Israel and the Palestinians.''\n  Clearly, the administration's interests, as Sari Singer observed, is \nnot with American victims of foreign terrorism. It is with the foreign \nterrorists that maybe if we sidle up to them enough, maybe if we will \nbe nice to them and not punish them, then maybe they won't keep killing \nAmerican citizens. That is false thinking.\n  Madam Speaker, I can't help but think as we find out this week that \nthis administration has released $100 billion to the largest supporter \nof terrorism in the world--Iran--and Iran has made clear that once they \ngot this money from the Obama administration that they were going to \nincrease their help to terrorists like Hamas and Hezbollah. In other \nwords, they told us in advance that when America cedes to Iran $100 \nbillion extra, they are going to be able to help more terrorists commit \nmore of their acts of terrorism.\n  Now, back when I was a judge or even back years and years ago as a \nprosecutor, we always approached cases that if you assisted somebody, \nsay you gave them money, and they told you before you gave them the \nmoney that they are going to use some of this money to commit a \ncriminal act, then we always felt like you could prosecute those \npeople. Jurors could bear that out because if you knowingly aid, \nassist--even encourage--you don't even have to give them money. If you \njust encourage them to commit a violent act or encourage them to go \nabout what they plan to do, and they already said, ``We plan to commit \nmore terrorism with what you give us,'' then you were an accomplice. \nUnder the laws federally, and as well as in the laws I am aware of in \nmost States, certainly in Texas, you would be charged as a principal. \nSo if you gave money to someone knowing that they said, ``We are going \nto use money and help kill people and help terrorism,'' and then they \ncommitted the terrorism, you could be convicted of the same terrorism \nof those you gave the money to help.\n  It is interesting that those principles seem to apply to all other \nAmericans, but this administration feels surely they won't apply to \nthis administration. Sure, Iran has said they are going to support more \nterrorism once they get all this extra money from the Obama \nadministration. But apparently the Obama administration, according to \nthese pleadings they filed, if you just be nice to the terrorists, let \nthem keep their own money, gee, they will probably quit killing \nAmericans. It doesn't work that way.\n  Let's take a look at who this administration, this Commander in \nChief's administration, is willing to punish. I have a letter here that \nwas sent by my friend, our fellow colleague, Duncan Hunter, to the \nchairman of the Senate Agriculture Committee when he discusses Sergeant \nFirst Class Charles Martland and points out he is considered a first-\nrate warrior.\n  ``While in Afghanistan in 2011, at a remote outpost, Martland \nconfronted an Afghan Local Police commander for kidnapping a young boy \nand raping him repeatedly over several days. The issue was brought to \nthe attention of Martland and his fellow soldiers after the boy's \nmother asked for help, after she also was attacked by the ALP--or \nAfghan Local Police--commander.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  ``When Martland and Captain Danny Quinn confronted the rapist, he \nadmitted to the charge and laughed in their faces--at which point \nMartland and Quinn took matters into their own hands. This occurred \nafter two separate\n\n[[Page H486]]\n\nbut similar human rights violations, including another rape, near the \noutpost, resulting in no punitive action whatsoever.\n  ``The Afghan Local Police commander was dragged to the perimeter \ngate, where he was thrown out and told never to come back. It is \nimportant to note that the Afghan Local Police commander left on his \nown, only to deliberately exaggerate his injuries. Multiple sources \nhave confirmed this fact, including a linguist and authorities who were \nnever interviewed by Army investigators after the incident.\n  ``For this action, Martland was removed from the outpost and faced \nreprimand. He later was allowed to reenlist, only to face a Qualitative \nManagement Program review board in February 2015.''\n  That would be a year ago.\n  ``The Army argued that the black mark on his record, which states he \nassaulted `a corrupt Afghan commander' is cause to expel him from duty, \ndespite the fact that he has the full support of his command and \nimmediate leadership. In fact, the Department of Defense Inspector \nGeneral reported to me that''--this is a letter from Duncan Hunter--`` \n`personnel are very supportive of the Sergeant and his efforts to \nremain in the U.S. Army. . . .' And there continue to be efforts within \nhis command to not 'inadvertently hamper his efforts.' This was in \nresponse to an alleged gag order put on Martland and his fellow \nsoldiers''--apparently, about trying to stop the rapes that were going \non in Afghanistan.\n  ``Importantly, Martland was permitted to resubmit an appeal to the \nQualitative Management Program decision after his first appeal was \ndenied outright. And recently, a decision within Army Human Resources \nCommand recommended that the Army uphold the judgment that Martland be \nremoved from service, although a final decision has yet to be made \nabout his future.''\n  Madam Speaker, we have an American hero in Sergeant First Class \nCharles Martland. Dragging a child rapist out of the confined area that \nthis child rapist was using to be a serial rapist, doing harm to \nchildren in Afghanistan, is an act of heroism, not an act to be \ncondemned. In fact, courts I am aware of, certainly juries in Texas, \nwould say that was acting in defense of a third person. This man is \nguilty of nothing except a heroic act to save children and women from \nbeing raped by a corrupt police commander.\n  But under this administration, where we give money to supporters of \nterrorism, the largest supporters of terrorism in the world, and where \nwe beg courts not to give large reimbursements to victims of terrorism, \nour own American victims of foreign terrorism because that might not \nhelp, it might make the foreign terrorists mad if they have a judgment \nagainst them, then it seems like this is perfectly consistent with the \npolicies of this administration. We give money to terrorists who say \nthey are going to use it to support terrorism; we don't give money to \nvictims of terrorism.\n  In fact, this administration should have done what the House passed \nand implored the administration to do, and that is to make sure that \nnot a dime was allowed to be released to Iran until the verdicts \noutstanding against Iran by American victims of Iranian terrorism were \npaid first. But in its haste to get all this money to those who say \nthey are going to use a bunch of it to support terrorism, the American \nvictims were left in the lurch. It is more than irresponsible. It is \nunconscionable what has been going on.\n  At some point, people in this administration have got to figure out \nwhat most of the American people have figured out, and that is you are \nnot going to stop terrorism by trying to be sweet and kind to the \nterrorists. Some of us learned it on the playground growing up. I guess \nnow that the Federal Government has control of education to such an \nextent that schools are forced to teach to the test--I have even had \nelementary schools tell me: We have had to do away with recess in \nelementary school because we just don't have time. We have got to teach \nthem to the test so that we can get that Federal money and we can stay \nopen.\n  But if you allow recess and kids are on the playground and you have \nkids that were smaller like I was, you learn you are not going to stop \nbullying by giving your money to a bully. If you give a bully money, \nnot only do they not respect you, they have more contempt and it \nencourages their bullying. You can't do that. You have to stand up to \nbullying. You find out when you do that, sometimes you will have a \nteacher, like my fifth grade teacher, that took up for the bullies, but \nyou will ultimately find more teachers will not tolerate that kind of \nconduct.\n  This administration never learned that. Maybe there was no chance to \nlearn that in the young schools in Indonesia. Maybe that is why we have \na Commander in Chief that thinks we should reward the terrorists, the \nsupporters of terrorism, and punish the victims of terrorism by not \nletting them have proper financial restitution.\n  But it is tragic what is going on. It is tragic.\n  There are a number of stories about Sergeant Martland, including from \nmy friend Jay Sekulow. He said:\n  ``Yet, for his actions, he was immediately pulled from the \nbattlefield and this decorated war hero is now facing expulsion from \nthe military.''\n  This administration's priorities are so completely out of step with \ntruth, justice, and the American way--what used to be the American way. \nPerhaps the American way has been fundamentally transformed in the last \n7 years, so now the American way has become that we help terrorists, \ngive them money, and we punish those who are victims.\n  Well, of course, we know that our Secretary of State thanked Iran for \ntheir activities. I haven't heard whether or not Secretary of State \nKerry has thanked Iran for this latest story. This from foxnews.com, \n``Iran's Supreme Leader Awards Medals to Troops Who `Captured' U.S. \nSailors.'' The story says:\n  ``Iran's supreme leader has awarded medals to five members of the \nIranian Navy whom he said 'captured intruding' U.S. Navy sailors during \na tense incident in January.\n  ``Ayatollah Ali Khamenei awarded the Order of Fat'h medal to Admiral \nAli Fadavi, the head of the navy of the Revolutionary Guards, and four \ncommanders who seized the two U.S. Navy vessels, according to Reuters. \nIran's state media reported the news on Sunday.\n  ``Order of Fat'h given by Chief Commander of Armed Forces to IRGC \nNavy commanders who captured intruding U.S. marines''. . .``In a tweet \nfrom his account Sunday, Khamenei misidentified those who were \n`captured' as being members of the Marines.\n  ``On January 12, Iran captured the ten sailors whose boats \n`misnavigated' into Iranian waters, according to Defense Secretary Ash \nCarter. Though the sailors were released the following day, Iran \nreleased video of the sailors being captured, detained and apologizing \nfor the incursion.\n  ``Though Iran initially accused the sailors of spying, Fadavi later \nsaid an investigation had established the sailors were led astray by `a \nbroken navigation system' and the trespassing was `not hostile or for \nspying purposes'.\n\n  ``The sailors were attempting to navigate from Kuwait to Bahrain when \nthey crossed into Iranian waters.''\n  Well, Madam Speaker, we have got satellites that could show exactly \nwhat happened. I would think that if this administration wanted to \ndefend our sailors, they would show the satellite footage of where they \nwere and we would be able to see for sure whether or not they did cross \ninto Iranian waters.\n  But consistent with these reports and stories we have already looked \nat this evening, it seems if they are going to act consistent with this \nadministration's prior actions, this administration wouldn't want to \nembarrass the Iranian military, the supporters of terrorism, and so we \nwouldn't want to show that they were liars. So we won't show by \nsatellite footage exactly where our sailors were, and we won't show \nexactly where our other naval vessels were. These were reported to be \nsmall vessels. Well, you don't have small Navy vessels unless they are \nnear much larger Navy vessels. Normally, if they are larger Navy \nvessels, there are other small vessels that can go rather quickly.\n  If you have the Navy vessels there, there is a good chance there is a \ncarrier nearby, an airstrip, where jets could be there in no time \nwhatsoever. It used to\n\n[[Page H487]]\n\nbe under other Commanders in Chief, not this one, but other Commanders \nin Chief, that if we had sailors who were in danger of being captured \nby a country, particularly the largest supporter of terrorism in the \nworld, our jets would be put in the air. They would get there \nimmediately. They would keep flying overhead and protecting those \nsailors until the Navy itself could get there to rescue them.\n  For some reason, this administration thought it was a better idea not \nto put our aircraft in the air--kind of reminiscent of Benghazi. We are \nnot going to send aircraft that could have been there in minutes. But, \nheck, I was asking a former commander at Ramstein Air Base clear up in \nGermany. He didn't realize where I was going.\n  I asked: How long would it take, say, to get to North Africa from \nRamstein?\n  He said: About 3, 3\\1/2\\ hours at the most.\n  I said: So you could have been at Benghazi in 3\\1/2\\ hours?\n  He said: Oh, well, we had ordnance on the planes that particular \nevening, and it would have taken awhile to reconfigure those.\n  Well, if you can get clear from Ramstein Air Base to Benghazi in 3, \n3\\1/2\\ hours, tops--we have got planes a whole lot closer to where \nthese Navy vessels were--they should have been able to be there in \nminutes. I am sure some commander or some admiral who is afraid of the \nCommander in Chief would never admit that, not these days.\n  But the fact is this once proud United States military who protected \nits own for the last 70 years and now it calls upon the largest \nsupporter of terrorism to come get our sailors and to have them kneel \non their knees, hands behind their heads, as if they are POWs, \nembarrass them to the maximum, for that, Secretary of State Kerry \nthanked Iran.\n  Well, Madam Speaker, I see my friend from Nebraska is here. I yield \nto my friend.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n\n                            Nebraska Values\n\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Texas for \nyielding.\n  I want to point out something about Mr. Gohmert. He was speaking \nabout our military a moment ago. He, himself, is a veteran. He served \nin the United States Army during the Vietnam war, and I appreciate his \nservice.\n  Madam Speaker, I also want to share something with the body today. I \nwrite a weekly report, generally, called the Fort Report. This week, I \nsent one that I hoped would have a broader meaning to the House of \nRepresentatives and, perhaps, to anyone else who might encounter this. \nIt is entitled, ``Nebraska Values.'' It is stories about America's \npolitical and economic and cultural crises. As we all know, they are \ndominating the headlines across our Nation. There is widespread, \nbipartisan dissatisfaction with the status quo, and it is propelling a \nnew conversation against the dysfunction and gridlock that have long \nthwarted effective government here in Washington, D.C.\n  As families across our Nation face pressing challenges, it is sad, \nbut elected officials often prioritize divisive rhetoric instead of \nempathy and understanding. Now our disagreements have widened into \nchasms. It is exhausting--exhausting to America's spirit--and it is \ndistracting us from the possibilities that are before us. In the midst \nof this contentious Presidential primary season, Madam Speaker, maybe \nit is time to just pause, change the subject, and celebrate some of the \nbest examples that our country has to offer.\n  In a small town gym in Beemer, Nebraska, at Beemer Elementary School, \nthe community recently gathered to celebrate the life of Joseph Lemm. \nWhile deep sadness marked the occasion, the community's desire to \ngather and tell stories and honor this remarkable man pointed to a much \ndeeper understanding of the values that bind us.\n  Joe chose to put on three different uniforms in his life--first, by \nenlisting in the United States Air Force after high school. Then he \nwent on to have a career with the New York City Police Department and, \nfinally, with the New York Air National Guard. Joe served three tours \nof duty in Iraq and Afghanistan. This past December, Joseph Lemm gave \nhis all for his country, along with five other Americans who were \nkilled in Afghanistan. Although Joe left Nebraska a very long time ago, \nI am quite certain that he carried his early formation with him \nthroughout his life of service, and I suspect my State, Nebraska, was \nnever far from Joe's heart.\n  Before the service that memorialized him, I saw Joe's mother, \nShirley. Shirley embraced me as though we were family members, and, \nperhaps, we were. She embraced our Governor, Governor Ricketts, and \nUnited States Senator Sasse in the same way. Everyone in the gym in the \nlittle town of Beemer knew, in the midst of this deep grief and loss, \nthat Joseph Lemm's life had great value, had great purpose.\n  Madam Speaker, several weeks ago, Washington, D.C., was buried in an \navalanche of snow, the remnants of which are still around. I was \nintending to come back to Washington but had to cancel that trip, and I \nhad more time than I had anticipated in my hometown of Lincoln. As I \nwas in my office, I noticed some young people who were walking around \nthe complex in their signature blue Future Farmers of America jackets, \nthe FFA jackets. I love those jackets, Madam Speaker. They are \nemblazoned with the name of their hometown below the FFA symbol. These \nyoung people had gathered along with others from the Distributive \nEducation Clubs of America; the Future Business Leaders of America; the \nFamily, Career and Community Leaders of America; Educators Rising; and \nthe Future Health Professionals Skills USA to talk about a very \nimportant issue: food security.\n  In Nebraska, we are very fortunate to have a very, very low \nunemployment rate. We have the convergence of some extraordinary \nnatural resources, that of our farming and ranch community; we have \nmanufacturing; we have a financial sector; we have had a long tradition \nof solid community leadership, which has left our economic situation \nmuch better than most across the country. Even so, even in our State, \nwe face problems with structural poverty.\n  These young students came together because they recognized the need \nto engage in the issue of children who face hunger--of children who \nreturn from school hungry, of children who have to worry about not \nhaving enough to eat when they get up in the morning. These young \npeople were there, gathered to lead the way--to find realtime solutions \nin their own small communities, to help the impoverished, vulnerable \nmembers who are all around them.\n  Madam Speaker, that same snowstorm that kept me out of Washington, \nthough, did not deter hundreds of other Nebraska students who left the \ncomforts of their homes and drove on buses through the night to \nexercise their fundamental American rights: the freedom to assemble and \nthe freedom of speech.\n  In the face of that devastating blizzard a couple of weeks ago, these \nprincipled boys and girls participated in the annual March for Life. \nThey are young people in our country who refuse to accept the current \nsettlement in our wounded culture. They refuse to stare at pain and \nwoundedness and then walk away. They refuse to accept what has been \nfostered upon us for the last four decades of brokenness, of fracturing \nin family life, and the deep wounds that abortion has caused in so many \nwomen. They are demanding that we do better as a country. They are \nsaying to all of us that women deserve better, that we deserve better. \nThey traveled to Washington to explicitly express this pro-life \nperspective and to proclaim that we should care for unborn children, \nfor their mothers, and for our society as a whole.\n  This is the new generation--the Millennial Generation--that, in many \nways, is standing upon the ash heap of broken tradition, and they are \nlonging for more. They are saying there is a better way no matter how \ndeep and difficult the problem is. Although our Nation, particularly in \nour politics, still experiences deep and sad divisions over the \nquestion of abortion, I do think we should all commend these students \nfor responsibly exercising their rights to peaceably demonstrate, for \nstanding up for what they believe. That is a source of renewal and \nstrength in America. Sometimes it discomforts us. Sometimes it \nchallenges those of us in power when truth has spoken to us. Sometimes \nit bumps up against systems that seem stacked against the ordinary \nperson.\n\n[[Page H488]]\n\n  These young people are not willing to accept the current economic, \npolitical, and cultural settlement in our country. They are saying \nlet's strive for more. Let's imagine what we could be. Let's put aside \nthe pain. Let's heal the past and look forward when all life is \ncelebrated as a beautiful gift. I respect what they did, and I think, \nagain, all of us here can look to these young people who have \nresponsibly demonstrated in front of us as good future stewards of a \nrebuilt America.\n  So, Madam Speaker, that is really what I wanted to say to you today. \nI am proud of these Nebraskans who have continued to demonstrate a \nbetter pathway for America in public servants and in military heroes, \nsuch as Joseph Lemm, who gave his life for his country, in the young \npeople back home who are deciding to tackle systemic childhood poverty \nand hunger, and in the students who trekked all this way in hazardous \nconditions to stand in defense of vulnerable persons.\n\n  Perhaps, in the example of these young people, we can find an answer \nto what is right about America at a time when so much seems to be going \nwrong. We can carry forward the best of our traditions, those put \nforward by small communities and families that are really the renewing \nsocial force that will help turn our country around.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, I am very grateful to my friend from \nNebraska. Mr. Fortenberry and I came in together, and I am so glad we \ndid. We have been friends ever since. What a noteworthy tribute he had \nto pay. I am grateful for that tribute.\n  Madam Speaker, we have had so many Americans who have given, as \nLincoln said, the last full measure of devotion for freedom, for \nliberty, for people who were not even Americans, because that is who \nAmericans have been.\n  I know our current President is fond of saying that is who we are, \nand then he provides access to $100 billion for Iran--the largest \nsupporter of terrorism. It says it is going to keep supporting \nterrorism, just with a lot more money now that the President has made \nall of this available. The President says that is not who we are, and \nthen he shows us that we open our arms to terrorists from all over the \nworld.\n  So many Americans gave their lives and gave their limbs for liberty \nin Iraq, for liberty in Afghanistan. In fact, in Afghanistan, if I \nrecall my figures correctly, in the 7\\1/4\\ years under Commander in \nChief Bush, from October of 2001 until January of 2009, there were just \nover 500 precious American lives given for the cost of freedom in \nAfghanistan. Supposedly, we were told by this President, the war was \npretty much over. He sent more troops for a while to Afghanistan; but \neven after, supposedly, the war has been over and troops have been left \nover there, we keep getting Americans killed.\n  It is because of the rules of engagement that so needlessly tie their \nhands. It is because this administration would rather punish Green \nBeret Sergeant First Class Martland for stopping a serial child rapist. \nIt would rather punish him--throw him out, end his military career--\nbecause this administration, at least here in this country, does not \nwant to offend the serial child rapist in Afghanistan.\n  No wonder people around the world have lost so much respect for the \nUnited States in the last 7 years. They know that stuff is going on. \nThey knew that Sergeant Martland stood up for the child and for the \nwoman. They knew what he did. They spread the word. Then the word \nspreads when Sergeant Martland makes international news because this \nadministration wants to punish him for dragging him out of the \ncompound--not killing, not beheading, not disemboweling--in an act of \ndefense of many third persons. They find out this administration \npunished the military hero, the Green Beret who protected the victims.\n  It is incredible. I mean, any administration that would do that would \nprobably turn around and, if it heard about some entity that was \nallowing unborn babies to be killed and was selling body parts, might \nbe tempted to punish the people who exposed it instead of punishing \nthose who did such a heinous act.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Those who have read Scripture know there will come a time when right \nis wrong, wrong is right, the good are punished, and the evil are \nrewarded. But we also know the day will come when the ultimate judge of \nthe world will set things straight.\n  So this is a story from Martha Mendoza, Maya Alleruzzo, and Bram \nJanssen from the Associated Press: ``Oldest Christian monastery in Iraq \nis razed.'' This is heartbreaking.\n  This is a monastery Americans were devoted to restoring. It is a \nmonastery where people came to know Jesus of Nazareth for the last 1400 \nyears. It is a place where God did miracles in people's lives. It is a \nplace where our military were very, very careful to protect because \nthey knew the Christian significance.\n  As this administration miscalculated--apparently, our intelligence \nagencies did not miscalculate. Apparently, our intelligence agencies \nmade very clear to this administration that ISIS is not a JV team, that \nthese are dangerous people and they have to be stopped and you have to \nramp it up.\n  So it wasn't our intelligence. We didn't have bad intelligence. The \nreports are out there. The administration, thinking it knew better than \nthose on the ground in the area, did not take ISIS seriously.\n  Now, this Christian monastery over 1400 years old has been razed. The \nstory from Iraq:\n  ``The oldest Christian monastery in Iraq has been reduced to a field \nof rubble, yet another victim of the Islamic State group's relentless \ndestruction of ancient cultural sites.\n  ``For 1,400 years the compound survived assaults by nature and man, \nstanding as a place of worship recently for U.S. troops. In earlier \ncenturies, generations of monks tucked candles in the niches and prayed \nin the cool chapel. The Greek letters chi and rho, representing the \nfirst two letters of Christ's name, were carved near the entrance.\n  ``Now satellite photos obtained exclusively by The Associated Press \nconfirm the worst fears of church authorities and preservationists--St. \nElijah's Monastery of Mosul has been completely wiped out.\n  ``In his office in exile in Irbil, Iraq, the Rev. Paul Thabit Habib, \n39, stared quietly at before- and after-images of the monastery that \nonce perched on a hillside above his hometown of Mosul. Shaken, he \nflipped back to his own photos for comparison.\n  `` `I can't describe my sadness,' he said in Arabic. `Our Christian \nhistory in Mosul is being barbarically leveled. We see it as an attempt \nto expel us from Iraq, eliminating and finishing our existence in this \nland.'\n  ``The Islamic State group, which broke from al-Qaeda and now controls \nlarge parts of Iraq and Syria, has killed thousands of civilians and \nforced out hundreds of thousands of Christians, threatening a religion \nthat has endured in the region for 2,000 years. Along the way, its \nfighters have destroyed buildings and ruined historical and culturally \nsignificant structures they consider contrary to their interpretation \nof Islam.''\n  Madam Speaker, I find it interesting that these writers know what \nleaders in this administration still, after all these years, have not \nfigured out. It is Martha Mendoza, Maya Alleruzzo, and Bram Janssen.\n  They point out in this article that these people believe that these \nsites are contrary to their interpretation of Islam. Yet, this \nadministration says, no, it has nothing to do with Islam.\n  The article continues:\n  ``Those who knew the monastery wondered about its fate after the \nextremists swept through in June 2014 and largely cut communications to \nthe area.\n  ``Now, St. Elijah's has joined a growing list of more than 100 \ndemolished religious and historic sites, including mosques, tombs, \nshrines and churches in Syria and Iraq. The extremists have defaced or \nruined ancient monuments in Nineveh, Palmyra and Hatra. Museums and \nlibraries have been looted, books burned, artwork crushed--or \ntrafficked.\n  `` `A big part of tangible history has been destroyed,' said Rev. \nManuel Yousif Boji. A Chaldean Catholic pastor in Southfield, Michigan, \nhe remembers attending Mass at St. Elijah's almost 60 years ago while a \nseminarian in Mosul.'\n  `` `These persecutions have happened to our church more than once, \nbut we\n\n[[Page H489]]\n\nbelieve in the power of truth, the power of God,' said Boji. He is part \nof the Detroit area's Chaldean community, which became the largest \noutside Iraq after the sectarian bloodshed that followed the U.S. \ninvasion in 2003. Iraq's Christian population has dropped from 1.3 \nmillion then to 300,000 now, church authorities say.''\n  Christians are under persecution, being killed in greater numbers \nthan any time in our history. Yet, it is not the Christians being \npersecuted in greater numbers than any time in history. It is not the \ngroup that many in the world recognize are the most persecuted religion \nin the world.\n  This administration wants to welcome those of the religion of \npersecution rather than the most persecuted group in the world, that \nbeing Christians, although just recently this article from CNS News, \n``550 Syrian Refugees Admitted to U.S. Since the Paris Attacks''--and, \nof the most persecuted highest number killed in the history of the \nworld, Christians, this administration admitted two.\n  An article from the Texas Tribune points out that Governor Greg \nAbbott and my friend, Democrat U.S. Rep. Henry Cuellar, ``pressed the \nU.S. Department of Homeland Security on Monday to explain why the \nagency plans to reduce its aerial surveillance on the Texas-Mexico \nborder.''\n  ``Monday's request comes as CBP is reporting a new surge in the \nnumber of undocumented immigrants crossing the Rio Grande. From October \nto December of 2015, about 10,560 unaccompanied minors entered Texas \nillegally through the Rio Grande Valley sector of the U.S. Border \nPatrol. That marks a 115 percent increase over the same time frame in \n2014.''\n  Madam Speaker, what is clear is that, as this administration says, \noh, we are arresting fewer people coming into the country illegally, \nthese kind of reports make clear, well, yeah, if you close your eyes, \nyou will keep arresting even fewer. That is what they are doing. They \nare closing our eyes to our ability to see people that are violating \nour law.\n  At the same time, we get this report from the Washington Examiner \nthat sanctuary cities now cross the 300 mark, with Dallas and \nPhiladelphia added to it.\n  Madam Speaker, with so much to be depressed about, I want to commend \nthe people of the State of Iowa, where I spent a couple of days last \nweek and where I have spent other times many days in the past. When I \nam among the Iowans, I feel like I am back home in East Texas. The \npeople are wonderful.\n  I had somebody ask earlier today about: What do you think about your \nparty?\n  I said: What do you mean?\n  He said: Well, you look at the people that won the Iowa caucuses.\n  So?\n  The comment was made: Well, in the Democratic caucus or primary, you \nhad two White Socialists--this was the comment from this person--and in \nthe Republican primary, the first and third vote-getters were Cuban, \nHispanic Americans, and the fourth was African American. Isn't that \ninteresting the way things have turned?\n  Well, I have enjoyed coming to love the people of Iowa, and I look \nforward to the days ahead because of them.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H489-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H489-H492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             WATER SECURITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, I want to pick up on some issues of \nsecurity. We have heard for the last hour discussions of security, and \nthere are many different aspects to the question of security.\n  Are we secure in this world in which we live? Well, there are a lot \nof problems. To be sure, we can worry about China and the South China \nSea, and we do. Certainly, in the Middle East, where I recently visited \nthe Gulf States and Iran, there are a lot of concerns there.\n  As you move into Iraq, there are the issues of ISIL, al Qaeda and, of \ncourse, the great tragedy that is occurring in Syria where, basically, \ncities are simply being destroyed, obviously, the churches, the \nmonasteries, the mosques--boom--housing.\n  There are well over 270,000 people--Christians, Muslims, and others--\nkilled in the Syrian civil war and the resultant desire by people to \nget out of there. Immigration issues are abounding. Certainly, they \naffect us here in the United States.\n  There are many other security issues beyond those that make the \nheadlines. There are security issues in our homes. For example, do we \nhave a job? Well, that is a big issue.\n  Often here on the floor, in days gone by, I would stand with my \ncolleagues and we would talk about creating jobs in the United States. \nWe would talk about strategies of Make It In America, strategies to use \nour tax dollars to buy American-made products and services so that our \nmoney could be used to employ our own people and to support our own \nbusinesses.\n  These are all very, very important strategies. They do happen to do \nwith individual security, community security, and family security. So \nsecurity has many, many pieces.\n  Tonight I want to talk about one type of security. This is something \nthat affects every human being, every animal, large or small, from an \nelephant to the smallest mouse. This security issue is one that affects \nevery form of life. It is called water. It is called water.\n  This is the most basic of security issues. You don't go but a day or \n2, maybe 3, days, if you are not doing much and it is really not very \nhot, without water. It is essential. This is a bottom-line security \nissue.\n  If you don't have water, you are insecure. If you don't have water, \nyou will very soon be dead. If you have poisonous water, you may not \ndie immediately, but it will certainly affect you.\n  Let's take a look at this. This is water from Flint, Michigan, United \nStates of America. There are roughly 100,000 human beings in Flint, \nMichigan.\n  Well, among the most essential of all of the things we need for life, \nfor security, is water. That is Flint, Michigan, water, a city of \n100,000 people in the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Oh, we would like to think of ourselves as being the most advanced \nplace in the world. That is Flint, Michigan, water. Nine thousand \nchildren under the age of 4 or 5 have been drinking that water \ncontaminated with lead for about 14 months.\n  I am not going to go into the reasons why that tragedy is occurring. \nThere are many. There is an FBI investigation and there are questions \nabout the Governor of Michigan and the way in which it was done, but I \nam not going to go there today.\n  I want to go to something else that we are responsible for here in \nthe House of Representatives and our colleagues across the Capitol in \nthe U.S. Senate. I want to talk about our responsibility here because \nthis is our business.\n  If we are concerned about security--and we are--we should--and we \ndo--talk about al Qaeda. We should--and we do--talk about ISIS. We \nshould--and we do--talk about refugees and whether they are safe or \nnot. We talk about San Bernardino and the great tragedy there. We \nshould talk about it, and we should do something about it.\n  There is another side of security that we have specific \nresponsibility to deal with. In 1974, we set out to clean up the waters \nof the United States with the Clean Water Act. Over the years, it has \nbeen amended. In 1996, we set standards for clean water and we provided \nsome funding.\n  If someone were to grade us on our success in addressing one of the \nfundamental security issues, that is, the ability to have clean, \ndrinkable water, here is the scorecard. Let's take a look at it. Let's \nsee.\n  We can run down through aviation, bridges. Oh, by the way, this is \nfrom the American Society of Civil Engineers. They produce a scorecard \non how well this great Nation, the United States of America, is doing \non providing fundamental security.\n  Aviation, bridges, dams, drinking water: D. Today, at a hearing on \nwater, the Society of Civil Engineers said we have got a D on drinking \nwater.\n  Somebody asked them: Is that the bottom grade?\n\n[[Page H490]]\n\n  They said: Well, pretty much because if you go to an F, it is too \nmuch paperwork. So they just stop at D. D.\n  We fancy ourselves to be the greatest place in the world, the most \nadvanced economy. All the way down this list are D's, a couple of C's. \nOur infrastructure doesn't rank among the best in the world. In fact, \nwe rank about where developing countries are.\n  So what is the result of all of this? Well, Flint, Michigan, water, \nwould you drink it? For 100,000 people in Flint, Michigan, that is \ntheir water supply. Without water, you don't live.\n  Closer to my home in Porterville, California, a city of a few tens of \nthousands of people, no water. So they truck it in. I have got one of \nthose on my ranch. It is called a livestock water trough. That is where \nthe kids get their water in the United States of America.\n  Oh, we think we are good. Security comes in many forms. Drinking \nwater. So why does this happen? Why is it that, in this great Nation, \nall of us, 435 here, and another 100 across the Capitol--why is it \nFlint Michigan, Porterville, California, a half a dozen other cities in \nCalifornia, no water or contaminated water?\n  Just in December it was reported that, in about a half a dozen \ncommunities in the San Joaquin Valley of California, the uranium in the \nwater has reached a level beyond that which is allowed. That is okay. \nIt is only going to be cancer.\n  Uranium, fine. Flint, Michigan, Porterville, communities throughout \nthis Nation. Oh, Toledo, Ohio. I remember Toledo, Ohio, last year shut \ndown its water system because of contamination from algae in the lake. \nAmerica. Why? Why?\n  Here is why. A sharp drop in government infrastructure spending. Oh, \ngovernment infrastructure spending. Federal Government infrastructure \nspending. For 435 of us; this is our job.\n  Oh, let's see. This is 2002. Somewhere--oh, these are real dollars, \ndisinflated, $325 billion. In 2014--that is 12 years later--$210 \nbillion. That is what happens. That is what happens when you don't have \nwater in Porterville. That is what happens when you have uranium and \nthe inability to take it out because you can't afford the systems. That \nis what happens in Flint, Michigan.\n  Let's take another look at those numbers, another way to look at it. \nSpending on clean water and drinking water infrastructure. In 2014 \ndollars--these are constant dollars across the way--1973, is that \nRonald Reagan? I think so. No. Actually, it was a little later.\n  That wasn't Reagan. It is the end of--what did we spend in 1973 in \nconsistent 2014 dollars? We spent about $10 billion. Okay. In 1990, we \nspent about $6 billion. Again, these are dollars all consistent for \n2016 dollars. In 1999, we are down to about just under $4 billion. In \n2005, we get down to about $3.5 billion. In 2016, bingo, $2 billion.\n  You wonder why we have a D? You wonder why the water systems break. \n240,000 water mains broke last year in the United States. You see the \npictures of the sinkholes. That is not a geological issue. That is a \nwater main issue. A water main is broken, washed out the street, washed \nout the community, and the houses fall into it. Not all of them, but \nthat is basically it. 240,000 of those last year.\n  What are we doing? Are we building new, high-quality water systems \nfor our community? No, we are not. I will tell you what we are doing. \nOver the next few years, we are going to spend a trillion dollars in \nthe next 20 years on rebuilding--that is a trillion dollars, not a \nbillion--a trillion dollars--on rebuilding our entire nuclear warfare \nsystem. Every bomb, new airplanes, new missiles, new intercontinental \nballistic missiles, new submarines, a trillion dollars. And this number \ncompetes with that trillion dollars.\n  We make choices around here, folks. We make choices on how we are \ngoing to spend your tax money. We are going to spend it on nuclear \nbombs that go big in a big way, on new stealth bombers, new \nintercontinental ballistic missiles, new submarines, new dial-a-bomb--\ndial it up, it goes big; dial it down, it goes small--so that we can \nuse it as a tactical nuclear weapon. Whoa. We are making choices here.\n\n  I can go on for some time about this. I get pretty excited about it. \nI get pretty dismayed. When I am in Brussels, as I was last week, \nreturning from the Gulf States--Oman, Dubai, Abu Dhabi, Qatar, \nBahrain--looking at what is going on there, this is what I saw: I saw \nenormous problems. But I also saw a modern infrastructure. Go to \nBrussels. Look at their airport. Then go to an American airport.\n  Water. Water. Flint, Michigan, water. State of Michigan, United \nStates of America, that is the water that 100,000 Americans are forced \nto drink. We have got a Clean Water Act. We have got the laws in place \nto build our water systems.\n  So what do we do? Well, I guess we would rather rebuild the B61 \nnuclear bomb rather than building a water system for Americans for the \nsecurity of 100,000 people.\n  I live a long way from Flint, Michigan, but the guy I am going to \ncall on, that is his home. That is where he was raised. Those are the \npeople he represents.\n  Dan Kildee, you have been on this issue for weeks and months. You \nhave been sounding the alarm. You have been calling us out. You have \nbeen calling us out, all 435 of us and the Senate and the \nadministration. You have been calling us out, and you are doing the \nwork of securing the safety of the people in your community. Please \njoin me, Dan Kildee, from Michigan.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Well, first of all, let me thank my friend, Mr. \nGaramendi, not just for that introduction and for his comments about my \nhometown, but for his leadership on this issue.\n  This is the critical issue that really determines whether we are \ncompetitive as a Nation. But it goes beyond competitiveness. It is the \nissue that will determine whether we have true national security. But \nit goes beyond national security. Sometimes it is a matter of life and \ndeath. Sometimes it is really a matter of health.\n  In my hometown, the issue of failed infrastructure, particularly of \nthe State of Michigan and their failure to manage infrastructure, let \nalone reinvest in it potentially, will affect not just 100,000 people, \nall of the citizens there, but, most importantly, will affect the \ntrajectory of the lives of 9,000 children under the age of 6 who, for \nthe last year and a half, have been drinking water that has elevated \nlead levels well beyond what normally would be required in order to \ntake drastic action to correct the problem.\n  And it was largely overlooked because of a failed philosophy of \ngovernment in the State of Michigan that put short-term interest, \nshort-term dollars-and-cents measures of success, ahead of not just \nlong-term investment, but ahead of the lives of children that has \nresulted in this terrible tragedy.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  I will just take a moment to tell you what happened and to support \nthe efforts of my friend Mr. Garamendi in continuing to raise this \nquestion.\n  The letter grade graph he showed regarding clean drinking water \nshowed in the aggregate a grade of D. In Flint, it was an F. It was a \nfailing grade.\n  So, the failure to invest in infrastructure, and particularly urban \ninfrastructure--roads, bridges, and water--led to significant economic \ndifficulty in my hometown of Flint. The failure of the State to support \ncities--and, in fact, they cut direct support in cities--resulted in my \nhometown going into financial stress. The State then appointed a \nreceiver to take over the city.\n  Rather than provide support, rather than rebuild, it appointed a \nreceiver, a financial manager, to go in with one tool, and one tool \nonly, and that was a scalpel, to cut the budget of a city that was \nreally begging for investment. Instead of investment, more cuts.\n  One of the cuts was, for a temporary period of time until a regional \npipeline to Lake Huron was completed, to draw drinking water from the \nFlint River, which for decades functioned as an open industrial sewer.\n  In the State of Michigan, where we have the world's greatest source \nof surface water, freshwater, there was a decision to use the Flint \nRiver. But because of our aging infrastructure, old infrastructure, and \nlots of lead pipes, including thousands and thousands of lead service \nlines to homes, and the failure of the State to manage this process and \ntreat the water effectively, highly corrosive water leached lead into \nthe drinking water, and 100,000\n\n[[Page H491]]\n\npeople have been subjected to elevated lead levels. Thousands of \nchildren have potentially been affected.\n  The sad story here is that it all could have easily been prevented \nwith just a little bit of investment and better management of the \ninfrastructure. But we take water infrastructure for granted, as if all \nwe have to do is turn on the faucet and the water will appear. No, it \ntakes investment; it takes money; it takes resources. In this case, the \nState's failure has resulted in something that we hope is not repeated \nacross this country; but without investment, there will be more Flint, \nMichigans.\n  So what we need now is to call upon the State particularly to make \nthe kind of investment in Flint to make it right. As I said, 9,000 \nchildren in the city of Flint under the age of 6 have substantially \nelevated lead levels from the water that showed up in their blood in \ntests done by a courageous pediatrician, Dr. Mona Hanna-Attisha, who \nwas one of the people who blew the whistle on this.\n  So now we have a crisis in Flint. We have a loss of faith in \ngovernment. But it is a crisis because this city is really at risk. We \nneed significant investment to make it right. That investment would \ncome in the form of a long overdue replacement of those lead service \nlines, that lead piping that is outdated, obsolete, and dangerous. \nBecause of the failure to deal with this when it was a less expensive \ninvestment, we now have, I think, a very important moral responsibility \non the State of Michigan to take care of the unique needs that these \nchildren will face as they go through their developmental stages. We \nneed early childhood education for all of them. We need good \nnutritional programming--and not just to make it available, but to \nensure sure they have good nutrition. We need additional help in the \nschools. We need behavioral support.\n  There are consequences. There are human consequences to this failure. \nIt is not just that the water looks bad, smells bad, tastes bad. It is \nunhealthy.\n  Again, I hope Flint's experience can be an experience for the rest of \nthe country, because the way our State treated the people of Flint was \nas if they didn't matter. They allowed this infrastructure to atrophy, \nallowed the city to atrophy, didn't support redevelopment, didn't \nsupport even the basic need of $140 a day to provide corrosion control \ntreatment in this aging water system. All of that could have prevented \nthis terrible tragedy, but they didn't do it.\n  So now the State of Michigan bears the principal responsibility. I am \ndoing everything I can to get Federal help for this, but the State of \nMichigan bears the principal responsibility. As far as I am concerned, \nit is up to them to make it right.\n  The message that my friend has been bringing to this Congress when it \ncomes to this question of infrastructure is that Flint proves that it \nmatters what we do here. It matters what we do in this House. The fact \nis we have known as a Nation for a long time that, if we are going to \nbe safe, if we are going to be competitive, if we are going to be \nhealthy, we have to invest in that which we take for granted.\n  Think about it, water, drinkable water. Most people in this room, \nmost people in America never give it a second thought. You just turn on \nthe faucet and it is there. It is literally what we depend upon for our \nvery lives. In Flint, Michigan, because of this terrible failure, not \nonly was it not safe, but we poisoned 9,000 children as a result.\n  There are consequences to what we do here, and there are consequences \nto what we don't do here. So for those Members who have expressed their \nsympathy, I appreciate that, I sincerely do. But the children of Flint, \nthe people of Flint, and, frankly, the people of Porterville and \neverywhere else need more than sympathy. We need investment. We need \nthis Congress and this country to step up and do what it is right and \ninvest in our own future, because if we don't, as you can tell, there \nare consequences.\n  Thank you for your leadership on this.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Kildee, thank you so very much for the work that \nyou are doing sounding the alarm and driving all of us. I know you did \nthis morning in our Caucus. You alerted us to it. You motivated us. \nAnd, in fact, I am talking about it tonight because of your motivation \nthat you gave to me and to our colleagues this morning.\n  You spoke here a little bit about the human consequences. I would \nlike you to take another run around this on how we bear--the community \nof America, and more specifically, Michigan--the responsibility of \ncaring for addressing the human problem that now exists.\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. I thank you for that question, because that is really the \ncore of what we are dealing with right now.\n  We need a lot of help in Flint. This could have been avoided. But now \nthat this has occurred, there is some work we need to do to fix the \npipes. There is some work we need to do to make sure the emergency \nneeds are met--temporary water. But the real need is this human need.\n  Lead is a neurotoxin. It affects development of the brain. The \ncitizens who are most at risk are those children who are still in those \nearly developmental stages, particularly children age 6 and under. \nLiterally, children feeding, drinking formula made with this water will \nhave the trajectory of their lives potentially affected.\n  The thing that I think is important to keep in mind is, first of all, \nFlint is a tough town. We can live through this; we can get through \nthis; we can succeed; but we are going to need resources. We need \nresources, really, to come from the people who did this to us, which is \nthe State government with, I think, a completely bankrupt philosophy \nthat basically says you are on your own.\n  Well, you are not on your own when it comes to drinking water. We all \nexpect drinking water to be clean. We have every right to expect that. \nIt is a human right.\n  But what we need now and what I think is morally required is to wrap \nour arms around these kids. We know that when it comes to brain \ndevelopment and challenges the kids might face, whether it is from a \ndevelopmental question from some other source or derived from lead \nexposure, the more we do to help those children develop as early as \npossible, the better they will do in the long term.\n  So, I will have legislation that I will introduce this week that puts \nFederal support in--and requires the State of Michigan to come up with \nits share, because they did this--so that we expand Head Start, Early \nHead Start, and that we give those kids the early opportunity to expand \ntheir minds; also, that we get them nutritional support, because we \nknow that good, nutritious food--milk, for example--is very helpful in \ngetting kids through lead exposure with minimal impact.\n  Now, it is only to mitigate the damages and help these kids overcome, \nbut what we need to do now as a community is what we would do for any \nchild facing a developmental challenge. It is early childhood \neducation. It is nutritional support. It is a school nurse, for \nexample. We have gone so far in this country that we don't even fund \nthe basics that we all grew up with. We all had a school nurse. You go \nto Flint, Michigan, a city of 100,000 people, and we have one school \nnurse.\n  Also, it is after-school programming, enrichment opportunities. Most \nof the kids in my hometown, sadly, already have hurdles in front of \nthem because of the misfortune of being born into poverty. They don't \nhave the kind of opportunities that many kids take for granted: piano \nlessons, dance, art, after-school activities, gym time, a summer \nprogram. Maybe for the older kids, a summer job.\n  That is the kind of help that will be required in order to move these \nkids from where they were headed before this crisis occurred and what \nthe trajectory of their lives looks like right now.\n  So the point is there are human consequences for the failure to do \nthis right in the first place. And when we have a State government that \nfailed these kids, they now have a moral obligation to step up and \nactually take care of their needs going forward.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. If I might interrupt you for a moment, this morning \nyou spoke of a young child that was interviewed. Would you please share \nthat?\n  Mr. KILDEE. I will. I read this. It came from a writer from Detroit, \na guy named Mitch Albom, who most people\n\n[[Page H492]]\n\nknow for having written a bestseller, ``Tuesdays with Morrie.'' He came \nto Flint to interview children and to talk about what this whole \nexperience meant to them.\n  One young man said something which, in a very poignant way, in a \nreally eloquent way, describes what exactly happened in Flint. The \nlittle boy said that he was afraid that he wouldn't be smart now, that \nhe wouldn't be smart.\n  It just occurred to me what a terrible crime this is, the failure of \nadults to manage the government in a way that takes the concerns of the \nlife of a child into account and looks only at a balance sheet, only at \na quarterly earnings statement--maybe the longest term that they look \nat it is an annual financial report--and wouldn't consider the fact \nthat the result would be to have a young 8- or 9-year-old boy say to \nhimself, ``I am afraid I won't be smart.''\n  What does that do to that kid's hopes for himself, whether the \ncognitive, behavioral, or developmental impact of lead would have any \nsubstantial effect on him or her, kids that are in Flint? The fact that \nthe lack of action by the government gives them doubt about their own \nfuture, doubt about their own capacity is just heartbreaking.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Kildee, thank you very, very much.\n  ``I am afraid I won't be smart enough.'' I wonder if we should ask \nourselves if we are smart enough. Are we smart enough? There are 435 of \nus facing a myriad of questions around this world and some of them in \nour own hometowns. Are we smart enough?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H492-1", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. Kaptur (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for February 1 on account \nof travel delay.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "02"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/02/02/house-section/article/H492-2", "month": "02", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H492]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              ADJOURNMENT\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI.
