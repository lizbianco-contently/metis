Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the extraordinary \nachievements of Martin and Catherine Terbrack of Troy, Michigan. Mr. \nand Mrs. Terbrack were recently recognized by CARE House of Oakland \nCounty as Foster Parents of the Year.\n  CARE House is a wonderful organization in southeast Michigan that \nprovides services and counseling to children who are victims of abuse.\n  The Terbracks have cared for 33 children, newborn babies to 5-year-\nold kids, and are currently caring for a 14-month-old baby girl who was \n6 weeks old and weighed only 4 pounds when they brought her into their \nhome.\n  The Terbrack family has been involved in fostering for an amazing 73 \nyears, with Martin's mother, Peggy, having cared for 150 children. That \nequates to about 90,000 bottles and 220,000 diapers.\n  Mr. Speaker, at a time when many have come to see our Nation defined \nby acrimony and division, the wonderful story of Martin and Catherine \nTerbrack of Troy, Michigan, reminds us all that there is more good in \nthis world than bad.\n  They have taught us that many of our problems we face can be solved \nwith love and generosity, and they remind us that we all have the power \nto touch people's lives for the better.\n  Martin and Catherine do that every day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2113-7", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2113]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 4651\n\n  Ms. DelBENE.

Mr. Speaker, this Saturday, April 30, marks 41 years \nsince the fall of Saigon, commemorated as Black April in Vietnamese \nAmerican communities across this Nation.\n\n[[Page H2114]]\n\n  I introduced a resolution in remembrance of this event, and to honor \nthe contributions and the sacrifices of Vietnamese Americans.\n  In addition, this week, in front of my congressional office, I am \nflying the Vietnamese Heritage and Freedom Flag, as recognized by \nStates and localities across this country.\n  As we remember the fall of Saigon, I also believe it is critically \nimportant to continue to shine a light on human rights abuses in \nVietnam.\n  When President Obama visits Vietnam next week, I hope he will make \nhuman rights a priority. Now is exactly the right time for Vietnam to \nbegin respecting the rights of its own citizens.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         AUTISM AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  (Mr. DOLD asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because April is Autism Awareness \nMonth.\n  Autism is a condition that affects more than 3 million Americans and \ntheir families. Those living with autism spectrum disorders face \nchallenges on a daily basis.\n  Though we have come a long way, much more must be done to ensure a \nhigh quality of life for all. Some of this work needs to happen right \nhere in the United States Congress, but much of this work also needs to \nhappen in our homes and in our communities.\n  That is why, together with my Disability Awareness Advisory Board, I \nhave been fighting for greater acceptance and understanding, working to \nensure that those with autism have greater access to education and \nemployment and have the place they deserve within our community.\n  One of the great organizations in Illinois' 10th Congressional \nDistrict is Lambs Farm. Those with developmental disabilities served by \nLambs Farm are provided the opportunity to advance in all areas of life \nthrough ever-increasing residential, vocational, and recreational \nchoices.\n  Together, we are striving for a society where those living with \nautism and other disabilities are free to pursue their passions, \nreceive a high-quality education, and have their unique gifts \ncelebrated.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BOOSTING AMERICA'S EXPORTS ACT\n\n  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, for corporations with a boardroom full of \nlawyers and thousands of employees, exporting products is something \nthey do every day.\n  But for a small-business owner or startup entrepreneurs in places \nlike Rockford, Galesburg, Peoria, or the Quad Cities, the deck is \nstacked against them on the global economic playing field.\n  That is why today I introduced the Boosting America's Export Act. It \nwill help small- and medium-sized businesses expand economic \nopportunity and create more good-paying American jobs.\n  My bill will identify and assist small businesses that have the \npotential to sell the products in new markets.\n  We already know that small businesses create two out of every three \njobs and, by building a business climate that helps them grow and \nsucceed, we will strengthen working families across our Nation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to stand \nwith me in this effort.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              INVESTMENT SPURRED BY SOUND FIDUCIARY RULES\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the House passed H.J. Res. 88, a \nmeasure to reject the Department of Labor's misguided fiduciary rule.\n  Just like ObamaCare gets between you and your doctor, this conflict-\nof-interest rule attempts to put Washington between you and your \nfinancial adviser, insisting on a broad, onerous piece of regulation \nrather than a simple solution based on best business practices that \nattracts plaintiff attorneys and a bonanza of new lawsuits.\n  Even State officials in New York, which is a Democratic stronghold, \nhave proposed simpler solutions that inform consumers without burdening \ninvestment businesses, if only the Department of Labor would listen.\n  I implore the Senate to pass this measure and the President to listen \nto State officials, actual financial investors, and small investors, \nwho have developed a better alternative, by signing this legislation \ninto law and not stymieing investment for families and our economy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 LET'S DO SOMETHING ABOUT GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, an American is killed with a gun every 16 \nminutes. And what is Congress' response?\n  Well, here is what we have become really good at. We have become \nreally good at coming together for moments of silence. We do it every \ntime there is a mass shooting. And, in 2015, there were 330 mass \nshootings.\n  We ask: Why can't we do more?\n  And our response, the response too often, is: We don't need to do \nanything else. There are plenty of laws on the books.\n  Why don't we enforce them? Well, the fact is that there is one thing \nwe can do that is not on the books. We can require that everyone who \nbuys a gun has a background check.\n  If you buy a gun in a store, you have to get a background check. But \nfor gun shows, 100 gun shows a week, 5,200 gun shows a year, 5 million \npeople traveling through those gun shows, there is no background check.\n  There is no background check for the millions of Internet ads or \nclassified ads.\n  Let's pass mandatory background checks to help keep guns out of the \nhands of dangerous people. That is what we can do, Mr. Speaker.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is too much at stake for us to continue to ignore \nthis tragedy. It is time for Congress to act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2114]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RURAL HEALTH ACT OF 2016\n\n  (Mr. HARDY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, last fall a hospital in my State closed its \ndoors after years of being the only hospital within a 100-mile radius. \nUnlike in more populated communities, when a rural hospital closes, \nresidents can be left with the frightening reality that emergency \nmedical care and medical care services may be too far away.\n  Sadly, this is not the only isolated incident. More than 30 percent \nof America's rural hospitals are vulnerable to the conditions that may \nhave caused the closure of 71 facilities in the last 6 years. The \nnumbers increase each year, and we have to act now to prevent more \nfamilies from losing their lifelines in times of emergency.\n  That is why I am introducing the bipartisan Rural Health Act of 2016. \nIt will support existing rural hospitals by strengthening resources for \nState Offices of Rural Health and incentivize construction of new \nfacilities for those communities in need.\n  Our rural communities need our attention. We cannot let them down.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2114-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2114-H2115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HEROIN AND OPIOID ADDICTION\n\n  (Mr. FOSTER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. FOSTER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the memory of those we \nhave lost to heroin and opioid addiction.\n  Another 30 people are likely to die today, another 30 lives lost on \ntop of the thousands that we are losing each year to this epidemic. We \nhave lost daughters and sons, fathers and mothers, sisters, brothers. \nFriends, acquaintances, and coworkers alike have lost their battles \nwith addiction.\n  Too often their deaths have been cloaked in the shadows. Obituaries \nremain silent on the cause of death. For too long our society has \nviewed opioid\n\n[[Page H2115]]\n\naddiction as simply a moral failing rather than the treatable medical \ncondition that it is.\n  While opioid addiction may start with an excessive prescription or an \nindiscretion of youth, it ends with a scientifically understood, \nincreasingly treatable, medical condition in which the biochemical \npathways necessary to normal decisionmaking in the brain have been \nhijacked and the chemistry of the brain permanently altered.\n  Heroin does not discriminate. It does not care if you are rich or \npoor, Black or White, a devoted mother, or a loving child. None of us \nare immune to its chemical grips.\n  So today I pay my respects. Those who fall prey to opioids are worthy \nof being mourned. They are not forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2115-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            WE NEED TO INVESTIGATE COMMUNITY HEALTH CENTERS\n\n  (Mr. PITTS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PITTS.

The fact that abortions are performed at these \nfederally funded community health center clinics is astonishing.\n  We put our confidence in them, as providers of life-affirming women's \nhealth care, based on their commitment to not entangle such care with \nabortion. Abortion is not health care.\n  Mr. Speaker, we need an investigation into Community Health Centers \nto determine how many of their clinics are providing for, referring, or \nperforming abortions, and the National Association of Community Health \nCenters should expel this network of New York clinics from their \nassociation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2115-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2115]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  0915\n                         NATIONAL REENTRY WEEK\n\n  (Ms. BASS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. BASS.

Mr. Jerrel McCoy lives in south L.A. He is 45 \nyears old and served 27 years in a California prison.

Official Code) is \n     amended--\n       (1) by redesignating paragraphs (1) through (10) as \n     paragraphs (2) through (11), respectively;\n       (2) by inserting before paragraph (2), as redesignated by \n     paragraph (1), the following:\n       ``(1) Core subject matter.--The term `core subject matter' \n     means--\n       ``(A) mathematics;\n       ``(B) science; and\n       ``(C) English, reading, or language arts.''; and\n       (3) in paragraph (4)(B)(ii), as redesignated by paragraph \n     (1), by inserting ``household with a'' before ``student''.\n\n     SEC. 12.

EFFECTIVE DATE.\n\n       Except as otherwise provided, the amendments made by this \n     Act shall apply with respect to school year 2017-2018 and \n     each succeeding school year.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform.\n  The gentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) and the gentlewoman from the \nDistrict of Columbia (Ms. Norton) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on H.R. 4901.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are here to pass an important bill, Mr. Speaker. This bill is H.R. \n4901, known as the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nReauthorization Act, or SOAR.\n  The SOAR Act continues a three-sector approach to education within \nthe District of Columbia. The bill provides equal funding to D.C. \npublic schools, D.C. public charter schools, and the Opportunity \nScholarship Program which is commonly known as the OSP.\n  The OSP provides scholarships to students of low-income families, \nmany of whom would otherwise attend low-performing schools. This \nprogram is bringing about educational opportunities to those who need \nit most.\n  Now, to some, this may sound familiar because in October of last \nyear, we considered H.R. 10, also a bill to reauthorize the SOAR Act. \nBut H.R. 4901 is very similar to H.R. 10; however, after H.R. 10 passed \nthe House, changes were made to it through a bipartisan negotiation \nwith the Senate. These changes actually strengthened the bill, and we \nare pleased to support this today.\n  The new bill brings greater transparency and accountability to the \nOSP through increased reporting requirements. The new bill strengthens \naccreditation requirements, and the new bill clarifies congressional \nintent around the use of carryover funds and access to the OSP. Out of \na commitment to regular order and the understanding of how important \nthis legislation is, we wanted Members to have the opportunity to \ndebate and vote on these changes, which we did in our committee, and it \npassed out of our committee. Thus, we introduced H.R. 4901.\n  We improved the legislation, and now we are bringing it before the \nChamber in an effort to pass the bill in its best possible form. I hope \nthe House will see the value of this bill as it benefits families in \nthe District, specifically low-income families in the District of \nColumbia.\n  The average income of a family with an OSP student is $22,000 per \nyear. Let me say that again. The average income of a family with an OSP \nstudent is $22,000. This program offers these families more than just a \nscholarship, it is a lifeline. One OSP parent went so far as to \ndescribe the OSP as her salvation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the OSP is working. In the 2014-2015 school year, OSP \nstudents had a graduation rate of 90 percent. Ninety percent graduation \nrate. That should indicate to a lot of people that this thing is \nworking. That is well above the national average of 82 percent and is \ncertainly better than the average within the D.C. public schools, which \nis only about 64 percent.\n  However, I would be remiss if I did not note that the D.C. public \nschools increased their graduation rate 6 percentage points from 2014 \nto 2015, and we applaud that and hope that continues. That is in part \nbecause this three-sector approach is actually working.\n  Opponents of the SOAR Act want to stop this legislation because they \ndisagree with the OSP for purely ideological reasons. In fact, \nopponents, just like their supporters, know that OSP students do as \nwell, if not better, on every measure compared to the public school \ncounterparts. Opponents will likely even support allowing current OSP \nstudents to remain in the program until they finish high school.\n  If the OSP is so bad, though, it makes no sense to allow children to \nremain in it. The truth is that the program works, and we should \nreauthorize it so it can work for even more children. Unfortunately, \nopponents of the OSP will seek to end the entire three-sector approach \nin an effort to simply stop the OSP.\n  I do want to note that the Washington, D.C., Mayor, the D.C. Council \nchairman, and seven other members of the D.C. Council sent a letter to \nthe congressional leadership urging the reauthorization of this \nprogram. The Mayor and a majority of the D.C. Council recognize the \nvalue of this legislation and are asking that we stand with them and \nnot forsake the children of the District of Columbia.\n  A March 2016 letter signed by the Mayor and 8 of the 13 Members of \nthe D.C. Council supporting the SOAR Act will be entered into the \nRecord. The letter states: ``These funds are critical to the gains that \nthe District's public education system has seen in recent years.''\n  It goes on to note how important the SOAR Act has been in maintaining \nand recruiting quality teachers and principals. District officials show \nstrong support for this legislation, as does the Washington, D.C., \ncommunity.\n  We are thrilled to have found common ground on this bill, and I \nwelcome the District's support. I thank them for their valuable work in \ngetting this legislation to this point. I am also excited that the SOAR \nAct is supported by the Washington Post. I will be inserting in the \nRecord a position they took on March 14, 2016, to that effect.\n  Mr. Speaker, the SOAR Act's purpose is to improve education within \nthe District, and I believe it is doing just that within public \nschools, charter schools, and the OSPs. It is providing families with a \nvaluable choice, and it is allowing them to escape other situations \nthat would not be nearly as conducive to their families.\n  I don't understand why the critics of the OSP are so opposed to the \nprogram, especially since it produces graduation rates far above the \nnational average. This feat is even more notable when you realize that \nthe OSP achieves better graduation rates than D.C. public schools at \nonly two-thirds of the cost, so you get better graduation rates, and it \nis two-thirds of the cost of D.C. public schools.\n  I recognize the importance of our public education system and the \nneed for public school improvement. That is why the legislation also \nauthorizes funds for public education. We must recognize the reality \nbefore us. This past year, D.C. eighth graders had the lowest test \nscores in the Nation in math and reading, some of the most critical \nskills that they need to be successful in life. While D.C. public \nschools have made progress, clearly, much remains to be done.\n  Mr. Speaker, students within the District should not have to wait for \nthese changes to come about. They deserve an alternative, a quality \neducation, and they deserve it now. Let's work to improve public \neducation in the District, but let's not hold back current students \nwhile those improvements happen. Let's allow them every opportunity \navailable, such as an opportunity scholarship.\n  We are here today to debate a bill that works in every way to further \nthe educational outcomes of Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Speaker, also let me just take a personal note to thank Speaker \nBoehner for his passion on this issue. For years he has championed \nthis. He has done it in his private time, he did it in his public life, \nhe did it as a Member of Congress, and he did it as the Speaker of the \nHouse. This was his. He championed this. It has been successful, and I \nam glad to carry the baton and make sure that there is school choice \nwithin Washington, D.C.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a mother, I believe parents should seize any and \nevery educational opportunity available to their\n\n[[Page H2119]]\n\nchildren, so I certainly have no criticism of my own constituents who \nhave seized this opportunity. In fact, in order to avoid disruption of \nthe education of the current voucher students, I believe they should be \nallowed to remain in the program until high school graduation, and \nPresident Obama has offered a compromise to allow them to do so.\n  Consideration of this bill surely is unprecedented. Until today, I \nhad never seen the House vote on virtually the same bill a second time \nin the same Congress, and that is about to happen here. The House, \nacted in October.\n  Why is this House acting redundantly again? Shouldn't the focus be on \nthe Republican-led Senate where neither this bill--which is virtually \nthe same as the bill that was passed before--nor its Senate companion \nhas moved?\n  Last December, the Senate committee of jurisdiction canceled a \nscheduled markup of the bill to protect Republicans from this bill and \nespecially from the civil rights amendments that had been proposed to \nthe bill. Just last month, Chairman Chaffetz himself--who is the \nchairman of the authorizing committee, and the subcommittee--requested \nthat the bill be included in the upcoming--the upcoming--2017 \nappropriation bill because the chairman, knows that legislation on an \nappropriation is how this bill is going to be passed.\n  The problem is that there is little congressional support for \nvouchers except for vouchers in the District of Columbia, where nobody \ncan vote for anybody except this Member. Congress has refused to create \na national voucher program. Just last year during reauthorization of \nthe Elementary and Secondary Education Act, both the House and the \nSenate voted on several national voucher amendments, and each failed. \nSo you see, they don't want vouchers in their own districts.\n  Moreover, the Congress has never authorized the D.C. voucher program \nin the light of day. When Congress first created the program in 2004, \nand then reauthorized it in 2011, it did so by adding the voucher bill \nas riders to appropriations bills. And to protect Republican Senators \nrunning for reelection this year, that is what is going to happen \nagain. The Senate has never passed a standalone D.C. vouchers bill, and \nyet it is being reauthorized now for the third time.\n  In this Congress alone, Republicans have introduced legislation to \noverturn D.C.'s gun safety laws, its laws on reproductive health, its \nlaws on nondiscrimination, its laws on marijuana, on labor, on \nimmigration, and on education. It is, therefore, ironic to hear \nRepublicans favorably cite the support of some D.C. government \nofficials for passage of this bill.\n  Now, let me explain that because I don't want my colleagues to get \naway with mischaracterizing the position of the D.C. government on the \nbill before us today. When the House voted this bill last year, a \nmajority of the D.C. Council wrote to Congress opposed to this voucher \nprogram. Last month, however, fearing the loss of $40 million for \npublic and charter schools, a bare majority wrote in support of this \nbill. You can't blame them.\n  I must say though, I am being hoisted on my own petard here. \nIronically, the funding for public schools and public charter schools \nexists only because during the creation of the voucher program, I \nrepeatedly said that funding for public and charter schools was the \npreference of D.C. residents. To his everlasting credit, the then-\nArchbishop of Washington then insisted that public and charter schools \nalso receive funding in conjunction with the voucher funding.\n  The D.C. Mayor and a bare majority this year of the council sent a \ncarefully crafted letter supporting this bill because they knew they \nwere writing for the residents of the District of Columbia who do not \nsupport vouchers. Their letter did not support the voucher program \nitself, but referred only to the bill's public and charter school \nfunding.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Those who signed the letter, by the way, were even more concerned \nthat the Congress, instead, could pass the radical Cruz-Meadows bill, \nwhich would permit D.C. students to use local funds, commandeer local \nfunds, from the D.C. treasury to pay for private schools.\n  City officials recognized--and who can blame them--that Republicans \nhave conditioned reauthorization of the public and charter school \nfunding on reauthorization of the voucher funding. I understand their \nconcern about losing public and charter school funding because it has \nbeen part of the city's education budget for a decade.\n  There is, of course, no reason for a unique Federal voucher program \nin the District of Columbia, in particular. According to the study of \nthe program's effectiveness mandated by Congress, by statute, the D.C. \nvoucher program has failed in its stated purpose. That purpose was to \nimprove academic achievement. The voucher program has not improved \nacademic achievement, as measured by math and reading test scores of \nstudents overall or of students the program prioritized from low-\nperforming public schools.\n  Republicans, rightly, were disappointed with these results, so guess \nwhat they did. Instead of getting rid of a failed program, they simply \nchanged the evaluation. The prior reauthorizations required the \nprogram's evaluation to be ``conducted using the strongest possible \nresearch designed,'' and a randomized controlled trial--the gold \nstandard--was therefore used.\n  It is almost laughable when somebody changes the test in order to \npass it. In contrast, this bill requires the evaluation to be \nconducted--this time--using an acceptable--that means any acceptable--\n``quasi-experimental research design'' and expressly prohibits the \nrandomized controlled trial that was mandated before.\n  This dishonesty is transparent, Mr. Speaker. As researchers \nconducting an evaluation of the program point out, a randomized \ncontrolled study ``is especially important in the context of school \nchoice because families wanting to apply for a choice program may have \neducational goals and aspirations that differ from the average \nfamily.''\n  The voucher program is also unnecessary. The District of Columbia has \nan unusually robust public school choice system, and it is available to \nevery student. Now, I would wager that the District's choice system is \nthe best in the Nation, and here is what it is.\n  Almost 50 percent of our children go to charter schools. Those \ncharter schools were authorized when I worked with Speaker Newt \nGingrich to allow charter schools instead of vouchers to be the \nDistrict's alternative school system. For the public schools, 75 \npercent of our children attend out-of-boundary public schools that they \nhave chosen. So I ask any Member who has public choice that robust to \nmake himself known during this debate.\n  The D.C. voucher program also exempts students from protection of \nFederal civil rights laws that apply to public and federally funded \nprograms. Under the voucher program, the Federal funding is considered \nassistance to the voucher student and not to the school, apparently in \norder to avoid these important mandates for our schools. Therefore, the \nprogram is not considered a federally funded program, although the \nmoney comes from Federal funds.\n  This program is exempt from title IV and title VI of the Civil Rights \nAct of 1964, from title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972, from \nthe Equal Educational Opportunities Act of 1974, the Individuals with \nDisabilities Education Act, the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, and titles \nII and III of the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990.\n  Everybody knows that this program is going to be reauthorized as a \nrider on an appropriations bill, which is how the D.C. vouchers bill \nhas always been enacted, in 2004 and again in 2011.\n  This is a masquerade here this morning. I am sorry Members had to be \nheld over. This could have been taken care of yesterday. Even if the \nbill is not reauthorized, however, everyone expects that Republicans \nwill continue to fund the three sectors, as they have always done.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is correct that the Republicans have \ncontinued to fund the three-sector approach in Washington, D.C., and I \nam proud of that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. \nMesser), the chairman of the Republican Policy Committee.\n  Mr. MESSER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4901, the\n\n[[Page H2120]]\n\nScholarships for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act.\n  I want to commend Chairman Chaffetz for his work on this important \npolicy and for continuing the legacy of former Speaker Boehner on this \nimportant issue.\n  Make no mistake about it, thousands of kids have access to the \nAmerican Dream because of Speaker Boehner's dedication to the D.C. \nOpportunity Scholarship Program and education choice across the \ncountry.\n  I met one of those students in February during a hearing on Capitol \nHill. Her name was Denisha Merriweather. Denisha provided some powerful \ntestimony that I will not soon forget. She spoke of being locked in a \nfailing school, and she said: ``When I was growing up, college was a \ndream that I didn't even know that I had, and if it weren't for an \neducational option Florida gave me 12 years ago, I wouldn't be here \ntoday.''\n  Ms. Merriweather is the first in her family to graduate from high \nschool and college, and she is now attending graduate school. That is \npowerful stuff, and it is just one example of the thousands of young \npeople in America whose lives have been changed by school choice.\n  As chairman of the Congressional School Choice Caucus, I believe \nevery child in America deserves the same kind of opportunity that \nDenisha had. But right now, for the majority of students in this \ncountry, real educational choice only exists if you can afford it.\n  Ask yourself this question: If your local school is failing your \nchild and you can't afford to move and you can't afford to pay for \nprivate school, what options do you really have?\n  Make no mistake about it, that is the truth for thousands of key \npeople here in Washington, D.C., and, frankly, all across the country. \nThey are locked in a failing school that is failing their child, and \nthey can't afford to move and they can't afford to pay for a private \nschool. They are stuck.\n  That is why school choice and the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram matters. Programs like D.C. OSP empower parents to choose the \nbest educational environment for their child, regardless of their \nincome, their ZIP Code, or their lot in life. And despite some of the \nrhetoric on the other side of the aisle, this program takes zero \ndollars from D.C. Public Schools--zero dollars. Yet D.C. OSP has a big \nimpact on D.C. students. In fact, the program lets more than 6,000 \nstudents attend the school that gives them the best opportunity to \nsucceed. And even better, an incredible 90 percent--90 percent--of D.C. \nOSP students graduate from high school on time, an incredible success.\n  It turns out that empowering parents and empowering students works. \nWe have miles to go before every kid in America has access to a great \nschool. This issue is far bigger than just D.C. schools. But today's \nbill will ensure that thousands of kids in Washington, D.C., have an \nopportunity, and every one of those kids matter.\n  This bill is worthy of our support. I ask my colleagues for their \nsupport.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, if the gentleman is so concerned about the \nmillions of parents who can't afford to send their children to private \nschools, his caucus had the perfect opportunity this year, because they \nhave such a strong majority, to, in fact, pass voucher amendments, and \nthey refused to do so for their own schools.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Connolly), my friend.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from the District of \nColumbia for yielding.\n  I rise in opposition to H.R. 4901.\n  Contrary to its title and contrary to what you just heard, this \nvoucher program for schoolchildren in the District of Columbia has \nneither expanded opportunities nor delivered results for those students \nand their families. It has actually proven to be an unwise and \nunwelcome use of tax dollars, which ought to be of great concern to my \ncolleagues on the other side of the aisle. Yet, rather than call for \nincreased scrutiny, they are forcing the House to once again vote on a \nbill on which this Chamber has already acted.\n  In successive reports on the effectiveness of this program, the \nDepartment of Education has determined that students using these \nvouchers saw no statistically significant improvement in their overall \nachievement in math or reading--none.\n  In addition, the Department found that both parents and students from \nschools in need of improvement, the program's intended beneficiaries, \nreported that their experience with the voucher program did not--not--\nimprove their level of satisfaction with the education system or the \neducation they were receiving.\n  I also find it extremely cynical that this reauthorization would \nweaken the very reporting requirements that have shown this program to \nbe ineffective. When you don't like the findings, I guess we suppress \nthem.\n  Further, the Government Accountability Office has cited the program \nfor not having sufficient financial controls and accountability \nmeasures, something I thought we favored. For example, the D.C. \nChildren and Youth Investment Trust Corporation, which administers the \nprogram, repeatedly failed to comply with statutory financial reporting \ndeadlines, and its ``policies and procedures lack detail in several \nareas related to school compliance and financial accounting'' to ensure \nFederal tax dollars are being used in accordance with the law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also hope the great irony of this legislation is not \nlost on my colleagues. Those who claim to support the conservative \nprinciples of small government would again authorize $60 million in \ntaxpayer subsidies for a program that has failed to meet expectations \nfor both educational achievement and financial stewardship. I guess \nthere are carve-outs for our ideological favorites.\n  Further, self-proclaimed states' rights conservatives are once again \nwilling to impose the will of Congress on a local government--the \nDistrict of Columbia--and they do it because they can. So much for Big \nBrother; so much for telling somebody we know best.\n  Finally, I want to remind my friends on the other side of the aisle \nof the principles they espoused just last year when we worked in \nbipartisan fashion to pass legislation reforming No Child Left Behind.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. In their own explanatory material for the Every Student \nSucceeds Act, Republicans say the new reforms are intended to restore \nlocal control by returning responsibility for accountability and school \nimprovement to State and local leaders. Why doesn't that apply here? \nAnother ideological carve-out, Mr. Speaker.\n  Congress has no business imposing its will on the schools and \nfamilies of the District of Columbia in this fashion. They are not \nguinea pigs for our ideological favorites.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Kline), the chairman of the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee.\n  Mr. KLINE. I thank Chairman Chaffetz for yielding the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in very strong support of the SOAR \nReauthorization Act, which will renew our vital investment in the \nchildren who live in the District of Columbia.\n  In passing the Every Student Succeeds Act last year, we took \nimportant steps to support and encourage greater school choice for \nstudents and their families. These reforms empower parents to do what \nis best for their children's education, and they help ensure that all \nchildren are able to receive the excellent education they deserve \nregardless of their family's background, income, or ZIP Code. Helping \nstudents escape failing schools so they can pursue brighter futures is \nan important priority, and that is exactly what the D.C. Opportunity \nScholarship Program does for children in our Nation's Capital.\n  For more than 10 years now, the program has enabled thousands of \nstudents to pursue the quality education necessary to excel both in the \nclassroom and later in life--and excel they do. In fact, last year, 90 \npercent of 12th graders who received a scholarship through the program \ngraduated from high school, and nearly 90 percent of them, Mr. Speaker, \nwent on to pursue college degrees. The traditional D.C.\n\n[[Page H2121]]\n\npublic school system can make no such claim. These are very impressive \nresults. Despite the claims of those who oppose these schools for, \napparently, purely ideological, partisan reasons, with results like \nthese--90 percent graduate, and 90 percent of those go on to college--\nit makes those claims that these schools are not performing well, \nfrankly, laughable.\n  This legislation also authorizes support for D.C. public schools, and \nit will provide critical resources for its charter schools. I agree \nwith the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia that the public \ncharter schools in the District are performing well. They are giving \nsome hope to mothers and fathers and grandmothers and grandfathers that \ntheir children will have a chance in life. I am very proud of those \npublic charter schools. There are also parents--Presidents of the \nUnited States and so forth--who choose to send their kids to private \nschools, and that opportunity ought to exist for more children--for \nmore students--in the District of Columbia. That is what the \nOpportunity Scholarship Program does. It provides another chance--\nanother avenue, another road to hope--for children in our Nation's \nCapital.\n  Together, these measures are working to improve the traditional \npublic schools that are struggling and that are still, too often, \nfailing students--which is why there is a waiting line to get into \ncharter schools and into private schools--and will make a positive \nimpact in the lives of students across the District and will create \nmuch-needed educational opportunities for these children.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want the gentleman from Minnesota to know that there are waiting \nlines in the District of Columbia to get into many D.C. public schools \nand, of course, into many charter schools. We also know nothing about \nthe schools that tell us 90 percent of their children graduate because \nthis House has no information on them. What we do know is that the \nrandomized study took children in D.C. public schools and compared them \nto students at exactly the same levels in the voucher schools--no \ndifference in overall achievement. That is how we measure achievement \nin the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nScott), the distinguished ranking member of the Education and the \nWorkforce Committee.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to H.R. \n4901, which would reauthorize the D.C. voucher program, known as the \nD.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, through 2021.\n  We don't spend enough money on education, so it is hard to justify \ndiverting scarce public resources in order to finance private school \neducation for a handful of students at the expense of the vast majority \nwho attend public schools. Instead, we should focus our limited public \nresources on initiatives that improve education for all of our \nchildren. This is the promise of a public school education in the \nUnited States, but the voucher programs undermine that promise while \nhiding behind the guise of school choice for students in need.\n  There are about 50 participating schools in the Washington, D.C., \nOpportunity Scholarship Program, but more than half of all of the \nparticipants are enrolled in just eight schools. Most of the schools in \nthe program have higher tuition than the voucher covers, limiting the \nutility of the voucher and shifting the cost of education to the \nfamilies that can't afford it--essentially, denying the opportunity to \nstudents whose families cannot afford the remainder of the tuition. \nFederal dollars are being provided to a small number of parents who can \nafford the choice and to others with students who are already enrolled \nin private schools when that money could have been used for our public \nschool systems.\n  Although there are a few who can participate in the program, as the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia said, the results are \ndisappointing. Research consistently demonstrates that the D.C. voucher \nprogram is an ineffective program that does not increase achievement. \nThe four reports produced by the Department of Education found no \nimprovement in reading and math after entering the voucher program for \nstudents coming from the most struggling D.C. public schools, nor did \nthey find any statistically significant difference in math and reading \nacademic performance from D.C. public schools. On average, Mr. Speaker, \nthese schools are, at best, average.\n  When you cite statistics that say some may be doing well, you have to \ntake into consideration that these are children from families who are \nvery supportive of their children and that they would be doing well \nwhether they were in the voucher program or not.\n  In addition to the disappointing results, we also found the voucher \nparticipants were less likely to have access to English language \nprograms, special education supports, counselors, and other vital \nsupports that ensure that all students remain on the path of academic \nsuccess.\n  If the schools are not producing the promised results, why are we \nproviding them with unrestricted Federal dollars?\n  Mr. Speaker, we could have improved the bill. We have a closed rule, \nso amendments were not allowed, but there were several amendments that \nshould have been considered that I had offered. One would have \nprotected the civil rights of students at schools that receive vouchers \nby requiring schools to certify that they provide each student with \napplicable civil rights protections. Another would have required any \nschool receiving funds under this program to comply with the same \nFederal data and reporting requirements that all public schools or \nother schools receiving Federal money have to provide. All of our \ncongressional districts provide this information, but, unfortunately, \nit is not required under the voucher program.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we are going to spend $20 million to fund education \nin the District of Columbia, we ought to use it to improve education \nfor everyone, not just for a few. This bill uses the money to help a \nfew parents by subsidizing tuition in private schools, which many were \nalready attending, at the expense of many, and it extends a program \nthat fails to actually improve the education for students in \nWashington, D.C.\n  I join the gentlewoman from the District of Columbia in opposing this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, the graduation rate in the D.C. public \nschools is 64 percent. The graduation rate at the OSP program is 90 \npercent. Those are results, and they are worth every penny.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker), \na member of the Oversight and Government Reform Committee.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, there are few times in this House that we \ncan see an immediate impact from legislation. A few months ago, I \nremember meeting some families who were given a choice in the SOAR Act. \nI remember seeing the pride in their faces, but what I remember most \nwas the hope they had--a hope that was new, a new hope in the future. \nAmerica has always been about opportunity. The SOAR Act does exactly \nwhat it says in its title--Scholarships for Opportunity and Results \nAct. The SOAR Act is impacting lives today, but it is changing lives \nforever.\n  Upward mobility starts with a strong education. It reminds me of my \nbackground in working with some gospel music arrangers. I was surprised \nat the high volume of sales in this particular industry, and one of the \narrangers summed it up this way. He said: ``Mark, ain't nobody likes it \nbut the people.''\n  To my colleagues on the other side of the aisle who oppose the SOAR \nAct and who oppose parents in having this opportunity, let me say this: \nAin't nobody likes it but the people.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on both sides?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 10 minutes remaining, and the gentleman from Utah has 16 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Public schools in the United States and big cities are improving, and \nit should be noted that the D.C. Public Schools district continues to \nbe the fastest improving urban school district\n\n[[Page H2122]]\n\nin the United States, according to data released from the 2015 Trial \nUrban District Assessment. These schools deserve support. They are \nimproving test scores unlike the voucher schools. In comparing the \nrandomized study of those who wanted the voucher and didn't get it and \nwho remained in the District public school system with those who wanted \nthe voucher and got it, there was no difference in their math and \nEnglish scores.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. NORTON. I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, on that point, if you select \nstudents from families who can afford the tuition and who are very \nsupportive of their students, is it a surprise that they may do better \nin graduation rates than the average?\n  Ms. NORTON. In reclaiming my time, the gentleman has brought up a \nvery important point.\n  By the way, some of the students who accept this voucher are already \nin the private schools, so they already could obviously afford the \nprogram. They are already attending the voucher schools, and they have \nnow gotten vouchers. If you have some free Federal money, let me have \nsome.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Would they be expected to do better, with \ntheir supportive families, than the average?\n  Ms. NORTON. In reclaiming my time, I think they would be because they \nhave families behind them, and they are being compared with students \nwho often do not.\n  I yield to the gentleman.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. The gentlewoman pointed out that, with the \nrandomized studies, there was no difference in the public schools and \nthe voucher programs. Those studies are the conclusion of vigorous \nresearch that there was no difference; is that right?\n  Ms. NORTON. In reclaiming my time, there was no difference, and yet \nimproving academic performance was a stated reason for the voucher \nprogram.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. Takano).\n  Mr. TAKANO. I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise to join my colleagues in opposing the \nreauthorization of the D.C. voucher program.\n  Public schools are the foundation of the American education system. \nThey represent a duty we have to provide every student in every \ncommunity with an education that helps them realize their full \npotential. Vouchers prevent us from fulfilling that duty by redirecting \ntaxpayer money away from our public schools, which are already \nunderfunded, and into private institutions that do not open their doors \nto every child.\n  As with previous versions of the SOAR Act, this bill does nothing to \nensure that students with disabilities have access to private schools. \nIt also discriminates against low-income families. In 64 percent of the \nparticipating D.C. schools, the tuition costs more than the voucher can \ncover, which, effectively, excludes families who cannot afford to pay \nthe difference. Even students who can afford to attend private school \ncan be excluded based on their prior academic achievement, language \nability, or other discriminatory factors. I had hoped we could address \nthese concerns through the amendment process, but the majority has not \nallowed amendments to the bill.\n  You would expect private schools that can choose their own students \nto have exceptional records of student performance, but you would be \nwrong. Since 2007, there have been four congressionally mandated \nreports on the D.C. voucher program's impact on student achievement. \nNot one of those reports found a significant improvement in reading or \nmath scores among participants.\n  Mr. Speaker, with the Every Student Succeeds Act, we are entering a \nnew era in education policy that holds real promise for students and \neducators across the country. We should be focusing our attention and \nresources on improving institutions that serve all students.\n  I call on my colleagues to remember the obligation we have to every \nchild and reject H.R. 4901.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis).\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, at the end of the Civil War, Lincoln \naddressed the Ohio regiment and he said that the beauty of a free \ngovernment is that it gives every individual an open field and fair \nchance for their intelligence, enterprise, and industry to flourish.\n  That was something that he could speak of firsthand because he had \ngrown up in the backwater. When you start talking about places like \nIllinois and Kentucky, that was so far removed from the corridors of \npower at that time and then he ends up being the President of the \nUnited States, that would have been unheard of in a country in Europe.\n  I think right now, when you look at our country, you have people who \nare born and you are supposed to be able to make the most of your God-\ngiven abilities, no matter your circumstances. Some people are born \ninto privileged circumstances, and some people aren't. But if they have \nthe desire to succeed, they need to be able to do that in America.\n  Yet, what we find now is there are so many kids who grow up in \ncommunities that have really failing school systems, and I think the \nnumber one thing to be able to better yourself in our modern society is \nwith education.\n  Now, of course, the Federal Government doesn't have jurisdiction over \nK-12 education for the States, and I think that that is proper. I \nthink, at times, the Federal Government has needled into that, and I \nthink it has been counterproductive.\n  We do have jurisdiction over the District of Columbia. You have some \nfamilies who are really in dire straits. There is a big D.C. \nbureaucracy that is not performing up to expectations. So this program \nis a lifeline to those families.\n  The average income is $22,000 a year, which is not a lot in any \ncommunity, but in Washington that is very, very little. It gives them a \nlifeline to be able to have an alternative school and maybe be able to \nmake the most of their God-given ability.\n  Look, if the public school bureaucracy is doing well, then they can \nchoose that. But if it is not and it is not working for them, then this \ngives them another option.\n  This is something that--having done the hearing at the school like we \ndid on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, these are kids \nwho are thrilled to be in these schools. I am just very happy to \nsupport this effort. I appreciate the chairman's work on this. We need \nto give every child the chance to succeed.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I proudly support the reauthorization of \nthe SOAR Act because the SOAR Act provides the choice that parents in \nthe District deserve. I supported H.R. 10 and I now support H.R. 4901, \nwhich made important improvements to H.R. 10.\n  This legislation we are considering today continues to empower low-\nincome families in D.C. to take advantage of opportunities they may not \notherwise be able to do. That is because H.R. 4901 is a bill that \nfocuses on people, public schools, charter schools, Opportunity \nScholarship Program, people with choices in each of those areas.\n  The SOAR Act is about improving the lives of students and families in \nthe District in a profoundly personal way. Isn't that what true \neducation is all about: personal achievement, improvement, and \nopportunity?\n  Take the story of Carlos Battle, as written about in the National \nJournal and a recent book on educational choice. Carlos received a \nscholarship through the OSP and attended Assumption Catholic School and \nthen Georgetown Day School for high school.\n  As a result of this quality education, by choice, Carlos was able to \nattend Northeastern University in Boston. In fact, his mother says \nCarlos ``almost surely wouldn't have gone to college'' without the \nscholarship.\n  Carlos now talks about how many of his friends from his time in \npublic school are still in the neighborhood and not doing well for \nthemselves, and he said some even are in jail.\n\n[[Page H2123]]\n\n  As he puts it: Everyone who was in my sixth grade class had the \npotential to achieve just as much as I did . . . that's just the \nunfortunate truth.\n  The OSP allowed Carlos to take advantage of his potential, and he \nkept on achieving all the way to Northeastern.\n  While in Boston, Carlos has spent time working at a nonprofit, \nhelping give back to Boston public school students by helping them \nprepare for responsibilities of college where he has been able to lead \nworkshops for public school students on college preparedness.\n  He is currently preparing to pursue a Ph.D. in a career as a child \npsychologist, and that would be an appropriate time for an applause \nline.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how much time remains on each side?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 6 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 12 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as I begin my remarks, I know that the \ngentlewoman from the District of Columbia would understand my sense of \npride in acknowledging that, in my district, the Victory Early College \nHigh School, which is in the Acres Homes neighborhood and a part of the \nAldine Independent School District, a public school, will be \ncelebrating the National Blue Ribbon award ceremony this morning. I \noffer them congratulations and express my disappointment for not being \nthere.\n  Obviously, they have been recognized as one of two schools in Houston \nnationally to earn the distinction of a National Blue Ribbon School at \nan awards ceremony in Washington, D.C., for closing the achievement \ngap. May I remind my colleagues that that is a public school system.\n  So I rise in opposition and join my colleague from the District of \nColumbia to oppose H.R. 4901, which would reauthorize the District of \nColumbia private school voucher program and the Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram for 5 years.\n  The OSP program came about in 2004. In 2011, Congress reauthorized \nthe OSP through fiscal year 2016. Under the SOAR Act, D.C. households \nwith incomes that do not exceed 185 percent of the poverty line may \nreceive an annual maximum voucher payment per student of $8,000 for \ngrades K-8 and $12,000 for grades 9-12.\n  We all know that private schools are much more expensive than that. \nSo, in essence, this creates a small class that pays money to schools \nthat have not been assessed as to whether or not they are quality \nschools. Private schools can cost as much as $50,000. Are we giving \nthem $50,000 while we are dumbing down the public school system? What \nis so disturbing is: Where is the data?\n  This bill, in particular, makes a significant change. The bill \nprohibits a control study group in making evaluations of the OSP and \nrequires a less rigorous quasi-experimental research design than under \nthe SOAR Act. Since 2004, almost $200 million has been spent on D.C. \nvoucher schools. Can you imagine what we would be able to do if that \nmoney was invested?\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the \ngentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, can you imagine what that could do?\n  I hear that 50 percent of D.C. children are in charter schools, but \n50 percent of children in D.C. are using The Choice Program. What are \nwe doing in America? By using this as a scapegoat, we are suggesting \nthat we are not invested in public schools.\n  Finally, the D.C. Mayor and City Council members, as I understand, \nwere only advocating that: If you don't fund the voucher program, don't \nleave us out for the public and charter school program. There is a \nvigorous Choice Program in D.C.\n  This bill undermines the public school system for all of us, and we \nshould oppose the bill.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n4901, the Scholarship for Opportunity and Results Reauthorization Act. \nAs many will remember, the House passed a similar bill, H.R. 10, last \nyear with 240 votes.\n  H.R. 4901 makes three specific changes to H.R. 10 to ensure the D.C. \nscholarship program continues to run efficiently and effectively for \nthe foreseeable future.\n  First, this bill creates additional reporting requirements for the \nadministrator of the scholarship program to ensure that the program is \noperating effectively.\n  Second, it requires that any District of Columbia school that \nparticipates in this scholarship program must be accredited.\n  Finally, the Department of Education has been withholding funds from \nthe scholarship program and excluding qualified students from \nparticipating.\n  H.R. 4901 ensures that the Department of Education cannot withhold \nfunds from the scholarship program and that they cannot exclude \nstudents that are qualified to participate.\n  With these changes, this D.C. school scholarship program can continue \nto run efficiently and allow low-income families to better their \neducational experience and opportunities.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support H.R. 4901.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina (Mr. Sanford).\n  Mr. SANFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the SOAR Act. I want \nto talk for a moment about the elephant in the room, and that is the \nway in which it has become something of a tug of war between those who \nbelieve in choice in education and those who don't.\n  I think that, on the one hand, you have, for instance, taxpayer \nadvocates who say: Wait a minute. If we are spending about $30,000 per \nstudent and getting the results that we are out of the system, \nsomething ought to change.\n  There are other people who are advocates for the children of D.C., \npeople like the former Mayor of this city, Anthony Williams, who said: \nWait a minute. The scholarship program worked and it made a difference \nin people's lives.\n  There are people who are advocates for the marketplace who say: Wait \na minute. There has been a revolutionary degree of change in technology \nand in output and in productivity as a result of marketplace forces, \nand maybe those marketplace forces ought to be at work in education as \nwell.\n  I think, most of all, there are folks who acknowledge the fact that \nGod makes every child different and that one size never fits all with \nthe plethora of different personalities in children that are out there.\n  On the other hand, you have folks who say: Wait a minute. Let's do it \nthe way we have always done it. We had schools set up this way in the \n1970s, in the 1980s, in the 1990s, and in the 2000s. Let's do it the \nway we did it.\n  But, in that process, kids may be locked into schools that aren't \nworking for them and for their families. They may be literally \nimprisoned in schools that aren't working.\n  So I think that what stands out about the SOAR Act is that it \nrepresents a set of keys so that kids would have additional choices. If \nwe really believe that education is the cornerstone to opportunity in \nthe 21st century, why not give kids as many keys as possible?\n  It could be a key to a charter school, a traditional public school, \nor a private school. It is a key of their choice because kids are \nindeed so different. That is what this bill acknowledges.\n  I commend the gentleman from Utah for what he has done on this front.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from the District of \nColumbia has 3\\3/4\\ minutes remaining. The gentleman from Utah has 9 \nminutes remaining.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Allen).\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding\n\n[[Page H2124]]\n\nand for his work on this important legislation.\n  As a proud member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, \nI rise today in support of H.R. 4901, the Scholarship for Opportunity \nand Results Reauthorization Act, also known as the SOAR Act.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram, which provides scholarships to low-income students so they may \nattend a D.C. private school of their parents' choice.\n  School choice is an effective tool that has proven to be successful \nin Washington, D.C. These scholarships have resulted in a 90 percent \ngraduation rate, which is simply outstanding. I congratulate them on \nthis.\n  Both of my parents were educators who instilled in me the importance \nof a good education, and I believe we should extend this opportunity to \nthose who might not otherwise have it.\n  God created every child to be unique. As such, this legislation gives \nopportunities to students to receive an education chosen by their \nparents, those who know their child's needs best.\n  I encourage my colleagues to stand up in support of school choice and \nthe SOAR Act to empower both parents and the students.\n  Ms. NORTON. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan).\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding and for her advocacy for every child in the District of \nColumbia.\n  Mr. Speaker, last year we passed the Every Student Succeeds Act, a \ngood bill, but instead of figuring out how to fund this bipartisan bill \nthrough our budget and appropriations process, which apparently has \nbroken down, we are here in a legislative deja vu redebating a nearly \nidentical bad bill we passed just months ago that will take money away \nfrom our public schools.\n  I am well aware of these attempts to divert money away from public \nschools and the failures of taxpayer-funded private schools. In the \nlast 10 years, Wisconsin taxpayers have wasted $139 million of taxpayer \ndollars on private schools that were later terminated from the voucher \nprogram due to their lack of appropriate standards and accountability.\n  Further, in Wisconsin, 79 percent of the students who received a \ntaxpayer-subsidized voucher in 2013 were already attending private \nschools. The SOAR Act would allow kids already in private schools to \nreceive this funding. That means taxpayer dollars are being used not to \nadvocate education, but instead as a form of tax policy. What is worse \nis that the taxpayer-funded voucher schools both in my State and here \nin D.C. are not providing equitable resources to special needs students \nwith disabilities.\n  At the end of the day, this is also about results. Multiple \nDepartment of Education studies have concluded that the taxpayer-funded \nD.C. voucher program has failed to improve educational outcomes for \nparticipating students, and two U.S. Government Accountability Office \nreports have also identified its repeated management and accountability \nfailures. Public funds should be used for public education which serves \nall students. It is that simple. I encourage everyone to oppose this \nbill.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers.\n  I reserve the balance of my time to close.\n  Ms. NORTON. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is going to be funded, and you can't blame the \nDistrict of Columbia for wanting the public school and charter school \nfunding that is in the bill. This bill is going to be funded. It was a \nBoehner bill, now it is essentially a Ryan bill, and I do want that \nunderstood.\n  I include in the Record the Council's letter from last year which \nopposed funding.\n\n                                           Council of the District\n\n\n                                                  of Columbia,\n\n                                  Washington, DC, October 8, 2015.\n     Hon. Jason Chaffetz,\n     Chairperson, Committee on Oversight & Government Reform, U.S. \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Chairperson Chaffetz: We write as locally elected officials \n     to express our opposition to renewed efforts to expand a \n     federally funded school voucher program in the District of \n     Columbia. We appreciate your interest in providing support to \n     public education in the District. We strongly believe, \n     however, that federal funds should be invested in the \n     existing public education system--both public schools and \n     public charter schools--rather than being diverted to private \n     schools.\n       We support the decision by Congress and the President \n     several years ago to phase out the voucher program. Multiple \n     U.S. Department of Education reports indicate that the \n     program has not lived up to the promises made by proponents. \n     These studies along with two troubling Government \n     Accountability Office reports have also revealed that many of \n     the students participating in the voucher program attend \n     private schools with fewer resources and lower standards than \n     our public schools. The evidence is clear that the use of \n     vouchers has had no statistically significant impact on \n     overall student achievement in math or reading, or for \n     students from schools in need of improvement.\n       We have serious concerns about using government funds to \n     send our students to private schools that do not have to \n     adhere to the same standards and accountability as do public \n     and public charter schools. For example, private religious \n     schools, which 80% of students with vouchers attend, operate \n     outside the non-discrimination provisions of the D.C. Human \n     Rights Act. Moreover, the voucher proposal is inequitable: if \n     fully funded, the authorization would provide many more \n     dollars per student for vouchers than is allocated per \n     student in public schools and public charter schools.\n       Although we believe that students who are already receiving \n     a voucher should have the opportunity to maintain and use \n     that voucher through graduation from high school, we do not \n     support expansion of the program to new students. The \n     District devotes considerable funds to public education, and \n     our local policies promote choice for parents. Indeed, over \n     the past decade the quality of public education in D.C. has \n     increased, as a result of reforms and targeted investment. \n     Families can choose from an array of educational institutions \n     based on publicly--available performance metrics, both within \n     the D.C. Public Schools system and among the myriad public \n     charter schools. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan has \n     called the progress of D.C. Public Schools ``remarkable'', \n     while the National Alliance for Public Charter Schools has \n     ranked the District's charter sector as the best in the \n     country.\n       Despite such ample evidence that the Congressionally \n     imposed voucher program is ineffective, while D.C. public \n     schools improve every year, some members of Congress continue \n     to see our city as their personal petri dish. It is insulting \n     to our constituents, who vote for us but not for any voting \n     member of Congress, that some of your colleagues push their \n     personal agendas on D.C. in a way they could never do in \n     their home states. Attacking D.C. home rule, including any \n     expansion of the voucher program, is irresponsible governing \n     on the part of Congress.\n       We call on you to respect the wishes of the District's \n     elected officials on the quintessentially local matter of \n     education as you consider this issue.\n           Sincerely,\n     David Grosso,\n       D.C. Council, At-Large, Chairperson, Committee on \n     Education.\n     Charles Allen,\n       D.C. Council, Ward 6, Member, Committee on Education.\n     LaRuby May,\n       D.C. Council, Ward 8.\n     Elissa Silverman,\n       D.C. Council, At-Large.\n     Anita Bonds,\n       D.C. Council, At-Large, Member, Committee on Education.\n     Yvette Alexander,\n       D.C. Council, Ward 7, Member, Committee on Education.\n     Brianne Nadeau,\n       D.C. Council, Ward 1.\n     Jack Evans,\n       D.C. Council, Ward 2.\n\n  Ms. NORTON. This year, of course, recognizing that they might lose \n$40 million, there was another bill, and a bare majority said: Give us \nthe money.\n  But I want you to understand what the letter from the District of \nColumbia said.\n  ``A reauthorization of the SOAR Act would help safeguard $150 million \nin Federal funds for the D.C. Public Schools and public charter schools \nover 5 years.''\n  And they go on to say: ``SOAR Act funding for D.C. Public Schools has \nbeen used to support initiatives that reward and increase retention of \nhigh performing teachers and principals. The funds also help attract \nmore high quality teachers and principals to D.C. Public Schools and \nimprove the efficiency with which schools are run.\n  ``After years of decline, D.C. public school enrollment is rising for \nthe first time in decades. Schools that previously struggled to fill \ntheir pre-kindergarten seats have waiting lists and\n\n[[Page H2125]]\n\nother schools are attracting families back into the system at grade \nlevels that have historically lost students.''\n  Clearly, we have a school system--and I cannot help but identify with \nthem--that does not want to lose $40 million for D.C. public schools \nand D.C. charter schools. I don't ask anybody to change their vote. \nThis program is going to be funded.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In conclusion, let me read the first sentence of the first paragraph \nfrom the D.C. Mayor, as well as the majority of the Council. ``As Mayor \nand members of the Council of the District of Columbia, we support the \nthree-sector Federal funding approach for D.C.'s K-12 education system \nthat is authorized in the Scholarships for Opportunity and Results, the \nSOAR Act.''\n  It is clear this is producing results. I find it a little bit \ntroubling when the opposition to the SOAR Act people stand up and say: \nWell, it is not producing results.\n  I will reiterate again that the average graduation rate at the D.C. \npublic schools is 64 percent. The graduation rate for somebody who \nobtains the scholarship is 90 percent, and 92 percent of those people \nwho get that scholarship go on to college. Those are laudable goals in \nany, any scenario.\n  And while this is done, this education is literally two-thirds of the \ncost, and it goes to people who really do deserve and need it, because \nthe average annual income for somebody who is a recipient of this \nscholarship is $22,000. A $22,000 income in the District of Columbia \nfor someone with kids is difficult, at best.\n  I want to thank, again, Speaker Boehner for his passion on school \nchoice and particularly the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship. I also want \nto thank our Senate colleague, Senator Tim Scott. Senator Scott joined \nus in a field hearing that we had in the Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform. He is a true believer and is passionate about school \nchoice and the need to give everybody the best possible opportunities \nthat we can.\n  So I think we have had a good debate. We had a good markup and \ndiscussion within the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform. I \nhope that we pass this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to support H.R. 4901, the \nScholarships for Opportunity and Results (SOAR) Reauthorization Act.\n  Members of Congress, believe that together--the key to the future of \nour great nation is the quality of the education we provide our \nchildren.\n  We all know the story of some District of Columbia public schools: \nLow graduation rates, high dropout rates, low math and reading scores. \nAnd, we can all agree that the children in the District deserve a first \nclass education.\n  A decade ago, I had the honor to Chair the District of Columbia \nAppropriations Subcommittee. In that capacity, we worked to create a \nprogram to give a `hand-up' to children in Washington, DC. We built a \n`three-sector' approach: public schools, charter schools, and the \nlatter, the DC Opportunity Scholarship Program, which provides parents \nwith funds to send their children to private or parochial schools.\n  The bill before us today will reauthorize the three-sector approach \nto school reform in the District of Columbia--including the DC \nOpportunity Scholarship Program--through FY 2021.\n  The DC Opportunity Scholarship Program is a huge success. Last year \nalone 3,246 students submitted applications to participate in these \nscholarships and the program accepted 1,244 students.\n  88 percent of high school graduates in 2015, who were Opportunity \nScholarship recipients, enrolled at a 2- or 4-year college.\n  Congress should listen to the voices of parents and students and \ncontinue to work to ensure that this not only survives, but grows.\n  I urge my colleagues to join us in supporting this critical \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I would like to submit the following:\n\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives.\n       Dear Majority Leader McConnell, Minority Leader Reid, \n     Speaker Ryan, and Minority Leader Pelosi: As Mayor and \n     members of the Council of the District of Columbia, we \n     support the three-sector federal funding approach for DC's K-\n     12 education system that is authorized in the Scholarships \n     for Opportunities and Results (SOAR) ACT. Our support for the \n     SOAR Act is rooted in the importance we place on the much-\n     needed federal funding for DC Public Schools (DCPS) and \n     public charter schools which totaled $30 million in FY2016. \n     This funding is provided via our DC federal payments and does \n     not take away from our state formula funding for education; \n     rather, it adds to it. A reauthorization of the SOAR Act \n     would help safeguard $150 million in federal funds for DCPS \n     and public charter schools over five years. These funds are \n     critical to the gains that the District's public education \n     system has seen in recent years.\n       In addition, we are very concerned about a bill that was \n     recently introduced in Congress, the Educational Freedom \n     Accounts Act (H.R. 4426/S. 2455), which would require the \n     District of Columbia to re-direct local funds from DCPS and \n     the public charter schools toward Educational Savings \n     Accounts for DC students who want to attend private schools. \n     This bill would be harmful to the District's progress on \n     education and we strongly oppose it. SOAR Act reauthorization \n     is far a better alternative and works for our families and \n     school system.\n       SOAR Act funding for DCPS has been used to support \n     initiatives that reward and increase retention of performing \n     teachers and principals. The funds also help attract more \n     high quality teachers and principals to DCPS and to improve \n     the efficiency with which schools are run. After years of \n     decline, DCPS enrollment is rising for the first time in \n     decades. Schools that previously struggled to fill their \n     prekindergarten seats have waiting lists and other schools \n     are attracting families back into the system at grade levels \n     that have historically lost students.\n       Public charter schools in the District represent 44 percent \n     of the public school population of more than 85,000 students \n     with 62 public charter schools on 115 campuses. Since FY2004, \n     federal funds authorized in the SOAR Act have supported the \n     acquisition, renovation, modernization, and expansion of \n     charter school facilities in the District. These funds have \n     also been used to improve academic achievement, teacher and \n     leader quality and recruitment, instructional support, and \n     graduation pathways.\n       The SOAR Act provides equal amounts of federal funding for \n     the DCPS, public charter schools and the OSP. We understand \n     that these funding streams are inextricably linked. We urge \n     you to ensure that the SOAR Reauthorization Act (S. 2171/H.R. \n     10) becomes law before the end of this Congress so that this \n     critical funding for K-12 education in the District of \n     Columbia is not put in jeopardy.\n           Sincerely,\n         Muriel Bowser, Mayor; LaRuby May, Councilmember; Brandon \n           T. Todd, Councilmember; Mary Cheh, Councilmember; Phil \n           Mendelson, Chairman; Vincent Orange, Councilmember; \n           Anita Bonds, Councilmember; Yvette M. Alexander, \n           Councilmember; Kenyon R. McDuffie, Councilmember.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Washington Post, Mar. 14, 2016]\n\n       For D.C., Preauthorizing School Choice Is the Right Choice\n\n                          (By Editorial Board)\n\n       IN THEIR zeal to kill off the federally funded scholarship \n     program for poor D.C. students, opponents have peddled the \n     fiction that Congress foisted the program on an unwilling \n     city. In fact, the program was backed enthusiastically by \n     then-Mayor Anthony A. Williams (D) and a key D.C. Council \n     member, and parent demand for scholarships far outstrips \n     supply. So let's hope that a letter from Mayor Muriel E. \n     Bowser (D) and a majority of the council urging continued \n     funding for the program finally puts the myth to rest and \n     helps allow more students to benefit from the program.\n       The D.C. Opportunity Scholarship Program, which provides \n     needy students with vouchers to attend private schools of \n     their choice, is up for reauthorization. As has happened \n     before with all-too-depressing frequency since the \n     scholarships were established in 2004, the program is under \n     attack from unions and other opponents. If Congress fails to \n     act, the city will also lose out on millions of dollars that \n     go to its traditional and charter public schools as part of \n     the three-sector federal funding deal.\n       The very real danger of the District losing $150 million in \n     federal funds over five years apparently finally sunk in with \n     members of the council. Three members who previously had \n     urged that the program be killed joined Ms. Bowser and five \n     other members, including council Chairman Phil Mendelson (D), \n     in a March 7 letter to congressional leaders in support of \n     the Scholarships for Opportunities and Results (SOAR) Act. \n     House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) in a statement called the \n     support of the mayor and council ``an important boost'' in \n     the effort to get reauthorization to the president's desk\n       We hope so. Mr. Ryan is right that ``when we give more \n     families a choice, more students succeed.'' Uncertainty about \n     the future of the program is the alleged reason the Education \n     Department has, for several years, put a hold on funds that \n     would allow additional students into the program. Officials \n     with Serving Our Children, the nonprofit that took over \n     administration of the scholarships in October, told us there \n     are more than 1,900 applicants, with more expected, for just \n     146 new spots next year. If Congress doesn't reauthorize the \n     program, funding could dry\n\n[[Page H2126]]\n\n     up, with no new students accepted after the 2016-2017 school \n     year. The scholarships provide a lifeline to low-income and \n     underserved families, giving them the school choice that more \n     affluent families take as a given. And because the program \n     results in more federal money for D.C. public education and \n     not less--another myth advanced by opponents--it's time for \n     Congress to act.\n\n  Mr. CUMMINGS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 4901, \nas I did when the House debated a nearly identical measure last \nOctober.\n  We have been told that the purpose of this bill is to help all DC \nchildren get a better education.\n  I strongly support that objective, but this bill does not.\n  Let me be crystal clear: public funds should support public \neducation.\n  But this bill proposes to spend 100 million dollars over five years \nto fund vouchers to send students in the District of Columbia to \nprivate schools.\n  Coming from the city of Baltimore, I understand the complexities of \nturning around struggling inner city schools.\n  Almost ten years ago, I became deeply involved in improving one of my \nown neighborhood schools, the Maritime Industries Academy.\n  It takes vision, commitment, accountability and, yes, resources to \nbegin the process of turning troubled schools around.\n  However, it is extremely difficult to turn around public schools if \nwe divert public resources to private schools.\n  By dividing funding among DC Public Schools, DC Charter Schools, and \nprivate school vouchers, this bill provides one-third of its total \nfunding to voucher students, a tiny fraction of the District's \nstudents.\n  The lack of equity is stunning. Our focus should be on maximizing the \nimpact of the federal government's limited resources to serve ALL of \nthe District's students.\n  This program was last authorized in 2011, over my strong objection \nand along party lines, despite the fact that the study on the program's \nimpacts mandated by law found that the use of vouchers had no effect on \nacademic achievement, as measured by math and reading test scores.\n  Vouchers also had no impact on students' perceptions of school safety \nand satisfaction.\n  We have heard all the Republican rhetoric justifying massive cuts to \neducation funding--all the talk about budget constraints, about \ntightening our belts, and about making sacrifices.\n  But apparently all that goes out the window when Republicans want to \ngive 100 million dollars in taxpayer funds to private schools.\n  As a graduate of public schools and a longtime advocate of quality \npublic education, I believe our highest priority must be to use limited \ntaxpayer dollars to support programs that will truly meet the \neducational needs of all children.\n  This bill does not do that. So I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. \n4901.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to this rule \nand the underlying bill, H.R. 4901, the Scholarships for Opportunity \nand Results Reauthorization (SOAR) Act.\n  H.R. 4901 would reauthorize the District of Columbia's private school \nvoucher program, the Opportunity Scholarship Program (OSP), for five \nyears through 2021.\n  Simply put, this bill diverts much needed resources from the D.C. \npublic school system into this unsuccessful and counterproductive \nvoucher program.\n  We know that this voucher program has failed to improve academic \nachievement, threatens vital civil rights for students, undermines \nconstitutional protections, and is poorly managed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is just another Republican attack on the \nDistrict of Columbia's right to self-governance.\n  Even worse, the Districts' government did not request this \nreauthorization--nor did its representative, Congresswoman Eleanor \nHolmes Norton.\n  If the District wants to establish a voucher program, it has the \nauthority to do so.\n  But it hasn't for many of the reasons I listed above.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should work to fully fund our public schools and \nensure equal access to education for all students--not funnel \nadditional funds into this ineffective and poorly managed program.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the rule and the underlying \nbill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 706, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit \nat the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Ted Lieu of California moves to recommit the bill H.R. \n     4901 to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith \n     with the following amendment:\n       Insert after section 7 the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 8. NONDISCRIMINATION AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS FOR ELIGIBLE \n                   ENTITY AND PARTICIPATING SCHOOLS.\n\n       Section 3008(a) (sec. 38-1853.08(a), D.C. Official Code) is \n     amended by inserting ``actual or perceived sexual orientation \n     or gender identity,'' after ``national origin,''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment \nto the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. \nIf adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  My amendment would simply change the D.C. Opportunity Scholarship \nProgram so that it could not discriminate against students based on \nsexual orientation or gender identity.\n  Sadly, we know that LGBT kids are often victims of bullying and hate. \nAccording to a survey by the Human Rights Campaign, LGBT youth were \ntwice as likely as their non-LGBT peers to report being verbally \nharassed and excluded.\n  Moreover, misguided anti-LGBT laws, such as those passed in North \nCarolina and Mississippi, continue to send a message that being LGBT is \nnot okay, and that is wrong. As one of my Republican colleagues earlier \ntoday on the floor stated, God makes every child different. It is wrong \nto systematically discriminate against students because they are LGBT.\n  We need to send our kids a message that saying whom they love and the \ngender they identify with does not dictate their self-worth, and it \ncertainly should not dictate whether or not they can get a voucher. I \nmove that we begin to do this right now by passing my amendment to \nprevent discrimination based on sexual orientation or gender identity. \nBeing LGBTQ is not a medical condition that needs to be cured. It is \ninstead a beautiful reflection of what it means to be a human being.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Utah is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, we went through regular order in our \ncommittee. We had field hearings. We had a markup. The gentleman was \nfree to offer an amendment in committee. That did not happen.\n  This is a school choice bill. This is a bill that gives parents the \nopportunity to make choices about where their students can attend, and \nthis scholarship program has been a very valuable tool. I am opposed to \nthe motion to recommit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of passage.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 167, \nnays 228, not voting 38, as follows:\n\n[[Page H2127]]\n\n  \n\n\n                             [Roll No. 178]\n\n                               YEAS--167\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I wish to announce to all Members of the \nHouse that the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence has ordered \nthe bill H.R. 5077, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n2017, reported favorably to the House today, and will file its report \non the bill in the House in early May.\n  Mr. Speaker, the classified schedules of authorizations and the \nclassified annexes accompanying the bill are available for review by \nMembers at the offices of the Permanent Select Committee on \nIntelligence in room HVC-304 of the Capitol Visitor Center. The \ncommittee office will be open during regular business hours for the \nconvenience of any Member who wishes to review this material prior to \nits consideration by the House.\n  I recommend that Members wishing to review the classified annex \ncontact the committee's director of security to arrange a time and date \nfor that viewing. This will ensure the availability of the \nappropriately cleared committee staff to assist Members who desire \nassistance during their review of these classified materials.\n  I urge interested Members to review these materials in order to \nbetter understand the committee's recommendations. The classified \nannexes to the committee's report contain the committee's \nrecommendations on the intelligence budget for fiscal year 2017 and \nrelated classified information that cannot be disclosed publicly.\n  It is important that Members keep in mind the requirements of clause \n13 of House rule XXIII, which only permits access to classified \ninformation by those Members of the House who have signed the oath \nprovided for in the rules.\n  In addition, the committee's rules require that Members agree in \nwriting to a nondisclosure agreement.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to introduce the Protection and \nAdvocacy for Veterans Act.

They have the authority to inspect medical records, \nmake recommendations to providers, and, when necessary, take legal \naction on behalf of patients. I believe bringing this high degree of \npatient advocacy expertise to the VA can greatly benefit our veterans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2129-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  NATIONAL INFERTILITY AWARENESS WEEK\n\n  (Mr. PETERS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PETERS.

Infertility is defined as \nthe inability to conceive or carry a pregnancy to term after 12 months \nof trying to conceive.\n  The American Society for Reproductive Medicine, the American College \nof Obstetricians and Gynecologists, and the World Health Organization \nrecognize infertility as a disease.\n  Today, one in eight couples have trouble getting pregnant or \nsustaining a pregnancy. Infertility affects approximately 10 percent of \nthe population, but rarely are the necessary medical treatments covered \nby insurance. Alarmingly, this, too, is the case for veterans who have \nserved our country and have become infertile as a result of their \nservice.\n  This issue strikes diverse groups, affecting people from all \nsocioeconomic levels and cuts across racial, ethnic, and religious \nlines.\n  We must acknowledge the medical and emotional aspects of infertility \nand continue to support efforts to make treatment more accessible to \nhelp improve the quality of life for people with infertility.\n  This week, I ask that we all recognize and raise awareness on the \nissue of infertility as a disease and support the family-building \nefforts of those struggling with this disease of infertility.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2129-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2129]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           TOP 50 BEST TOWNS FOR FAMILIES IN THE GARDEN STATE\n\n  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANCE.

The school \ngrounds also include vegetable, herb, pollinator, and rain gardens. In \npartnership with Penn State University, the school has also built a \ngreenhouse which later served as the model for two built at a school in \nRwanda.\n  This just scratches the surface of the initiatives undertaken at Park \nForest Elementary, and everyone involved deserves praise for their \nefforts.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2130-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OPIOID ADDICTION\n\n  (Mr. RUPPERSBERGER asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. RUPPERSBERGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge House leadership \nto take action against the scourge of opioid addiction that is plaguing \nour communities.\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, drug \noverdoses now surpass car accidents as the leading cause of injury-\nrelated death for Americans between the ages of 25 and 65.\n  In Baltimore, opioid overdose has been declared a public health \nemergency. There are about 19,000 active heroin users in Baltimore \nCity, and far more who abuse prescription opioids.\n  But this isn't just an urban issue. I have personally heard from \nfamilies from all walks of life throughout my district that have been \ndevastated by heroin and prescription drugs. No socioeconomic level is \nsafe.\n  To this end, I urge leadership to move the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act forward. Among other measures, this important \nbipartisan bill will expand the availability of naloxone to law \nenforcement agencies and other first responders to help reverse \noverdoses, expand resources to identify and treat incarcerated \nindividuals suffering from addiction, and expand disposal sites for \nunused prescription medications to keep them out of the hands of young \npeople.\n  Only through a comprehensive approach can we stop and reverse current \ntrends.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2130-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REMEMBERING THE LIFE AND CONTRIBUTIONS OF CHIEF JUSTICE PERRY HOOPER, \n                                  SR.\n\n  (Mr. BYRNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BYRNE.

He went on to be elected probate \njudge and later circuit judge in Montgomery County.\n  His groundbreaking election as chief justice of the Alabama Supreme \nCourt in 1994 marked the first time a Republican had served on the \ncourt since Reconstruction.\n  Justice Hooper brought dignity and grace to the Supreme Court, along \nwith his consummate professionalism. He raised the court to a higher \nlevel. Whether you were a lawyer or a party, he treated you with \nrespect and fairness.\n  Most importantly, Justice Hooper understood that judges don't make \nthe law, but decide cases with wisdom and fairness. So on behalf of \nAlabama's First Congressional District, I want to share my deepest \nsympathies with his wife, Marilyn, and four sons. Justice Hooper will \nnever be forgotten.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2130-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2130]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOGNIZING SOPHIE MARIE EDWARDS\n\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Since then, she has raised more than $6,000 for food banks \nand local feeding programs. Through her efforts, more than 1,000 kids \nhave been able to receive a healthy summer lunch. She has also made it \nher mission to educate everyone she meets about the problem of hunger \nin America.\n  Sophie's work in her hometown of Marietta, Georgia, led her to be \nrecognized as a youth advocate for the national No Kid Hungry campaign.\n  I am inspired by Sophie's commitment, by her compassion, and by her \ndrive to end hunger.

She was a \npolice officer, an actor, a development officer for her church and its \nelementary school, and the founder of a nonprofit organization, a \nhealth activist, and a mother to three incredible children.\n  Breast cancer was what took Mary Ann from us, but it is also what one \nof her lasting legacies was born from--a successful and much-needed \nbreast health initiative, the Get in Touch Foundation.

One \nof his daughters was one of the 13 young children that integrated the \nschools. He got on a bus and refused to go to the back of the bus in \n1964 with six others and helped integrate the buses in Memphis. His \nlife was dedicated to civil rights, making Memphis better, and serving \nhis church members.\n  He is well known and remembered for being at the Lorraine Motel on \nthe day that Dr. King was assassinated on April 4, 1968. On that \noccasion, he was near Dr. King and was a witness to the assassination, \nwhich he told people about throughout the country and is part of a \ndocumentary film called ``The Witness.''\n  He remembered Dr. King's work to all, witnessed what he did and what \nhappened in Memphis. He lived his life as Dr. King would have wanted: \ntrying to move civil rights forward and making America the country that \nit was supposed to be. A life well lived.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2131-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2131]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     DEFUND NUCLEAR DEAL WITH IRAN\n\n  (Mr. BABIN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, the Obama administration's foolish nuclear \ndeal with Iran continues to get more troubling and damaging by the day.\n  Last week, we found out that the administration was spending $8.6 \nmillion of our hard-earned tax dollars to buy nuclear material from \nIran. That is right: the United States Government is borrowing money \nfrom China and the rest of the world to buy heavy water from Iran, \nwater used in nuclear reactors.\n  This is insanely foolish. I thought that the goal of Obama's nuclear \ndeal was to stop Iran's nuclear program, not subsidize it.\n  Iran remains the world's leading sponsor of terrorism. They have been \ndirectly tied to the deaths of thousands of U.S. servicemembers. \nProviding the Iranian regime with millions of tax dollars only gives \nthem new financing to spread hateful ideology, terror, and death across \nthe globe.\n  The Obama administration's payments to this terrorist regime further \nlegitimize their growing nuclear ambitions. Is it any wonder that our \nallies no longer consider the United States a reliable partner?\n  Appeasement only emboldens bullies, terrorists, and dictators. Sadly, \nthis is the path that this current administration has chosen.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2131-6", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2131-H2132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           VERIFYING OPTIMAL TOOLS FOR ELECTIONS ACT OF 2016\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, there is a grave threat that is \nfacing the American electoral process in\n\n[[Page H2132]]\n\n2016, and that is the soundness and the dependability of our voting \nmachines and the integrity of our voting process.\n  Nationwide, authorities are tabulating crucial voting results using \nfaulty, out-of-date electronic voting machines from the era that \npredated the smartphone. These outdated machines are prone to crashes \nand screen freezes that can cause unacceptably long wait times. \nAdditionally, old voting machines remain vulnerable to being hacked and \nelections can be stolen.\n  My bill, the Verifying Optimal Tools for Elections Act of 2016, \notherwise known as the VOTE Act, would allocate millions of dollars to \nassist States in replacing these aging voting machine dinosaurs. The \nVOTE Act would also allocate millions of dollars in grants to assist in \ndeveloping new technologies to assure accuracy in the voting process, \nto protect voting machine source codes from being hacked, and to train \nelection officials.\n  The aim of the VOTE Act is simple: the safeguarding of elections by \nensuring the very integrity of the voting process, while protecting \naccess to the ballot box.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2132-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nAPPOINTMENT OF INDIVIDUAL TO UNITED STATES-CHINA ECONOMIC AND SECURITY \n                           REVIEW COMMISSION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Woodall).

Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Flores) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. FLORES. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor Harper Cunningham, age \n12, and Maggie Cunningham, age 10, from College Station, Texas, who are \nrecipients of the 2016 Jefferson Award for the Brazos Valley.\n  The Jefferson Awards are presented annually to honor our unsung \nheroes, ordinary citizens who have done something extraordinary and \nthat will have a lasting impact on the community. It is fitting that \nthe Jefferson Award be presented to these two young girls, who not only \nexemplify what it means to serve, but who also share Thomas Jefferson's \npassion for reading.\n  Harper and Maggie Cunningham's passion for reading and for helping \nthose in need led them to create an organization to promote literacy \nand the well-being of our community students. Their Books and a Blanket \nprogram provides a basket of books and a blanket to elementary \nschoolchildren in need across the Brazos Valley during the winter \nmonths.\n  Their mission is simple and impactful: they want all students to have \naccess to books so that they, too, can experience the joy that comes \nfrom reading. Since 2012, Books and a Blanket has given away over 1,200 \nblankets and distributed over 33,000 books to over 2,500 children in \nneed.\n  Mr. Speaker, these two young girls have done a tremendous job helping \nothers, promoting literacy, and being inspiring leaders in our \ncommunity. As President Ronald Reagan once said:\n\n       The greatest leaders are not necessarily the ones who do \n     the greatest things. The greatest leaders are the ones who \n     get other people to do the greatest things.\n\n  It is evident that Harper and Maggie are models of true leadership, \nand their desire to serve and empower others is inspiring. Young \nAmericans like Harper and Maggie provide confidence for all of us about \nthe future of our great country.\n  I congratulate Harper and Maggie Cunningham for their hard work, \nselfless service, and for being awarded the 2016 Jefferson Award for \nthe Brazos Valley. Gina and I look forward to hosting them in \nWashington later this year for the National Jefferson Awards ceremony.\n  I would also like to congratulate the other 2016 Jefferson Award \nwinners from the Brazos Valley: Stephanie Sale, Alma Villarreal, and \nDavid Ruesink. Their selfless service to our community is inspiring and \nalso worthy of these special recognitions. I am humbled to represent \nall of them in Congress.\n  As I close, I ask all Americans to continue to pray for our country \nduring these difficult times, for our military men and women who \nprotect us from external threats, and for our first responders who \nprotect us here at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2132-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2132-H2136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          AMERICA'S TO-DO LIST\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Woodall) is recognized \nfor the remainder of the hour as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. WOODALL. Mr. Speaker, we all got elected. I have been here 5 \nyears now. You are fairly new to this institution. Everybody comes with \na dream. You don't come because you are looking for new business cards. \nYou come because you want to make a difference for folks back home. We \nall have about 700,000 bosses back home, and they want us to make a \ndifference. Mr. Speaker, I want to talk about some of those differences \ntoday.\n  You can't see it from where you are sitting, but I have got a little \nAmerica's to-do list down here. I didn't have enough paper back in the \noffice to do the entire to-do list. There is a lot out there, as I know \nyou hear every weekend when you go home as well, but I put a couple of \nthe top things out there.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  I have ``fix our roads and bridges'' out there--just a terrible \ninfrastructure issue. What separates America in terms of getting our \ngoods to market around the globe is a world-class infrastructure. \nInvestment in that infrastructure has waned in recent years as we have \ndangerous bridges and we have roads that are in desperate need of \nrepair. That is one of those things--to maintain the postal roads--that \nthe Constitution uniquely assigns to the United States Congress. That \nis on the to-do list.\n  Update our national WRRDA policy, Mr. Speaker. We are going to have \nwars on this planet--mark my words--not over oil, but over fresh water. \nHaving a freshwater infrastructure, maintaining our natural resources, \ntaking care of and being good stewards of those resources that we have \nbeen entrusted with are critically important. It is one of those things \nthat the Federal Government has a dominant role in doing. We have to \nget on that.\n  Tax relief, Mr. Speaker. Where is that family back home who isn't \ntrying to figure out how next month works and the month after that and \nthe month after that?\n  I keep hearing about this economic recovery, and yes, the numbers are \ngetting better slowly, but they are not improving nearly fast enough. \nThe folks cannot afford to support an inefficient Federal Government. \nTax relief is on that list.\n  Medicare, Mr. Speaker. There is not a man or a woman in this Nation \nwho depends on Medicare who does not know it is in fiscal peril. There \nis not enough money in the Medicare trust fund to meet the promises \nthat we have made to America's seniors. There is not enough money in \nthe Medicare trust fund even though working age men and women begin \npaying in on their very first paychecks to meet the promises of this \ngeneration and the next. We owe America better than that. Fixing that \nis on the to-do list.\n  Improving veterans' care, Mr. Speaker. For Pete's sake, talk about \nsomething that is uniquely this government's responsibility. We ask so \nmuch of the young men and women in uniform who serve and protect this \nNation, and they ask nothing of us. We make promises to them, and we \nmust keep those promises. It is hard to open up the newspaper and not \nread a story of America's failing its veterans. We must do better, and \nwe can do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, cutting spending. For Pete's sake, when folks back home \ndo send a dollar's worth of taxes to Washington, D.C., they don't \nbelieve they\n\n[[Page H2133]]\n\nare going to get a dollar's worth of value out of it. They think it is \ngoing to get thrown down some rat hole somewhere, on some pet project \nthat is not going to benefit anyone. They think it is going to get \nwasted on a regulatory infrastructure that isn't modernized for the \n21st century. Every family has to do more with less in tough economic \ntimes, and the Federal Government is no different. This is just the \nbeginning of the to-do list, Mr. Speaker.\n  It is dreary outside. There is a steady mist coming down. I haven't \nseen the Sun out there for days. Sometimes I get back home, and I hear \nthat same kind of spirit coming from folks who are trying to feed and \nprovide for their families. There is a dreariness out there, Mr. \nSpeaker, such that folks feel like self-governance is not serving them \nin the way that it should. That is why you and I ran for Congress and \nthat is why I have come to the House floor today with good news.\n  It is true that when you open up the newspaper, it is failure after \nfailure after failure, but that is not telling the story of the work \nthat the good men and women of this Chamber are doing, that Republicans \nand Democrats are coming together to do, that the House and the Senate \nare coming together to do, that the Congress and the White House are \ncoming together to do. In this election season of everybody's talking \nabout what divides us, of everybody's talking about what the failures \nare, I want to talk about those things that unite us and on which we \nare succeeding for the American people together.\n  Mr. Speaker, there have been 36 short-term transportation extensions \nsince the last time we passed a long-term transportation bill. Thirty \nsix short-term extensions. If anybody is in the construction business, \nMr. Speaker, they know you can't plan to build a bridge in a matter of \ndays. This is a multiyear project. You need long-term planning and you \nlong-term certainty.\n  Historically, that is what the Congress has provided: Republicans and \nDemocrats coming together in a bipartisan way and Congress and the \nWhite House coming together to provide for a multiyear transportation \nbill. But it has been more than two decades, Mr. Speaker, since this \nbody has passed a 5-year transportation bill--a multiyear \ntransportation bill--that provides certainty to folks back home and \nthat fulfills the commitment that every American citizen expects from \nthe Federal Government in having collected gas taxes on every gallon of \ngas that the American consumer buys.\n  We all know about the infrastructure needs in this country. For more \nthan two decades, Congress and the White House had not been successful \nin fulfilling that responsibility. When Republicans ran the show, we \nfailed. When Democrats ran the show, we failed. When Republicans were \nin the White House, we failed. When Democrats were in the White House, \nwe failed. But this Congress--the men and women gathered here with this \nPresident in the White House--came together, and we succeeded with the \nfirst long-term transportation bill in more than 20 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, 5 years of funding is just the beginning. I won't tell \nyou this is the end of the show. Our Transportation and Infrastructure \nchairman, Bill Shuster of Pennsylvania, wants to do more. This isn't \nthe end. This is the beginning. It is a fantastic beginning, and it is \none that we ought to celebrate of $305 billion going back to \ncommunities around this Nation to focus on safety and infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, it streamlines the process--the most dramatic \nstreamlining of the regulatory process. It often takes longer to get \nregulatory approval to build a bridge than it does to build the bridge \nitself--years wasted on approval processes that could have been \nstreamlined while we are still being good stewards of our environmental \nresources. This bill does that. It also eliminates the increase in \ncosts that come with those delays, Mr. Speaker, the increase in costs \nthat come from that bureaucracy so as to make sure the American \ntaxpayer is getting more value for his dollar.\n  Mr. Speaker, it shores up the highway trust fund, and we will talk a \nlot about trust funds in this time today. The highway trust fund was \ngoing bankrupt. The highway trust fund didn't have enough money to meet \nthe needs of the American highways, so $70 billion has been transferred \ninto that trust fund to make sure that we are keeping the promises that \nwe have made to America.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been two decades since America has had this kind \nof transportation success. We did that together. Open up the newspaper \nand see the divides and see the failures, but know that this is a \nsuccess that we had together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I had water resources on America's to-do list. It had \nbeen 6 years since we had passed water resources legislation in this \nbody, not in 2008 when Republicans controlled the White House, not in \n2009 when Democrats controlled everything, not in 2010 when Democrats \ncontrolled everything, and not in '11 or '12 or '13, but we have come \ntogether, and we have gotten that done. It is not easy. It is hard. It \ndoesn't happen quickly. It happens slowly and deliberatively. It has \nbeen 6 years since we have been able to succeed together in passing \nwhat we call the WRRDA bill, Mr. Speaker. Now it is done. Now it is the \nlaw of the land.\n\n  I want to make that clear, Mr. Speaker. I am not talking about bills \ntoday that the House has passed and are going nowhere. I am not talking \nabout bills today that the House has passed and the Senate has passed \nbut that are going nowhere. I am talking about bills today on which the \nHouse has worked entirely through the process, on which the Senate has \nworked entirely through the process, and those which the President of \nthe United States has signed into law--bills that are laws and are \nmaking differences for America's families.\n  This WRRDA bill, the Water Resources Reform and Development Act, is \nthe most comprehensive policy reform bill, again, in two decades, Mr. \nSpeaker. It accelerates project delivery because, again, there is no \nmore urgent need--as we see in Flint, Michigan--than having a stable \nand safe water infrastructure.\n  Mr. Speaker, it goes into $18 billion worth of projects--projects \nthat have been on the books for years but have failed, projects that \nfolks have not committed the time and resources to complete--and it \npulls those back in. It cancels all of those projects, saves that \nmoney, and rededicates it to projects that the American people can \nbenefit from; and it strengthens the oversight and accountability \nbecause these are American taxpayer dollars we are talking about here. \nWhen they go out the door to localities back home, folks deserve to \nknow they are being used responsibly. It is an increase in oversight \nand accountability. Again, it has been more than two decades since we \nhave seen something of this kind. We got it done together--Republicans, \nDemocrats, House, Senate, and White House.\n  Mr. Speaker, tax relief is on the list for American families, and tax \nrelief was delivered by this body--this Congress--and this White House. \nMr. Speaker, what Republicans failed to be able to do--and I am not \nknocking them. It was a difficult environment. I am a hardcore \nRepublican from the great State of Georgia, but when George Bush was in \nthe White House and when Republicans were running the House and when \nRepublicans were running the Senate, they provided tax relief, but they \ncouldn't make it permanent. They didn't have the votes to make it \npermanent, so it languished out there--families uncertain about what \nthe tax future would hold, businesses uncertain about what the tax \nfuture would hold. Together, in this body, with the President's \nsignature, we provided 99 percent of Americans the certainty that even \nGeorge Bush and a Republican House and Senate could not do.\n  Divided government is hard, Mr. Speaker. Divided government is hard. \nThe differences that we have on policy are dramatic, but there is still \nmore that unites us as a Nation than divides us as a Nation. That is \ntrue in this Chamber as well, so we came together on tax policy and did \nthat. Taxes were going to go up, Mr. Speaker. In this tough economy, \ntaxes were going to go up on almost every family in the land. We \nprevented that income tax increase from hitting 99 percent of all \nAmericans.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wanted to prevent the tax increase on 100 percent of \nAmericans, but I couldn't get the votes to get\n\n[[Page H2134]]\n\nthat done, and I know you would have joined me in that. Sometimes you \nhave a choice between can you get something done or will you get \nnothing done. Mr. Speaker, I promise you, if you are working hard in \ntrying to provide for your family back home, you do not care who is to \nblame for a problem; you just want the problem fixed. We could have \nstood around this Chamber and we could have argued amongst ourselves \nabout whether the perfect is the enemy of the good. We did not. We \nstruggled to find agreement, and we found that agreement, and we made a \ndifference for 99 percent of Americans in the struggling economy to \ndate. That counts, Mr. Speaker.\n  We talk about the to-do list as to the Medicare trust fund. Mr. \nSpeaker, back in the late 1990s, when Newt Gingrich was the Speaker of \nthe House and when Bill Clinton was the President, they made an effort \nto protect the Medicare trust fund from going bankrupt. This is \nsomething that has been on the minds of Americans all the way back to \n1965. The Medicare trust fund has never been properly funded. \nHealthcare costs have always had a rate of inflation that has been \nhigher than that of other services, and we have struggled with how to \nmake the math work. They came up with a plan back in 1997 to fix it. \nThe plan didn't work, and it was going to cause a dramatic reduction in \nwhat doctors were reimbursed and a dramatic reduction in the benefits \nthat were available to senior citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, so what happened in 2003, when it came time for those \nfirst painful cuts to go into place, the first effort to protect the \nMedicare trust fund?\n  Congress kicked the can down the road. They delayed those cuts from \ngoing into place for 1 year.\n  What happened the next year?\n  They delayed it for a year again. The next year, they delayed it \nagain. Then the next year, again and again and again and again--17 \ntimes, Mr. Speaker. We had come together and passed legislation that \nwas designed to protect the Medicare trust fund, and when it came time \nto actually do the heavy lifting, we kicked that can down the road, all \nthe while having the trust fund becoming more and more and more \nunstable. We all knew there was a problem, but nobody wanted to take \nthe responsibility of fixing it.\n  Mr. Speaker, in this divided Congress, in this divided government, in \nthis Washington that supposedly can't come together to fix American \nproblems, we passed H.R. 2. It was the first bill out of the gate. \nWell, it was the second bill out of the gate, but it came right out in \nfront. H.R. 2 was the first Medicare reform proposal to be signed into \nlaw in more than 10 years, and it solved a problem that had been \ncreated almost 20 years ago but that no Congress before or no President \nbefore had had the courage to permanently fix.\n  Mr. Speaker, we talk about Medicare as one of the third rails of \npolitics--don't touch that rail, or else you will be defeated. This \nbody is not about who wins and who gets defeated. This body is about \nwho can make a difference. We needed to make a difference for folks who \nwere relying on Medicare. There were 392 House Members and 92 Senators \nwho supported this bill. We hadn't been able to fix it for almost 20 \nyears. We hadn't been able to fix it, so the can had been kicked down \nthe road 17 times.\n  We came together, grappled with it, struggled with it, but ultimately \ncame up with a proposal that almost all of the House and almost all of \nthe Senate could support. They called it the sustainable growth rate, \nthe SGR, that eliminated this failing piece of Medicare policy, that \nbent the long-term cost curve of Medicare, extending the life of the \ntrust fund. In fact, it cuts the actuarial deficit in Medicare by \nalmost 10 percent.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  This is heavy lifting, Mr. Speaker, that Congress has punted on and \npunted on and punted on. With the leadership we have here today, with \nthe collaboration that we have here today, not only did we pass it, not \nonly did the Senate pass it, but we were able to pass it into law.\n  There are many parts of Medicare, Mr. Speaker. There is part A, part \nB, part C, part D. $2.4 trillion, Mr. Speaker, is the way we bent the \ncost curve on those various components of Medicare in order to protect \nand ensure Americans for another generation that Medicare would be \nthere for them.\n  Veterans: Mr. Speaker, again, you cannot open up the newspaper today \nwithout seeing the way that the system is failing our veterans. There \nis nothing that brings us together more in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker, \nthan standing up for those who have stood up for us.\n  We did that in the Veteran Access, Choice, and Accountability Act, \nMr. Speaker. It was the largest overhaul of veterans health care, \nagain, in more than a decade.\n  When Republicans ran the whole show, we couldn't get it done. When \nDemocrats ran the whole show, they couldn't get it done. When we are \ndivided, but focused, on crisis in this country, we have come together \nand we have gotten it done for the first time, Mr. Speaker.\n  For the first time in the history of veterans health care, we have \nsaid: If the veterans healthcare system is failing you, but you, as a \nserviceman or -woman, did not fail us, we are going to give you a \nprocess to get outside of that veterans system. We are going to give \nyou a chance to go see your own doctor. We are going to give you a \nchance to go see any specialist you need. We are going to give you a \nchance to get the care that we promised you, but that the bureaucratic \nhealthcare system has failed to deliver.\n  Mr. Speaker, in all of these many years of budget cutting that we \nhave talked about--trying to clamp down on spending, trying to make \nsure that all taxpayer dollars are being accounted for--so many \naccounts are going down, but veterans spending is going up.\n  Why? Because budgeting is about prioritizing. And when we come \ntogether not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans, we \nprioritize those who have served us.\n  It is the biggest change in health care for veterans in over a \ndecade, Mr. Speaker, and folks are finally able to get the health care \nthat they need. That is not it. There is more.\n  There is still a system in place that is failing veterans, Mr. \nSpeaker. We couldn't come together on reforming the entire Veterans \nAdministration. But we did come together on saying that: If you work at \nthe Veterans Administration and you are failing our veterans, there is \nno place for you on the Federal payroll.\n  You know how hard it is to get rid of failing Federal employees, Mr. \nSpeaker. We came together in a bipartisan way to say: If you are in the \nupper echelons of the VA, we are asking more of you. If you are in \ncharge of serving our veterans, we are asking more of you. If you fail, \nwe are going to ask you to leave so we can get somebody else in there.\n  We streamlined the firing process, Mr. Speaker, to get rid of \nineffective employees as we had not done before in Federal employment.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's talk budgets. You know ending budget deficits is \none of America's priorities. You know getting out of the businesses of \nmortgaging our children's future is one of America's priorities.\n  From 1966 to 2009, Mr. Speaker--and I chose that time because that \nwas the beginning of Medicare and Medicaid, which are two of the \nlargest spending programs on the ledger today. They are two that have \nballooned much larger than their authors ever suggested that they \nwould. This is when we got into some really difficult entitlement \nspending decisions.\n  From 1966 to 2009, that 43-year period, the debt in this country went \nup by 55 percent relative to GDP. It is still these mandatory spending \nprograms that are driving our debt, but over a 43-year period our debt \nwent up 55 percent.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the first 3 years of the Obama administration, our \ndebt went up another 34. For 43 years, it had gone up 55 percent, way \ntoo much, but a gradual increase. In 3 years, it went up 35 percent. We \nwent from going up about 1 percent a year to going up 10 percent a \nyear, Mr. Speaker.\n  Today, with this Congress, this House, this Senate, divided \ngovernment, from 2012 to 2015, when we have been grappling with this \nissue together, when we have been looking for answers together, when no \nside had complete control, but we had to work together to find \nsolutions, we have collapsed that increase back down to that\n\n[[Page H2135]]\n\n1 percent a year. There is so much more to do, but we just disagree.\n  The President introduces a budget every year. That budget never \nbalances, not this year, not next year, not 10 years from now, not 100 \nyears from now. The President has different investment priorities than \nI do.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee. We do a budget every year. It always \nbalances. So I have budgets that balance and budgets that never come to \nbalance. Clearly, that is a big gap to bridge.\n  We have begun to bridge it, Mr. Speaker, collapsing the dramatic \nincrease in the debt to levels that are still too high, but don't \nthreaten our security as years past have. But no one ever believed we \nwould be able to come together to do that. No one ever believed we \ncould work with the President to get that done, and, yet, we have.\n  Mr. Speaker, a lot of that comes from the Budget Control Act. One of \nthe best votes I have taken in this institution was the vote for the \nBudget Control Act. It was the largest reduction in Federal spending in \nthe history of the republic. Hear that, Mr. Speaker.\n  In divided government--in fact, there was a Republican House, \nDemocratic Senate, Democratic President, dramatically divided \ngovernment. Power of the filibuster in the Senate. Hard to get anything \ndone. We came together because America needed us to, to reduce spending \nin the most dramatic way in the history of the republic. It is not \nbecause somebody had all the votes and they jammed it through, but \nbecause we worked together to find a policy that made sense.\n  Mr. Speaker, people always think, when you talk about big budget and \ndeficit reductions, that you are talking about some sort of phony \nWashington, D.C., math. You have seen the examples where you raise \nspending by $5 instead of $10 and then you call that a cut. We have all \nseen that math. Nonsense.\n  When I talk about budgets, I am talking about real numbers. I am \ntalking about money going out the door. I am talking, even though we \nhave 10,000 men and women a day qualifying for Social Security and \nMedicare, 10,000 new applicants every day for Social Security and \nMedicare, working together, we reduced the total amount of money going \nout the door not just for 1 year, but for 2 years. That is not funny \nWashington, D.C., math, Mr. Speaker. Those are real numbers, real \ndollars, going out the door.\n  We bent the curve together. Some of my colleagues might say we did \ntoo much. I would say we haven't done nearly enough, but we came \ntogether and we made a difference for deficits.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the biggest differences we can make for deficits \nis putting folks back to work. It turns out you can't pay taxes if you \ndon't have a job. You have to have money coming in the door in order to \nbe part of the system. So we focused together on creating American \njobs. We focused together on putting families back to work. Again, this \nis something that unites us. It does not divide us.\n  We have done it in the spirit of trade, Mr. Speaker. We have done it \nin the spirit of manufacturing. We have passed legislation here that \nthe President signed into law that is working today to make sure, if \nyou work in a manufacturing industry in America, you are not \ndisadvantaged relative to foreign competition.\n  If we are trying to export the best products made in the world today, \nthose manufactured by American hands, we are tearing down the trade \nbarriers that are preventing those products from getting into the hands \nof customers who want them overseas. We have done that together.\n  When it comes to tearing down those trade barriers, Mr. Speaker, \nAmerica is already virtually a free trade zone. We always say we will \nplay fair with other nations, but other nations don't always say that \nto us.\n  So this Congress empowered the President to go out and do those \nnegotiations, to tear down those barriers, to make sure that American \nworking families always get a fair shake on the global scene. Mr. \nSpeaker, we haven't seen that happen in a decade.\n  A Republican Congress came together to work with a Democratic \nPresident to say we are all in this boat together. Putting families \nback to work is not a Republican priority alone, though it is a \nRepublican priority. It is not a Democratic priority alone, though it \nis a Democratic priority. It is an American priority. That is why \nAmerica's House and America's Congress and America's President work on \nit together.\n  Mr. Speaker, that takes me back to where I started. I will put \nAmerica's to-do list up here on the board. I talked about the dreary \nweather outside and kind of the dreary spirit that I feel sometimes \nwhen I talk to folks about how Congress is operating and how Congress \nand the President are working together and how America, in the spirit \nof self-governance, is succeeding or failing at addressing America's \npriorities.\n  Mr. Speaker, we did the first roads and bridges bill, $305 billion, \nin more than two decades. It is more long-term certainty than America \nhad seen in 20 years because it was the right thing to do.\n  We updated the national water policy, Mr. Speaker. We have done \nmore--it was the most substantial, positive improvement to delivering \nclean water to American citizens than we have seen in more than a \ndecade. We did that together.\n  Tax relief: Mr. Speaker, working together, we prevented taxes from \ngoing up on 99 percent of American families. Working together, we did \nthings that George Bush and a Republican Congress couldn't do because \nthey didn't have the votes 15 years ago. We did that together because \nit was the right thing to do in this tough economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, we came together on Medicare reform. There were 17 \nshort-term extensions, kicking the can down the road, Congress and the \nPresident afraid to take a stand and solve a problem. We came together \nand did that, Republicans and Democrats, House and Senate, President \nObama and America's Congress.\n  Improving veterans health care: Mr. Speaker, for the first time in \nAmerican history, if the veterans healthcare system is failing you, we \ngive you an exit ramp to go and see your physician, your specialist, \nthe best that America has to offer, because, as a serviceman or -woman, \nwe have made promises to you and, in a bipartisan, bicameral way, we \nare committed to keeping those promises. It is the biggest reforms in \nmore than 10 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have cut spending. We have cut spending not with \nphony Washington, D.C., math, but with real dollars going out the door. \nThe biggest deficit-reduction package in American history we did \ntogether, a divided government, divided Congress. But it is the right \nthing to do for the American people, and that is what this Congress is \nabout.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is just the beginning of the to-do list. I don't \nwant to feel like I am tooting the horn of bipartisanship in this \ninstitution. I didn't even have education reform on that list. I didn't \nhave education reform on that list. But we have done it.\n  We have come together in a bipartisan way, bicameral, with the White \nHouse, signed into law the biggest evolution of education policy that \nwe have seen in 10 years. Again, it has been more than a decade since \nwe have come together to make sure that principals, teachers, and \nparents have more control over the education of children in our \ncommunities.\n  We repealed 49 different programs, Mr. Speaker. I am not saying \nhardcore conservative Republicans repealed them. I am not saying \nliberal Democrats repealed them. I am saying together we scoured the \nentire Federal education landscape looking for ways to do better for \nour families back home.\n  When we rolled up our sleeves, when we took off the Republican and \nDemocratic labels, when we all sat down as parents and grandparents and \ncommunity leaders about how to do better for our children, we found 49 \nprograms, all of which had a constituency out there, all of which had \nsomebody making a buck off of them, but they were programs that were \nfailing our children and we ended them. We ended them together because \nit was the right thing to do. It is the biggest education reforms, Mr. \nSpeaker, again, in more than a decade.\n  Mr. Speaker, I don't have the time to go through the difference that \nwe are making together. From our veterans,\n\n[[Page H2136]]\n\nH.R. 91, H.R. 203, H.R. 313, H.R. 2499, on and on and on, not bills \nthat we have passed here in the House, though we have, but bills we \nhave passed in the House, bills that have been passed in the Senate, \nbills that the House and Senate have come together on, bills that have \nbeen sent to the President's desk, and bills that the President has \nsigned into law, making a difference.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Mr. Speaker, reducing the size and scope of government. H.R. 1626, \nH.R. 2029, H.R. 2048, and the list goes on and on and on. Doing things \ntogether for our bosses back home because they are going to make a \ndifference.\n  Mr. Speaker, creating jobs and expanding economic opportunity. Again, \nH.R. 2029, H.R. 22, H.R. 1000, S. 535. Mr. Speaker, yes, there are even \nsome bills that originated in the Senate that are delivering for the \nAmerican people. I am proud to say most of them start with H.R., but \nthere are even a few Senate bills in there. Good ideas from the other \nbody that we took on, that we made better, that we sent to the \nPresident's desk, that he signed.\n  Defending America's freedom and security, patient-centered healthcare \nsolutions. Mr. Speaker, everybody talks about the President's \nhealthcare bill. You are either for it or you are against it. It is a \ndivisive issue. Nobody talks about the fact that there are parts of the \nPresident's healthcare bill that I believe are broken from the hard \ncore right and that my friends on the left believe are broken, too. And \nso we have come together not once, not twice, not three times, not five \ntimes, but almost a dozen times to repeal parts of the President's \nhealthcare bill that we all agreed were not serving the American \npeople.\n  Mr. Speaker, at the end of the day, it is not about who can be a good \nRepublican or who can be a good Democrat. It is about who can be a good \npublic servant, and that is never going to make the front page of the \nnewspaper. It is never going to be a part of this Presidential election \ncycle. It is never going to be in a commercial on TV talking about how \nsuccessful we are when the cameras go off, when the labels come off, \nand when we are focused on what we all came here to do, and that is to \nmake a difference.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are going to keep going on through this election \ncycle. There is going to be more division, there is going to be more \nstrife, and there is going to be more finding out who is to blame and \nwhose fault it is.\n  I have gotten to know the men and women in this Chamber, Mr. Speaker. \nI confess, there were some of them that I wanted to dislike from the \nget-go. Oh, I wanted to dislikes them. I had seen them on TV, and I \nknew they didn't have any merit, didn't have any business being here, \ndidn't have any desire to serve the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, my confession here today is I was wrong. I was wrong. \nThere are colleagues on the other side of the aisle with whom I \ndisagree with about virtually everything, but for that one small issue \non which we find some common ground, they will roll up their sleeves \nand they will bleed with me and sweat with me until we find a way to \nmake a difference for families back home in their district and mine.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are folks on the other side who come down here on \nthis floor and rail and rail and rail, and it is every partisan tagline \nthat you could imagine, but when the camera goes off, they roll up \ntheir sleeves and they get to work on making a difference for their \ndistrict and for mine.\n  Mr. Speaker, my voice is not loud enough to drown out all the \ndivision that is in a Presidential election campaign. Mr. Speaker, my \nvoice is not loud enough to drown out all the commercials going on all \nover the country and all the headlines all over the country that talk \nabout how Washington is a big cesspool, and it is broken, and we should \njust give up on self-governance altogether, but not me. My voice may \nnot be loud enough, but it will be tireless.\n  I believe in self-governance. I believe that my district has \npriorities that are going to be different from priorities in another \ndistrict, and that is okay. I believe that division sometimes brings \nout the best of ideas, and that is okay. I believe that my colleagues \nbelieve that there is no challenge too big for America to confront when \nAmericans confront it together.\n  I do not know what November holds, but I know this: We have the best \nsystem of governance on the planet. It is not easy. It is not clean. It \nis not simple. But when you put the American people in charge, it is \neffective.\n  Mr. Speaker, you are not going to sell good newspapers talking about \nthe difference that we make together in self-governance, but we are \ngoing to make that difference together. Folks here didn't come for the \nheadlines. They came to do the things that mattered, and I am proud to \nwork with folks on both sides of the aisle to get that done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2136-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2136]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        MESSAGE FROM THE SENATE\n\n  A message from the Senate by Ms. Curtis, one of its clerks, announced \nthat the Senate has passed without amendment a bill of the House of the \nfollowing title:\n\n       H.R. 2908.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as I listened to my good friend--and I \nthink it is important that we note that our colleagues are good friends \nand Americans who care. That is why I have come to the floor to \nchallenge the hearts and minds of my colleagues, for my discussion \ntoday, as the gentleman that preceded me, will be in the Congressional \nRecord for my colleagues to peruse and for the American people to \nperuse.\n  I do take note of the fact, as the gentleman recounted the history of \nbudgets--and I might say that I, too, spent time working on the 1997 \nbudget. I have been privileged to serve from that time when a \nbipartisan effort--with everyone, in essence, putting down their \nobstructionist perspectives--generated one of the best health insurance \nprograms for our children, called CHIP, that the Nation has seen, that \nmillions of American children are now insured.\n  But it is important to note that the present Republican majority \nfailed to put a budget on the floor for us to vote up or down, \nprimarily because there were Members in their own conference that would \nnot vote because the cuts were not sufficient, even though trillions of \ndollars were cut from education and many other services that the \nAmerican people need.\n  Now, I know that the American people are very independent. There are \nStates that have worked very hard to ensure that their particular \ncitizens in their State are well taken care of, but the one thing I \nknow about the Federal Government, it is the umbrella on a rainy day.\n  I will go home to my district, having suffered the terrible impact of \nmajor flooding, 20 inches of rain devastating young families, \ndevastating people who flooded just less than a year ago in May of \n2015. Oh, we pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps, tore out carpet, \nthrew out all of our personal possessions, but we needed the umbrella, \nFEMA, that is en route to my district now to help those who cannot help \nthemselves or those who had never flooded in 50 years. So we cannot \ndiscount the role of the Federal Government.\n  The United States military is the finest in the world. The Affordable \nCare Act, yes, needs to be fixed in certain areas, but 20 million \nAmericans have gotten insurance, and more Americans have private \ninsurance because they said, you know what, it is the right thing to \ndo.\n\n[[Page H2137]]\n\n  So it troubles me when we talk about a budget that should have been \nput on the floor that was a combination of the efforts of Democrats and \nRepublicans, and when we listen to the President and work together, but \nno budget has come because they realize the draconian budget that is \nslashing government, throwing people out in the streets is not a budget \nthat America can even tolerate. They could not overcome those that \ndidn't even want that budget. They wanted to cut and slice education, \nresources to our military, health care, and the environment even more.\n  So I stand in the backdrop of that challenge to challenge this \nCongress again. I was one of the first Members of Congress to deal with \nraising the need for serious attention to the Ebola virus as it hit \nTexas in Dallas. The first American to be diagnosed was in our State of \nTexas.\n  I began as a member of the Committee on Homeland Security to ask what \nour airports were doing, how are we assessing those who are traveling \ninto our country, and making sure that the Centers for Disease Control \nwere at my airports, both in Dallas and in Houston, Texas.\n  Now 1 year later or a couple of years later, we are now facing this \nissue called the Zika virus. I want to be very clear, we are not paying \nthe attention to this that we should.\n  A headline reads: ``Scarier Than We Initially Thought.'' The CDC, the \nCenters for Disease Control, sounds a major alarm, a warning regarding \nthe Zika virus. ``Public health officials used their strongest language \nto date in warning about a Zika outbreak in the United States, as the \nObama administration lobbied Congress for $1.9 billion to combat the \nmosquito-borne virus.''\n  What did I start out by saying?\n  The Federal Government should not run our lives, but it is the \numbrella on a rainy day. It is the only entity that can muster the \nstakes and resources to deal with what the CDC has said is a far more \nserious issue.\n  If we look at Puerto Rico, they are the eye of the storm. Texas, the \neye of the storm. Florida, the eye of the storm. It is important to \nnote that we have not done what we should be doing.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, which \nhas a core mission of emergency preparedness of State and local \ngovernments to be equipped to react to emergencies, I am acutely aware \nof the potential for the Zika virus to be a real challenge for State \nand local governments in the coming months. You need our help.\n  This House has done nothing to respond to the President's request for \n$1.9 billion in emergency funds. My friends, this is not a frivolous \nrequest.\n  What do emergency funds mean?\n  Someone said, just go write a check out of the operating budget of \nthe United States. You want us to be more fiscally responsible than \nthat. We have a budget. We have funding that we have to obligate to the \nother needs of this Nation. The reason why the President rose to the \nlevel of the emergency funding, because emergency funding can come \nimmediately outside of the budgeting process and begin to get these \ndollars to community health entities in our States and the Centers for \nDisease Control, who will have to be dispatched to our States to help \nif the epidemic becomes uncontrollable. No action.\n  One leader in this House said they are doing absolutely nothing in \nresponse to the President's request. They don't want to give him the \nmoney. Thank goodness the Senate has just passed a compromise, the \nother body, $1.9 billion in emergency funding for this important effort \nthat we must have.\n  I come from Houston that has a tropical climate, with many climatic \nsimilarities with other States along the Gulf Coast, parts of Central \nand South America, as well as the Caribbean. Tropical climates are \nhospitable to mosquitoes that carry the Zika virus. In addition, \nHouston has a large and very diverse population that travels to many \nparts of the Zika virus-impacted zones located throughout Central and \nSouth America and the Caribbean where mosquito transmission of the Zika \nvirus is a primary means of exposure to the illness.\n  People coming back and forth into the United States, citizens, those \nwho have legal documents will travel across this Nation. There is no \nreason to point to these individuals and make them scapegoats. We \nshould be prepared.\n  What about vacationers?\n  No matter how much you have spoken about the Zika virus, there will \nbe vacationers who will still be going to places because they planned \ntheir vacation. They are going right into the heart of the storm.\n  As we well know, those women who will become pregnant will be the \nprime target for a devastating impact on their embryo, their baby that \nmay be born with severe brain damage, lifelong brain damage.\n  We held a hearing early in March because I knew that I could not wait \nto educate my community. I called the Zika virus planning meeting along \nthe Gulf Coast that would include doctors, agency officials, community \nservice and faith-based organizations to start to build the bridges \nbetween those communities to defeat Zika.\n  As you well know, the summer Olympics will be held this year, and all \nof our American athletes will be going to Brazil. Brazil is also one of \nthe serious sites of the Zika-carrying mosquito. It is a very serious \nand important effort.\n  Communities across America should not be panicking, but they should \nbe preparing their community health centers, their public health system \nto confront the Zika virus if it comes to their community either by way \nof an individual who needs treatment or by chance of this mosquito.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  So I have called for a national task force on the prevention of Zika \nvirus infections in order to target funding for tropical climate areas, \nlike Houston, south Texas, Florida, and other places in the southern \nregion of the United States that have a tropical population, and to \nfocus on the environmental cleanup of city water and trash near \npopulated areas.\n  Most people are aware of the extreme flooding--20 inches of rain--\nthat hit my community just 10 to 15 days ago. There were large amounts \nof sitting water and trash in a tropical area, tires. I visited a site \nin my district after the rains that had sitting water. It was just an \nopen, welcoming place for the Zika-carrying mosquito.\n  I have also asked for public education campaigns targeting all public \nand private pediatric clinics and OB/GYN services for pregnant women. I \nneed them to be educated that any mosquito repellant that does not have \nthe DEET name on it is not sufficient.\n  If you are traveling overseas, your mosquito repellant must say the \nword ``DEET,'' which was work that I did in the United States Congress \na few years ago when mosquito repellants did not have that word on \nthem. We worked legislatively and with the EPA to ensure that you knew \nif it had that component. And you must be careful in using that as \nwell.\n  We want to provide DEET repellant free to certain high-risk \npopulations, in cooperation with private companies. Demand for DEET \nproducts will likely increase because the Zika virus is in the news. We \nmay run out. So it is important that companies need to be alerted to \nset aside products for tropical areas along the south Texas coast and \nother States along that tropical area going along the Gulf Coast: \nAlabama, as I have said, Florida, Mississippi, and others.\n  And keep children's wading pools empty of water, my friends.\n  These are goals that should be met. I encourage stakeholders to be \ncalm, but to meet with your infectious disease physicians, who are in \nall of your communities, along with your public health leaders, faith \nleaders, and others, to educate about this particular disease.\n  It is important that we move on this call by the President. This is \nnot frivolous. This is an effort that is as clear as if we had called a \nbattalion into operation--the United States military--because we were \nunder attack. This is prevention--being prepared for potential \ndevastating impact.\n  These are not my words. One of the most renowned infectious disease \ndoctors that we have the privilege of hosting in Houston at the Baylor \nCollege of Medicine, Dr. Peter Hotez, dean of the National School of \nTropical Medicine and professor of pediatrics\n\n[[Page H2138]]\n\nand molecular virology and microbiology at the Baylor College of \nMedicine, said the following points:\n\n       Zika virus infections will increase over the next few \n     months. Effects of the infections on pregnant women in the \n     first trimester will be, certainly, dangerous. It will impact \n     on the poor. Leadership to fight the spread of the Zika virus \n     must be local and must start now.\n\n  Dr. Peter Hotez said that this particular mosquito is the greatest \nkiller of people in the world. They are also called the yellow fever \nmosquito. Now they are acquiring the Zika virus. Dr. Hotez says we are \nexpecting 4 million Zika cases in the next 4 months, and to date, there \nare over a million cases in Brazil.\n  Remember, we are traveling back and forth. As all of you know, this \nis a small world. No one is kept from traveling internationally. We \ndon't close our borders, in terms of Americans traveling on business or \nother responsibilities that they have.\n  Pregnancy, during the first trimester of pregnancy if the mother is \nexposed to the Zika virus, it can invade the central nervous system. \nLet me say this more clearly. In pregnancy, if the mother is infected \nin the first trimester of pregnancy, it can invade the central nervous \nsystem of the developing baby and inhibit brain development, which can \nresult in stillbirths and brain damage. It occurs in 1 of every 10,000 \nbirths. And the rate for Zika virus exposure far exceeds that number.\n  Brain damage undermines the development either at birth, or the brain \nfails to develop properly after birth. The child will have difficulty \nin walking, difficulty in hearing, and difficulty with speech. Not all \ndevelopmental consequences are known.\n  This is Dr. Hotez:\n\n       Three factors together make Zika virus a threat to poor \n     communities: high concentrations of poverty--sitting trash \n     and tires that may be found in many of our more depressed \n     areas--the presence of the mosquitos; environmental \n     conditions that support mosquito breeding near people; and \n     the lack of resources for people to isolate themselves from \n     mosquitos, such as screens, replants, and air-conditioning.\n\n  Now, we all know that on the continent of Africa they have been able \nto bring down the epidemic of malaria by making sure that charities \nlike the United Nations and the Gates Foundation give mosquito nets to \nthe people to assist them.\n  Well, in the United States, I know a lot of people think everybody \nhas air-conditioning and that their doors and windows are closed. That \nis not true. There are people who have no air-conditioning and have \ntheir windows open or they have screens that have holes in them. It is \nsad to think, but it is true.\n  Or they are outdoors. They are walking along places that have this \nkind of circumstance--not because we want it to be that way, but after \na terrible and devastating storm like we had in Houston, we have mounds \nof trash.\n  I want to thank the mayor of the city of Houston and the Harris \nCounty Judge for working diligently on why I asked for extra money for \nthese areas: to clean up these trash areas. Now we have extra trash \nbecause we had this terrible flood. People are still out of their \nhomes, and trash is still piled up in many places.\n  We need partnerships critical to defeating the Zika virus-carrying \nmosquitos. Zika virus control requires more than spraying for \nmosquitos. Mosquito and animal control need to use the best methods for \npreventing the spread of the disease.\n  We can no longer say that disease is a problem from a foreign \ncountry, because it will be a problem here. Dr. Umair Shah said the \nimportant lesson from Ebola and Zika is that there is a strong \nconnection between global health and domestic health.\n  So, my friends, I am sounding the alarm not for panic, but \npreparation and preparedness, education, outreach, personal precaution, \nand understanding how to move around during this time, to cover up to \nprevent mosquito bites day and night--prevent the bites day and night--\nenvironmental cleanup. If you do not have the spray, use a mosquito net \nthat you can purchase.\n  It is important to note that the Zika virus is not a local mosquito \npopulation, but it will travel. Travelers must be educated regarding \nthe Zika virus. And if you are wondering about our local atmosphere, \nlet me tell you of the latest news.\n  Thirteen Zika virus cases are now reported in Virginia. Two new cases \nwere reported on Thursday, both of them in the northern region of \nVirginia, according to the Virginia Department of Health. I did not say \nBrazil. I said Virginia. There are now 388 cases nationwide as of \nThursday. According to the Centers for Disease Control, 33 with the \nvirus are pregnant. This is an action that we cannot avoid.\n\n  For anyone that has not seen the Zika virus-carrying mosquito, this \nis a mighty powerful mosquito. And don't in any way have me suggest \nthat this is the size of it, but you can see the elements of it; and \nwhat we are taught is that it is a pretty strong mosquito, not to be \ndeterred. We must get prepared.\n  So, as we look to the elements of preparedness, let me share some \nother issues that I think need to be addressed. I thought this was so \nimportant. The national media has helped us try to bring it to people's \nattention. I put an article in Time magazine myself, ``Congress Must \nAct Immediately to Combat Zika Virus.''\n  We are serious about this and have to get serious. We cannot have the \nSenate in a compromise of $1.1 billion on the emergency supplemental \nthat the President has asked for, yet this House has not done anything.\n  We are now going for the district work recess. I will be going home \nto my district to visit those individuals who are underwater, whose \nproperties are outside of their home, mosquito gathering sites where \ntrash is left not because they want to, but because so much has been \ntorn up because of the water and we are waiting for it to be picked up. \nMy community, my city needs these resources to do massive pickup of \ntires, massive cleanup of sitting water.\n  The Aedes mosquito is the most dangerous of the various Zika-carrying \nmosquitos. You can see that it is none too friendly looking. That is \nwhy I came to the floor today.\n  I want to leave with information directly to pregnant women, to give \nthe information that we know to provide them with the importance of the \nissues that we are confronting.\n  I include in the Record letters, Mr. Speaker, that I wrote in March \nto the Secretary of Health and Human Services pleading for the task \nforce. As well, I include a number of other items.\n  I also ask President Obama to look closely at the southern region and \nrim, where States like Texas, Louisiana, Alabama, Mississippi, and \nFlorida are, because they will be the epicenter. Even though there are \nnow 388 cases nationwide, 13 in Virginia, as the summer goes on, this \nis going to be of serious concern.\n  Let me suggest to you that this is a situation where women who are \npregnant are taking heed. Pregnant women in Houston and their doctors \nweigh the risks of the Zika virus. This is a very real circumstance. \nAnd our climate is very tropical.\n  This mother, Tracy Smith, and her children are at their home. Smith \nis pregnant with twins, and she is worried about the approach of the \nmosquito season. So OB/GYN doctors are now having to prepare their \nmothers. What kind of protection should they take? What kind of \nmosquito repellant should they utilize? And what measures? Should they \nhave mosquito nets inside their house, even though they may be living \nin an air-conditioned facility?\n  But what you say for one mother who may have a more economic level of \nopportunity than others, you need to say for the entire population of \npregnant women, because there is no doubt. Dr. Hotez has said this is \ngoing to be a season where we have to be extremely concerned about the \nZika virus and the Zika-carrying mosquito.\n  So what we are suggesting is mosquito traps. And they will be in \nthese areas that are attractive to their environment and their trends: \nsitting water, dirty water, wading pools. They are not prohibited, if I \nmight say, from getting an airplane ticket. They will get here on their \nown. We have to take it very seriously.\n  So, I want an immediate response by this House to pass the \nPresident's emergency supplemental and to work with the Senate on the \n$1.1 billion that has been requested.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  It is money to save lives of Americans. It is money to give pregnant\n\n[[Page H2139]]\n\nwomen comfort that their newborn child can be born in this country with \nthe best opportunity for survival and, of course, to reach their \nfullest potential.\n  Many of you have seen the video, tragically, of those babies with \nsmall brains that have now been born in countries in South and Central \nAmerica. It is a sentence, although we love everyone, that we should \nnot render to an unborn child.\n  And to that mother who is looking forward to raising that child, \neither her first or along with her other children, let me tell you what \nthe Zika virus will do. Pregnant women can be infected with the Zika \nvirus, as I said. The primary way that pregnant women get the Zika \nvirus is through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n  Zika virus can be spread by a man in sex partners. A pregnant woman \ncan pass Zika virus to a fetus. Zika virus can be passed from a \npregnant woman to a fetus during pregnancy or at delivery and then that \nimpact comes at a later time.\n  If a pregnant woman is exposed, we don't know how likely she is to \nget Zika. If a pregnant woman is infected, we still don't know how the \nvirus will affect her or her pregnancy.\n  We don't know how likely it is that Zika will pass to a fetus. We \ndon't know, if the fetus is infected, if the fetus will develop birth \ndefects. It means that they cannot cure this in the womb.\n  We don't know whether her baby will have birth defects. We don't know \nif sexual transmission of the Zika virus poses a different risk of \nbirth defects than mosquito-borne transmission.\n  So, because we have all these questions, we need the $1.9 billion \nthat the President asked, but we need it to begin to answer these \nquestions and we need to be able to have doctors like Dr. Hotez, a \nmajor leader in infectious disease, begin the research to know what is \nthe best repellent not in terms of mosquito repellent, but what is the \nbest scientific response to this dastardly and predictable potential of \nthe Zika-carrying mosquito coming to the United States and having an \nimpact on all of those who are excited about looking forward to the \nbirth of a newborn baby.\n  I hope that, as we return from our work recess, this House and the \nRepublican leadership, as was said earlier on the floor, end any \npartisan bickering, any debate or disagreement with the President of \nthe United States, and accept the fact that he is the Commander-in-\nChief and that his experts, the Centers for Disease Control, who are \nthe entity to which all of us in our respective communities immediately \nturn for assistance on infectious diseases or natural disasters as it \nrelates to health care--we call upon them to come to our districts and \nour States.\n  We ask them to help us and to make sure that we and our healthcare \nsystem are doing all that we can to be able to be helpful.\n  I do want to end by saying the reason why we are in such an alarm is \nthere is now no vaccine to prevent or medicine to treat the Zika \ninfection so that, if you are infected, as a mother, there is nothing \nright now. So we have to work on the research and the preventative \naspect in order to protect these unborn children.\n  The illness can be mild, with symptoms lasting for several days to a \nweek. But it is that unborn child right now and the larger impact we \nhave yet to understand.\n  People may not be sick. They may not be sick enough to go to the \nhospital. They may not die. For this reason, people might not realize \nthat they have been affected. That means we don't know whether their \ninfection can cause someone else to be infected because we need to do \nmore research.\n  We know it is transmitted by this mosquito. We need to make sure we \nunderstand whether there is any other kinds of transmissions that we \nhave.\n  We know that there have been Zika travel advisory notices. We know \nthat this is not a happy experience for the countries that we have \nlisted.\n  But I feel compelled to say that the Zika virus has been noted in \nCape Verde, the Caribbean, Aruba, Barbados, Bonaire, the Dominican \nRepublic, Guadeloupe, Haiti, Jamaica, Martinique, the Commonwealth of \nPuerto Rico, U.S. territories St. Maarten, St. Vincent, The Grenadines, \nTrinidad and Tobago, and the U.S. Virgin Islands.\n  The Zika virus is in Central America--Costa Rica, El Salvador, \nGuatemala, Honduras, Nicaragua, and Panama--Mexico, the Pacific \nislands, American Samoa, the Marshall Islands, Samoa, Tonga.\n  The Zika virus is in South America: Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, \nEcuador, French Guinea, Guyana, Paraguay, Surinam, and Venezuela.\n  I am not condemning these places. I am only asking that travelers \ntake caution. And pregnant women need to take counsel from their OB-\nGYN.\n  So, my friends, our job and task here in this country is to be the \numbrella on a rainy day. It is to ensure that the American people have \nall of the information that will help them make very important \ndecisions.\n  It is to make sure that our health system and our doctors who are in \ntheir offices, in general medicine or internal medicine, have all the \ninformation and tools to be able to determine whether a woman has been \ninfected and happens to be pregnant.\n  So my task here today is to say that we cannot wait. I am disturbed \nthat we now have a week and we have not yet passed the emergency \nsupplemental to help our friends in Puerto Rico, which, as I indicated, \nhave a serious, serious opportunity to be without the resources that \nthey need in the tropical climate that they are in to be able to \nconfront the Zika virus. That is a U.S. territory. How unfair that is.\n  To my friends in this House, you cannot wait any longer. When we come \nback, there needs to be on the floor of the House a bill passing the \nSenate compromise or the $1.9 billion emergency supplemental that the \nPresident has asked for, as the Commander-in-Chief. We need to roll up \nour sleeves. We need to ensure that the American people are taken care \nof.\n  And I just want to add this: Our military personnel are in tropical \nclimates. We can treat them with limited dignity absolutely not.\n  They must have both the medical personnel and the equipment to either \nbe of assistance to places where they are, where the epidemic may be, \nas they did when they were sent to Africa to help set up a hospital \nstructure that did not exist.\n  We don't know where this will be the worst, and I can assure you that \nour military personnel may be called on, working with the Centers for \nDisease Control. Are we going to leave them without the resources they \nneed? I hope not.\n  I take my role on the Homeland Security Committee very seriously. It \nis our responsibility to deal with the security of this Nation.\n  We have excellent Members who are working hard, such as my dear \nfriend Donald Payne, who is the ranking member of the Subcommittee on \nEmergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications. We work together \nto ensure that America is prepared.\n  Right now this Zika-carrying mosquito has the potential for being \nhere in the United States and creating havoc among pregnant women and \npossibly others.\n  What is our task? It is, Mr. Speaker, to do our job and to prepare \nthe American people. We owe that to the great and wonderful people of \nthis Nation, to the mothers and fathers expecting that bundle of joy. \nWe owe that to all of them.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, which has a core mission of emergency preparedness of state \nand local governments to be equipped to react to emergencies make me \nacutely aware of the potential for Zika Virus to be a real challenge \nfor state and local governments in the coming months.\n  This emerging health issue is a matter of great importance and one \nthat must be addressed in timely way through a coordinated effort by \nfederal, state and local government joined with community partners.\n  Houston Texas has a tropical climate with many climatic similarities \nwith other states along the Gulf Coast; parts of Central and South \nAmerica as well as the Caribbean. Tropical climates are hospitable to \nmosquitoes that carry the Zika Virus.\n  In addition, Houston has a large and very diverse population that \ntravels to many of the Zika Virus impacted zones located throughout \nCentral and South America and the Caribbean where mosquito transmission \nof the Zika Virus is the primary means of exposure to the illness.\n  I have identified shared concerns among state, and local agency \nofficials regarding a need to have a plan to address Zika Virus in\n\n[[Page H2140]]\n\nthe Houston and Harris County area that would include every aspect of \nthe community.\n  For these reasons, I called the Zika Virus planning meeting along the \nGulf Coast that would include doctors, agency officials, community \nservice and faith based organizations to start to build the bridges \nbetween these communities to defeat Zika whether it was contracted \nthrough travel or mosquito borne transmissions.\n  Houston is fortunate to have diverse community of pastors who serve \npeople in need throughout the area. Part of the Zika Virus response \nmust be to ensure that we are doing all that we can and should be doing \nto reach every community.\n  Congresswoman Jackson Lee's work on environmental mosquito mitigation \nissues:\n  As Congresswoman I worked with the EPA to get the word DEET on labels \nfor mosquito repellant that contained the ingredient that remains the \nmost effective mosquito repellant on the market.\n  CDC recommends that DEET is safe for use on children 2 months of age \nor older.\n  Congresswoman Jackson Lee's Action Plan:\n  National Taskforce on Prevention of Zika Virus infections;\n  Target Funding to Tropical Climate areas--like Houston and South \nTexas in the U.S.;\n  Focus environmental cleanup of sitting water, and trash (tires) near \npopulated areas;\n  Public Education campaign targeting all public and private pediatrics \npractices and OB/GYN service for pregnant women;\n  DEET Repellent;\n  Provide DEET Repellent free to certain high risk populations \nincorporation with private companies [Demand for DEET products will \nlikely increase because of Zika Virus in the news.]; Companies need to \nbe alerted to sit aside product for tropical areas along the South \nTexas Coast that will have the strongest need for the products; and\n  Keep children's wading pools empty of water.\n  Goals of the Meeting of Congresswoman Jackson Lee's March 10 Meeting \nin Houston Texas:\n  Engage stakeholders in a planning discussion on combating Zika Virus:\n  1. Learn what each agency is doing to address Zika Virus\n  2. Calm the community through information\n  3. Engage key stakeholders outside of government and health care in \nadvance of Mosquito Season 2016\n  4. Outline the strategy to defeating Zika Virus breeding areas\n  5. Learn what needs to be done to effectively communicate with every \ncommunity in the Houston/Harris County area\n  6. Discuss the emergency supplemental appropriations proposed by \nPresident Obama\n  What is Zika Virus:\n  Zika Virus is spread primarily through the bite of an infected Aedes \n[A-dees] species mosquito. It is important to remember that 80% of \nthose who get the Zika Virus will feel no symptoms. The most common \nsymptoms of Zika [Zee-Ka] are fever, rash, joint pain, and \nconjunctivitis (red eyes). The CDC reports based on what they know \nabout the virus to date--Zika virus illness is usually mild with \nsymptoms lasting for several days to a week after being bitten by an \ninfected mosquito. People usually don't get sick enough to go to the \nhospital, and they very rarely die of Zika. For this reason, many \npeople might not realize they have been infected. Once a person has \nbeen infected, he or she is likely to be protected from future \ninfections.\n  What is being done to address Zika Virus:\n  Federal: President Obama is seeking $1.6 Billion in emergency \nsupplemental appropriations to fund Zika Virus mitigation; response, \nlocal and state federal agency programs that address environmental \nclean up; public education, community engagement, testing; and mosquito \nabatement.\n  CDC has a disease surveillance unit at Bush Intercontinental Airport.\n  Importance of advocating for the President's request:\n  Congresswoman Jackson Lee advised that offices that will benefit from \nthe resources to fight Zika Virus in their communities should make \ntheir views known regarding the emergency supplemental appropriations.\n  Speakers:\n  Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine and \nProfessor of Pediatrics and Molecular Virology & Microbiology, Baylor \nCollege of Medicine, said.\n  4 Key points:\n  1. Zika Virus infections will increase over the next few months\n  2. Effects of the infections on pregnant women (first trimester)\n  3. Impact on the poor\n  4. Leadership to fight the spread of Zika Virus must be local\n  Dr. Peter Hotez said that Aedes Aegyptus mosquitoes are the greatest \nkiller of people in the world. They are also called the yellow fever \nmosquito.\n  Dr. Peter Hotez we are expecting 4 million Zika Virus cases in the \nnext four months and to date there are over a million cases in Brazil.\n  Pregnancy during the first trimester of pregnancy if the mother is \nexposed to the Zika Virus it can invade the central nervous system of \nthe developing baby and inhibit brain development, which can result in:\n  Still births;\n  Microcephaly [occurs in about 1 in every 10,000 births] the rate for \nZika Virus exposure far exceeds that number. Microcephaly is brain \nunder development either at birth or brain fails to develop properly \nafter birth: Difficulty walking, Difficulty hearing, Difficulty with \nspeech.\n  [Not all developmental or health consequences are known]\n  There are no tests to detect the virus, but not vaccine or cure.\n  Three factors together make Zika Virus a threat to poor communities: \nHigh concentrations of poverty; the presence of the Aedes mosquitoes; \nenvironmental conditions that support mosquito breeding near people and \na lack of resources for people to isolate themselves from mosquitoes \n[screens, replants, air conditioning, etc.].\n  Zika virus disease in pregnant women in Bahia, Paraiba, and \nPernambuco states, supports an association between Zika virus infection \nduring early pregnancy and the occurrence of microcephaly.\n  Primary source of the virus is through infected mosquito bites. \nPeople to people transmissions are rare, but can occur if the virus \nload in the body is high sexual contact can spread the virus.\n  Leadership must be local; the CDC is only serving in a technical \nadvisory role to local and state governments.\n  Dr. Umair Shah Executive Director for Harris County Public Health & \nEnvironmental Services, said:\n  Key points:\n  1. Partnerships are critical to defeating Zika Virus carrying \nmosquitoes\n  2. Zika Virus control requires more than spraying for mosquitoes\n  3. Mosquito and animal control use the best methods for preventing \nthe spread of disease\n  Dr. Umair Shah said that the important lesson from Ebola and Zika is \nthere is a strong connection between global health and domestic health.\n  We can no longer say that disease is a problem from that foreign \ncountry, because it will be a problem for the United States if it is \nnot addressed wherever it might originate.\n  He said that you can only effectively clap with two hands. The \npartnerships that must be developed among local, state and federal \nagencies as well as community leaders are critical to the success of \nwinning a fight against the Zika Virus.\n  Mosquito control will not be enough to deal with Zika Virus because \nthe host mosquito that is a primary carrier has evolved to live on \nhuman blood--even when given a choice of animal or human blood the \nAedes Egypti will choose human blood. It lives near the ground--so \nspraying in the air will not work; it likes to be near people; it \nrequires very little water to breed; it can hide under leaves, and will \nseek out homes where people live.\n  Zika Virus response requires a new approach:\n  Education;\n  Outreach;\n  Personal precaution:\n  Cover up to prevent mosquito bites day and night: Slogan ``Prevent \nthe bite day and night''\n  Environmental cleanup--removing things that will hold water, small \nwading pools for children, gutters, grills, tires, toys, trash, etc.\n  If you do not have air conditioning use a WHOPES approved net like \nPramax (156 holes per square inch and long enough to tuck under the \nmattress)\n  Permethrin-treated bed nets provide more protection--do not wash them \nor expose them to sunlight, which would break down an insecticide that \nkills mosquitoes and other insects.\n  Important to note: Zika Virus is not in the local mosquito population \nyet.\n  All domestic Zika cases except one have been linked to travel.\n  Travelers must be educated regarding Zika Virus. They should know the \nsymptoms and should seek care. They should not fear being shunned for \nhaving the virus.\n  Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health \nEnvironmental Services Mosquito Control Division, prior to his current \npublic service he served 25 years in the military.\n  Harris County Health Department Zika Website: http://www.hcphes.org/\npublications/hcphes responds/ 2016 zi ka virus/\n  Key points:\n  1. Get rid of the mosquito breeding habitat.\n  2. Ecologically people are the preferred food source for Aedes \nmosquitoes.\n  3. No need to panic.\n  4. The solution to Zika Virus is community involvement.\n  Dr. Dubboun traveled to Brazil to join others in his field to sharing \ninformation on mosquito control with the hope of determining the best \npractices to achieve better results.\n\n[[Page H2141]]\n\n  Dr. Dubboun said that the best approach to ending the threat of Zika \nvirus is to get rid of the habitat that is used by the mosquito to \nbreed. Ecologically people are the preferred food source for the Aedes \nmosquitoes.\n  He said that there was no need to panic because the weather right now \n(March 10, 2016-April 30, 2016) is not great for mosquito breeding, \nwhich means we have time to address environmental issues that support \nAedes mosquito breeding.\n  Spraying will not work to control the Aedes aegypti mosquito because \nthis mosquito does not fly in the air--it stays close to the ground; \ncan breed in very small amounts of water; and hide very well.\n  The solution to fighting the Zika Virus is community involvement in \nworking to minimize the habitats that allow Zika Virus carrying \nmosquitoes to breed.\n  Dr. Gruber, Assistant Commissioner from Regional and Local Health \nServices for the State of Texas:\n  Key points:\n  1. Number of cases in Texas and nearly have are in Harris County they \nare travel related except one;\n  2. Core ways to address key elements of a stop Zika effort.\n  Dr. Gruber said that he was there from the state to listen to what \nwas being said and to communicate that the state was planning to \nsupport communities in combating Zika Virus.\n  On April 14 the state of Texas there have been 31 confirmed cases of \nZika Virus, we know this because the patients were ill enough to seek \nmedical attention and the tests were positive. Twelve of those cases \nwere in Harris County.\n  It is important to note that 80% of people who will be infected will \nhave no symptoms, which means it is not possible to know how many \npeople have returned from travel with the virus or antibodies after \nhaving been exposed.\n  1. Core ways to address the existence of Zika Virus:\n  a. Health community communication with the public;\n  b. Correct vector control;\n  c. Surveillance;\n  d. Planning;\n  e. Keep yards clean; i. Communicate to authorities any needs for \nservices to assist with clean up or to address environmental issues \nrelated to Zika.\n  f. The battle against Zika must be viewed as a community fight--we \nmust enroll people to become members of the Public Health Army.\n  Bishop James Dixon, Community of Faith Church:\n  Key points:\n  1. The poor are not equipped to protect themselves from anything;\n  2. Education is key;\n  3. Access to the Community is essential;\n  4. Many churches have Haiti Missions that must be educated on this \nissue;\n  5. Larger forum to engage the community on the issues of Zika Virus\n  6. See others in the world as our neighbors, not as foreigners.\n  Bishop Dixon said that we must stop seeing the people of other \nnations as foreigners but neighbors.\n  People who are poor do not have the means of helping themselves. By \nthe very definition of poverty--it is not just a state of being, but a \nstate of existence, a state of mind, and the source of our ability to \nbe compassionate, not just think compassionately.\n  Education is key to reaching those who are most in need, but breaking \nthrough the barriers of poverty will require a great deal of effort.\n  People must come from outside of these communities into them to knock \non doors, pick up trash, hang mosquito netting, hand out DEET and show \npeople how to use it, help the elderly who cannot do their own yard \nclean up, share with people the city and county numbers to call to \nremove trash and tires, and teach people how to police their yards for \nitems that will allow mosquitoes to breed.\n  Prevention of Zika Virus transmission to humans must be the goal.\n  Houston has a very diverse community of pastors, ministers and \nreligious community leaders who should be part of this discussion and \nthe solution.\n  Dr. S.J. Gilbert Houston Metropolitan said that he wanted to bring \nthe Zika Virus issue to the attention of the diverse ministers \ncommunity and would support efforts by Congresswoman Jackson Lee.\n  Dr. Raouf Arafat Houston Health and Human Services Office of \nSurveillance and Public Health Preparedness said:\n  Key points:\n  1. Houston routinely deals with medical or health related \nemergencies;\n  2. The talent in the city and county government health departments \nare unmatched in other locations around the nation;\n  3. We work well together and see each other as partners;\n  4. The Laboratory serves the entire area with testing services;\n  5. Training of public health workers is essential; and\n  6. Communication is essential.\n  City of Houston Website on Zika: http://www.houstontx.gov/health/\nEpidemiology/Zika_Virus.html.\n  Dr. Arafat said that through surveillance and public health efforts \nthat Houston routinely responds to and effectively addresses \nemergencies that never see the light of day because they are well \nmanaged.\n  Disease control and prevention are areas where Houston excels and \nvery few areas of the country have a combination of very talented \npeople working in city and county government on the issue of public \nhealth.\n  We have laboratory services that can test for Zika Virus, but only in \ncases where the CDC guidelines are met, e.g., recent travel to a region \nwith the virus, symptoms consistent with the infection, etc.\n  As I have said the virus carrying mosquitoes are not in the Houston \narea.\n  My purpose in working on this issue is to make sure that Houston \nalong with other Gulf Coast communities is prepared for the 2016 \nmosquito season.\n  The U.S. has the experience and we should use it to help other \nnations, by doing so we also help ourselves. The strength of the U.S. \napproach is the systems that have been built up and developed over \ntime. These systems allow for us in Houston and Harris County to know \nif something serious is occurring in the city.\n  On January 1, 2016 people in this field of disease control expressed \na position that it was important to start working on Zika Virus issues, \nbut no one else was thinking about the virus. By January 29 everyone \nwas talking about Zika Virus.\n  Stephen Williams, Director of Houston Health Department, said:\n  Key points:\n  1. There is no need to be alarmed;\n  2. We have been thinking about this for some time;\n  3. The key to success will be personal responsibility; and\n  4. Environmental work has already begun.\n  Community action is important to meeting the challenge and each \nperson must play a part in the overall success of the plan.\n  The school education plans for Zika Virus in Houston Texas will begin \nin early to late April.\n  During this same period they will be doing a visibility campaign for \nthe public to learn about protecting themselves from the virus, which \nwill include multipurpose centers and community health clinics.\n  There is no need for alarm about the topic of Zika, we deal with and \ntake care of situations on a daily basis that no one ever knows about \nthat are serious.\n  We will be successful in Houston if the funding the President \nrequested are approved by Congress.\n  The city of Houston began ramping up waste cleanup in low income \nareas like the 3rd Ward located in my District by going after illegal \ndump sites.\n  However, breeding sources in yards is not something the city or \ncounty can take care of.\n  If the trash is in a vacant lot or on the side of the road that is \nthe government's responsibility, but private property is the owner's or \noccupant's responsibility.\n  Houston has organized an incident command structure to combat Zika \nVirus, which is the effort to better coordinate resources and planning \nacross agencies.\n  Houston Sanitation Department is part of that effort.\n  Dr. David Persse, Physician Director, Emergency Medical Services, \nHouston Public Health Authority, said:\n  Key points:\n  1. Houston Emergency Command Center;\n  2. Solid Waste Collection efforts;\n  3. Phase I of Zika Virus Response;\n  4. Phase II of Zika Virus Response.\n  Dr. Persse said Houston's Emergency Command Center has been ramped \nup, which includes Houston Department of Solid Waste, Department of \nHousing and Air Port Authorities, etc.\n  Dr. Persse said Houston and Harris County are in Phase I of the Zika \nVirus preparation where there is no virus in mosquitoes in the area and \nthe only cases are coming from those who have traveled to areas where \nthe infection is transmitted by mosquito bite.\n  During this phase Houston and Harris County will focus on \nenvironmental cleanup of breeding sites and education of homeowners \nabout breeding mosquito sites on their property.\n  Goal: Get rid of breeding sites.\n  Phase II will focus on mosquito breeding and will start in mid-to \nlate April into May.\n  Julie Graves, (Confirmed) MD, MPH, PhD Regional Medical Director \nHealth Service Region 6/5S Texas Department of State Health Services, \nsaid:\n  Dr. Graves said that the need to coordinate among all agencies \nresponsible for Zika Virus\n\n[[Page H2142]]\n\npreparation, public education, remediation and control was critical. \nShe said that chikungunya virus spread in the Caribbean was attributed \nto the lack of cooperation among governments and agencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                         [TIME, Apr. 20, 2016]\n\n           Congress Must Act Immediately To Combat Zika Virus\n\n\n      Local governments need federal funding to prevent outbreaks\n\n                        (By Sheila Jackson Lee)\n\n       Members of Congress recently received news so chilling that \n     it is imperative that they take immediate action to approve \n     the about $1.9 billion in emergency funding for Zika \n     preparedness requested by the Obama administration. According \n     to Dr. Anthony Fauci, Director of the National Institute for \n     Allergy and Infectious Disease, the mosquito that carries the \n     Zika virus, which is already spreading rapidly in Latin \n     America and the Caribbean, has been detected in nearly 30 \n     states and could infect hundreds of thousands of people in \n     Puerto Rico.\n       In Brazil, Zika has been identified as the cause in many \n     recent cases of microcephaly, a birth defect resulting in \n     babies being born with small heads and developmental \n     problems. Zika poses a special risk for pregnant women since \n     the virus can be transmitted through the bloodstream to the \n     fetus. Previously, it was thought that Zika was only a \n     problem during the first trimester of pregnancy, but \n     according to officials at the Center for Disease Control and \n     Prevention, it has now been learned that the virus is likely \n     to be a problem throughout the term of pregnancy.\n       In February, the Obama administration requested Congress to \n     approve about $1.9 billion in emergency Zika prevention \n     funding, but to date Republican congressional leadership has \n     not acted. If Congress does not act to approve the urgently \n     needed funding, federal public health agencies will be forced \n     to divert funding away from research into malaria, \n     tuberculosis and a universal flu vaccine.\n       It is outrageous that the Republican congressional \n     leadership is putting at risk the health and safety of \n     hundreds of thousands of persons by refusing to do its job. \n     The impact of that failure of responsibility is likely to be \n     felt most severely in the congressional districts like the \n     one I represent in Houston, Texas.\n       Because the summer months in areas along the Gulf Coast and \n     the southwest region of the United States are unusually long \n     and hot, Houston is expected to be an epicenter of any Zika \n     outbreak in the U.S. In impoverished areas of the city and \n     county, there are many open ditches in residential areas and \n     lots where tires are illegally dumped. These are ideal \n     breeding habitats for Aedes aegypti, the mosquito species \n     that carries the Zika virus. Experts now know that it can \n     also be transmitted in other ways, including sex.\n       Mosquito control will not be sufficient to limit the spread \n     of the Zika virus because the Aedes aegypti has evolved to \n     live on human blood, which it will choose over animal blood \n     whenever it has the opportunity to do so. This breed of \n     mosquito lives near the ground and near people, which limits \n     the effectiveness of areole spraying. The Aedes aegypti \n     mosquito can breed in a habitat as small as a cup of dirty \n     water, it can hide under leaves, and it will seek out homes \n     where people live.\n       To combat the threat posed by Zika, it is essential that \n     the public be enlisted as the first line of defense. But for \n     this effort to be successful, resources must be available to \n     implement community-based mosquito control and abatement \n     programs. That is why I have called upon the Republican \n     congressional leadership to approve the requested about $1.9 \n     billion emergency Zika prevention funding immediately, with \n     $100 million dedicated to support local government efforts to \n     conduct environmental cleanup activities to remove items in \n     populated areas that promote mosquito breeding. This funding \n     would also support coordinated public-education campaigns to \n     encourage proactive efforts to seek early medical care when \n     Zika virus symptoms are present, or early in a pregnancy.\n       The funding would also provide the resources to teach \n     community residents how to check for and safely address \n     mosquito breeding areas; repair or replace broken or torn \n     door and window screens; and provide DEET mosquito replant \n     products to low-income communities and mosquito netting for \n     beds in homes that have no air conditioning.\n       Last month, I convened the first of what are planned to be \n     several strategic planning sessions with state and local \n     officials to prevent any outbreak or spread of the Zika \n     virus. Here in Houston and Harris County we are prepared to \n     meet this serious challenge to public health and safety with \n     determination and resolve. All we are lacking is the federal \n     funding needed to succeed. And that is why Congress must act \n     immediately.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, March 10, 2016.\n     Hon. Sylvia Mathews Burwell,\n     Secretary of Health and Human Services, U.S. Department of \n         Health and Human Services, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Secretary Mathews Burwell: I applaud the President and \n     commend his designation of the U.S. Department of Health and \n     Human Services as the lead federal agency charged with \n     responding to the threat posed by the Zika virus. I am \n     writing to request that the Department of Health and Human \n     Services establish a National Taskforce on the Prevention of \n     Zika Virus infections in pregnant women and girls.\n       The Zika Virus is a serious illness for pregnant girls and \n     women. Zika virus can be spread from a pregnant woman to her \n     fetus and has been linked to a serious birth defect of the \n     brain called microcephaly in babies of mothers who had Zika \n     virus while pregnant. Other problems have been detected among \n     fetuses and infants infected with Zika virus before birth, \n     such as absent or poorly developed brain structures, defects \n     of the eye, hearing deficits, and impaired growth. CDC \n     recommends special precautions for pregnant women. There is \n     no treatment or cure for those infected with Zika Virus.\n       Experts believe the Zika Virus will be a seasonal epidemic \n     for North America, but will primarily affect those states in \n     the south and will flare up in the summer and continue into \n     the fall in tropical zones. As you know, in Texas we have had \n     particularly hot and long summers, with tropical zones along \n     the Gulf Coast that include Houston Texas. There are two \n     types of the Aedes mosquitoes known to carry the virus that \n     found in the Houston area. Houston will possibly be ground \n     zero for the United States because of environmental \n     conditions that support breeding of mosquitoes that are known \n     to carry Zika Virus in the Americas that are found in close \n     proximity to low income areas and the proximity. Prevention \n     measures consist of community based mosquito control programs \n     that are able to reduce vector populations and personal \n     protection measures to reduce the likelihood of being bitten \n     by infected mosquitos.\n       Thank you for your consideration of this request.\n           Very truly yours,\n                                               Sheila Jackson Lee,\n     Member of Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2142-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2142-H2145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THESE ARE THE TIMES THAT TRY MEN'S SOULS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Russell). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it is an interesting time. Sometimes you \nthink about the literary quote ``These are the times that try men's \nsouls,'' but there have been trying times before and there will be \nagain.\n  But our Congress continues to be urged to do things that sound like a \ngreat solution, sound like a good, compassionate thing to do, but when \nyou get to the bottom of them, sometimes they are the most \nuncompassionate things we could do.\n  For example, there are reports of sexual abuse victims who are female \nbeing deeply troubled. There are FBI statistics that indicate that \nperhaps 18, maybe 20, percent of women in America have been sexually \nassaulted. Other types of crimes on females raise the percentage even \nhigher.\n  There are statistics that indicate transgender may be three-tenths of \n1 percent. Who knows what the right numbers are? But I think we should \nbe far more compassionate with female sexual abuse victims that \ncomprise such a large number in weighing whether you want to have men \ncome walking in on women in restrooms, dressing rooms.\n  Also, the talk has been this year that we are going to have \nsentencing reform because it is the compassionate thing to do.\n  We are told that there are massive, massive numbers of people who \nhave been incarcerated in Federal prison for simple possession cases, \nand we have moved on. We have evolved in this country where we don't \nlook on those as critically. So it is time to start releasing some of \nthose people.\n  Having been a judge of a felony court, I can't say I did the right \nthing on sentencing in every case, but I can say I struggled. I got all \nthe information that was available. I considered it before we ever \nundertook the sentencing hearing. I considered everything submitted at \nthe sentencing hearing and wrestled and tried to get to a just and \nappropriate sentence.\n  Judges do that all over the country. Some think they are being \ncompassionate and quickly release criminals, not being quite as \ndedicated to reviewing backgrounds and the indications of repeat \noffenses to come. So they release people too quickly, sentence them too \nlightly, and they go back and commit other offenses.\n  We know from the recidivism rate that is going to happen, but you try\n\n[[Page H2143]]\n\nyour best, as a judge, to do the right thing.\n  Then the thought of someone in Washington that never ever reviewed \nall of the facts of the case, never heard all of the evidence that you \nor the jury heard in assessing sentence, who have just got some big \npicture that they think they may be able to apply and generalize \nsufficiently--the thought is repugnant that they would come in and say: \nWe are going to have this blanket set aside, a reduction in the \nsentence that was achieved through a very deliberative process.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  There are also a lot of fallacies and a lot of fiction that has been \nthrown out regarding sentences, some vast many that have been sentenced \nto and sitting in Federal prison for just having a little bit of \nmarijuana; we have got to let those go.\n  Anybody that has prosecuted knows, whether you have prosecuted as a \nState prosecutor or a Federal prosecutor, Federal prosecutors have \ntraditionally not been interested in small possession cases. They are \nnot interested. They weren't in east Texas.\n  When I was in court, when I have been a prosecutor and a judge, the \nState prosecutors in east Texas and the Federal prosecutors actually \nworked very well together. Every now and then there might be a rare \ncase where the State prosecutors would realize that there was a very \nheinous offense that was committed, but the Federal Court may have a \nhigher range of punishment, and because this person is such a threat to \nsociety, might ask the Federal prosecutors to take a look to see if \nthis is something you would be interested in pursuing. More often than \nnot it was not. But most of those cases are handled in State court.\n  I don't have any doubt that we should be reviewing drug offenses when \nit comes to the new opium-related cases. There have been so many \ndevelopments. We have got development of synthetics now that were not \nknown, so they are not listed as items that would generate a prison \nsentence, that do enough damage to individuals that they should be \nconsidered to be listed in a crime to possess. So those are things we \nneed to be constantly looking at.\n  There is an article from Adam Kredo of the Free Beacon from \nyesterday. The headline is: ``Obama Administration Freed 19,723 \nCriminal Illegal Immigrants in 2015.''\n  It says: ``The Obama administration released nearly 20,000 illegal \nimmigrants convicted of crimes from custody in 2015, according to new \nfigures published by the Immigration and Customs Enforcement bureau. \nThe 19,723 illegals freed from custody during the last year had a total \nof 64,197 convictions between them, according to the data. This \nincluded 8,324 violent convictions and 208 homicide convictions.''\n  Those are people who came into the country illegally who not only \nbroke our immigration laws to come into the country, but some of them \nare coming in more than once illegally, some after they have been \ndeported and come back in to commit more crimes, but nearly 20,000 \nreleased in 2015, according to Immigration and Customs Enforcement, \naccording to ICE, and it doesn't appear that they are all being \ndeported.\n  Certainly if they were, there is no bar to them turning right around \nand coming back. One man who had, I think it was, nine DWI cases that \ncame before me in a felony court, and the Federal authorities had never \nbeen interested in deporting him until he had a violent accident. He \ncame before me, and I sent him, appropriately, to prison. Within 6 \nmonths he is back in my court. So I had to ask, through the \ninterpreter, that since I sent him to prison, how is he back in my \ncourt for a new crime of violence on other people?\n  It turned out that very shortly after I sent him to prison, finally, \nthe Federal authorities acted--just much too late for victims that were \ninvolved--and they deported him. According to what he said through his \ninterpreter, they took him down to the border and watched him go across \nthe border. Then as soon as the people that deported him left, that \nsame day, that same hour, he came right back across the border.\n  What about all the victims? Do we want to talk about compassion? What \nabout all the victims of the people who have been harmed, hurt, and \nobviously cases of people being killed because we don't secure our \nborder, and instead of letting people serve out the sentences that a \ncourt very deliberately sentenced, they let them go?\n  As if we are some ubiquitous group here in Washington, somehow once \nyou come into the District of Columbia, we are so much wiser than any \njudge sitting on any court anywhere in the Federal system that we know \nbetter than they did.\n  I can tell you I have heard from judges from around the country that:\n  If I had known that some jerk in Washington was going to come around \nand reduce my sentence that I agonized to arrive at, I would have \nsentenced much more harshly so that the appropriate sentence would have \nbeen what was arrived at by the brilliant, wise, ubiquitous jerk in \nWashington that set it aside too early.\n  This article from April 12 is: ``Sentencing Reform Legislation Would \nDisproportionately Favor Noncitizens.''\n  It says: ``U.S. prisoner data clearly shows two things. One, the \nmajority of low-level drug offenders are serving their sentences in \nState, not Federal prisons. Two, most of those incarcerated in Federal \nprison for drug charges are noncitizens. While it may be worthwhile to \npursue reform at the Federal level, it will do very little to address \nthe problems identified by proponents of sentencing reform, and it \nwould do almost nothing to reduce sentences for U.S. citizen drug \noffenders.''\n  In fact, on further down it says:\n  ``As of April 7, 2016, there were 196,285 prisoners in the custody of \nthe Federal Bureau of Prisons, with 46.5 percent of these prisoners--\n91,270--sentenced for drug offenses. The percentage of prisoners \nincarcerated for drugs is just over 2\\1/2\\ times greater than the State \nprison population. However, overall, there are fewer prisoners serving \ntime in Federal prison for drug charges than in State prisons,'' which \nhave 212,000.\n  ``The Federal Government collects data differently for State and \nFederal prisoners. In order to get the breakdown of offenses for \nFederal drug prisoners, data from the U.S. Sentencing Commission is \navailable. Looking at the sentencing statistics from FY 2007 to FY \n2015, a clear distinction between Federal and State prison populations \nis that the proportion of Federal prisoners serving time for drug \npossession is much higher than that for State prisoners, and Hispanics \nare disproportionately represented among Federal drug inmates . . . \nThere is a higher ratio of Hispanics serving drug sentences for both \ntrafficking and possession convictions in Federal prisons. As Daniel \nHorowitz points out, this is because many of the drug offenders in \nFederal prison are serving sentences for drug convictions related to \nthe illicit drug trade on the U.S.-Mexico border.\n  ``In response to a congressional request regarding sentencing data \nfor Federal drug offenses, the U.S. Sentencing Commission sent data \nshowing that 95 percent of the 305 individuals serving time in Federal \nprison for simple drug offenses are noncitizen . . . only 13 simple \npossession cases were tried in nonborder districts in FY 2014 . . . In \na letter sent to Senator Jeff Sessions last fall, the Federal Bureau of \nPrisons reported that 77 percent of individuals convicted of Federal \ndrug possession charges and more than 25 percent of individuals \nconvicted of Federal drug trafficking charges in FY 2015 were \nnoncitizen.''\n  Sometimes graphs give us a good look and give us a better picture of \nwhat we are talking about than a word picture does. So here is what the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons reported last fall, that of all the people \nin prison, in Federal prison, U.S. Federal prison for drug possession \ncharges and convictions, 77 percent are noncitizens of the United \nStates.\n\n  That is right. We are using our United States prisons when it comes \nto Federal possession of drugs. Seventy-seven percent of them housed \nare noncitizens. Twenty-three percent of those in Federal prison for \ndrug possession charges and convictions are citizens of the United \nStates.\n  ``The profile for Federal drug prisoners is different than at the \nState level, and this is why Congress needs to recognize and address \nthese differences when crafting legislation that will effect this \npopulation. Federal drug and immigration enforcement are for now\n\n[[Page H2144]]\n\ninextricably tied together, and Mexican drug cartels are a serious \nthreat to public safety. A serious debate over how to best address the \nWar on Drugs and its effects on American communities can not ignore the \nimmigration component.\n  ``Sentencing reform bills reducing penalties for some Federal \nprisoners . . . are being portrayed by their supporters as a long \noverdue corrective to harsh sentencing laws for individuals who violate \nFederal drug laws, which they argue create racial disparities in the \nNation's prison population.\n  ``Reforming drug sentencing laws is one thing. Releasing criminal \naliens back into U.S. interior is quite another. The Obama \nadministration has already shown its willingness to do the latter, \nincluding those who were deemed to be criminal threats to the public. \nWithout a bill with strong, clear language and, most importantly, a \nCongress willing to extend oversight over the executive branch, it is \nplain that the sentencing reform legislation likely to soon come before \nCongress will accomplish little more than to provide an early release \nfor dangerous criminal aliens, while still failing to hold President \nObama to account for his failure to enforce U.S. immigration law.''\n  This article from Daniel Horowitz from this month's Conservative \nReview said: ``Yes, it was all an April Fool's joke. The entire \nrationale and premise on which the top legislative priority of the D.C. \npeople was built is an illusion. On a Federal level, there is no \nwidespread epidemic of people being locked up for nonviolent drug \noffenses.\n  ``The entire debate over the prison population on a Federal level is \nabsurd. Proponents of jailbreak legislation speak about the issue in \nthe abstract and concoct all sorts of myths as to who is sentenced for \nFederal crimes.\n  ``This is, in fact, a finite and verifiable population. Why don't we \nstop talking past each other and actually take a look at what is the \n800-pound gorilla behind the Federal criminal justice system?''\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  From there he goes on to talk about illegal immigration and the \neffect on our prisons. He said:\n  ``What is clear when you juxtapose the total convictions to the large \nnumber of immigration-related sentences and the drug trafficking \nconvictions, the 800-pound gorilla in the room when dealing with \nFederal crimes, is--illegal immigration. Both directly, by clogging up \nthe system with immigration cases, and indirectly, through the open \nborder and drug cartels and proliferation of drugs, more than half of \nall Federal sentences are a byproduct of immigration and the drugs that \nare brought in as a result of the porous border . . . Hence, the entire \npremise of Federal jailbreak legislation--that there are infinite \nnumbers of individuals serving time in Federal prison for `nonviolent \ndrug offenses'--is complete bunk.\n  ``If we would deal with the immigration problem and keep out much of \nthe drug infestation by building the fence''--it doesn't have to be a \nwall--``and implementing visa tracking, both the direct effects of \nimmigration and the drug problem, which is a byproduct of immigration, \nwould reach a manageable level. We would save a lot of money on \nincarceration costs and dramatically reduce the prison population, all \nwithout risking the safety and security of Americans by \nindiscriminately and retroactively releasing violent criminals into our \ncommunities.''\n  And people should understand, what most prosecutors will tell you is, \nespecially in the Federal system--they don't have plea agreements like \nnormally you find in most States--they agree on what charges they will \nallow a defendant to plea to and which ones they will drop. So, if \nthere is violence in an offense, if there is a gun used in a drug \noffense or violence in a drug offense and a Federal prosecutor is \ntrying to get someone involved for carrying out that violent drug \noffense, but they know they want to get the guy that is over this one, \nthey want to get the bigger fish and the even bigger fish, they are \ngoing to have to have some kind of negotiation at that level. And what \nthey negotiate is: ``All right. We will leave off the violent part of \nthis offense and let you plead to that,'' or, ``We will leave out the \nburglary,'' or, ``We will leave out this other. We will leave out \nsomething else and we will let you plea to this, and the State has \nagreed they won't pursue that burglary.'' They work out an agreement so \nthat part of the offense that would have gotten them a much more severe \nsentence is left out in return for their cooperation to go after the \nbigger fish.\n  So when somebody in Washington that has not analyzed the facts of \neach case and the reason for the recommended charge to be accepted by \nthe court goes about and just releases somebody, they are normally \ngoing to do an injustice to the victims. Some say drugs are a \nvictimless crime. Some are tempted to think that until they look at the \ninvolvement of drugs and violent crime in burglaries. It is phenomenal.\n  With a porous border the way we have, we see the drugs pouring in. \nAnd I literally say ``we see.''\n  We had a hearing yesterday with a lady who lived down near the \nborder. Actually, she pointed out that our Federal law enforcement \nimmigration officials are about 25 miles north of the border. We are \nnot enforcing the border there in Arizona where she was pointing out. \nShe and her husband put up video cameras and displayed it in the \nhearing. Clearly, these were guys carrying big amounts of something, \napparently drugs, passing by back and forth, just bringing drugs into \nAmerica because we were not enforcing and securing our border and our \ncountry.\n  If we want to have true sentencing reform, it should not be \nundertaken until the border is secure so that we know we are not \nreleasing more criminals to the interior of the United States to commit \nmore crimes and to be back involved in the drug trade.\n  I know some years back, after I got here, Congress decided to make it \nmore difficult for people to get Sudafed because it was used in the \nprocess of producing methamphetamine. In east Texas, cooking \nmethamphetamine was a problem. But most of the cooks stunk, so when \npeople would smell something violent and they called in, immediately \nlaw enforcement would think, oh, maybe some meth is being cooked. They \nwould go, and often that was the case. So we made it hard for law-\nabiding people to get Sudafed that works a whole lot better than \nSudafed with any initials after it that is not true Sudafed.\n  Some in the DEA and law enforcement back in Texas tell me what has \nhappened: Yeah, we were able to shut down a lot of methamphetamine \ncooking in Texas, but since our border is so porous, the drug cartels \nin Mexico right across our border are pouring through synthetics and \nfar more potent drugs. They are hooking our young people, our \nAmericans, on drugs that are harder to get off of and induce more \nunpleasantness and crime.\n  We really didn't solve anything because we didn't deal with what was \ncalled the 800-pound gorilla in the room. It is illegal immigration. It \nis an unsecured border.\n  And, of course, some can't help but raise questions about political \nmotivation. Because when you are trying desperately to win, say, a \nPresidential election or a local election, say, in Virginia, and you \nknow from surveys that have been done, if you can restore the voting \nrights to people that have been in prison, a big majority of those will \nvote Democrat, and then when you think about the potential--wow.\n  So if we just cut loose a massive number of illegal immigrants that \nare in prison, and then you have a Governor like you have in Virginia \nwho then says, hey, we are going to let felons have voting rights, \nnever mind you are not supposed to vote unless you are a U.S. citizen, \nwe are finding that there is fraud in elections despite what some say.\n  My friend John Fund had a good book on the fraud involved in \nelections and the voting process around the country. Look, if we are \ngoing to stop from disenfranchising real voters and real American \ncitizens, then we have got to make sure that we have legitimate voters. \nThat means voter ID. Why not? I mean, you have got to have an ID to do \nmuch of anything in this country. Why not have one and make sure that \nthe disenfranchising process is not happening because we make sure that \nevery voter is a legitimate voter?\n  Those who were worried about it preventing minorities from voting, go\n\n[[Page H2145]]\n\nlook at places like Georgia. It has been established that, when photo \nID requirements were added, there were actually more minorities that \nvoted after that. It didn't just disfranchise the minority. What it \ndisenfranchised were people that wanted to vote as illegal aliens or \nillegally.\n  But parenthetically, Mr. Speaker, I can't help but wonder if you were \nthe head of a political party, hypothetically, if you were the head of \na political party and your party believed their hope for winning the \nnext election was to get people who were felons to vote, whether they \nreformed or not, maybe it is time to take a look at what your party \nstands for.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2145-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2145-H2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE FINCA VIGIA FOUNDATION: A VERY SPECIAL U.S.-CUBA \n    COLLABORATION TO RESTORE AND PRESERVE THE CUBAN HOME OF ERNEST \n                               HEMINGWAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. McGovern) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor The Finca Vigia \nFoundation, based in Massachusetts, and the extraordinary model it \nprovides of what Americans and Cubans working together can accomplish.\n  Over the past 13 years, this special collaboration has restored and \nprotected the home, documents, and related materials of Ernest \nHemingway's home in Cuba, the Finca Vigia, located 12 miles outside of \nHavana, in the village of San Francisco de Paula.\n  Like so many stories on Capitol Hill, this one began when a visitor \nfrom Massachusetts walked into my office. Jenny Phillips had an \ninteresting story to tell because her grandfather was Ernest \nHemingway's editor and long-time friend, Maxwell Perkins.\n  She and her husband, Frank, had traveled to Cuba earlier that year to \nvisit the Finca Vigia, which the Cubans had lovingly cared for and \noperated as a museum since Hemingway's death. We are grateful to those \nCubans because there would be no Hemingway House without their decades \nof devotion to his memory and his legacy.\n  In addition to touring the house and grounds, Jenny and Frank also \nsaw thousands of Hemingway documents and photographs that were in boxes \nand containers in the basement, most unknown to writers and \nresearchers. They recognized the priceless value of these papers to \nHemingway scholars worldwide, but they also knew that the political \ndivide between the United States and Cuba made their preservation and \naccessibility a problem.\n  Listening to her describe what was at stake, we took the first steps \nthat would result in a wonderful binational process to save Hemingway's \ndocuments; preserve the architecture and physical structure of his \nhome; restore his famous boat, the Pilar; and conserve and protect the \ncontents of his home, including original furniture, clothing, a 9,000-\nvolume library, original galley proofs and manuscripts, and over 4,000 \nphotographs. Time and tropical climates are not kind to these delicate \nmaterials.\n  Partnering with the Social Science Research Council here in the \nUnited States, the Cuban Ministry of Culture, and the Cuban National \nCultural Heritage Council, the CNPC, a plan of action was outlined to \ncarry out a joint preservation project in Cuba and to conserve \ndigitized and microfilm copies of all documents located in Hemingway's \nhome to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum and to the \nCuban National Cultural Heritage Council.\n  In 2002, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed between Eric \nHershberg with the Social Science Research Council; Dr. Marta Arjona \nPerez of the CNPC; and witnessed by Frank and Jenny Phillips; Sandra \nSpanier with Pennsylvania State University and general editor of the \nHemingway Letters Project; Sean, Angela, and Hilary Hemingway, who are \nthe grandson, daughter-in-law, and niece of Ernest Hemingway; President \nFidel Castro; and myself. Dozens of Cubans and Americans attended the \nsigning, including my wife, Lisa.\n  Since then, scores of Cubans and Americans have worked together to \nmake the dream of preserving this priceless legacy of Ernest Hemingway \na reality.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  This includes officials at the State Department, at the Commerce \nDepartment, and at the Department of the Treasury in both the Bush and \nObama administrations who recognized the importance to America and the \nworld in saving Hemingway's cultural history in Cuba and helped the \nproject navigate the complicated requirements of U.S. regulations and \nlicense applications.\n  I would especially like to note and thank the many Cuban cultural \nofficials and preservation, architectural, museum, and technical \nexperts who made this dream come true. And I apologize if I leave \nanyone out.\n  I would like to begin with Cuban President Fidel Castro, whose \nunconditional support was essential to moving this project forward, as \nwell as Josefina Vidal during her service at the Cuban Interests \nSection here in Washington and later, following her return to Havana.\n  I want to highlight the role of then-Minister of Culture, the iconic \nAbel Prieto, who was such an enthusiastic and encouraging voice when we \nfirst began reaching out to Cuban officials in 2002, as well as his \nsuccessors, Rafael Bernal and the current Minister of Culture, Julian \nGonzalez Toledo.\n  Central to the success of the restoration and preservation of \nHemingway's house, grounds, and its contents are:\n  Marta Arjona Perez, now deceased, who was the visionary voice on the \nproject when she was president of the Cuban National Cultural Heritage \nCouncil, the CNPC;\n  Gladys Collazo Usallan, who is the current president of the CNPC, as \nwell as her predecessors Manuel Palacios Soto and Margarita Ruiz \nBrandi;\n  Nestor Garciaga, vice president of the CNPC and chief conservator of \nthe Hemingway papers;\n  Gladys Rodriguez Ferrero, long associated with the Hemingway \ncollection and buildings and the former director of The Finca Vigia \nMuseum, has been one of the most influential voices and actors in the \npreservation and restoration projects;\n  Ada Rosa Alfonso, the current director of The Finca Vigia Museum, and \nIsabel Ferrero, the current deputy director of the museum;\n  Architect Enrique Hernandez Castillo;\n  Structural engineer Livan Yanes Diaz;\n  Historic preservation architects Fernando Sanchez Rodriguez and Marco \nAntonio Vidal Garcia;\n  Conservators Elisa Serrano Gonzalez, Liabys Alfonso Perez, Rosalba \nDiaz Quintana, and Roberto Abaen Siglen;\n  Arborist Rafael Ibanez San Miguel and Manuel Valle Lopez from the \nInstitute of Forestry Research.\n  Their leadership, participation, expertise, vision, and generosity \nhave been the essential heart of this successful collaboration.\n  I know I speak for many Americans when I say that we share their \npride and joy in having participated day by day in the restoration and \npreservation of Hemingway's legacy in Cuba.\n  I count each of them as a valued colleague and as a friend, and I \nfeel honored to have had the privilege, even in a small way, of having \nworked with them on this historic project.\n  Initially known as the Hemingway Preservation Foundation, the \nnonprofit Finca Vigia Foundation has been the critical coordinating \nagent of U.S. professionals and technical experts who have contributed \ntheir expertise, skills, time, and passion to this major preservation \nundertaking.\n  Since 2004, the Foundation has harnessed the talents, skill, and \ncollaboration of the National Trust for Historic Preservation, the \nSocial Science Research Council, Mystic Seaport, and the Northeast \nDocument Conservation Center to create teams of engineers and \narchitects, of preservationists and document conservators, and of \nbotanists, builders, and photographers to:\n  Architecturally restore and preserve Hemingway's home to its 1950s \nsplendor;\n  Restore Hemingway's famous yacht, the Pilar;\n  Conserve and digitize more than 10,000 documents, 4,000 photographs, \nand 5 rare Hemingway scrapbooks;\n\n[[Page H2146]]\n\n  Preserve these original documents in Cuba and bring digital images to \nthe United States to the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and \nMuseum in Boston;\n  Design, in a joint U.S.-Cuban collaboration, an onsite archival \nstorage facility with wet and dry conservation laboratories.\n  There are so many individuals, U.S. companies, and foundations that \nhave made the restoration of Hemingway's house a personal passion. They \nhave dedicated time and talent, materials, and funding to this \ninitiative for over a decade. I would just like to mention a few:\n  First are the foundations whose early contributions allowed this \nproject and The Finca Vigia Foundation to get its feet on the ground, \nexplore with its Cuban partners how to bring this dream to fruition, \nand put the first cornerstones in place. They are the Ford Foundation, \nthe J.M. Kaplan Fund, The Christopher Reynolds Foundation, the Stewart \nMott Charitable Trust, and the Rockefeller Foundation.\n  Next, I would like to recognize the National Trust for Historic \nPreservation, which has recognized The Finca Vigia Foundation in Cuba \nas a U.S. Historic Preservation site--the only such site outside of the \nUnited States--and whose experience and technical expertise in \npreservation and cultural conservation have been invaluable.\n  I would especially like to note the contributions of Richard Moe, the \nformer President of the National Trust, and Paul Edmondson, the current \ngeneral counsel with the National Trust for Historic Preservation.\n  Several foundations and U.S. companies have been involved directly in \nthe preservation projects or in providing financial support for this \nwork.\n  The lead sponsor for document conservation has been the EMC \nCorporation, headquartered in Hopkinton, Massachusetts, and especially \nBill Teuber, Chris Goode, and Joel Schwartz from the company. EMC also \nreached out to Intel and Emulex, which also provided financial support \nto the project.\n  The lead sponsors for the construction of archival storage and \nconservation laboratories are the Caterpillar Foundation and \nCaterpillar, Inc., along with the AT Foundation, the Ford Foundation, \nand American Express.\n  U.S. professionals who have been critical contributors and \nparticipants in the technical, document conservation, construction, and \narchitectural teams are William Dupont, the former chief architect with \nthe National Trust for Historic Preservation and currently a professor \nat the University of Texas, San Antonio; architect planners Leland Cott \nand Henry Moss with Bruner/Cott & Associates; structural engineer \nMichael Henry with Watson & Henry Associates; structural engineer \nRobert Silman with Robert Silman Associates; landscape architects \nPatricia O'Donnell with Heritage Landscapes; preservation architect \nMary DeNadai with John Milner Architects; and Ronald Staley, a \nconstruction specialist from Christman Company in Lansing, Michigan.\n  Also very much involved are collections conservationist Wendy Claire \nJessup and wooden boat curator Dana Hewson with Mystic Seaport.\n  In the first years of this project, attorney Thomas D. Herman \nprovided invaluable pro bono advice, and attorney Michael Gurdak and \nhis team from Jones Day have provided essential services throughout the \nproject.\n  Special recognition must also be paid to the tireless work and \nengagement of Mary-Jo Adams and Robert Vila. Mary-Jo is the executive \ndirector of The Finca Vigia Foundation and is its very heart, soul, and \nbeating blood. Without her efforts, this project would not have been \npossible.\n  Bob Vila is a builder, a well-known TV host especially of the PBS \nprogram ``This Old House,'' and is a recognized building consultant. \nBob has been involved on the ground in Cuba with overseeing every phase \nof the restoration of Hemingway's house and grounds.\n  Along with Jenny Phillips, he is the co-chair of The Finca Vigia \nFoundation, but more than anything, we know that, when Bob is on site \nin Cuba, all is right with the world and, if it isn't, he will make \nsure that it is.\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the work of Michael Mershon, who \nrecently left my staff and who worked with me for over a decade on the \nHemingway project.\n  Right now U.S. and Cuban technical teams are constructing a facility \non the grounds to carry out on-site archival storage with wet and dry \nconservation laboratories. Known as the ``taller,'' which means \n``workshop'' in Spanish, this facility will ensure the longevity of the \nHemingway papers. It will be the first building constructed in Cuba \nusing U.S. materials and ingenuity since the 1950s.\n  The Cuban Ministry of Culture views this project as a possible \nprototype to be replicated across the country in the preservation of \ncultural heritage. The construction of this critical facility is \npossible because of the new regulations announced by President Obama in \nDecember of 2014.\n  With very little money and largely during a period of daunting \nobstacles created by a tense political climate, The Finca Vigia \nFoundation and its team of experts, in close collaboration with Cuban \nprofessionals and experts, have done a great service for the American \npeople, the Cuban people, and, indeed, all of the people of the world.\n  With passion and professional skill, they recognized that the life, \nmemory, books, papers, and home of Ernest Hemingway are above politics \nand policies, which are fleeting, while art is eternal. They understand \nthat the legacy of Ernest Hemingway is a shared heritage, belonging to \nboth Cubans and Americans, and in one of the best models of what can \nhappen when Americans and Cubans collaborate, they have made sure that \nit will never be lost.\n  I am so very grateful to Jenny and Frank Phillips for walking into my \noffice 13 years ago and sparking a remarkable and personal journey for \nme. It has offered me the rare privilege to meet and work with so many \nextraordinary Cubans and Americans and to participate in preserving our \nshared heritage around the life and artistic achievements of Ernest \nHemingway. I cannot wait to see what the next chapter brings.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "29"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/29/house-section/article/H2146-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2146]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   COMMUNICATION FROM THE HONORABLE STEVE ISRAEL, MEMBER OF CONGRESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Honorable Steve Israel, Member of Congress:\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                   Washington, DC, April 29, 2016.\n     Hon.
