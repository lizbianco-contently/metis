The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, I am on the House floor today to express my \nthanks to Senator Rand Paul for his 11-hour filibuster of the PATRIOT \nAct reauthorization on May 31.\n  I voted against the USA FREEDOM Act, which would have reauthorized \nthe PATRIOT Act, because the NSA spying program allows for the Federal \nGovernment to gather bulk private data on law-abiding American \ncitizens, a clear violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n  I also commend Senator Paul for his courageous statement a couple of \nweeks ago. He said: ``ISIS exists and grew stronger because the hawks \nin our party gave arms indiscriminately, and most of those arms were \nsnatched by ISIS. They''--the hawks in our party--``created these \npeople.''\n  Unfortunately, Louisiana's Governor, Bobby Jindal, criticized my \nfriend Senator Paul by saying he is ``unsuited to be Commander in \nChief.'' It is obvious Governor Jindal does not know about the \nmanipulation of intelligence that led us into the Iraq war.\n  In a 2006 article for Time magazine, Lieutenant General Greg Newbold, \nwhom I met with shortly after he wrote the article, stated: ``From 2000 \nuntil 2002, I was a Marine Corps Lieutenant General and Director of \nOperations for the Joint Chiefs of Staff. After 9/11, I was a witness \nand, therefore, a party to the actions that led us to the invasion of \nIraq, an unnecessary war. Inside the military family, I made no secret \nof my view that the zealots' rationale for war made no sense.''\n  Later in the article, Lieutenant General Newbold states: ``The \ndistortion of intelligence in the buildup to the war led us to the \nunnecessary war in Iraq.''\n  The distortion of intelligence, Mr. Speaker, is what led us to that \nwar in Iraq.\n  Last month, when Governor Jeb Bush justified his brother's war in \nIraq, my friend Colonel Lawrence Wilkerson, who was chief of staff to \nformer Secretary of State Colin Powell, appeared on MSNBC's ``The Ed \nShow,'' where Wilkerson said: ``The intelligence was fixed, and \neveryone should know that by now. It was a failure of the intelligence \nagencies, but it was also a failure of the political people who \nmanipulated the intelligence failure to their own benefit. It destroyed \nthe balance of power in the Gulf and produced what we have today: the \nchaos we have today; al Qaeda in Iraq--never there until we invaded; \nISIS--never there until we invaded; the mess we have in Yemen. \nEverything that's happening in the Middle East today can be attributed \nto our having destroyed the balance of power that we had carefully \nmaintained for half a century with the invasion in 2003. It was a \ndisaster.''\n  Thank you, Lawrence Wilkerson, for telling the truth.\n  Like Colonel Wilkerson said, everyone knows the intelligence was \nmanipulated to trick the American people and the Congress into thinking \nthe Iraq war was necessary. In fact, it was not, and it created the \nvacuum of power that exists today and that ISIS takes advantage of.\n  Also, I would like to say, Mr. Speaker, as I have a poster here of \nthe Air Force removing an American hero from the plane in a flag-draped \ncoffin: because of that unnecessary war in Iraq, we lost over 4,000 \nAmericans; because of that unnecessary war in Iraq, we had over 30,000 \nwounded.\n  So in closing, Mr. Speaker, I would first like to thank our men and \nwomen in uniform, their families, and the families who gave a child \ndying for freedom in Afghanistan and Iraq.\n  I also would like to say: Thank you, Senator Paul, for standing up \nfor the truth. The truth is what can save America. Thank you, Senator \nPaul.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3923-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3923-H3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         REMEMBERING JOHN NASH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from West \nVirginia (Mr. Jenkins) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, on May 23, 2015, the world \nlost one of the brightest mathematicians of the 20th century. John \nNash, Jr., and his wife, Alicia, were tragically killed in a car \naccident, and I offer my sincerest condolences to their family.\n\n[[Page H3924]]\n\n  John Nash, Jr., was born in Bluefield, West Virginia, on June 13, \n1928. At a young age, he displayed immense intelligence and an affinity \nfor mathematics. Many may know Dr. Nash's story from the movie, ``A \nBeautiful Mind,'' where he was portrayed by actor Russell Crowe, but \nmany are unaware of the groundbreaking impacts he had in the field of \nmathematics and economics.\n  In 1994, Dr. Nash shared a Nobel Prize in economics for his work on \ngame theory. Dr. Nash's work developed the concept of an equilibrium in \nnoncooperative games that has come to be known as the Nash equilibrium. \nToday, economics students across the world are familiar with Dr. Nash's \ncontributions to the field of economics, studying the Nash equilibrium \nand game theory exclusively.\n  He revolutionized economics, and his work will have lasting impacts \nin business, sports, politics, and is even applicable to nuclear \ndeterrence theories. Dr. Nash's work in pure mathematics is just as \nimportant and revolutionary as his work on game theory.\n  Dr. John Nash was not only a genius, he was also an advocate for \nthose suffering from mental health issues. As many who have seen the \nfilm know, Dr. Nash suffered from mental illness. He used his struggles \nas a way to help others with mental health problems, becoming a staunch \nsupporter for awareness and outreach for those with mental health \nissues.\n  Dr. Nash's advocacy work and brilliance will be missed by so many. \nThis Saturday would have been John Nash's 87th birthday. Dr. Nash was \nclearly taken from us too soon, but his work and his advocacy will live \non. The best way we can honor his legacy is to continue his fight for \ntreatment, for education, and for dignity for those facing mental \nhealth issues and their families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3924-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3924]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  OPPOSING THE AMERICAN INNOVATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, today I would like to alert my \ncolleagues, Democrats and Republicans, and I would like to alert the \nAmerican people that there is a monstrous piece of legislation that \nwill do great damage to our country and to the welfare of the American \npeople making its way through the Judiciary Committee.\n  In fact, the Judiciary Committee will have a markup this Thursday of \nwhat is called the American Innovation Act, H.R. 9. This, in reality, \nis the anti-innovation act. It is one of the most egregious examples of \ncrony capitalism that I have witnessed in this body as I have been here \nfor the last 26 years.\n  This legislation uses a legitimate problem, which is frivolous \nlawsuits, and then portends to solve that problem by dramatically \nrestricting the right of all Americans to sue in order to address those \nwho have violated their rights in the name of usurping those who have \nbeen called patent trolls. A patent troll is someone who has purchased \nthe right for a patent from an inventor and now has that property right \nhimself. In the name of restricting those patent trolls from enforcing \nthe right that they have bought from the inventor, they are \ndramatically restricting those people, both the inventors and anyone \nelse who owns these intellectual property rights known as patents.\n  Early provisions of this bill, and almost every provision of this \nbill, make it more difficult for the inventor to protect himself \nagainst the theft of huge corporations. And there you go; huge, \nmultinational corporations are seeking to destroy America's patent \nsystem.\n  I have been fighting this for 25 years. They have been fighting it \nbecause they want to take the property of American inventors, and they \ndon't want to pay for it--surprise, surprise. So they passed \nlegislation in the name of stopping frivolous lawsuits that prevent \npeople with legitimate lawsuits from actually obtaining the justice \nthey deserve. This will undercut American innovation. It will destroy \nthe individual inventors.\n  Almost every American university now has come out opposed to this \nbecause they have found that the result of this bill, by restricting \nthe people's right to actually defend their own intellectual property \nrights, will undermine the value--dramatically decrease the value--of \npatents, which will mean people won't invest in patents, which means \nthe universities now have less resources. Who will benefit? Large \ncorporations, multinational corporations with no loyalty to the United \nStates will then have the power to take from our inventors their \ninventions.\n  This is a game changer for American innovation. It is the anti-\ninnovation act. I ask my colleagues to please pay attention to H.R. 9. \nDon't let them push this over. Don't let this crony capitalism being \ndone using a decoy, meaning the patent trolls, get away from the fact \nthat they are actually trying to destroy the system for legitimate \ninventors.\n  As I say, I have been fighting this for 25 years. We have seen this \nin many forms. The last time, the decoy was submarine patentors. This \ntime it is patent trolls.\n  The fact is that none of this is an excuse to dramatically decrease \nthe ability of our inventors to own what the Constitution gives them: a \n15- to 17-year period where they own what they invented; thus, they can \nmake a profit from it. This would have destroyed all of the young \ninventors that made such a difference in the American way of life.\n  We will not be prosperous and we will not be secure unless the \nAmerican people have the right to the own their intellectual property, \nunless the inventors that are the basis of many of our new industries \nknow that they will control their patent and that some big corporation \nwon't just come along and steal it.\n  This goes so far as to limit and to say that, for example, one of the \nprovisions in the bill, if an inventor sues a major company that has \nstolen his or her patent, well, not only now will the inventor be \nliable for the costs of the litigation, but anybody who has invested in \nhis patent will then be liable for those court costs. Who the heck will \never invest in an inventor when he is up against a megacorporation? No, \nwe should not be permitting the theft of the intellectual property \nrights of our inventors.\n  I would ask my colleagues to pay attention to H.R. 9. I would ask the \nAmerican people to get ahold of your Congressman and make sure he \nunderstands how heinous this bill is that has already, as I say, been \nopposed by every major university in this country and, of course, every \ngroup of inventors in this country.\n  If it was the Innovation Act, as the title would suggest, why would \nthe inventors be against it?\n  I would ask my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 9 as it is \nmarked up in the Judiciary Committee this coming Thursday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3924-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3924-H3925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         FREE TRADE IN AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nLouisiana (Mr. Graves) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, I am a big proponent and \nsupporter of free trade. I think the American workforce is so \nproductive. I think that American businesses and our industries are so \nproductive and so innovative that we can compete in the global markets. \nI am confident that our innovation and that our workforce can compete \nand we can win, when given an opportunity, again, to compete in global \nmarkets.\n  At home, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce has determined that the State \nof Louisiana is the top export State in the United States. In fact, one \nout of every five jobs in our State is tied back to our waterways, and \nthat is because we are home to 5 of the top 15 ports in the United \nStates.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  We have an awful lot to export at home. We have a huge petrochemical \nindustry, one of the largest ones in the United States. Large \nagriculture--in fact, over half the grains from the Midwest from \nAmerican farms come down through our port system and are then exported \naround the country, around the world.\n  We are home to all six class I rail lines, only one of two places in \nthe United States that actually has all six class I rail lines in our \nState.\n\n[[Page H3925]]\n\n  Free trade can be good for America; it can be good for our country, \ngood for our businesses, good for our families, if it is fair trade, \nand that is where my concerns come in, is our ability to compete \nfairly.\n  The President said: ``High-standard trade helps level the playing \nfield for American workers''--``high-standard trade helps level the \nplaying field.'' The problem is that, when you compare the cost of \ncompliance in the United States with environmental policies, with tax \npolicies, and with labor regulations, it is not a level playing field \nin the United States. In fact, it is extraordinarily out of balance.\n  The National Association of Manufacturers estimates that in 2012 \nalone, that the American workforce wasted 4.2 billion hours just \ncomplying with regulations, 4.2 billion. The Competitive Enterprise \nInstitute estimates that $1.88 trillion in lost economic productivity \nand higher prices were experienced by the American workforce and by \nAmerican families across the country, again, $1.88 trillion in 2014.\n  CEI also did a study that estimated that, for every small business in \nthe United States, for each employee that small business has, that they \npay over $11,000 a year just complying with Federal regulations. If the \ntotal cost of the aggregate cost of Federal regulations were at GDP--\nwere at gross domestic product--it would rank behind Russia's economy \nand just ahead of India's economy. There are extraordinary costs. In \nfact, it is a backdoor way to tax our families.\n  Eighty-eight percent of the manufacturers in the United States, \naccording to a survey done by NAM, 88 percent identified Federal \nregulations as being their top concern in regard to their ability to \ncompete on a level playing field.\n  If you take, for example, tax compliance alone, tax policies are \ngoing to cost $1.7 trillion over the next 10 years, as proposed by the \ncurrent administration, $1.7 trillion on top of all of these other \nextraordinary costs that I have covered to date.\n  One of the huge costs that we have in the environmental world is the \nozone standard. There has been a proposal to change the ozone standard. \nSome have said that the ozone standard being proposed, Yellowstone \nNational Park couldn't comply with; yet they want the State of \nLouisiana, where I represent, to comply with this new ozone standard.\n  When we had the top--or one of the top petrochemical industries in \nthe United States, that standard is estimated to cost perhaps--it is \nestimated to be the most expensive Federal regulation in history. It \ncould cost over $2 trillion to comply with the regulation--over $140 \nbillion per year it could cost to comply with the regulation. In our \nhome State of Louisiana alone, nearly 34,000 jobs are estimated to be \nlost on an annual basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am a proponent of the environment. I spent years and \nyears of my life, of my career, working to restore the environment, \nworking to restore the ecological function of south Louisiana, of our \ncoastal area, of our fisheries, and of our wetlands. I am a big \nproponent of the environment.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, I am concerned that, as we move forward with free \ntrade, under the policies being put forth by this administration, \nAmerican workers are going to have their hands tied behind their back \nin the cost of complying with environmental regulation, the cost of \ncomplying with the expensive tax regulation in the United States, and \nthe cost of extraordinary labor regulation.\n  I will say in closing, Mr. Speaker, I am a proponent of free trade, \nbut it must be fair trade.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3925-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3925]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Last week, millions \nmore were affected when the Office of Personnel Management's network \nwas compromised.\n  This complicated nature of cyber defense means we need a clear \nstandard of measurement for assessing the damage of attacks on our \ncitizens and to affected computer systems and devices. It is for this \nreason that I have introduced the Cyberattack Standards Study Act today \nto instruct the Director of National Intelligence, in consultation with \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of the FBI, and the \nSecretary of Defense, to define a method of quantifying cyber incidents \nfor the purpose of determining a response.\n  Recent cyber attacks are a sobering reminder that Congress, all \ngovernment agencies, and private companies and citizens need to work \ntogether to better protect our public and private networks now.\n  I appreciate the research of legislative director Taylor Andreae and \nmilitary fellow Major Jacob Barton for their service in providing the \nability to establish this legislation.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n[[Page H3926]]\n\n\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3926-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n                     SUPPORT THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE.

That is direct and real support \nfor American businesses and real jobs for American workers, and it is \nall at no cost to the taxpayers.\n  For ideological reasons, this Bank could close by June 30 if Congress \ndoes not act. It is more of the same of this sort of reckless \nbrinksmanship and irresponsible behavior that we have seen from the \nRepublican leadership in Congress.\n  One might ask: Why would you threaten hundreds of thousands of \nAmerican jobs just to make an ideological point? If you want to make a \npoint, send a letter; don't threaten the American worker to pursue an \nextreme ideological agenda.\n  Mr. Speaker, enough is enough. Let's end the political games. Let's \nget back to the work we were sent here to do and support the Export-\nImport Bank and our small businesses and the hard-working Americans \nthat depend upon that.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3926-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HONORING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a fellow Hoosier, Dr. \nRichard Helton, the retiring president of Vincennes University.\n  Few have exemplified the university's timeless motto, ``Learn in \norder to serve,'' more clearly than Dr. Helton. Under his dynamic \nleadership, this 214-year-old institution founded by our ninth \nPresident, William Henry Harrison, has become a cutting-edge center for \ncareer and technical education that offers students tangible, \nemployable skills and an opportunity for lifelong growth.\n  Throughout his career, Dr. Helton has maintained a commitment to \npublic education that has positively impacted the lives of countless \nstudents. Our State has benefited greatly from his vision and will \nforever be indebted for his service.\n  Best wishes to Dick and Cindy Helton in the future ahead.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3926-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. HINOJOSA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. HINOJOSA. Mr. Speaker, as of today, we have only 11 more \nlegislative days to act in order to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Reauthorizing the Bank is common sense. Sadly, however, the opponents \nof the Bank are operating out of ideological fervor, not on facts. We \nshould be here dealing with and solving real problems, not endangering \nAmerican jobs with fantastical ideology.\n  The truth of the matter is that the Bank is a vital free market \neconomic engine for our manufacturers, for exporters, and job creators. \nLast year alone, the Bank financed $4 billion worth of exports in my \nhome State of Texas, supporting thousands of hard-working Americans.\n  We cannot and should not let the Bank expire. Let's put an end to \nthis nonsense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to vote in our House of Representatives on this \nissue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3926-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              WORLD WAR II VETERAN SERGEANT HARRISON DOYLE\n\n  (Mr. BILIRAKIS asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS.

His contributions were crucial in recreating the topography into \nmaps that were used to win the Battle of the Bulge.\n  Dedicated caseworkers in my office were able to help him recover lost \npersonnel records. They worked tirelessly to get Sergeant Doyle's \npersonnel records and medals, including the European-African-Middle \nEast Campaign with Bronze Star attachment to give him the recognition \nhe deserves.\n  I am honored to represent Sergeant Doyle. Helping heroes like him and \nany constituents being stonewalled by a Federal agency makes this job \nmore meaningful.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3926-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3926]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Conaway) and the gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Walz) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume, and rise today in support of H.R. 2088, the United States \nGrain Standards Act Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, for nearly 100 years, the United States Grain Standards \nAct has been the cornerstone of the vibrant grain trade, both \ndomestically and internationally. This law is relied upon not only by \nexporters and domestic shippers but the entire U.S. agricultural \nsector.\n  The law establishes official marketing standards and procedures for \nthe inspection and weighing of grains and oilseeds, and I would like to \nunderscore the importance this law has played in establishing value and \nprice-discovery in the grain and oilseed marketplace.\n  Many of the provisions in this current law are set to expire on \nSeptember 30 of this year. A lapse in authorization would disrupt \nexport weighing and grading services, imposing heavy burdens on \nfarmers, merchants, traders, inspectors and, ultimately, consumers. We \nshould not delay in passing this reauthorization.\n  I cannot emphasize enough: it is imperative that these inspections \nand weighing services are provided in a reliable, uninterrupted, \nconsistent, and cost-effective manner. To ensure that we fulfill this \nobligation, we must provide a safeguard to ensure we avoid disruptions \nin service like the one that took place last year in Washington State.\n  The Washington State Department of Agriculture currently provides \ninspection and weighing services for grain intended for export at the \nPort of Vancouver. USDA's Federal Grain Inspection Service has \ndelegated this responsibility to the Washington State Department of \nAgriculture. In the event that the Washington State Department of \nAgriculture cannot provide services for any reason, then the Federal \nGovernment, through FGIS inspectors, are statutorily required to step \nin and resume inspection and weighing services.\n  That is not what happened last summer. Amid an ongoing labor dispute, \nWSDA discontinued services. In statements issued at the time, WSDA, the \nState-based program, acknowledged they withheld inspection services \nbecause of their belief that ``the continued provision of inspection \nservices appears to be unhelpful in leading to a foreseeable \nresolution'' of the labor dispute.\n  Instead of fulfilling their statutory obligation, the leadership of \nthe USDA politicized this situation when the agency also declined to \nfulfill its statutory responsibility to resume inspection and grain and \nweighing services. Services were eventually restored, but not before \nsignificant costs accrued to all parties involved.\n  We have worked hard to gain access to overseas markets. We are \nshooting ourselves in the foot when we cannot ship our products to \nthese markets because State and Federal agencies are unable or \nunwilling to comply with their obligations. The inability to ship our \ngrain because there are no inspectors at a facility does a disservice \nto our farmers, and it harms our economy.\n  To address this situation, we could have been punitive. In fact, \nthere were some who would have preferred that we do just that. But that \nis not what we have done and had no interest in doing. We simply want a \nsafeguard mechanism to avoid this situation being repeated.\n  To do that, we worked with the State of Washington delegation, the \nWashington State Department of Agriculture, labor unions, the grain \ntrade industry, and USDA. What we developed was a bipartisan consensus \non a workable safeguard provision.\n  I am pleased with this work product, and I appreciate the help and \nsupport of Ranking Member Peterson, Subcommittee Chairman Crawford, and \nSubcommittee Ranking Member Walz,\n\n[[Page H3929]]\n\nas well as Representatives from Washington State, both on and off the \ncommittee, for their advice and counsel as we developed this \nlegislation.\n  H.R. 2088 provides a certainty to American agriculture, and I would \nurge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, and \nI, too, rise in support of the U.S. Grain Standards Act Reauthorization \nAct, H.R. 2088.\n  I would like to, first of all, thank the chairmen of the full \ncommittee and of the subcommittee, both of whom provided great \nleadership, provided the necessary space to get all parties together, \nand then provided for a final product that meets all of the necessary \nrequirements that you heard the chairman talk about.\n  I think it is well known that U.S. grain producers produce the \nhighest quality grain in the world. It is the inspections of them, the \ngold standard of assuring that quality, backed by the Federal \nGovernment, that allows us to continue this trade. I think no one here \nwants to see any interruption to that service. No one here wants to see \nany lowering of the quality that we have.\n  So this piece of legislation, I think, in the best tradition of the \nAgriculture Committee and this House, was a true, bipartisan \ncompromise. It was working to find working solutions that made those \nthings happen, and I would urge my colleagues to support this piece of \nlegislation.\n  This is how we are supposed to do business. This honors those \nproducers of our grain and makes sure that business and capital flow \ncorrectly, and it makes sure that there are standards in place to \nensure that our buyers of U.S. grain know that they are getting the \nworld's highest quality product.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Crawford), the subcommittee chairman.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for his leadership on \nthis and certainly want to thank the ranking member of the full \ncommittee as well and my friend, the gentleman from Minnesota, who \nserves as the ranking member on our subcommittee.\n  This is a great piece of bipartisan legislation. As has been noted \nhere, this is about 100 years since this has been signed into law, and \nthe grain trade has thrived over that century. GSA has supported its \nevolution by providing a backbone of stability relied upon by \nexporters, shippers, farmers, and, of course, consumers.\n  With the farm economy and so many of our constituents relying on the \nability of grain and oilseeds to get to market, it is critical that we \nact to provide stability for the grain trade, like we are doing here \ntoday.\n  This legislation accomplishes that goal in the following two ways. \nMany of the provisions in current law are set to expire on September 30 \nof this year. A lapse in that authorization would disrupt the current \ngrain inspections process; therefore, Congress should not delay in \npassing its reauthorization. The House is getting its job done well \nahead of schedule by considering this bill today, and I hope my \ncolleagues in the Senate will act soon as well.\n  Secondly, this legislation provides stability by ensuring we can \navoid disruptions like that which took place last year in Washington \nState, which was alluded to earlier by the chairman. Last summer, the \nWashington State Department of Agriculture discontinued its export \ninspections amid an ongoing labor dispute. Since labor disputes do \nhappen from time to time, this kind of situation was anticipated by our \npredecessors, which is why current law provides a mechanism for USDA to \nstep in and provide inspection services in the event of a disruption.\n  However, the dispute devolved into a political situation in which the \nSecretary of Agriculture declined to use his discretionary authority to \nmaintain inspections. While inspection services were eventually \nrestored, it is critical we avoid a repeat of that unfortunate \ndecision.\n  Fortunately, the Agriculture Committee arrived at a bipartisan \nconsensus and found a way to avoid any future disruptions to the grain \ntrade by giving the industry more control of its own destiny.\n  I urge support from my colleagues for this vital legislation. I thank \nthe committee for all of its hard work to move this bill forward.\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, again, I have no further speakers on my side. \nI can't stress enough my thanks for working this out. It was, at times, \na somewhat delicate situation, but leadership from my friends on the \nRepublican side, bringing in folks, all engaged parties in this, helped \nus find a great compromise.\n  I, too, would urge our colleagues in the Senate to take up this piece \nof legislation, move it forward, and give certainty to those producers \nwho feed, clothe, and power the world. I urge our colleagues here, \nlet's just pass this thing and get further work done.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleagues' comments, both the ranking \nmember as well as the chairman of the subcommittee. We did work in a \nbipartisan manner. We worked out the differences of the bill, came up \nwith a good work product. It is worthy of the system.\n  I would like to, again, emphasize, as my colleague from Arkansas did, \nwe are actually getting this done ahead of time. These rules aren't \nout-of-date yet. And so I would encourage my colleagues in the Senate \nto follow our example and get it done quickly so we can get this to the \nPresident's desk. I urge support of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2088, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3929-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3929-H3931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 MANDATORY PRICE REPORTING ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the bill under consideration\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I rise in support of H.R. 2051, the Mandatory Price Reporting Act \nof 2015.\n  I want to begin by thanking my colleagues on the Agriculture \nCommittee, Ranking Member Peterson and Congressman Rouzer, for joining \nme in introducing this legislation. I am especially appreciative of Mr. \nRouzer's work as subcommittee chairman in holding a hearing to foster \ndiscussions that led to this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2051 is a bill to reauthorize the Livestock \nMandatory Reporting Act of 1999. This bill, like the underlying act and \neach subsequent reauthorization, has been the result of dialogue and \nconsensus between livestock producers and other industry participants.\n  I would like to extend my gratitude to our Nation's livestock \nproducers, capably represented by their trade associations--the \nNational Cattlemen's Beef Association, the National Pork Producers \nCouncil, and the American Sheep Industry Association--for their hard \nwork and dedication on this effort.\n  We fully understand that government mandates, like price reporting, \ncan be onerous, and that not all industry participants may fully \nembrace this program.\n  That said, it is apparent that over the preceding 16 years, mandatory \nreporting has become an essential tool that allows for greater \ntransparency and price discovery within the livestock industry, \nespecially as the industry continues to evolve.\n  This reauthorization contains a number of industry-specific \nmodifications proposed by the pork producers and sheep producers. We, \nlikewise, include a provision that responds generally to industry \nconcern regarding USDA's arbitrary decision to shut this mandatory \nprogram down for several days during the lapse in appropriations that \noccurred in 2013, while other mandatory programs were deemed essential.\n  Following extensive negotiations, the cattlemen have opted to support \na simple reauthorization without any statutory modifications. I \nappreciate their hard work and look forward to continuing to work with \nthem on future improvements that they may choose to pursue.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a simple, bipartisan reauthorization that \nrepresents consensus among industry participants. I urge Members to \nsupport this bill, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Mr. WALZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of the Mandatory Price Reporting Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would say let's hope that what you see is a pattern \ndeveloping here: smart, bipartisan legislation passed in a timely \nfashion to make sure this country's business goes on uninterrupted.\n  You heard it from the chairman, these programs are important for \nproducers, who rely on access to transparent, accurate, and timely \nmarket information. The bill makes an important change to mandatory \nprice reporting by making it an ``essential'' government program.\n  As you also heard, the 2013 government shutdown disrupted price \nreporting. This designation will ensure that, if we ever find ourselves \nin that situation again, price reporting will continue on. This is the \nvery least we can do for the hard-working folks who are out there. It \ngives our producers the certainty that it will be there. It is the \nright thing to do. Again, it is smart; it is bipartisan; it is timely. \nAnd I would urge my colleagues not only to support this, but to make \nthis a habit in much of what we do.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), chairman of the Subcommittee on Livestock \nand Foreign Agriculture.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman for his good \nand hard work on this important piece of legislation.\n  As chairman of the Livestock and Foreign Agriculture Subcommittee in \nwhich the Mandatory Price Reporting Act originated, I too want to thank \nthe stakeholders for their hard work in coming together on the \nprovisions of this bill.\n  Mandatory price reporting was developed in response to changing \nmarkets, with an increasing number of animals being sold with little \ninformation publicly accessible. As these structural changes continued, \nlivestock producers requested that price reporting be made mandatory.\n  Even today, livestock markets are continuing to evolve, and it was \nthe\n\n[[Page H3931]]\n\ngoal and intent of the committee to bring all parties together to \nstrike a balance that promotes fairness, transparency, and stability in \nthe market. No one knows how to make this process work better than \nthose directly involved, and I appreciate the willingness of these \nstakeholders to work together with the committee to craft this \nlegislation.\n  I also look forward to working with our Senate colleagues to continue \nthe tradition of a healthy dialogue between both Chambers of Congress, \nproducers, and packers on this reauthorization so that we can make sure \nthat the requested modifications are executed as smoothly as possible.\n  In closing, I would like to again thank Chairman Conaway, Ranking \nMember Collin Peterson, and the committee staff for their tremendous \nhelp and guidance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend this legislation to my colleagues, and I \nappreciate their support.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remainder of the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I too want to thank my colleagues across the aisle as \nwell as colleagues on the committee with me, but I also was remiss \nearlier in not thanking the dedicated staff of the Ag Committee that \nworked on the grain standards bill and the group that has worked on \nthis one as well.\n  We are blessed. Our country is blessed to have dedicated \nprofessionals on both sides of the aisle and the committee staff who do \na great job working together, trying to avoid the kind of partisanship \nthat sometimes permeates this body.\n  Again, I rise in support of this mandatory price reporting \nreauthorization. I will remind my colleagues that this does not expire \nuntil September 30 of this year. We are actually ahead of the curve and \nwould commend this process to the House on other important issues like \nthat. I ask my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2051, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3931-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3931-H3932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         NATIONAL FOREST FOUNDATION REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nthat all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and include extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time \nas I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2394, the National Forest Foundation \nReauthorization Act of 2015.\n  The National Forest Foundation has a simple mission: bring people \ntogether to restore and enhance our national forests and grasslands. \nThrough the foundation, we are able to leverage private and Federal \ndollars to support our Nation's great forests in a variety of ways. \nThese include: planting trees, preserving wildlife habitat, surveying \nstreams, restoring and maintaining trails, and the list goes on.\n  In recent years, the foundation has leveraged funds at over a four to \none ratio and plans to continue on this success to raise at least $125 \nmillion for forest restoration activities.\n  Since its charter in 1993, the foundation has been essential in \nhelping to meet the challenges the National Forest System faces. \nAccomplishments include: over 14,000 miles of trail restored or \nmaintained; nearly 4.4 million trees and shrubs planted; more than \n500,000 acres of fuel reduction completed or planned; over 120,000 \npeople volunteered more than 1.5 million hours with an estimated value \nof $34 million; over 46,000 youth employed or engaged; approximately \n80,000 acres of invasive weeds treated; over 117,000 acres of wildlife \nhabitat restored or maintained; and more than 3,000 miles of streams \nsurveyed or restored.\n  The foundation has also taken it upon itself to educate and engage \nthe American public on the importance of our national forests as well \nas the natural resources found within them. It is an integral component \nin keeping our national forests--such as the Allegheny national forest, \nin my district, and dozens of other national forests around the \ncountry--viable and thriving for years to come.\n  Simply put, the National Forest Foundation works, and this is a \ncommonsense reauthorization. I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania for his work on this \nlegislation and also for his work and dedication on the Conservation \nand Forestry Subcommittee, which we lead together.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation. The National \nForest Foundation Reauthorization Act will allow the public-private \npartnership responsible for the stewardship and management of our \nnational forests and grasslands to continue.\n  This legislation would reauthorize the National Forest Foundation's \nmatching funds program. This important program brings non-Federal \npartners and stakeholders together to keep our forests healthy and less \nprone to fire. In practice, this has generated more than $4 for our \nforests for every Federal dollar invested.\n  I have seen the benefits of this program in my own district. Since \n2010, the New Mexico Wilderness Alliance has received grants from the \nNational Forest Foundation to assist the Forest Service in conducting \nsurveys and data collection on the wilderness areas within the New \nMexico national forests. This data has helped the Forest Service combat \ninvasive species and improve forest health in the Cibola, Carson, and \nSanta Fe National Forests.\n  Our national forests are in dire need of this type of management and \nrestoration in order to maintain valuable ecosystems and prevent \ndevastating and costly wildfires.\n  New Mexico, like many other States in the Southwest, has been \nexperiencing severe drought; and, as a result, we have had record-\nbreaking fires that have burned hundreds of thousands of acres and have \ncaused millions of dollars in damage.\n  While we have seen some recent improvements, long-term projections \nindicate that drought conditions will\n\n[[Page H3932]]\n\nworsen and spread to more States across the country. We must ensure \nthat this program, which prevents costly and, oftentimes, irreparable \ndamage to communities, personal property, and wildlife habitat, \nreceives continued support. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the ranking member for her leadership and support on this \nbill and, quite frankly, on everything we do as a part of our \nSubcommittee on Agriculture.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers on this bill. I urge all \nMembers to join me in support of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 288 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2289.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1526\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2289) to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to \nbetter protect futures customers, to provide end-users with market \ncertainty, to make basic reforms to ensure transparency and \naccountability at the Commission, to help farmers, ranchers, and end-\nusers manage risks, to help keep consumer costs low, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Simpson in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) and the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Peterson) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief \nAct.\n  I want to start by thanking Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking Member \nDavid Scott of the Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit \nSubcommittee. They have done a tremendous job over the past few months \nworking on these issues. They have held three hearings on \nreauthorization, listening to testimony from end users, financial \nintermediaries, and even the commissioners themselves. Without their \nwork, we would not have been able to move this bill today.\n  H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, does exactly what the \nname suggests: it provides relief from unnecessary red tape for the \nbusinesses that ``make things'' in our country.\n  End users are the businesses that provide Americans with food, \nclothing, transportation, electricity, heat, and much, much more. \nCompanies that produce, consume, and transport the commodities that \nmake modern life possible use futures and swaps markets to reduce the \nuncertainties that their businesses face. Farmers hedge their crops in \nthe spring so that they know what price they will get paid in the fall. \nUtilities hedge the price of energy so they can charge customers at a \nsteady rate. Manufacturers hedge the cost of steel, energy, and other \ninputs to lock in prices as they work to fill their orders.\n  The fact is, no end user played any part in the financial crisis of \n2008, and no end user poses a systemic risk to U.S. derivatives \nmarkets. Yet, as the Agriculture Committee heard in countless hours of \ntestimony, it is now more difficult and more expensive for farmers, \nranchers, processors, manufacturers, merchandisers, and other end users \nto manage their risks than it was 5 years ago.\n  To address their concerns, H.R. 2289 makes targeted reforms to the \nCommodity Exchange Act that fall into three broad categories: consumer \nprotections, commission reforms, and end-user relief.\n  Title I of the bill protects customers and the margin funds they \ndeposit at their FCMs by codifying critical changes made in the wake of \nthe collapse and bankruptcy of both MF Global and Peregrine Financial.\n  Title II makes meaningful reforms to the operations of the Commission \nto improve the agency's deliberative process. In doing so, it also \nrequires the Commission to conduct more robust cost-benefit analysis to \nhelp get future rulemakings right the first time and to avoid the \nendless cycle of re-proposing and delaying unworkable rules.\n  Finally, title III fixes numerous problems faced directly by end \nusers who rely on derivatives markets. From unnecessary recordkeeping \nburdens, to improperly categorizing physical transactions as swaps, to \nnarrowing the bona fide hedge definition, CFTC rules have discouraged \nexactly the kind of prudent risk management activities Congress \nintended to protect with the end-users exemptions in the Dodd-Frank \nbill.\n  These regulatory burdens present challenges to American businesses \nand will cost them significant capital to comply with, unless Congress \nacts to provide the relief.\n  Title VII of Dodd-Frank sought to require that most swaps, one, be \nexecuted on an electronic exchange to ensure price transparency; two, \nbe subject to initial and variation margin and central clearing through \nthe lifetime of the transaction, to ensure performance on the \nobligation for counterparties; and, last, to be reported to a central \nrepository to ensure that regulators have an accurate picture of the \nentire marketplace at any one point in time.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  H.R. 2289 does not roll back a single core tenet of title VII. It \ndoes not change the execution, clearing, margining, and reporting \nframework set up by the act. In fact, not a single witness who appeared \nbefore the House Committee on Agriculture ever asked us to upend these \nprinciples. But what they did ask for were fixes to portions of the \nstatute that didn't work as intended, to provide more flexibility in \ncomplying with the rules when they impaired end users' ability to \nhedge, and to bring more certainty to the Commission and how it \noperates. That is exactly what H.R. 2289 provides.\n  Similar to the CFTC reauthorization bill passed by the House with \noverwhelming bipartisan support last Congress, the Commodity End-User \nRelief Act makes narrowly targeted changes to the Commodity Exchange \nAct. This legislation offers meaningful improvements for market \nparticipants without undermining the basic tenets of title VII. I am \nproud that the committee has again put together a bill that has earned \nthe bipartisan support of our members because it provides the right \nrelief to the right people.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge support of the Commodity End-User Relief Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                                     June 8, 2015.\n       Dear Member of the House of Representatives: The \n     undersigned organizations represent a very broad cross-\n     section of U.S. production agriculture and agribusiness. We \n     urge you to cast an affirmative vote on H.R. 2289, the \n     ``Commodity End-User Relief Act,'' when it moves to the floor \n     for consideration.\n       This legislation contains a number of important provisions \n     for agricultural and agribusiness hedgers who use futures and \n     swaps to manage their business and production risks. Some, \n     but certainly not all, of the bill's important provisions \n     include:\n       Sections 101-103--Codify important customer protections to \n     help prevent another MF Global situation.\n\n[[Page H3933]]\n\n       Section 104--Provides a permanent solution to the residual \n     interest problem that would have put more customer funds at \n     risk--and potentially driven farmers, ranchers and small \n     hedgers out of futures markets--by forcing pre-margining of \n     their hedge accounts.\n       Section 308--Relief from burdensome and technologically \n     infeasible recordkeeping requirements in commodity markets.\n       Section 310--Requires the CFTC to conduct a study and issue \n     a rule before reducing the de minimis threshold for swap \n     dealer registration in order to make sure that doing so would \n     not harm market liquidity and end-user access to markets.\n       Section 313--Confirms the intent of Dodd-Frank that \n     anticipatory hedging is considered bona fide hedging \n     activity.\n       Thank you in advance for your support of this bill that is \n     so important to U.S. farmers, ranchers, hedgers and futures \n     customers.\n           Sincerely,\n         Agribusiness Association of Iowa; Agribusiness Council of \n           Indiana/Indiana Grain and Feed Association; American \n           Cotton Shippers Association; American Farm Bureau \n           Federation; American Feed Industry Association; \n           American Soybean Association; Commodity Markets \n           Council; Grain and Feed Association of Illinois; Kansas \n           Grain and Feed Association; Michigan Agri-Business \n           Association; Michigan Bean Shippers Association; \n           Minnesota Grain and Feed Association; Missouri \n           Agribusiness Association; National Cattlemen's Beef \n           Association; National Corn Growers Association; \n           National Cotton Council; National Council of Farmer \n           Cooperatives; National Grain and Feed Association; \n           National Pork Producers Council; Nebraska Grain and \n           Feed Association; North American Export Grain \n           Association; North Dakota Grain Dealers Association; \n           Northeast Agribusiness and Feed Alliance; Ohio \n           AgriBusiness Association; Oklahoma Grain and Feed \n           Association; Pacific Northwest Grain and Feed \n           Association; Rocky Mountain Agribusiness Association; \n           Southeast Minnesota Grain and Feed Dealers Association; \n           South Dakota Grain and Feed Association; Tennessee Feed \n           and Grain Association; Texas Grain and Feed \n           Association; USA Rice Federation; Wisconsin Agri-\n           Business Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 5, 2015.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative: The National Association of \n     Manufacturers (NAM), the largest manufacturing association in \n     the United States representing manufacturers in every \n     industrial sector and in all 50 states, supports provisions \n     in the Commodity End User Relief Act (H.R. 2289), to clarify \n     that non-financial companies, like manufacturers, that use \n     derivatives to manage business risk will not be subject to \n     onerous and harmful regulatory requirements.\n       Manufacturers use derivatives to manage and mitigate \n     against fluctuations in commodity prices and currency and \n     interest rates. The NAM worked to include provisions in the \n     Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act \n     (P.L.111-203) to protect manufacturers' use of over-the-\n     counter derivatives. We continue to work to ensure that, as \n     Dodd-Frank is implemented, end-users do not face undue \n     burdens. Imposing unnecessary regulation on end-users would \n     limit their ability to use these important risk management \n     tools, increasing costs and negatively impacting business \n     investment, U.S. competitiveness and job growth.\n       Provisions included in H.R. 2289 would ensure that non-\n     financial end-users trading through a centralized treasury \n     unit (``CTU'') are covered by the end-user clearing exemption \n     provided by the Dodd-Frank Act. Without the clarification on \n     CTUs, non-financial end-users may be swept into costly \n     clearing requirements meant for financial entities, simply \n     because they use a CTU to manage internal and external \n     trading to mitigate risk within a corporate entity--an \n     industry ``best practice''.\n       The CFTC reauthorization also includes an NAM-supported \n     provision that requires the CFTC to take an affirmative \n     action before lowering the swap dealer de minimis threshold. \n     Without this provision, the de minimis level of swap dealing \n     automatically drops from the $8 billion to $3 billion in the \n     near future, sweeping some manufacturers into bank-like \n     regulatory requirements.\n       Almost five years after the enactment of Dodd-Frank, \n     implementation of the Act is well underway and deadlines for \n     compliance with various regulations are looming. End-users \n     remain extremely concerned about the lack of clarity on the \n     CTU issue and the automatic drop in the de minimis threshold \n     for swap dealing among other issues. Thank you in advance for \n     supporting provisions in H.R. 2289 to ensure that derivatives \n     regulation is focused on needed areas, and not on imposing \n     unnecessary regulatory burdens on manufacturers.\n           Sincerely,\n     Dorothy Coleman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman, House Committee on Agriculture, Longworth House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Collin C. Peterson,\n     Ranking Member, House Committee on Agriculture, Longworth \n         House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conaway and Ranking Member Peterson: As the \n     House prepares to vote on and reauthorize the Commodity \n     Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) oversight of the futures \n     and swaps markets, the National Corn Growers Association \n     (NCGA) and the Natural Gas Supply Association (NGSA) wish to \n     express support for the end user provisions in the CFTC \n     reauthorization bill which will help to ensure that corn and \n     natural gas markets are able to function efficiently.\n       Specifically, NCGA and NGSA support the provision which \n     will provide relief for end-users using physical contracts \n     with volumetric optionality and ensure that non-financial, \n     physical energy delivery agreements are not regulated as \n     swaps.\n       Founded in 1957, NCGA represents more than 40,000 dues-\n     paying corn farmers nationwide. NCGA and its 48 affiliated \n     state organizations work together to create and increase \n     opportunities for their members and their industry.\n       Established in 1965, NGSA encourages the use of natural gas \n     within a balanced national energy policy, and promotes the \n     benefits of competitive markets, thus encouraging increased \n     supply and the reliable and efficient delivery of natural gas \n     to U.S. customers.\n       Because of the potential for the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act of 2010 (the Dodd-Frank \n     Act or the Act) to impede what are and have been healthy, \n     competitive, and resilient corn and natural gas markets, NCGA \n     and NGSA played an active role in the shaping of the Act \n     during its passage and have continued this role in ensuring \n     the Act's successful implementation by the CFTC.\n       The CEA as amended by the Dodd-Frank Act excludes forward \n     contracts and includes options in commodities in the \n     definition of ``swap.'' This raises the practical question of \n     how to treat forward contracts containing terms that provide \n     for some form of flexibility in delivered volumes, i.e., \n     ``embedded optionality.''\n       Flexibility in the terms of physical commodity forward \n     contracts is essential in everyday commerce given the \n     commercial uncertainties that exist in commodity delivery and \n     receipt. One important form of such flexibility involves the \n     volumes to be transacted in a forward contract. This \n     flexibility is necessary because parties cannot always \n     accurately predict the required or optimal amounts of \n     physical commodities to meet their business needs and \n     objectives. The CFTC refers to this flexibility as \n     ``volumetric optionality'' and has formulated rules that \n     suggest that the CFTC will regulate forward contracts with \n     such ``optionality'' as swaps.\n       Volumetric optionality is a contractual tool used in the \n     physical commodity industry to ``right size'' physical \n     delivery. The ability to appropriately size a physical \n     commodity delivery via a contractual tool facilitates market \n     efficiency because it allows commercial market participants \n     to adjust delivery volumes seamlessly in response to changes \n     in supply and demand requirements at the time of delivery. \n     Volumetric optionality is a delivery tool that mitigates the \n     uncertainty inherent in any physical commodity contract, \n     making both parties aware of potential delivery variability \n     embedded within the intent to deliver. Thus, volumetric \n     optionality in a physical forward contract allows commercial \n     uncertainties to be accommodated up front, providing a \n     process for orderly physical delivery and settlement even in \n     the absence of precision in the delivery volume. Importantly, \n     the intent to physically deliver remains despite the \n     variability in final delivery terms.\n       In August of 2012, the CFTC issued the final rule further \n     defining the term ``swap,'' Final Rule, Further Definition of \n     ``Swap,'' et al., 77 Fed. Reg. 48, 208 (August 13, 2012) \n     (Swap Definition Final Rule or Final Rule). As part of the \n     definition of swap, the Final Rule provides an interpretation \n     that an agreement, contract or transaction with embedded \n     optionality falls within the forward exclusion when seven \n     criteria are met. The seventh criterion or element requires \n     that:\n       7. The exercise or non-exercise of the embedded volumetric \n     optionality is based primarily on physical factors, or \n     regulatory requirements, that are outside the control of the \n     parties and are influencing demand for, or supply of, the \n     nonfinancial commodity.\n       In the Final Rule, the Commission specifically requested \n     comments on whether this seventh element is necessary, \n     appropriate and sufficiently clear and unambiguous. On \n     October 12, 2012, NCGA and NGSA submitted written comments to \n     the CFTC highlighting the market uncertainty that the new \n     seven-criterion test creates in light of very clear statutory \n     language stating that contracts with the intent to physically \n     deliver are physical forward contracts. Specifically, NCGA \n     and NGSA asked the Commission to affirm that the seven \n     criteria identified in the Final Rule are simply illustrative \n     of certain common characteristics in forward contracts with \n     embedded optionality, and thus, a safe harbor instead of \n     requirements for satisfaction of the forward contract \n     exclusion.\n       NCGA and NGSA recognize the Commission's interest in \n     retaining the ability to regulate physical contracts with \n     embedded options as swaps if ``intent to physically deliver'' \n     is not genuine and simply crafted to evade regulation. \n     However, in this case, the Commission has created so much \n     ambiguity in the applicability of the forward-contract\n\n[[Page H3934]]\n\n     exclusion that market participants may be reluctant to use \n     volumetric optionality in their forward contracting. \n     Consequently, the regulatory uncertainty caused by the seven-\n     criterion test compromises the viability of a physical \n     commodity market delivery tool that is critical to market \n     efficiency. The forward-contract exclusion should not be \n     implemented in a way that limits its usefulness to catching \n     bad actors at the expense of physical market efficiency.\n       The definition of swap has far-reaching effects beyond \n     physical market efficiency. Determining what is and is not a \n     swap impacts the calculation of notional amount and thus, \n     which entities are swap dealers. It also impacts the \n     application of position limits and the appropriate scope of \n     the bona fide hedge exemption, clearing requirements, \n     reporting requirements and capital and margin requirements. \n     In short, the definition of swap is the heart and soul of the \n     end-user protections.\n       The October 12, 2012 NCGA and NGSA request for clarity \n     regarding the Commission's expected application of the seven-\n     criterion test remains unanswered. In light of the lingering \n     uncertainty created by the seven-criterion test, clarity \n     regarding the applicability of the forward-contract exclusion \n     to volumetric options embedded within a physical contract has \n     become essential to commodity producers and consumers. Given \n     the importance of the definition of swap to implementation of \n     so many other Dodd-Frank-Act-related CFTC regulations, \n     clarity is crucial to the sound implementation the Dodd-Frank \n     Act. This regulatory uncertainty has complicated sound \n     implementation of the Dodd-Frank Act and risks harming \n     commodity market efficiency. The CFTC is contemplating some \n     clarifying language on volumetric optionality which would be \n     welcome news. Regardless of the CFTC's clarification, \n     however, the implementation uncertainty that has persisted \n     for the last four years illustrates the need for legislative \n     changes.\n       The swap definition is fundamental to implementation of the \n     CFTC's new Dodd-Frank rules and consequently to the on-going \n     availability of cost-effective risk management tools. \n     However, if the definition is too broad, it can bring in \n     common commercial agreements that have no relationship to the \n     types of transactions that the Dodd-Frank Act was intended to \n     regulate. Market participants demonstrating the potential to \n     exercise physical delivery or a history of physical delivery \n     must have confidence in the forward-contract exclusion from \n     the definition of a swap.\n       NCGA and NGSA are committed to working with you to achieve \n     a positive outcome that both protects the integrity of \n     commodity markets and ensures the continued availability of \n     cost effective hedging tools.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Corn Growers Association.\n     Natural Gas Supply Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 2, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman, House Agriculture Committee, House of \n         Representatives,Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Collin Peterson,\n     Ranking Member, House Agriculture Committee, House of \n         Representatives,Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, Chairman Conaway, and \n     Ranking Member Peterson: On behalf of the member companies of \n     the Edison Electric Institute (EEI), I want to express our \n     strong support for H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief \n     Act. Key provisions in the legislation provide additional \n     certainty and clarify congressional intent on a number of \n     issues of significant importance to EEI members.\n       EEI is the association of U.S. investor-owned utilities, \n     international affiliates and industry associates worldwide. \n     Our members provide electricity for 220 million Americans, \n     directly employ more than a half-million workers, and operate \n     in all 50 states. With approximately $90 billion in annual \n     capital expenditures, the electric utility industry is \n     responsible for providing reliable, affordable, and \n     increasingly clean electricity that powers the economy and \n     enhances the lives of all Americans.\n       EEI members are non-financial entities that participate in \n     the physical commodity market and rely on swaps and futures \n     contracts primarily to hedge and mitigate their commercial \n     risk. The goal of our member companies is to provide their \n     customers with reliable electric service at affordable and \n     stable rates, which has a direct and significant impact on \n     literally every area of the U.S. economy. Since wholesale \n     electricity and natural gas historically have been two of the \n     most volatile commodity groups, our member companies place a \n     strong emphasis on managing the price volatility inherent in \n     these wholesale commodity markets to the benefit of their \n     customers. The derivatives market has proven to be an \n     extremely effective tool in insulating our customers from \n     this risk and price volatility. In sum, our members are the \n     quintessential commercial end-users of swaps. As such, \n     regulations that make effective risk management options more \n     costly for end-users of swaps will likely result in higher \n     and more volatile energy prices for retail, commercial, and \n     industrial customers. H.R. 2289 goes a long way in providing \n     much needed regulatory relief and even greater clarity to the \n     compliance landscape facing EEI and the entire end-user \n     community going forward.\n       Thank you for your leadership on these important issues. We \n     look forward to working with you to advance this legislation \n     through the House.\n           Sincerely,\n     Thomas R. Kuhn.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     May 12, 2015.\n     Hon. K. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture, House of Representatives, \n         Longworth House Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conaway: The American Gas Association \n     strongly supports the Commodity End User Relief Act, a bill \n     to reauthorize the Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) that would \n     improve Commodity Future Trading Commission (CFTC) operations \n     and provide much-needed marketplace certainty and regulatory \n     relief for natural gas utilities and the American homes and \n     businesses to which they deliver natural gas.\n       The American Gas Association (AGA), founded in 1918, \n     represents more than 200 local energy companies that deliver \n     clean natural gas throughout the United States. There are \n     more than 71 million residential, commercial and industrial \n     natural gas customers in the U.S., of which 94 percent--over \n     68 million customers--receive their gas from AGA members. AGA \n     is an advocate for natural gas utility companies and their \n     customers and provides a broad range of programs and services \n     for member natural gas pipelines, marketers, gatherers, \n     international natural gas companies and industry associates. \n     Today, natural gas meets more than one-fourth of the United \n     States' energy needs.\n       The Commodity End User Relief Act will help the CFTC become \n     a more responsive and well-equipped regulator. Commercial \n     market participants currently lack basic procedural \n     opportunities to hold the CFTC accountable for arbitrary and \n     capricious actions. The lack of good process is self-evident \n     in the haphazard pattern of rulemaking and non-rule \n     ``guidance'' issued by the Commissioners or staff. Just \n     yesterday, the CFTC answered a critical industry question \n     about whether ``swaps'' (financial derivatives) include non-\n     financial natural gas delivery contracts through an \n     ``Interpretation'' rather than through formal regulation. \n     Even this action is five months late: The CFTC asked for \n     comments on this draft in November 2014 and closed the \n     comment period in December 2014. The goal was to provide \n     time-sensitive response to market participants. And yet, it \n     took five months to finalize.\n       The Commodity End User Relief Act will help fix several \n     problems described above--changes that can neither be made by \n     the CFTC's evolving leadership nor by revisions to internal \n     rules.\n       1. Direct Review in Federal Appellate Courts: The bill \n     would allow the federal appellate courts to directly review \n     CFTC rules, replacing the protracted and expensive trial \n     court process currently in effect as the default rule for \n     judicial review. This change will not increase litigation nor \n     will it disrupt the CFTC. Rather, it will incentivize the \n     CFTC to write better rules and avoid challenge altogether. \n     Also, any inevitable legal challenges will be more swiftly \n     decided by appellate courts, benefitting the regulator and \n     the regulated community. All of the key federal rulemaking \n     agencies are subject to direct appellate review -- including \n     the Securities Exchange Commission and Federal Energy \n     Regulatory Commission. There is no logical justification to \n     treat the CFTC differently.\n       2. Strict Compliance with the Administrative Procedures Act \n     (APA): The CFTC's administrative process suffers from vague \n     and varying levels of compliance with federal procedural \n     laws. Strict compliance with federal laws requiring due \n     process and notice should not be contingent on how the \n     Commission leadership directs staff, shares information among \n     Commissioners, or chooses between a legal rule, non-binding \n     guidance, or interpretation for resolving a public concern. \n     This bill would eliminate subjectivity and require strict \n     compliance with the APA and Executive Orders that instruct \n     agencies to ensure public notice-and-comment on rules or \n     guidance that have legally-binding effects.\n       3. Give the CFTC Comprehensive Authority to Exempt End-\n     Users' Physical Contracts from ``Swaps'' and ``Options'' \n     Regulation: The CFTC undertook a tortuous four-year path of \n     issuing interim final rules, policy guidance, and no-action \n     letters, to arrive yesterday at yet another \n     ``interpretation'' regarding how much of the physical \n     marketplace will not be regulated as ``swaps''. In the \n     interim, gas utilities have seen their physical gas \n     counterparties (natural gas suppliers) exit the marketplace. \n     Those that remain, offer less flexible and more costly \n     contracting terms to avoid any confusion generated by CFTC \n     policies that suggest these physical transactions are \n     ``swaps''. In the past year alone, many AGA members' \n     counterparties have abstained from providing the physical \n     delivery flexibility that is needed to manage customer demand \n     during hard winters and cold snaps. For AGA's rate-regulated \n     utilities, cost increases for flexible gas supplies are \n     passed directly to consumers.\n       Yesterday's Interpretation does help clarify the morass of \n     regulatory guidance that\n\n[[Page H3935]]\n\n     the CFTC has issued in prior years. However, confusion \n     remains as at least two Commissioners disagree about what the \n     CFTC has actually accomplished (see statements from CFTC \n     Chairman Massad and Commissioner Bowen). Natural gas \n     utilities cannot afford to wait any longer for policy clarity \n     because energy consumers are paying the price for the CFTC's \n     confusion. The Commodity End User Relief Act will \n     definitively clarify that non-financial energy delivery \n     agreements, that ensure physical delivery of natural gas to \n     homes and businesses, will not be treated by the CFTC as \n     speculative, financial instruments. The bill will help \n     restore liquidity to the physical energy marketplace, which \n     gas utilities rely on to mitigate commercial risk on behalf \n     of consumers.\n       Congress certainly did not intend to provide the CFTC a \n     tremendous regulatory mandate without giving it the necessary \n     guidance and authority to do its job. Furthermore, Congress \n     did not intend for the CEA to constrain liquidity in the \n     physical natural gas marketplace, create business-changing \n     impacts on regulated natural gas utilities, or increase the \n     costs of reliable service for natural gas consumers. As such, \n     AGA supports the Commodity End User Relief Act because it \n     provides the CFTC the tools necessary to be a responsive \n     regulator and restores the regulatory confidence that natural \n     gas utilities rely on to procure natural gas supplies at the \n     lowest reasonable cost for the benefit of America's natural \n     gas consumers.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                                 Dave McCurdy,\n\n                                                President and CEO,\n     American Gas Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 8, 2015.\n     Re End-User Support for Passage of Derivatives End-User \n         Clarifications in H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User \n         Relief Act.\n\n       To The Members of the U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     Coalition for Derivatives End-Users represents the views of \n     companies that employ derivatives primarily to manage risks \n     associated with their businesses. Hundreds of companies and \n     business associations have been active in the Coalition, \n     seeking strong, effective and fair regulation of derivatives \n     markets that brings transparency and mitigates the risk of \n     another systemic collapse while not unduly burdening American \n     businesses and harming job growth. The Coalition supports \n     H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, which \n     incorporates vital legislation aimed at protecting \n     derivatives end-users.\n       In particular, the Coalition strongly supports the bill's \n     inclusion of the language of H.R. 1317, the Derivatives End-\n     User Clarification Act, sponsored by Representatives Moore, \n     Stivers, Fudge and Gibson. H.R. 1317 is a narrowly targeted \n     bill providing much-needed clarification that certain swap \n     transactions with centralized treasury units (``CTUs'') of \n     non-financial end-users are exempt from clearing requirements \n     and fixes a language glitch in the Dodd-Frank Wall Street \n     Reform and Consumer Protection Act (the ``Dodd-Frank Act'') \n     that denies some end-users that employ CTUs the clearing \n     exception that Congress passed specifically for them.\n       A Coalition survey of chief financial officers and \n     corporate treasurers found that nearly half of the \n     respondents use CTUs to execute over-the-counter derivatives. \n     The Coalition is encouraged that the House of Representatives \n     last year passed this CTU language (H.R. 5471/S. 2976) by \n     voice vote, reflecting the fact that CTUs are a best practice \n     among corporate treasurers and their use should be \n     encouraged, not penalized.\n       While the Commodity Futures Trading Commission has issued \n     no-action relief allowing some end-users to use the clearing \n     exception, the relief does not fix the problematic language \n     in the Dodd-Frank Act. This language, which also is \n     referenced in regulatory proposals on margin, places \n     corporate boards in the difficult position of approving \n     decisions not to clear trades based on a staff letter \n     indicating that the law will not be enforced against the \n     company.\n       It also is important to note that international regulators \n     often look to U.S. rules--but not no-action letters--when \n     developing their regulations. Unless we fix the underlying \n     problem in the Dodd-Frank Act, our denial of clearing relief \n     to end-users with CTUs may be propagated overseas.\n       Throughout the legislative and regulatory process \n     surrounding the Dodd-Frank Act, the Coalition has supported \n     efforts to increase transparency in the derivatives markets \n     and enhance financial stability for the U.S. economy through \n     thoughtful new regulation while avoiding needless costs. We \n     urge you to support the efforts to move this essential \n     clarification in H.R. 2289.\n           Sincerely,\n                              Coalition for Derivatives End-Users.\n\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I oppose this legislation because it will roll back \nimportant financial regulations and interfere with the CFTC's ability \nto do its work. I am very concerned that H.R. 2289 will open the door \nto the types of things that created the financial mess that we are just \nbeginning to get ourselves out of.\n  So let me be clear. I don't have an issue with many of the provisions \nthat are relevant to end-user protections. In fact, the Dodd-Frank bill \nthat I helped write states very clearly that end users were not the \nproblem, and the CFTC has been very receptive to that fact and taken \nthat into consideration as they have adopted rules.\n  One of my biggest concerns in this bill is the new cost-benefit \nanalysis. This is, in my opinion, all cost and not a lot of benefit \nunless you are one of the nine big banks who, as far as I am concerned, \nhave not learned a thing from the financial crisis. This not only adds \nan unneeded layer of government bureaucracy; it opens the doors to \nlawsuits from major banks seeking to delay or completely derail CFTC \nrulemakings.\n  I also have serious concerns with the trouble that will be caused by \nsection 314, the cross-border section of this bill.\n  Chairman Massad has been negotiating extensively and in good faith \nwith our European counterparts to harmonize their rules with ours. I \nhave talked to the Chairman a number of times about this, and he has \nassured me and it has been independently verified that they are 85 \npercent of the way to getting a deal in this area. This provision in my \nopinion will cut the negotiators off at the knees. I am worried that \nthis provision will take us back to where we were and what was \nhappening prior to the financial crash. The big banks at that time that \nhave offices both in London and New York were playing us against each \nother, getting the United States to water down rules by threatening to \nmove their business elsewhere and vice versa, and that was verified on \ncommittee trips that we took over to Europe and in discussions with \ntheir regulators.\n  The cost-benefit requirement, as I said, along with the cross-border \nrule, will cost $45 billion over 5 years, according to the CBO. And \nagain, this is a cost that I believe doesn't have a whole lot of \nbenefit.\n  H.R. 2289 has a whole host of other problems. The bill unravels the \ntransparency provided by Dodd-Frank, slows down CFTC staff ability to \nrespond to industry concerns, mucks up the Commission's ability to \nissue guidance if rules need updating or clarification, and relitigates \na disagreement between former commissioners that has no place in this \nbill.\n  This is a bad bill that can't be fixed. It should be defeated by the \nHouse. I urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 2289.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have a statement from the administration where they \nhave indicated their displeasure with this bill and the fact that they \nare going to recommend vetoing it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                H.R. 2289--Commodity End-User Relief Act\n\n                   (Rep. Conaway, R-TX, June 2, 2015)\n\n       The Administration is firmly committed to strengthening the \n     Nation's financial system through the implementation of key \n     reforms to safeguard derivatives markets and ensure a \n     stronger and fairer financial system for investors and \n     consumers. The full benefit to the Nation's citizens and the \n     economy cannot be realized unless the entities charged with \n     establishing and enforcing the rules of the road have the \n     resources to do so.\n       The Administration strongly opposes the passage of H.R. \n     2289 because it undermines the efficient functioning of the \n     Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) by imposing a \n     number of organizational and procedural changes and would \n     undercut efforts taken by the CFTC over the last year to \n     address end-user concerns. H.R. 2289 also offers no solution \n     to address the persistent inadequacy of the agency's finding. \n     The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial regulators \n     funded through annual discretionary appropriations, and the \n     funding the Congress has provided for it over the past five \n     years has failed to keep pace with the increasing complexity \n     of the Nation's financial markets. The changes proposed in \n     H.R. 2289 would hinder the ability of the CFTC to operate \n     effectively, thereby threatening the financial security of \n     the middle class by encouraging the same kind of risky, \n     irresponsible behavior that led to the great recession.\n       Prior to enactment of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and \n     Consumer Protection Act, the derivatives markets were largely \n     unregulated. Losses connected to derivatives rippled through \n     that hidden network, playing a central role in the financial \n     crisis. Wall Street Reform resulted in significant expansion \n     of the CFTC's responsibilities, establishing a framework for \n     standardized over-the-counter derivatives to be traded on \n     regulated platforms and centrally cleared, and for data to be \n     reported to repositories to increase transparency and price \n     discovery. The changes proposed in H.R. 2289 would hinder the \n     CFTC's progress in successfully implementing these critical \n     responsibilities\n\n[[Page H3936]]\n\n     and would unnecessarily disrupt the effective management and \n     operation of the agency without providing the more robust and \n     reliable funding that the agency needs.\n       In order to respond quickly to market events and market \n     participants, the CFTC needs funding commensurate with its \n     evolving oversight framework. The Administration looks \n     forward to working with the Congress to authorize fee funding \n     for the CFTC as proposed in the FY 2016 Budget request, a \n     shift that would directly reduce the deficit. User fees were \n     first proposed in the President's Budget by the Reagan \n     Administration more than 30 years ago and have been supported \n     by every Democratic and Republican Administration since that \n     time. Fee funding would shift CFTC costs from the general \n     taxpayer to the primary beneficiaries of the CFTC's oversight \n     in a manner that maintains the efficiency, competitiveness, \n     and financial integrity of the Nation's futures, options, and \n     swaps markets, and supports market access for smaller market \n     participants hedging or mitigating commercial or agricultural \n     risk.\n       If the President were presented with H.R. 2289, his senior \n     advisors would recommend that he veto the bill.\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I remind my colleagues that the cost-benefit analysis provisions that \nare in this bill are remarkably similar to the bill last year, which \ngarnered overwhelming support, including support out of the Agriculture \nCommittee itself. Cost-benefit analysis is an important tool for any \nregulatory agency to have at its disposal to be able to use. This \nagency did not use the cost-benefit analysis rule that was in place \nbecause it was so weak and toothless that they just basically gave lip \nservice to it, according to their own IG.\n  The cost-benefit analysis in this bill mirrors in most instances \nPresident Obama's executive order from January 2011 that required all \nnonindependent agencies to conduct cost-benefit analysis in a \ntransparent manner to get to better rules in that regard.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nLaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Chairman, I thank my colleague, Chairman Conaway, \nfor allowing me to speak today.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief \nAct.\n  End users, such as our ranchers, farmers, manufacturers, and public \nutilities, face risks that they have no control over on a daily basis. \nFor years now, they have used tools available to manage risks like \nvolatile markets or changing interest rates, such as a farmer who uses \nfutures contracts to establish a guaranteed price to offset the risk of \na decrease in crop value before harvest or a grain company using \nderivatives to hedge commercial risks associated with buying wheat from \na farmer. This is part of day-to-day operations that allow them to do \ntheir jobs and provide products in an affordable and accessible manner. \nHowever, the implementation of Dodd-Frank placed a number of costly \nburdens on our end users that limit their ability to use these tools.\n  It is important that we do all we can to erase this unintended and \nexcessive red tape. One measure included in this bill today will do \njust that, which is my Public Power Risk Management Act, which passed \nwith the full support of the House last year. Again, it is included in \nthe bill today.\n  There are over 2,000 publicly owned utilities across the United \nStates, including one in my district in the city of Redding, that have \nused swaps to manage their risk for years. However, Dodd-Frank put them \nat a major disadvantage to private utilities by limiting their ability \nto negotiate with swap dealers.\n  This bill would level the playing field permanently and ensure the 47 \nmillion Americans who rely on public power for electricity will not see \ntheir rates increase due to unnecessary regulatory policies. Our \nfarmers, ranchers, and small businesses who pose no systemic risk to \nour financial system and certainly did not cause the financial crisis \nshould not have to face costly bureaucratic overreach from policies \noriginally intended to protect them in the first place.\n  I thank Chairman Conaway for his leadership on this bill. Let's help \nour agriculture community by passing this commonsense piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. David Scott).\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, as the ranking member of \nthe subcommittee of jurisdiction over this bill, I would like to \naddress the three major areas of contention here. We have put a lot of \ntime, a lot of work in this over the years.\n  First, we want to deal with, as Mr. Peterson brought up, some of his \nconcerns and share how we are responding to that. I am a sponsor of \nthis bill. We have worked on it. It is a similar bill to what we had \nbefore. The first area I want to deal with is cross border, and then I \nwill go to cost-benefit analysis, and then end users.\n  What is important for the House and the people of this Nation to \nunderstand is that we operate in a global market, and our United States \nfinancial system is best served with deep financial liquidity. But if \nglobal regulations are not well harmonized, are not well coordinated, \nor we have good cross-border access, then these global markets will \nfragment into separate regulatory jurisdictions and become far less \nliquid, to the detriment of the United States financial system.\n  We know now that the derivatives swaps market is about an $815 \ntrillion piece of the economy, and we must not--and I am sure we will \nnot--put our financial system of the United States at a disadvantage on \nthe world stage. By passing this bill, we will not do that. If we delay \nit again, we will be putting our financial system at a disadvantage on \nthe stage.\n  Let me deal with the first concern that has been brought up. The \nclaim that our legislation subverts the CFTC's authority to regulate \nforeign derivatives, this is flat-out false because at no point is an \nentity of the United States person able to escape U.S. rules that the \nCFTC, itself, has deemed equivalent. Let me read section 314 that has \nbeen referred to. In section (b)(2)(A) of 314, it clearly states that \nonly the CFTC can make sure that foreign entities, regulations are \ncomparable to the United States. At no point do we yield the power of \nthe CFTC to any foreign entity unless the CFTC makes sure that that \nforeign entity has equivalent rules to our Nation.\n  Now, let me go to the claim that we are making it harder to challenge \nthe cross border in 314. We are doing no such thing. It is important \nthat if there is a country, if there is anybody in the world that wants \nto challenge, that wants to have a way of challenging the ruling of the \nCFTC, it is in our best interest to make sure that they go through a \npetition process, and the petition process is there to give the CFTC \nample time--180 days--to review the challenge and be able to respond \nappropriately. And after the Commission makes its decision, we request \nthem to report to the Congress. Now, how is that making it harder? As a \nmatter of fact, it is making it easier and more transparent.\n  Now, the concern about the bill's attempts to rein in the CFTC's \ncapacity to impose certain rules on Wall Street trades, this concern \nrefers to what we refer to as U.S. persons and location tests. At no \ntime, Mr. Chairman, does our bill state that U.S. persons are not \nsubject to U.S. rules. Individuals and transactions are still allowed \nto be carved in definitions and, thus, subject to the same rules, the \nsame tests, and regulations. And our own Commissioner Bowen, who is a \nDemocrat serving on the CFTC, stated before my subcommittee, ``risk \nshould be about risk and not about location.'' Tests should be about \nwhere the risk is, instead of where someone wrote something on a piece \nof paper.\n  Now let me deal with the business that our bill creates a presumption \nthat each of the eight foreign jurisdictions with the largest swaps \nmarkets automatically have swap rules that are considered to be \ncomparable to and as comprehensive as the United States requirements. \nYes, they are correct, but that presumption comes only after the CFTC \nmakes sure that those eight foreign markets have comparable rules to \nus. Here is what it says in section 1: ``The Commission shall \ndetermine, by rule or by order, whether the swaps regulatory \nrequirements of foreign jurisdictions are comparable to and as \ncomprehensive as United States requirements.''\n  I rest my case.\n  But now, Mr. Chairman, I want to turn to what is the most important \ncross-border issue, this business with the European Union. The European \nUnion is discriminating against the United States.\n\n[[Page H3937]]\n\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PETERSON. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. The European Union is denying our country \nstatus in terms of equivalency of rules. Historically, we have always \nhad that. But what is very interesting is they have already given this \nstanding to jurisdictions that have the same regime as ours.\n  Why is that?\n  Something very strange is going on in the European Union. They are \ndiscriminating against our financial system when they will go ahead and \napprove other regimes that are equal to ours but not ours.\n  Why is this a terrible thing?\n  Because, Mr. Chairman, our clearinghouses can't do business in Europe \nif we are not qualified, if we do not have that equivalency. So by \ntaking that equivalency away, they are keeping our clearinghouses and \nour businesses from being able to be used there because the other \nmarket participants will go elsewhere rather than come and do business \nwith us.\n  There are millions of dollars at stake here, so we have got to \ncertainly deal with that.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I do want to say something about this cost-benefit \nanalysis because this is not all truth is being told here. This cost-\nbenefit analysis is being put on because it has the way of being able \nto make us more efficient.\n  Mr. Peterson brought up the point of litigation; that is a legitimate \nconcern, but here is what we did: we accepted and approved an amendment \nby Democratic Representative DelBene and some Republicans to make sure \nthat the CFTC's back door is protected. The amendment clearly states \nthat the court must uphold the decision of the CFTC unless there has \nbeen an abuse of discretion.\n  In a court of law, abuse is a high threshold to attain.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 3 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. This is important, Mr. Chairman. I have \ngot my name on this bill. I have put the work and time into this bill. \nIt is important that I give the reasons why I am supporting this bill.\n  Now, this amendment says, as I said before, that a court must uphold \nthe decision of the CFTC unless there has been an abuse of discretion. \nIn a court of law, abuse is a high threshold to attain. If a firm wants \nto challenge the CFTC, they know right off that they better have beyond \ncompelling facts to prove it.\n  The CFTC's abuse of power is a discretion. We are letting anyone know \nwho would dare to pursue litigation against the CFTC that they better \nthink twice.\n  Now, about the funding, Mr. Chairman, perhaps this cost analysis can \nhelp us build a case to take to the Appropriations Committee to get \nmore money. The President has appropriately asked for more money for \nthe CFTC.\n  Year after year after year, I have been asking for more money, but I \ndo believe that if we put the cost-benefit analysis in there--and, \nagain, Mr. Chairman, we have a section in there where this cost-benefit \nanalysis would be more succinct if it is done with an economist. Cost \nbenefit is an economic issue, a financial issue; an economist should be \ndoing that, not a lawyer.\n  I believe, Mr. Chairman, that if we pass this bill, we will be taking \na great step forward to be able to put our CFTC on the world stage to \nbe able to negotiate the rules and regulations for the United States of \nAmerica from a position of strength, not weakness. This is a very \ndelicate time for us, and we are losing respect.\n  Look at the EU; look at how other nations are treating us. Could it \nbe, Mr. Chairman, that we are losing this respect largely because in a \nway by continuing year after year--this is the third year of not \nreauthorizing CFTC--by us doing that, we are not respecting ourselves, \nMr. Chairman?\n  Now, finally, Mr. Chairman, I do want to say this one thing about the \nend users. This is a very important piece of this bill. They can't wait \nanother 3 years. They need this relief right away, and we need to do \nand be able to get them out of an identification of being a financial \ninstitution.\n  Let me tell you why that is. End users are businesses who use a \nsingle entity that allows their company to centralize functions such as \ncredit and risk; however, when the banking laws come in on finance, \nthey put them in that category.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I enter into the Record a statement from the Chamber of Commerce and \nwould like to read a couple of paragraphs from that.\n  ``This bill also takes a practical approach to address one of the \nmost problematic areas of regulatory implementation in the global \nderivatives market: cross-border harmonization. Many end users operate \ninternationally and are struggling to meet the changing demands of \nmultiple, conflicting, and sometimes duplicative regulatory regimes. \nH.R. 2289 would require the CFTC to move quickly to make substituted \ncompliance determinations that would significantly reduce needless \ncomplexity and uncertainty for U.S. businesses, without reducing market \ntransparency.\n  The Chamber also supports provisions in this bill intended to promote \ntransparency and accountability in the CFTC's rulemaking process, \nincluding a requirement to conduct a cost-benefit analysis for new \nrules, and the establishment of an Office of the Chief Economist to \nsupport such analysis. Cost-benefit analysis has been a fundamental \ntool of effective government for more than three decades, and these \nrequirements would help protect Main Street businesses, investors, and \nconsumers from some of the unintended consequences of regulation.''\n\n         Chamber of Commerce of the United States of America,\n                                     Washington, DC, June 8, 2015.\n       To The Members of The U.S. House of Representatives: The \n     U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the world's largest business \n     federation representing the interests of more than three \n     million businesses of all sizes, sectors, and regions, as \n     well as state and local chambers and industry associations, \n     and dedicated to promoting, protecting, and defending \n     America's free enterprise system, strongly supports H.R. \n     2289, the ``Commodity End-User Relief Act,'' a bipartisan \n     bill that would reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading \n     Commission (CFTC). This bill also includes a number of \n     important reforms designed to promote smart regulation, \n     enhance accountability at the CFTC, and protect Main Street \n     businesses from onerous and unintended derivatives \n     regulation.\n       The Chamber is particularly supportive of provisions in \n     H.R. 2289 that would help preserve the ability of commercial \n     end users to manage their financial risks by using \n     derivatives. This bill includes a critical fix that would \n     ensure non-financial companies would be protected from \n     burdensome and unnecessary regulations, consistent with \n     Congress's clear intent under the Dodd-Frank Act almost five \n     years ago. Non-financial companies that use centralized \n     treasury units to manage their enterprise-wide risk should \n     not be penalized for adopting this risk reducing structure, \n     and H.R. 2289 acknowledges and would address this issue.\n       This bill also takes a practical approach to address one of \n     the most problematic areas of regulatory implementation in \n     the global derivatives market: cross-border harmonization. \n     Many end users operate internationally and are struggling to \n     meet the changing demands of multiple, conflicting, and \n     sometimes duplicative regulatory regimes. H.R. 2289 would \n     require the CFTC to move quickly to make substituted \n     compliance determinations that would significantly reduce \n     needless complexity and uncertainty for U.S. businesses, \n     without reducing market transparency.\n       The Chamber also supports provisions in this bill intended \n     to promote transparency and accountability in the CFTC's \n     rulemaking process, including a requirement to conduct a \n     cost-benefit analysis for new rules, and the establishment of \n     an Office of the Chief Economist to support such analysis. \n     Cost-benefit analysis has been a fundamental tool of \n     effective government for more than three decades, and these \n     requirements would help protect Main Street businesses, \n     investors, and consumers from some of the unintended \n     consequences of regulation.\n       Additionally, H.R. 2289 contains a number of sensible \n     provisions that would promote principles of good governance, \n     including providing market participants with better \n     Commission oversight regarding ``no action'' letters issued \n     by the CFTC staff, and a requirement that the CFTC develop \n     internal risk control mechanisms in order to protect \n     sensitive market data. These are common sense measures that \n     would help make the CFTC a more effective and accountable \n     regulator, and the Chamber appreciates their inclusion in \n     this bill.\n\n[[Page H3938]]\n\n       The Chamber strongly urges you to support H.R. 2289 and may \n     consider including votes on, or in relation to, this bill in \n     our annual How They Voted scorecard.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  R. Bruce Josten.\n\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Rodney Davis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Conaway \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief \nAct.\n  The use of derivatives is an important tool that farmers, \nagribusinesses, and manufacturers in my district use to hedge the risks \nthat come with doing their business. Because of the risk of price \nmovements and commodities, such as corn and soybeans, these end users \nuse derivatives to ensure they and their customers aren't negatively \nimpacted by sudden changes in prices.\n  The CFTC has an important role in overseeing these end users, who \nresponsibly use derivatives to hedge. Unfortunately, following the \npassage of Dodd-Frank in 2010, many of these responsible hedgers, \nincluding farmers right in my congressional district in central and \nsouthwestern Illinois, have been impacted by these new regulations that \noften treat them as speculators. Mr. Chairman, farmers aren't \nspeculators. Farmers didn't cause the global financial crisis, and \nfarmers shouldn't be treated like they did.\n  This bill includes language that I authored to address regulations \nthat could directly increase transportation prices for consumers back \nhome. Additionally, the final bill includes an amendment I offered at \ncommittee that removes unnecessary and duplicative regulations created \nby the CFTC that require certain registered investment companies, such \nas mutual funds, to be regulated by both the SEC and the CFTC.\n  This language, which was adopted unanimously in the committee, \nremoves this duplicative burden in a manner that would not undermine \ninvestor protection because these companies would still be regulated by \nthe SEC.\n  This bill is an important and necessary opportunity for Congress to \nuse the reauthorization process as a means to improve the regulatory \nenvironment and the impact it has on responsible market participants, \nas well as exchanges like the CME Group, which is headquartered in my \nhome State of Illinois.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am proud of the committee's work on this bill. I want \nto express my appreciation for the work of Chairman Conaway and what he \nhas done to get us here, as well as Chairman Austin Scott and Ranking \nMember David Scott of the Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and Credit \nSubcommittee.\n  This is an important bill, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this bill; yet \nagain, this bill deliberately sets out to weaken one of our most \nimportant financial regulators, the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission.\n  It fails to address the CFTC's biggest challenge, its flawed funding \nmechanism. It prioritizes Wall Street special interests over the \neconomic security of our Nation's families.\n  This bill is a recipe for another financial disaster like the one \nthat led to the Great Recession and cost nearly 9 million American \njobs.\n  Americans are tired of casino banking and speculation. They want big \nbanks and oil speculators held accountable. They want to increase the \ntransparency of our markets, prevent market failures, and avoid future \nbailouts. That is the CFTC's job.\n  This bill takes us in the wrong direction. Instead of helping the \nCFTC fulfill its mandate in an increasingly complex global financial \nsector, the bill throws up roadblock after roadblock.\n  The CFTC is one of only two Federal financial regulators completely \nreliant upon the general fund. The Securities and Exchange Commission, \nthe Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, Federal Housing Finance \nAgency, and a host of others all collect user fees, so should the CFTC.\n  This is not a partisan proposition. The first President to propose \nuser-fee funding for the CFTC was Ronald Reagan. Every President since \nthen, Republican or Democrat, has done the same.\n  User fees would directly reduce the deficit while securing CFTC's \nfunding for the long term. That is even more important now that the \nagency's responsibilities have been expanded in response to the bad \nbehavior that created the financial crisis.\n  I submitted an amendment that would have dealt with this problem, but \nthe majority refused to allow it to be heard.\n  We must avoid at all costs a return to the conditions that allowed \nthe Great Recession to happen, and I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' \non this bill.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to remind or at least acknowledge to the committee that \nCFTC's funding is up 49 percent since 2010 when the Dodd-Frank bill was \npresented, 49 percent increase in funding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGoodlatte), the former chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and \nthe current chairman of the House Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Conaway for yielding me \nthis time and thank him for his leadership on this important \nlegislation.\n  I rise today to support H.R. 2289, the Commodity End-User Relief Act, \na bill to reauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n  As we have heard today, the CFTC's mission is to foster a \ntransparent, balanced, and functional marketplace. However, uncertainty \nand delays in the marketplace mean higher prices for families and small \nbusinesses across America. As the committee charged with ensuring the \noversight of our commodity markets, it is our duty to ensure that those \nmarkets are functioning properly.\n  For the last several years, the Agriculture Committee, through the \nstrong leadership of former Chairman Frank Lucas and current Chairman \nMike Conaway, has done an excellent job of educating Congress and the \nAmerican public about the importance of our commodity markets and the \nneed for a strong reauthorization of the CFTC.\n  I was also pleased to work closely with the Subcommittee on Commodity \nExchanges, Energy, and Credit's Chairman Austin Scott on this \nlegislation. He and his staff have been leading an open and transparent \nprocess that involved all stakeholder groups and took input from across \nthe country.\n  In an effort to help the CFTC achieve its mission, I worked with the \ncommittee and the CFTC to craft an amendment which was adopted in \ncommittee to address the issue of manufacturers being able to take \ntimely delivery of aluminum for production at a fair price. These \nmanufacturers support a broad set of industries from common drink cans \nto airplane parts.\n  The persistence of long, disruptive market queues for the delivery of \naluminum at warehouses in the United States, licensed overseas, has \nattracted considerable concern for end users and the consumers of \nproducts which many Americans utilize on a daily basis.\n  My provision will prevent the unreasonable delay of delivery of such \ncommodities stored in warehouses, which can cost end-user companies \nincreased storage fees, potentially higher prices due to supply and \ndemand implications from improper exchange contract design, and result \nin uneconomic commodity prices.\n  Specifically, the amendment directs the CFTC to report to Congress \nregarding the ongoing review of foreign board of trade applications of \nmetal exchanges and the status of its negotiations with foreign \nregulators regarding aluminum warehousing.\n  Such status reports shall inform the CFTC in determining foreign \nboards of trade status for metals exchange applications, and such \ndetermination shall be made no later than September 30, 2016.\n  In closing, I would like to again applaud Chairman Conaway and \nsubcommittee Chairman Scott for their hard work to get this bill to the \nfloor today. This bipartisan bill takes steps to improve consumer \nprotections for\n\n[[Page H3939]]\n\nfarmers and ranchers, as well as implementing reforms, to ensure a more \nbalanced regulatory approach that will help our markets thrive.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  With all due respect to my colleagues who have been claiming that the \nbill does this and does that, there are a lot of groups that have a \ndifferent view.\n  There are over two-hundred-and-some groups that disagree with how the \nimpacts of these bills were going to affect the markets, including the \nchairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, who are the \npeople who actually have to administer this law.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  And we have a letter from the chairman that has a completely \ndifferent point of view than Mr. Scott has and others in terms of how \nthis will impact the situation. According to the chairman, you know, he \nis opposed to this. He says: ``I believe that many of the provisions in \nthis bill before the committee are either unnecessary or impose \nrequirements on the Commission that would make it harder to fulfill \ntheir mission. The bill limits the agency's ability to respond quickly \nto both market events and market participants. It will make it more \ndifficult for us to make adjustments to rules and achieve greater \nglobal harmonization of swaps rules. With respect to the provisions \npertaining to commercial end users' concerns, the agency has sufficient \nauthority to address the goals outlined in the legislation and in most \ncases has already done so.''\n  He also states: ``I have concerns that title II of the bill includes \nlanguage that would complicate the agency's longstanding statutory \nrequirements to consider costs and benefits in its rulemaking, imposing \nadditional, unworkable standards and creating confusion that is likely \nto lead to more lawsuits instead of policy grounded in data-driven \nanalysis. Had this language been in effect, it would have been harder \nfor the agency to positively respond over the past 10 months to market \nparticipants' concerns. Title II also imposes procedural requirements \non the agency that, to my knowledge, are not followed by any other \nindependent agency. These changes would make it difficult to manage the \nagency and to ensure accountability and could weaken the Commission for \nadministrations to come.''\n  So there is a disagreement of opinion about how this bill will \nactually impact the marketplace and how it will actually work. And if, \nas was claimed, it wasn't going to have any effect, I would be here \nsupporting it.\n  In my opinion, this is going to have significant impacts on the way \nthe Commission does its work, and I think it is going to do more harm \nthan good.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much time is left \non both sides?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 13 minutes remaining. The \ngentleman from Minnesota has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Apparently, I have a speaker coming, but she is not \nhere yet, so we could wrap up, I guess.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I am prepared to close if you are, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PETERSON. Mr. Chair, I think I made clear my position. I was \nhoping that we could work out a bill here that could have support \nacross the board, but I just think that there are areas we have gone \ninto with this bill that are going to cause more harm than good, and I \nthink it is not a good bill. It is not the kind of bill that we need to \ngive the Commission the reauthorization that they need to do their job, \nso I ask my colleagues to oppose the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of the time.\n  It should come as no surprise that those who are being regulated have \na difference of opinion with the folks proposing regulations. In this \ninstance, the roles are actually reversed.\n  Tim Massad is a good guy, a good friend of mine, and an individual I \nlook forward to working with. He doesn't want to change the deal he has \ngot.\n  Well, if you look back at all the testimony that has been delivered \nthroughout all of our hearings, most of the folks on the regulated \nside, the end users, the banks, the brokers, the SEFs, everybody else, \nthey didn't like what the CFTC was doing to them. So the CFTC was able \nto power through the objections, and I would like for us to do the same \nthing, because what we have asked the CFTC to do is rational, \nstraightforward stuff with respect to the changes at the operations of \nthe Committee itself.\n  Over the past 4 years, the Committee on Agriculture has heard dozens \nof witnesses testify about the upheaval end users have been facing \nwhile trying to use derivatives markets in the wake of the postcrisis \nfinancial reforms. While this Congress took affirmative steps in Dodd-\nFrank to protect end users from harm, today it is clear there is still \nwork to be done.\n  It isn't enough to simply raise these issues and hope that the CFTC \nwill take care of them for us. For one, sometimes they cannot. There \nare numerous small oversights in the statute that have huge \nimplications for end users that we correct in this legislation.\n  The CEA prevents many end users from claiming their exemption because \nthey conduct their hedging activity out of an affiliate specifically \ncreated to manage risks throughout the entire corporate enterprise. The \nCommission can't fix this req.\n  The CEA requires foreign regulators to indemnify the CFTC, even \nthough that is a legal concept that does not exist in many foreign \nlegal jurisdictions. The Commission can't fix it.\n  Currently, the CEA defines some utility companies as financial \nentities, stripping them of their status as end users. The Commission \ncan't fix that.\n  The core principles of SEFs were lifted almost word for word from the \ncore principles for future exchanges, even though SEFs and future \nexchanges operate completely differently and SEFs cannot perform many \nof the functions of a futures exchange. The Commission can't fix this.\n  Certainly, the Commission can and has tried to paper over these \nproblems by issuing staff letters explaining how it would deal with \nincongruities of the law, but this isn't good enough. We know the \nproblems, and we should fix them.\n  Sometimes, though, the problem isn't the statute. There are a number \nof end users that we have heard testimony about which the CFTC will not \nfix because the Commission simply disagrees with Congress about how to \napply the law. We know these problems, too.\n  The Commission has promulgated a rule that reduces the transaction \nthreshold, which triggers the requirement to register as a swap dealer \nfrom $8 billion to $3 billion, a 60 percent decline, while they are \nstill studying the matter. We require that the CFTC complete the study \nand have a public vote on the matter before that automatic decrease \noccurs.\n  The Commission has proposed a new and significantly narrower method \nof granting bona fide hedge exemptions, upending longstanding hedging \nconventions for market participants. This proposal is also dramatically \nmore labor intensive for the Commission to implement than the current \nprocess. We should insist that historic hedging practices be protected.\n  The Commission has dramatically expanded the recordkeeping \nrequirements, requiring businesses to trade only for themselves and \nhave no fiduciary obligations to customers to retain any record that \nwould lead to a trade. This requirement demands that end users retain \nemails, texts, phone messages, and other records in which a potential \ntrade or hedge was simply contemplated or discussed. We should clearly \nspell out that end users need only retain written records for actual \ntransactions.\n  The challenges facing businesses that hedge their risks in derivative \nmarkets are real, and we have an opportunity today to fix some of those \nproblems. Every dollar that a business can save by better managing \nrisks is a dollar available to grow its business, to pay higher wages, \nto protect investors, or to lower the costs to consumers.\n  Over the past week, over 40 organizations representing thousands of \nAmerican businesses have voiced their support for the important reforms \nof the Commodity End-User Relief Act. Businesses from agriculture \nproducers, to\n\n[[Page H3940]]\n\nmajor manufacturers, to public utilities need every tool available to \nmanage their businesses and reduce the uncertainties they face each and \nevery day.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the Commodity End-User Relief Act to \nprotect these companies and to ensure that they have the tools they \nneed to compete in a global economy. I urge my colleagues to support \nH.R. 2289.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Chair, I rise today in strong \nopposition to H.R. 2289. The bill would obstruct our cop on the Wall \nStreet beat, the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, from doing its \njob. The CFTC is charged with fostering open, transparent, competitive, \nand financially sound markets, mitigates systemic risk, and protects \nmarket participants, consumers, and the public from fraud, \nmanipulation, and abusive practices related to derivatives. In sum, the \nCFTC protects farmers, manufacturers, municipalities, pension funds and \nretirees but would be thwarted from doing so if H.R. 2289 is enacted.\n  In the wake of the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, \nCongress passed Wall Street Reform--and gave our derivatives regulator \nthe authority necessary to oversee previously unregulated transactions \nin which parties agree to exchange--or ``swap''--the risks of one \nfinancial instrument with another. The most notorious of these are \ncredit-default swaps, made famous by AIG and which fueled the 2008 \ncrisis, bankrupted millions of homeowners and cost taxpayers trillions \nof dollars.\n  Nevertheless, under the guise of reauthorizing the CFTC, Republicans \nare proposing a bill that undermines its regulatory authority, imposes \nnew procedural requirements on an overburdened and underfunded agency, \nand ultimately hamstrings the Commission's ability to protect the \nAmerican people.\n  This bill imposes heavy administrative hurdles and new litigation \nrisks on the CFTC by requiring the agency to conduct a cost-benefit \nanalysis slanted towards industry--a tactic that has been pushed in the \npast by opponents of financial reform to prevent, delay or weaken any \nrules implementing the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  The bill also makes it much more difficult for the CFTC to regulate \nand oversee derivatives transactions involving the foreign operations \nof megabanks like Citigroup, JP Morgan, and Bank of America. Earlier \nthis Congress, Republicans overreached when they tried to pass a \nprovision weakening the Volcker Rule's ban on banks taking bets with \ntaxpayer dollars. H.R. 2289 is cut from the same cloth--instead \nallowing these same institutions to avoid U.S. law by setting up shop \nin a foreign jurisdiction, even though the risk may still be borne by \nU.S. taxpayers. There is even a provision in this bill that absurdly \ndirects the CFTC to ignore the physical location of a bank's swap \ntrader when determining whether the derivative was conducted inside the \nUnited States for purposes of applying U.S. law.\n  And all of this is done without providing one red cent to pay for \nthese new burdens. CBO estimates that this bill costs at least $45 \nmillion, but the Republicans wouldn't even let the House consider an \namendment to pay for it, offered by Representative DeLauro. The result \nis that H.R. 2289 will deplete the CFTC's modest resources currently \nspent enforcing against fraud.\n  But don't take my word for it. The Commission's own Chairman says the \nbill makes it harder for the CFTC to fulfill its mission and creates \n``unintended loopholes and uncertainties.'' The White House says the \nbill ``[threatens] the financial security of the middle class.'' And \npublic interest groups, such as the Consumer Federation of America, and \nsome industry groups, have weighed in as well, voicing their strong \nopposition to the bill.\n  While not necessarily surprising, Republicans on the Agricultural \nCommittee refused to work with Ranking Member Peterson to improve this \nbill--despite his deep commitment to making the Commission work better \nfor farmers, ranchers and manufacturers. Even though several of the \nmegabanks that directly benefit from H.R. 2289 pled guilty to \nmanipulating our foreign exchange markets, Republicans also rejected my \namendment, which sought to ensure that these banks' admissions of \nviolating our laws have real collateral consequences and are not merely \nsymbolic.\n  Ultimately, this legislation is part of an ongoing, multifaceted \nRepublican effort to undercut financial reform laws and regulations \nthat protect consumers, investors and the economy. That's why it should \ncome as no surprise that Koch Industries, for instance, spent $2.8 \nmillion lobbying to ensure the passage of this bill alone. The playbook \nis well-known: create huge loopholes and carve-outs for special \ninterests, while simultaneously underfunding the cop with the authority \nto ensure compliance with the law.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting ``No'' on this bill.\n  Mr. VAN HOLLEN. Mr. Chair, just yesterday, I signed a letter with \nfive other Ranking Members on this side of the aisle in opposition to \nthis poorly conceived Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) \nReauthorization bill--which is also opposed by the Obama \nAdministration, CFTC Chairman Massad, and a whole host of consumer \ngroups.\n  For those who aren't familiar with it, the Commodity Futures Trading \nCommission (CFTC) has a very important job: it regulates the futures \nand options markets in the agricultural sector, including commodity-\nrelated derivatives. While there's no question that the appropriate use \nof these financial instruments can help farmers and commercial end \nusers hedge their commercial risk, recent history clearly demonstrates \nthat the unregulated abuse of these kinds of products can distort \nmarkets, hurt consumers and put our entire economy at risk. The CFTC's \nauthority was allowed to expire in 2013, so its reauthorization is long \noverdue. Having said that, today's legislation has multiple major \ndefects. I will briefly describe three.\n  First, Title II of H.R. 2289 imposes new bureaucratic requirements on \nan agency whose activities are already governed by the Commodity \nExchange Act, the Paperwork Reduction Act, the Congressional Review \nAct, and the Regulatory Flexibility Act. With all due respect, the \nbureaucracy does not need more bureaucracy. In this case, it simply \nneeds to do its job policing our financial markets. If enacted into \nlaw, Title II of this bill would undermine the CFTC's ability to do its \njob and subject the commission to unnecessary and costly litigation \nrisk.\n  Second, Title III of H.R. 2289 requires a complex new rulemaking for \nour international derivatives markets. While I support the goal of \nharmonizing global rules in this area, this provision of the bill \ninterferes with the CFTC's ongoing negotiations to achieve that \nobjective and instead substitutes and attempts to predetermine the \nmajority's preferred outcome for those negotiations. In my judgment, \nthe CFTC should be allowed to complete its negotiations unfettered by \nthe dictates of this legislation.\n  Finally, the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office estimates that \nall of the additional requirements placed on the CFTC by this \nlegislation will require 30 new employees at a cost of $45 million over \nthe next five years--a cost this bill does not even attempt to pay for. \nMoreover, an amendment to permit the CFTC to collect user fees to close \nthat gap and help pay for the CFTC's operations was not even afforded \nthe opportunity for an up or down vote on the floor of the House today.\n  Mr. Chair, the reauthorization of the CFTC is an important subject, \nworthy of a far more thoughtful bill than we are being asked to \nconsider today. I strongly urge a no vote, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Agriculture, printed in the bill, it shall be in order \nto consider as an original bill for the purpose of amendment under the \n5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a substitute consisting of \nthe text of Rules Committee Print 114-18. That amendment in the nature \nof a substitute shall be considered as read.\n  The text of the amendment in the nature of a substitute is as \nfollows:\n\n                               H.R. 2289\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and the House of \n     Representatives of the United States of America in Congress \n     assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Pursuant to House Resolution 288, the gentlewoman from \nWisconsin (Ms. Moore) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Wisconsin.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, my amendment is simple. It really seeks to \nharmonize the regulatory regime for both the security- and commodity-\nbased swaps. I am so pleased to be joined on a bipartisan basis with \nRepresentatives Rick Crawford, Bill Huizenga, and Sean Patrick Maloney \nin offering this amendment.\n  As we all know, Mr. Chairman, the regulation of the swaps market is \nunder the jurisdiction of both the Securities and Exchange Commission \nand the Commodity Futures Trading Commission. As such, legislation that \namends the swap regulation must be addressed in both the securities law \nand the Commodity Exchange Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I have worked with Chairman Hensarling, Ranking Member \nWaters, and the Committee on Financial Services, and we have offered \nthe same language to amend the securities law section of a bill. This \namendment in committee, Mr. Chairman, was adopted by a voice vote.\n  This amendment makes the same minor change to the Commodity Exchange \nAct section so that the regulatory regime is the same for both \nsecurity- and commodity-based swaps.\n  This section of H.R. 2289 mirrors legislation, H.R. 1847, sponsored \nby Representative Crawford and has enjoyed broad bipartisan support and \npassed both the Committee on Financial Services and Committee on \nAgriculture without controversy and with the support and blessing of \nthe SEC.\n  So why the amendment? Foreign regulators and some industry \nparticipants reached out to the SEC seeking to tighten the language to \nnarrow the requirement to share data to clarify that swap data \nrepositories are only required to share data related to the swap trade.\n  The amendment will in no way weaken swap regulation or inhibit the \naggregation of swap data; rather, the amendment will make a narrow \nmodification to protect market participant information. This change is \nsupported by both industry and the SEC.\n  This bill has global impact on swap participants and regulators, so I \nthink it is important to get it right. I applaud the SEC for working \nwith industry to refine the bill, and I want to thank the chairman and \nranking members of both the Committee on Financial Services and the \nCommittee on Agriculture for working with me on this amendment and to \nthe sponsor and cosponsors of this legislation for also working with me \nfor their support on this amendment.\n  I do have some concerns about the underlying bill. The cost-benefit \nanalysis, I think, will hamper the regulatory ability of the CFTC, but \nI do urge the adoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I claim time in opposition, although I do \nnot oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Arkansas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the cosponsors of this \namendment. I would like to thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin for \nintroducing the amendment and the cosponsors--Ms. Moore, Mr. Huizenga, \nMr. Maloney--for joining me in efforts to help bring transparency to \nthe global swap markets.\n  While I may not agree with every position in the Dodd-Frank law, \ntoday, I believe we are working towards its bipartisan goal of giving \nregulators the tools they need to improve systemic risk mitigation in \nglobal financial markets.\n  I think everyone agrees that the lack of transparency into the over-\nthe-counter derivatives market escalated the financial crisis of 2008. \nIn order to provide market transparency, the Dodd-Frank law requires \nposttrade reporting to swap data repositories, or SDRs, so that \nregulators and market participants have access to real-time market data \nthat will help identify systemic risk in the financial system.\n  So far, we have made great strides in reaching this goal, but \nunfortunately, a provision in the law threatens to undermine our \nprogress unless we fix it.\n  Currently, Dodd-Frank includes a provision requiring a foreign \nregulator to indemnify a U.S.-based SDR for any expenses arising from \nlitigation relating to a request for market data. Although well \nintentioned, the effect has been a reluctance of foreign regulators to \ncomply, which threatens to fragment global data on swap markets and \nmaking it harder for regulators to see a complete picture of the \nmarketplace.\n  Without effective coordination between international regulators and \nSDRs, monitoring and mitigating global systemic risk is severely \nlimited. H.R. 2289 includes a bipartisan provision that removes the \nindemnification provisions in Dodd-Frank.\n  This provision received broad bipartisan support when it came to the \nfloor as a stand-alone last year, passing the House by a vote of 420-2. \nAdditionally, both the CFTC and the SEC support the fix.\n  This amendment makes a small technical change to make clear that only \nswap data can be shared with foreign regulators. It will ensure that \nregulators will have access to a global set of swap market data, which \nis essential to maintaining the highest degree of market transparency \nand systemic risk mitigation.\n  Again, I thank the gentlewoman for introducing the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Wisconsin has 2 minutes remaining.\n\n[[Page H3950]]\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Minnesota (Ms. McCollum).\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. \nMoore), and I rise in full support of her amendment, but I join Ranking \nMember Peterson in his opposition of the bill before us.\n  Although reauthorization of the Commodity Exchange Act is an \nimportant endeavor, this legislation rolls back critical Dodd-Frank \nreforms and places unnecessary restrictions on the Commodity Futures \nTrading Commission. The changes proposed in this underlying bill would \nstifle the Commission's capacities to respond to a rapidly changing \nmarket and would add unneeded layers of government bureaucracy.\n  The underlying bill, H.R. 2289, threatens the financial stability of \nhard-working Americans by encouraging the same type of risky behavior \nthat led to the recession just 7 years ago.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting the Moore amendment. \nHowever, I urge my colleagues to use great caution and join me in \nvoting against the underlying bill.\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nConaway), the distinguished chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I don't oppose the amendment. It does improve \nthe bill. We appreciate that. I am looking forward to supporting the \namendment. I would also expect support on the underlying bill itself.\n  We have had a good discussion on why this bill is the right answer, \nbringing the right relief to the right people at the right time and \ndoes not do the things that have been spoken of in terms of rolling \nback Dodd-Frank.\n  This is a very light touch on Dodd-Frank, and it improves a bill that \nI don't think anybody would argue is perfect, but maybe they do argue \nthat Dodd-Frank is perfect. I don't think it is perfect, and it does \nneed these light touches.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman. I would urge adoption \nof the amendment, as well as support of the underlying bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mrs. Walorski\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-136.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment made in order by the \nrule.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 24, line 2, strike ``and''.\n       Page 24, line 4, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 24, after line 4, insert the following:\n       (3) the status of consultations with all United States \n     market participants including major producers and consumers.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 288, the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Congressman \nGoodlatte and Chairman Conaway for their continued leadership in \nsupport of my amendment.\n  My amendment today would encourage the CFTC to keep both U.S. \nproducers and users of aluminum firmly in mind as they proceed in their \nwork. We might take it for granted, but aluminum is part of our \neveryday life. It is used in everything from food packaging to \ncommercial buildings and homes to automotive and air transportation.\n  In my home State of Indiana, aluminum is home to 10,000 industry jobs \nthat account for over $5 billion in economic activity every year. About \n1,800 of those workers are employed at an integrated facility in \nsouthern Indiana that boasts the largest operating smelter in the \nUnited States and is one of eight still in use in the country.\n  My amendment would require the CFTC provide this body with an update \nof the status of its consultations with U.S. producers and consumers of \naluminum. To better protect the thousands of workers in my district and \nbusinesses and consumers across the country, we must ensure the CFTC is \noperating in a transparent manner where the rules are designed to help \nfair and open price discovery.\n  It is imperative that everyone who participates in the physical \naluminum market have confidence in the system, and my amendment will \nensure the protection of our workers, businesses, and consumers.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of my amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. Does any Member claim time in opposition? If not, the \ngentlewoman from Indiana is recognized.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, may I inquire how much time I have \nremaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Indiana has 3\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me the \ntime.\n  As someone who has worked very hard to ensure that this CFTC \nreauthorization process is transparent for commodity purchasers, users, \nand the markets that facility these transactions, I was pleased to work \nwith Mrs. Walorski on her amendment to bring further transparency and \nopenness to the issue of aluminum warehousing.\n  Her amendment would clarify that the bill's required report on the \nstatus of any application of metal exchange to register as a foreign \nboard of trade should also include the status of consultations with all \nU.S. market participants, including major producers and consumers.\n  I applaud her for offering this targeted amendment to improve the \nunderlying legislation and help everyone in the aluminum market have \nthe best information possible to strengthen aluminum supplies and bring \nthe best cost for consumers, helping to create jobs and grow our \neconomy.\n  I support her amendment.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nLaMalfa) having assumed the chair, Mr. Simpson, Chair of the Committee \nof the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that that \nCommittee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2289) to \nreauthorize the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, to better protect \nfutures customers, to provide end-users with market certainty, to make \nbasic reforms to ensure transparency and accountability at the \nCommission, to help farmers, ranchers, and end-users manage risks, to \nhelp keep consumer costs low, and for other purposes, had come to no \nresolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3950-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3950]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n   PERMISSION TO CONSIDER AMENDMENTS OUT OF SEQUENCE DURING FURTHER \n       CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2289, COMMODITY END-USER RELIEF ACT\n\n  Ms. PLASKETT.

When the Committee of the Whole House rose earlier today, \namendment No. 5 printed in House Report 114-136 offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) had been disposed of.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Plaskett\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in \norder to consider amendment No. 2 printed in House Report 114-136.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, I offer an amendment as the designee of \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gallego).\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 13, after line 6, insert the following:\n       (c) Sense of the Congress.--It is the sense of the Congress \n     that the Commodity Futures Trading Commission should take all \n     appropriate actions to encourage applications for positions \n     in the Office of the Chief Economist from members of minority \n     groups, women, disabled persons, and veterans.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 288, the gentlewoman from the \nVirgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from the Virgin Islands.\n  Ms. PLASKETT. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is very straightforward. \nIt simply urges the CFTC Office of the Chief Economist to encourage \napplicants for employment by members of minority groups, women, \ndisabled persons, and veterans.\n  This is a basic standard that I believe every corporation and Federal \nagency in America should and is willing to strive to meet. Our \ngovernment is stronger when its workforce reflects the rich diversity \nof the American people, and this is especially true when it comes to \nour financial regulatory agencies.\n  In the years preceding the financial crash, CFTC and the SEC fell \ndown on the job. Their failures helped set the stage for the crushing \nrecession that followed, an economic downturn that disproportionately \nimpacted communities of color.\n  In the wake of this crisis, Dodd-Frank wisely established the Offices \nof Minority and Women Inclusion to promote diversity at the Nation's \nfinancial regulators and to ensure that the interests of women and \nminorities would be protected by these agencies.\n  I was pleased when, earlier this month, six regulatory bodies came \ntogether to announce the creation of joint standards for assessing the \ndiversity practices of the financial institutions they oversee.\n  Though long overdue, this is a critical step forward that will help \nto promote a more inclusive financial industry. While CFTC did not \nparticipate in crafting these standards, I hope that by passing this \namendment today we can send a clear message that Congress expects the \nagency to demonstrate a strong commitment to diversity and inclusion \nmoving forward.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment is narrowly crafted, but it promotes a \nfar-reaching goal, advancing the fundamentally American principles of \nequal opportunity for all.\n  I urge all Members to support this amendment, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, but I am \nnot opposed to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Chairman, I am not opposed to the amendment, as I \nsaid. The CFTC in fact does have an office of diversity and inclusion \nand has three people employed there to work at this very important \nissue.\n  I would like to put in the Record a statement from Chairman Massad. \nHe says:\n\n       Our greatest resource is our employees, and each of us \n     plays a role in ensuring that we recognize the benefits of \n     the differences and the diversity that we bring to our \n     environment.\n       The protections provided by the Equal Opportunity Act \n     extend to everything we do at the agency, be it recruitment, \n     hiring, appraisal systems, promotions, training and career \n     development programs, or any other actions . . . All persons \n     should be afforded equal employment opportunities at the \n     Commission in an environment in which they can do their best.\n\n  I urge support of the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from the Virgin Islands (Ms. Plaskett).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Takai\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the order of the House of today, it is now in \norder to consider amendment No. 3 printed in House Report 114-136.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 15, line 4, strike ``and''.\n       Page 15, line 7, strike the period and insert ``; and''.\n       Page 15, after line 7, insert the following:\n       ``(iii) include a summary of any plan of action and \n     milestones to address any known information security \n     vulnerability, as identified pursuant to a widely accepted \n     industry or Government standard, including--\n\n       ``(I) specific information about the industry or Government \n     standard used to identify the known information security \n     vulnerability;\n       ``(II) a detailed time line with specific deadlines for \n     addressing the known information security vulnerability; and\n       ``(III) an update of any such time line and the rationale \n     for any deviation from the time line.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 288, the gentleman from \nHawaii (Mr. Takai) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Hawaii.\n  Mr. TAKAI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My amendment is simple and would help to address cyber \nvulnerabilities for stored government information at the Commodity \nFutures Trading Commission.\n  As the bill is currently written, section 206 would require the \nCommodity Futures Trading Commission to come up with a 5-year plan on \ntechnology acquisition. My amendment would add reporting requirements \nto Congress on plans of actions and milestones for any known \ninformation security vulnerability.\n  My amendment would include a detailed timeline with specific \ndeadlines for addressing the known threats to make sure we get any \nthreat dealt with and solved in a reasonable amount of time.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have seen recently that cybersecurity is a serious \nthreat to our security, where just last week the personal information \nof over 4 million Federal employees was compromised. This was one of \nthe largest known cyber attacks on Federal networks in our history and \nonly further underscores the necessity of this amendment.\n  As we know, this threat is very real. Networks are being attacked \nconstantly by a variety of different actors and for different reasons. \nFor example, there is evidence that our financial institutions have \nbeen targeted, and other actors are out to steal one of the best \ndrivers that we have of our economic growth: intellectual property.\n  Cybersecurity is a problem that the entire government needs to \naddress. The CFTC will be storing very sensitive information, and they \nshould have a plan to place privacy safeguards on this information when \nstoring government data.\n  If we are going to discuss budgeting for technology acquisition, we \nshould also be discussing looking at information security \nvulnerabilities, a plan to address them, and have reporting \nrequirements along the way.\n  This amendment is common sense, and I urge my colleagues to support \nits adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Hawaii (Mr. Takai).\n\n[[Page H3952]]\n\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 235, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The clock is ticking down on a key law that protects Internet \nfreedom. On October 1, 2015, a temporary moratorium on State taxation \nof Internet access will expire.\n  In 1998, Congress temporarily banned State and local governments from \nnewly taxing Internet access or placing multiple or discriminatory \ntaxes on Internet commerce. With minor modifications, this ban was \nextended five times, with enormous bipartisan support. The most recent \nextension passed in 2014.\n  If the moratorium is not renewed, the potential tax burden on \nconsumers will be substantial. The average tax rate on communications \nservices in 2007 was 13.5 percent, more than twice the average rate on \nall other goods and services. The FCC's recent reclassification of the \nInternet as a telecom service emboldens States to apply these telecom \ntaxes to Internet access immediately, should ITFA lapse.\n  To make matters worse, this tax is regressive. Low-income households \npay 10 times as much in communications taxes as high-income households \nas a share of income.\n  The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act converts the moratorium into a \npermanent ban--on which consumers, innovators, and investors can \npermanently rely--by simply striking the 2015 end date.\n  This legislation prevents a surprise tax hike on Americans' critical \nservices this fall. It also maintains unfettered access to one of the \nmost unique gateways to knowledge and engines of self-improvement in \nall of human history.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  This is not an exaggeration. During the 2007 renewal of the \nmoratorium, the Judiciary Committee heard testimony that more than 75 \npercent of the remarkable productivity growth that increased jobs and \nincome between 1995 and 2007 was due to investment in \ntelecommunications networks technology and the information transported \nacross them.\n  Everyone in Silicon Valley knows Max Levchin's story. He came to \nAmerica from the Soviet Union at age 16. He had $300 in his pocket, and \nhe learned English by watching an old TV set he hauled out of a \ndumpster and repaired. Ten years later, he sold PayPal, a well-known \nInternet payments platform he cofounded, for $1.5 billion.\n  That is the greatness of the Internet. It is a liberating technology \nthat is a vast meritocracy. It does not care how you look or where you \ncome from. It offers opportunity to anyone willing to invest time and \neffort.\n  That is precisely why Congress has worked assiduously for 16 years to \nkeep Internet access tax-free. Now we must act again, once and for all.\n  The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act has 188 cosponsors. Identical \nlegislation passed last year on suspension by a voice vote.\n  Nevertheless, small pockets of resistance remain. They argue that the \nInternet is no longer a fledgling technology in need of protection. But \nit is precisely the ubiquity of the Internet that counsels for a \npermanent extension. It has become an indispensable gateway to \nscientific, educational, and economic opportunities.\n  It is the platform that turned Max Levchin from an impoverished \nimmigrant into a billionaire. The case for permanent Internet tax-free \naccess to this gateway technology is stronger today than it ever has \nbeen.\n  It is important to note that PITFA does not address the issue of \nState taxes on remote sales made over the Internet. It merely prevents \nInternet access taxes and unfair multiple or discriminatory taxes on e-\ncommerce, whether inside the taxing State or without.\n  That said, the committee is also eager to proceed with legislation \nthat levels the playing field between traditional and online retailers \nwithout letting States tax and regulate beyond their borders. \nProductive discussions continue.\n  I would like to specifically thank Ms. Eshoo, Mr. Chabot, \nSubcommittee Chairman Marino, and Subcommittee Ranking Member Cohen for \ntheir work on and support of this legislation.\n  This bipartisan legislation is about giving every American unfettered \naccess to the Internet, which is the modern gateway to the American \nDream. I urge all of my colleagues to support it, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  We have often worked, in the Judiciary Committee, as Mr. Goodlatte \nhas so noted, because of the bipartisan leadership, including the \nofferer of this bill, the gentlewoman from California\n\n[[Page H3953]]\n\n(Ms. Eshoo), in a bipartisan manner as it deals with this new \nphenomena, and when I say ``new phenomena,'' continually changing \nphenomena, the Internet and the entire world of social media and the \nnew technologies that we face today in communications.\n  So, I am always eager to find common ground and would have liked to \nhave done so as we worked together on this very important bill, H.R. \n235.\n  As a senior member of the House Judiciary Committee, and as the \nranking member on the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations, coming from Houston, I rise with great \nconcern on H.R. 235, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act.\n  When originally enacted in 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nestablished a temporary moratorium on multiple discriminatory taxation \nof the Internet, as well as new taxes on Internet access. This \nmoratorium, however, is due to expire on October 1 of this year.\n  Since 1998, Congress has extended the moratorium on a temporary \nbasis. The bill before us, H.R. 235, will make that moratorium \npermanent.\n  Unfortunately, in doing so, H.R. 235 also ends the act's grandfather \nprotection for States that imposed such taxes prior to the act's \nenactment. There lies the crux of the problem: intrusion into \nindividual States' authority dealing with taxation and providing them \nwith a bridge of revenue.\n  H.R. 235 is problematic for several reasons. First, Congress, instead \nof supporting this seriously flawed legislation, should be focusing on \nmeaningful ways to help State and local governments, taxpayers, and \nlocal retailers. The House can do that by addressing the remote sales \ntax issue.\n  In addition to extending the expiring moratorium on a temporary \nbasis, the House should take up and send to the Senate legislation that \nwould give States the authority to collect sales taxes from remote \nsellers. Such a proposal would incentivize remote sellers to collect \nand remit such taxes, as well as require States to simplify several \nprocedures that would benefit retailers. Such legislation would enable \nStates and local governments to collect more than $23 billion in \nestimated uncollected sales taxes each year.\n  The measure would also help level the playing field for local \nretailers who must collect sales taxes when they compete with out-of-\nstate businesses that do not collect these taxes. Retail competitors \nshould be able to compete fairly with their Internet counterparts, at \nleast with respect to sales tax policy.\n  Now, I do know that a lot of our businesses are taking to the \nInternet, and I applaud that. But before I came here today I spoke \nbefore at least 100-plus small businesses. I can tell you that they are \nworth considering, for many of them are in bricks-and-mortar, and they \nare small businesses trying to increase their revenue and trying to \nemploy a number of employees. We should thank them for the energy that \nthey provide to the economy.\n  I believe the House should do its part and address the remote sales \ntax disparity before the end of this Congress.\n  Second, this legislation will severely impact the immediate revenues \nfor the grandfather-protected States and all States progressively in \nthe long term.\n  The CBO, for example, estimates that this bill will cost certain \nStates several hundred million dollars annually in lost revenues.\n  Indeed, the Federation of Tax Administrators has estimated that the \nbill will cause the grandfather-protected States to lose at least $500 \nmillion in lost revenue.\n  For my home State of Texas, enactment of this bill will result in a \nrevenue loss of $358 million, and Texas will not be alone in those \nlosses annually.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, as senior member of the House Judiciary Committee; as \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations; and as the representative from Houston, I \nrise in opposition to H.R. 235, the ``Permanent Internet Tax Freedom \nAct.''\n  When originally enacted in 1998, the Internet Tax Freedom Act \nestablished a temporary moratorium on multiple and discriminatory \ntaxation of the Internet as well as new taxes on Internet access.\n  This moratorium, however, is due to expire on October 1st, of this \nyear.\n  Since 1998, Congress has extended the moratorium on a temporary \nbasis. The bill before us, H.R. 235 will make that moratorium \npermanent.\n  Unfortunately, in doing so, H.R. 235 also ends the Act's grandfather \nprotections for states that imposed such taxes prior to the Act's \nenactment date.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 235 is problematic for several reasons.\n  First, Congress, instead of supporting this seriously flawed \nlegislation, should be focusing on meaningful ways to help state and \nlocal governments, taxpayers, and local retailers. The House can do \nthat by addressing the remote sales tax issue.\n  In addition to extending the expiring moratorium on a temporary \nbasis, the House should take up and send to the Senate legislation that \nwould give states the authority to collect sales taxes from remote \nsellers.\n  Such a proposal would incentivize remote sellers to collect and remit \nsales taxes as well as require states to simplify several procedures \nthat would benefit retailers.\n  Such legislation would enable states and local governments to collect \nmore than $23 billion in estimated uncollected sales taxes each year.\n  The measure would also help level the playing field for local \nretailers--who must collect sales taxes--when they compete with out-of \nstate businesses that do not collect these taxes.\n  Retail competitors should be able to compete fairly with their \nInternet counterparts at least with respect to sales tax policy.\n  The House should do its part and address the remote sales tax \ndisparity before the end of this Congress.\n  Second, this legislation will severely impact the immediate revenues \nfor the grandfather-protected states and all states progressively in \nthe long term.\n  The Congressional Budget Office, for example, estimates that this \nbill will cost certain states ``several hundred million dollars \nannually'' in lost revenues.\n  Indeed, the Federation of Tax Administrators has estimated that the \nbill will cause the grandfather-protected states to lose at least $500 \nmillion in lost revenue annually.\n  For my home state of Texas, enactment of this bill will result in a \nrevenue loss of $358 million per year. Texas will not be alone in these \nlosses, annually: Wisconsin will lose about $127 million, Ohio will \nlose about $65 million, and South Dakota will lose about $13 million.\n  Should this bill become law, state and local governments will have to \nchoose whether they will cut essential government services--such as \neducating our children, maintaining needed transportation \ninfrastructure, and providing essential public health and safety \nservices--or shift the tax burden onto other taxpayers through \nincreased property, income, and sales taxes.\n  Meanwhile, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated \nthat the permanent moratorium will deny the non-grandfathered states of \nalmost $6.5 billion in potential state and local sales tax revenues \neach year in perpetuity.\n  H.R. 235 will burden taxpayers, while excluding an entire industry \nfrom paying their fair share of taxes.\n  Finally, this bill ignores the fundamental nature of the Internet.\n  The original moratorium was intentionally made temporary to ensure \nthat Congress, industry, and state and local governments would be able \nto monitor the issue and make adjustments where necessary to \naccommodate new technologies and market realities.\n  The Act was intended as a temporary measure to assist and nurture the \nfledgling Internet that--back in 1998--was still in its commercial \ninfancy. Yet, this bill ignores the significantly changed environment \nof today's Internet.\n  The bill's supporters continue to believe that the Internet still is \nin need of extraordinary protection in the form of exemption from all \nstate taxation.\n  But, the Internet of 2015 is drastically different from its 1998 \npredecessor. And, surely the Internet and its attendant technology will \ncontinue to evolve.\n  Permanently extending the tax moratorium severely limits Congress's \nability to revisit and make any necessary adjustments.\n\n[[Page H3954]]\n\n  Simply put, a permanent moratorium is unwise.\n  In closing, urge my colleagues to oppose H.R. 235.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, at this time it is my pleasure to yield 3 \nminutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), a member of the \nJudiciary Committee and chairman of the Small Business Committee.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Mr. Goodlatte, not only for yielding me this time \nbut also for his leadership on promoting and pushing for this bill.\n  The Internet is an essential component of our economy. It drives \ninnovation, job creation, and has resulted in a higher standard of \nliving for virtually every American.\n  The bill before us today provides certainty to Americans by making \nthe current law of the land permanent and protecting access to the \nInternet against new taxes.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is common ground in this Chamber today. We all \nagree that the Internet is an essential part of our lives and an \nincredibly powerful tool for communication, education, and job \ncreation. Let's not make accessing the Internet more costly and more \ndifficult.\n  The Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, H.R. 235, makes the current \nlaw of the land permanent and protects access to the Internet from new \ntaxes, and that is why I would urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  The Internet, it is essential to our everyday lives. Americans use it \nto run small businesses, to do research, to apply for jobs, to listen \nto music, to communicate with friends and family, to check the weather \nand the traffic, and for so many other things.\n  Since 1998, Congress has made sure that access to the Internet \nremains tax-free. Unfortunately, this protection expires in October, at \nwhich point taxes could go up on every American who wants to get \nonline.\n  Now is the time to make sure that this policy remains permanent. Now \nis the time to protect access to the Internet.\n  So I want to again thank the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, Mr. \nGoodlatte, for his leadership on this issue. Let's make sure that \naccess to the Internet stays tax-free. That is the way it is under the \nexisting law. What we are trying to do is to make that permanent. I \nwould urge my colleagues to do that.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it gives me great pleasure to yield 4 \nminutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Eshoo), the \nlongstanding author of this legislation.\n  Ms. ESHOO. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 235, the Permanent \nInternet Tax Freedom Act.\n  Now, whether it is communication, commerce, business, education, \nresearch, access to the Internet is today an integral part of the \neveryday life of millions of Americans and people around the world. And \nwe take great pride in this because this is an American invention.\n  Just this month, the GAO released a new report which found that \nbroadband affordability continues to be the most frequently identified \nbarrier to adoption.\n  Now, this whole issue of taxation for access to the Internet, this is \nnot the collection of taxes across State lines. That is another issue.\n  There are over 10,000 taxing agencies in the United States today. \nImagine if we, you, your constituents, everyone in the country who uses \nthe Internet has to pay for access to the Internet every time they go \nto use it, that they would be taxed on that.\n  So, the temporary, or the moratorium bill that we have, now this one \nmakes it permanent. This is a bipartisan effort. Over 200 cosponsors in \nthe Congress are on it.\n  We want to encourage expanded broadband adoption. If you tax it, you \nare going to shrink it. And I think in the communities that are of \nlower economic means, this is going to hurt them even more.\n  We need to do everything we can to ensure that Internet access is \nuniversally affordable. This bill is an important component of that \neffort by permanently eliminating the taxation of Internet access.\n  The current moratorium, as my colleagues have said, expires October \n1, and we want to be ahead of that to keep the door open, but no \ntaxation to access.\n  I want to salute the chairman, Chairman Goodlatte. We are good \nfriends. We have worked on other efforts.\n  As I said, this bill has nearly 200 bipartisan cosponsors and strong \nsupport of the communications, Internet, and e-commerce industries. So \nI would urge all of my colleagues to support this, and understand that, \nfrom the ground up, we want to expand the use of broadband in our \ncountry for every community. Whether they are poor, whether they are \nrural, whether they are in a city, whether they are middle class \nindividuals, we don't want to weigh the Internet down with taxation of \naverage people in this country. It would really be unfair, and I think \nit would smother the Internet as we know it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have only one speaker remaining. I \nbelieve I have the right to close, so if the gentlewoman has additional \nspeakers, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I am delighted to yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nto the distinguished gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cohen), who is the \nranking member on the Judiciary Committee's Regulatory Reform, \nCommercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for providing the \ntime, and I want to thank her for her good work.\n  I also want to thank the chairman of the committee for bringing this \nbipartisan bill, which is bipartisan. I signed on to this bill, I \nguess, with Representative Eshoo and maybe Representative Goodlatte, \nback in 2007 because it is my belief that the Internet is a necessity, \nand it is a necessity in minority communities who need that outreach to \ninformation, whether it is educational or commercial, to reach out and \nbe a part of the society. Without the Internet, you can't do that.\n  Now, the gentlewoman from Texas and my State, Tennessee, neither have \nan income tax, and therefore, our governments rely on taxes that tend \nto be regressive. I think Tennessee is the most regressive State in the \ncountry on its taxes, very high sales tax.\n  And the local governments will reach out for anything they can find \nto tax to make up for the fact that our State doesn't have a \nprogressive tax base.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  I want to protect my constituents against regressive taxes at all \nlevels and protect them against taxes that might limit their \npotentiality of getting access to the World Wide Web and information \nthey need.\n  So I am proud to be a sponsor of this, to work with the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Chabot), with whom I have worked on so many bills \ntogether, trying to get the Delta Queen going back down the river and \nall these other things, and the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nGoodlatte), the chairman on the Judiciary Committee. I thank them for \ntheir work and hope they will all vote for this in a bipartisan \nfashion. I hope the Senate will, as they did on the USA FREEDOM Act, \nfollow the lead of the House and show that the House leads.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First of all, let me again say that in the Judiciary Committee, we \nhave consistently worked together on issues dealing with the Internet, \ncontinue to work together on issues dealing with innovation, so I would \nhope as this bill makes its way to the Senate we will find an \nopportunity to work together again.\n  But I want to make mention of the fact that in addition to Texas, \nWisconsin will lose about $127 million, Ohio will lose about $65 \nmillion, and South Dakota will lose about $13 million. Should this bill \nbecome law, State and local governments will have to choose whether \nthey will cut essential government services, such as educating our \nchildren, maintaining needed transportation infrastructure, and \nproviding essential public health and safety services, or shift the tax \nburden onto other taxpayers to increase property income and sales \ntaxes.\n  Now let me be very clear: I am not interested in taxing the Internet. \nI am\n\n[[Page H3955]]\n\ninterested in the process that most States are utilizing. It is the \npurchase of items that juxtapose against those who have bricks and \nmortar, and particularly small businesses.\n  Meanwhile, the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities has estimated \nthat the permanent moratorium will deny the non-grandfathered States of \nalmost $6.5 billion in potential State and local sales tax revenue--\nsales tax, not access to the Internet.\n  H.R. 235 will burden taxpayers while excluding an entire industry \nfrom paying their fair share of taxes. I want this industry to grow, \nand, again, I do not want taxing on access. You can be on the Internet \nfrom morning until the early sunrise again, the next day. But for those \nStates who have worked and worked with our committee, trying to find a \npathway forward, I would like to see us find a compromise.\n  Finally, this bill ignores the fundamental nature of the Internet. \nThe original moratorium was intentionally made temporary to ensure \nCongress, industry, and State and local governments would be able to \nmonitor the issue and make adjustments where necessary to accommodate \nnew technologies and market realities, such as acts. The act was \nintended as a temporary measure to assist and nurture the fledgling \nInternet that back in 1998 was still in its commercial infancy, yet \nthis bill ignores the significantly changed environment of today's \nInternet.\n  The bill's supporters continue to believe that the Internet still is \nin need of extraordinary protection in the form of exemptions from \nState taxation, but the Internet of 2015 is drastically different from \n1998. It is standing on its own two legs. It is not a toddler. It is a \nfull-grown adult.\n  Permanently extending the tax moratorium severely limits Congress' \nability to revisit and make any necessary adjustments, though I hope we \nwill.\n  Simply put, the permanent moratorium is unwise, and I urge my \ncolleagues to consider the problems of H.R. 235. H.R. 235, I think, \nshould be addressing these issues dealing with the many who have \nopposed it.\n  Let me, as I close, mention that the National Governors Association \nrecently introduced the following statement: ``The National Governors \nAssociation is disappointed that the House Judiciary Committee is \nmoving to make the Internet access tax moratorium permanent.''\n\n              NGA Statement Regarding Internet Access Tax\n\n                 [For Immediate Release, June 17, 2014]\n\n       Washington--The National Governors Association today \n     released the following statement regarding the Internet \n     access tax moratorium:\n       ``The National Governors Association (NGA) is disappointed \n     that the House Judiciary Committee is moving to make the \n     Internet access tax moratorium permanent.\n       ``Federal prohibitions on state taxing authority are \n     contrary to federalism and the sovereign authority of states \n     to structure and manage their own fiscal systems.\n       ``NGA encourages the committee instead to act to address \n     the disparity between Main Street retailers and online \n     sellers regarding the collection of state and local sales \n     taxes. Leveling the playing field for all retailers is a \n     priority for governors, consistent with federalism and the \n     best opportunity for states, Congress and the business \n     community to work together.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I would like to make note that I came from local \ngovernment, so I have a letter signed by representatives of the \nNational Association of Counties, National League of Cities, U.S. \nConference of Mayors, International City/County Management Association, \nGovernment Finance Officers Association, and the National Association \nof Telecommunications Officers and Advisors. In part, they simply say \nthat they are writing on behalf of local governments: ``We urge you to \noppose the legislation. . . . The most recent estimates provided by the \nCongressional Budget Office,'' they write, ``indicate that, if enacted, \nH.R. 3086 would cost State and local governments hundreds of millions \nof dollars in lost revenues.''\n\n         National Association of Counties, National League of \n           Cities, U.S. Conference of Mayors, International City/\n           County Management Association, Government Finance \n           Officers Association, National Association of \n           Telecommunications Officers and Advisors\n                                                     July 8, 2014.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of local governments across \n     the nation, our organizations write to express our continuing \n     opposition to H.R. 3086, the Permanent Internet Tax Freedom \n     Act. We urge you to oppose the legislation when it is \n     considered on the House floor.\n       The most recent estimates provided by the Congressional \n     Budget Office indicate that, if enacted, H.R. 3086 would cost \n     state and local governments hundreds of millions of dollars \n     in lost revenues. These are revenues that local governments \n     rely upon to fund essential services in their communities, \n     including well-trained firefighters and police officers; \n     schools, parks, community centers and libraries to support \n     youth; retirement security for dedicated career employees; \n     and continued investments to fix aging infrastructure.\n       In addition, now that Internet access is ubiquitous and its \n     use generates scores of billions of dollars in revenue \n     annually, it no longer justifies protection from state and \n     local taxation. When the law was first enacted in 1998, the \n     Internet access and commerce industries were in their infancy \n     and only beginning to be significantly available to \n     households. The intent of the moratorium was to give the \n     then-nascent Internet industry time to grow and become \n     established. However, even at that time, Congress recognized \n     that the ban should not be permanent.\n       Finally, as the telecommunications and cable service \n     industries transition to broadband, the scope of what the \n     ITFA immunizes from state and local taxation is rapidly \n     expanding. Over time, the ITFA would arbitrarily exempt this \n     fast growing, prosperous sector of the economy from taxation, \n     and unfairly shift the burden of supporting essential local \n     services onto other businesses and residents in a community.\n       For all of these reasons, we urge you to vote against the \n     Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act, H.R. 3086.\n           Sincerely,\n       Matthew D. Chase, Executive Director, National Association \n     of Counties;\n       Clarence E. Anthony, Executive Director, National League of \n     Cities;\n       Tom Cochran, Executive Director, U.S. Conference of Mayors;\n       Robert J. O'Neill, Executive Director, International City/\n     County Management Association;\n       Jeffrey L. Esser, Executive Director, Government Finance \n     Officers Association;\n       Stephen Traylor, Executive Director, National Association \n     of Telecommunications Officers and Advisors.\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I want to be very clear: I am here, as many Members \nare, to extend our hand of friendship for the protection of the \nInternet and the question of sales on the Internet. I hope we will be \nable to do that. I ask my colleagues to consider the failings of the \npresent bill and to, in its present form, oppose it.\n\n       To Members of the Texas Congressional Delegation: As some \n     of you already know, this bill would make permanent the \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act and, importantly for Texas, would \n     repeal the existing grandfather clause that has been in place \n     since the original passage of the Act in 1998 that has \n     allowed Texas to impose sales and use taxes on Internet \n     access services at the state and local level.\n       The Texas legislature just finished its regular session on \n     June 1, and while it decided to cut property and franchise \n     taxes, it chose to maintain the sales and use tax imposed on \n     these services and anticipates receiving that revenue during \n     the next two year budget cycle.\n       The estimated revenue loss to the state and local \n     jurisdictions if the grandfather is not extended is as \n     follows:\n       State: $280 million\n       City: 51\n       Transit: 18\n       County: 5\n       Special districts: 4\n       Total: $358 million (per year)\n       Please feel free to get in touch with me if you need input \n     from the Comptroller's office on this or any other state/\n     local tax bills that come before the House.\n           Thanks,\n     Nancy L. Prosser,\n       Special Counsel to the Deputy Comptroller, Texas \n     Comptroller of Public Accounts.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 8, 2015.\n\n Labor Unions Oppose H.R. 235 (PITFA) Ban on State & Local Government \n                       Taxes on Internet Access.\n\n       Dear Representative: We, the undersigned labor unions, \n     oppose a federal ban on the authority of state and local \n     governments to impose taxes on internet access. We \n     strenuously oppose the ``Permanent Internet Tax Freedom Act'' \n     (H.R. 235), which would ban these internet access taxes \n     permanently. This type of federal tax preemption is typically \n     unwarranted because it restricts state and local government \n     taxing authority unnecessarily, narrows the tax base, and \n     often leads to harmful unintended consequences. In this case, \n     the internet's huge economic value, its vast and expanding \n     importance to daily life, and the vague statutory definition \n     of ``internet access'' makes this particular carve out \n     especially troubling and likely to cause fiscal problems. By \n     restricting state\n\n[[Page H3956]]\n\n     and local taxing authority, this bill reduces the ability of \n     state and local governments to raise funds to invest in \n     needed infrastructure, education, health care, job training, \n     and other vital public services.\n       While a short-term ban is less troubling than a permanent \n     ban, any ban remains problematic and harmful to state and \n     local government finances. Ideally, the existing temporary \n     ban should be allowed to expire as scheduled on September 30, \n     2015. As new internet-based technology and related \n     applications increasingly affect our daily lives and rapidly \n     transform our economy, we are extremely wary of a ban that is \n     permanent. Congress should be extremely cautious before \n     supporting a permanent tax exemption for internet access. \n     Moreover, it would set harmful, inappropriate, and costly \n     precedents that could spillover into other sectors of our \n     economy.\n       Years ago, some opined the internet needed time to grow \n     because it was weak, tiny, or immature. In contrast, today's \n     internet is an enormously powerful driver of our economy, a \n     central part of our daily lives, and an enormously valuable \n     well developed industry. As the internet continues providing \n     new transformative services to businesses and consumers, its \n     importance to America's economy grows. Prohibiting these \n     taxes would unfairly exempt this economic sector from \n     contributing to our common well being and communities. In \n     addition, this unneeded and undeserved carve out would \n     unfairly shift its share of taxes to other services, sectors, \n     and stakeholders. There is no reason to exempt internet \n     providers and users from state and local government taxes.\n       Our labor unions urge you to oppose the ``Permanent \n     Internet Tax Freedom Act'' (H.R. 235) and any similar ban on \n     state and local government taxes on internet access.\n         American Federation of Labor and Congress of Industrial \n           Organizations (AFL-CIO); American Federation of State, \n           County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME); American \n           Federation of Teachers (AFT); Amalgamated Transit Union \n           (ATU); Communications Workers of America (CWA); \n           Department for Professional Employees, AFL-CIO (DPE); \n           International Association of Fire Fighters (IAFF); \n           International Federation of Professional and Technical \n           Engineers (IFPTE); International Union of Police \n           Associations (IUPA); National Education Association \n           (NEA); Service Employees International Union (SEIU); \n           International Union, United Automobile, Aerospace & \n           Agricultural Implement Workers of America (UAW).\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The last thing the American people need is another tax bill at their \ndoor come October. If the ban lapses, State telecommunications taxes \ncould take effect, and those rates are already too high. Basic \neconomics teaches that, as price rises, demand falls.\n  Former White House Chief Economist Austan Goolsbee estimated that a \ntax that increased the price of Internet access by 1 percent would \nreduce demand for Internet access by 2.75 percent. This bill ensures \nthat access to the Internet--this unparalleled engine of social \nmobility--remains tax-free. That is why this bill is so overwhelmingly \npopular. Nevertheless, I believe it is proper to counter the criticisms \nof the small pockets of resistance that remain.\n  The opponents' chief argument is that the bill would cost the States \n$6.5 billion annually. This argument confuses an out-of-pocket loss \nwith prevention of a gain. States cannot currently tax Internet access, \nso they will suffer no actual revenue loss. The only out-of-pocket loss \nwould be to taxpayers in 44 States who will owe an additional $6.5 \nbillion annually should it expire. They will have to pay taxes that \nthey don't have to pay now.\n  Nevertheless, some of our colleagues would prefer to extend the \nmoratorium temporarily rather than permanently. That is simply \ninefficient. The moratorium has been periodically renewed by enormous \nbipartisan margins in both Houses for 16 years. No serious expectations \nare being upset by codifying what everyone knows is the case: the \nmoratorium is not going away.\n  The grandfathers will be eliminated, but that only affects six States \nthat have had more than enough time to transition to other sources of \nrevenue, which was the original intent of the grandfather clauses. If \nthose States still need more time, I am open to working with the Senate \non a final phaseout.\n  Opponents also argue that PITFA creates unequal treatment of similar \nservices. The example given is landline phone service, which is \ntaxable, versus Skype which, under PITFA, is accessible tax-free. But \nthis happens because Skype's basic service is free; Skype's paid \nservice is taxable. Indeed, PITFA specifically provides that Internet \nphone service is taxable.\n  More importantly, this neutrality argument conflates a service with \nthe access to it.\n  The toll road on the way to the shopping mall is not the same as the \nsales tax paid at the mall. PITFA is neutral because Skype's paid \nservice remains taxable, just like landline service.\n  True, there is no tax on Skype's basic service because it is free, \nbut that is the function of Skype's revenue model, not a different tax \ntreatment of the same service.\n  This legislation has enormous bipartisan support precisely because \nMembers on both sides of the aisle already understand the flaws in \nthese objections. I catalog them here merely to complete the record.\n  This is a great issue for the Congress to move forward on in a \nbipartisan fashion that will help to create jobs and economic growth \nand foster continued greater access to the unparalleled opportunities \nthat Internet access provides. I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 235.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3956-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3956-H3959]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  FOREIGN CULTURAL EXCHANGE JURISDICTIONAL IMMUNITY CLARIFICATION ACT\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 889, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Chabot) for introducing this legislation and the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Conyers) and the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. \nCohen) for their support as well.\n  The Foreign Cultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification \nAct strengthens the ability of U.S. museums and educational \ninstitutions to borrow foreign-government-owned artwork and cultural \nartifacts for temporary exhibition or display in the United States.\n  The United States has long recognized the importance of encouraging \nthe cultural exchange of ideas through exhibitions of artworks and \nother artifacts loaned from other countries. These exchanges expose \nAmericans to other cultures and foster understanding between people of \ndifferent nationalities, languages, religions, and races.\n  Unfortunately, the future success of cultural exchanges is severely \nthreatened by a disconnect between the Immunity from Seizure Act and \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act.\n  Loans of artwork and cultural objects depend on foreign lenders \nhaving confidence that the items they loan will be returned and that \nthe loan will not open them up to lawsuits in U.S. courts.\n  For 40 years, the Immunity from Seizure Act provided foreign \ngovernment lenders with this confidence. However, rulings in several \nrecent Federal cases have undermined the protection provided by this \nlaw. In these decisions, the Federal courts have held that the Immunity \nfrom Seizure Act does not preempt the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. \nThe effect has been to open foreign governments up to the jurisdiction \nof U.S. courts simply because they loaned artwork or cultural objects \nto an American museum or educational institution.\n  This has significantly impeded the ability of U.S. institutions to \nborrow foreign-government-owned items. It has also resulted in cultural \nexchanges being curtailed as foreign governments have become hesitant \nto permit their cultural property to travel to the United States.\n  This bill addresses this situation. It provides that if the State \nDepartment grants immunity to a loan of artwork or cultural objects \nfrom the Immunity from Seizure Act, then the loan cannot subject a \nforeign government to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts under the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act.\n  This is very narrow legislation. It only applies to one of many \ngrounds for jurisdiction under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, \nand it requires the State Department to grant the artwork immunity \nbefore its provisions apply. Moreover, in order to preserve the claims \nof the victims of the Nazi government and its allies during World War \nII, the bill has an exception for claims brought by these victims.\n  If we want to encourage foreign governments to continue to lend \nartwork and other artifacts, we must enact this legislation. Without \nthe protections this bill provides, foreign governments will avoid the \nrisk of lending their cultural items to American museums and \neducational institutions, and the American public will lose the \nopportunity to view and appreciate these cultural objects from abroad.\n  Last Congress, this legislation passed the House with broad \nbipartisan support by a vote of 388-4. I, once again, urge my \ncolleagues to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 889, the Foreign Cultural Exchange \nJurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act.\n  This bill makes a modest but important amendment to the \n``expropriation exception'' of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of \n1976. Specifically, it ensures that foreign states are immune from \nsuits for damages concerning the ownership of cultural property when \nthree particularly important ingredients are present: one, that the \nproperty is in the United States pursuant to an agreement between the \nforeign state and the U.S. or a U.S.-based cultural or educational \ninstitution; two, the President has granted the work at issue immunity \nfrom seizure pursuant to the Immunity from Seizure Act; and three, that \nthe President's grant of immunity from seizure is published in the \nFederal Register. All three of those conditions must be met.\n  The expropriation exception remains available to all claims \nconcerning misappropriated cultural property to which these factual \ncircumstances do not apply.\n  I would not support this bill if it did not contain a sufficient \nexception for claims arising from artwork stolen by the Nazis, their \nallies, and their affiliates.\n  H.R. 889 has such an exception, ensuring that victims of Nazi art \ntheft continue to have the opportunity to pursue justice in court. This \nexception is appropriate and important in light of the sheer scale and \nthe particularly concerted efforts of the Nazis to seize artwork and \nother cultural property from their victims.\n  A movie that was directed and starred in by George Clooney called \n``The Monuments Men'' brought to America's attention, really, the \nextreme depth to which the Nazis went to confiscate art, steal art, and \ntry to keep it for their own uses and for the future of what they saw \nas a Nazi world.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  In that film, American soldiers were shown in extreme danger to \nthemselves in great heroic acts to locate and save that artwork for \ngenerations to come. In fact, those particular survivors will be given \na Congressional Gold Medal for their work.\n  Another recent film, ``Woman in Gold,'' tells the story of Maria \nAltmann. It surrounds compensation for artwork stolen by the Nazis and \nhas been highlighted recently in the theatres.\n  Mrs. Altmann's effort to retrieve works by Gustav Klimt that the \nNazis had taken from her uncle in Austria in the thirties led to an \nimportant Supreme Court decision that held that the expropriation \nexception applied to claims arising prior to the FSIA's enactment in \n1976, which allowed Nazi-era victims to file suit for damages in \nFederal court.\n  It is critical to note that the bill sponsors worked with the \nConference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany to revise the \nNazi-era exception to ensure that it was broad enough to be a \nmeaningful exception. As a result, the conference has stated, for \nitself and for the American Jewish community, that it will not oppose \nthe bill.\n  I also note that all of the FSIA's other exceptions to sovereign \nimmunity remain available to potential plaintiffs with claims \nconcerning the ownership of cultural property.\n  In particular, I note this bill does nothing to affect the attempts \nof Chabad to seek enforcement of its 2011 judgment against Russia, both \nbecause such judgment would predate the effective date of this bill and \nbecause it was not predicated on the loan of any artwork to the U.S., \nmeaning this bill would not have any effect in that case even if it had \nbeen in effect in 2011.\n  To the extent it may be necessary, I would encourage consideration of \nadding clarifying language that this bill\n\n[[Page H3958]]\n\ndoes nothing to affect enforcement of an already entered judgment.\n  H.R. 89 is narrowly tailored to ensure that it provides for just \nenough immunity to encourage foreign states to lend their cultural \nproperty to American museums and universities, accordingly, then, to \nthe American people, young people and older, for temporary exhibits and \ndisplays without protecting more than we intend to protect.\n  The bill ensures that works that have already been granted immunity \nfrom seizure by the President, pursuant to the Immunity from Seizure \nAct, are also immune from suits for damages, which is in keeping with \nthe act's purpose in encouraging foreign countries to lend their works \nto American institutions without fear of litigation based on the act of \nlending these works.\n  In essence, if you believe in art, you like art, you think people \nshould see art, and you like your museums, you ought to be for this \nbill. That is why I thank Representative Steve Chabot, Judiciary \nCommittee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and Ranking Member John Conyers for \ntheir leadership on this issue and for allowing me to manage this time \nand be part of this initiative.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield as much time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), who is the chief sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by thanking Chairman \nGoodlatte, Ranking Member Conyers, and also Mr. Cohen of Tennessee for \ntheir leadership in cosponsoring this legislation.\n  As Mr. Cohen had mentioned earlier, he and I have found a number of \npieces of legislation which we have been able to support together in a \nbipartisan manner, such as the Delta Queen, which we are still working \non. I would like to think that we can look forward to other pieces of \nlegislation down the road to work together on, again in a bipartisan \nmanner. There is a lot better chance you can get things accomplished in \nthis House if you do that. He has reached out, and I certainly \nappreciate that.\n  H.R. 889, which I authored, is simple, straightforward legislation \nthat restores American museums the protections of the Immunities from \nSeizures Act and clarifies the relationship that that act and the \nForeign Sovereign Immunities Act share. This bill would revise existing \nlaw to clarify that the temporary importation of artwork is not legally \nconsidered commercial activity and assure foreign government lenders \nthat if they are granted immunity from seizures, their loan of artwork \nand artifacts will not subject them to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts \nand lawsuits and disputes about that property, so that it is much more \nlikely that they will allow their artifacts and artworks to come here \nand then be enjoyed by the American public.\n  Furthermore, it is important to note that the immunity provided under \nthis bill does not apply to artwork taken in violation of international \nlaw, as was already mentioned by both Mr. Goodlatte and Mr. Cohen, in \nparticular, to those pieces of art seized during World War II by the \nNazi government or by the Nazi government's allies or impact ongoing \ncases to get the Russians to return a collection of sacred Jewish books \nand manuscripts claimed by the Chabad movement.\n  By enacting the Immunity from Seizure Act, Congress recognized that \ncultural exchanges produce substantial benefits for the United States, \nboth artistically and diplomatically. Foreign lending has and should \ncontinue to aid cultural understanding and increase public exposure to \narcheological artifacts.\n  However, for artwork and cultural objects owned by foreign \ngovernments, the intent of the Immunity from Seizure Act is being \nfrustrated by the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act. Some \ninterpretations of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act have exposed \nforeign governments to the jurisdiction of U.S. courts based solely \nupon the temporary importation into the U.S. of foreign-government-\nowned artwork. According to the American Association of Museum \nDirectors, this has led, on several occasions, to foreign governments \ndeclining to exchange artwork and cultural objects with the United \nStates for temporary exhibits.\n  In a recent survey of 38 museums across the U.S., it was found that, \nover the past 5 years, these museums had 1,000 pieces denied to \nshowcase here in the United States for very questionable reasons. These \nwere works that museum curators reasonably believed would be loaned to \ntheir museum for special exhibits. Therefore, in order to continue the \nexchange of foreign-government-owned art and reaffirm our country's \ncommitment to the promotion of foreign lending to American museums, \nCongress needs to clarify the relationship between the two acts I \nalready referred to: the Immunity from Seizure Act and the Foreign \nSovereign Immunities Act. That is what this legislation does.\n  This is a relatively minor change to the law, but it will provide \nenormous cultural benefits by ensuring that museums, like the \nCincinnati Museum Center and the Cincinnati Art Museum and other \nsimilar museums throughout the State of Ohio and across the country, \nmay continue to present first-class exhibits that educate the public on \ncultural heritage and artwork from all over the globe. Through \nenactment of this legislation, we can secure foreign lending to \nAmerican museums and ensure that foreign art lenders are not entangled \nin unnecessary litigation.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation is supported by the Association of Art \nMuseum Directors, which represents 240 museums, including the \nSmithsonian and several within my district and all across the country.\n  Last Congress, this body showed overwhelming support for this bill, \nand I urge my colleagues to support this legislation once again. I also \nurge our colleagues in the other body to swiftly move similar \nlegislation through their Chamber. Again I thank Chairman Goodlatte and \nRanking Member Conyers and Mr. Cohen for their support.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member of the Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations Subcommittee of the Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank Mr. Goodlatte, Mr. Chabot, \nand Mr. Cohen for their great work on this instructive legislation. My \nappreciation for the Judiciary Committee is how we clarify the law, and \nin this instance the subcommittee has brought two conflicting legal \ntenets as relate to statutes and clarified them. So I want to celebrate \nit because it is directly impacting on the Nation's museums and \neducational institutions. Let me cite some in my congressional \ndistrict.\n  Texas Southern University has an African American history museum. It \nis a beautiful display. This legislation will allow a small entity that \ncould not stand under a lawsuit to be able to secure international \ngifts which they have received without the burden of litigation.\n  In the early stages of my career in Congress, I represented, \nextensively, Houston's museum district: the Museum of Foreign Arts, \nwith an outstanding curator, museum director; the Children's Museum; \nthe Health Museum; and the Museum of Natural Science. All of those have \nthe tendency to receive these international gifts and also be \nsubjected, potentially, because of the conflict to seizure.\n  In particular, I remember working with the Museum of Fine Arts, maybe \none of my greatest early opportunities of service, and to help them \nbring the Russian jewels to Houston, Texas. It was a long, long \njourney, not because of the distance but because of the conflicting \nlaws and the entanglement of imports and protection of the jewels. I \nremember being at the dock receiving those jewels after a long wait. \nJust imagine if there had been this potential of seizure, which there \nwas, but that there was the glaring opportunity there for seizure and \nit had occurred. What would have happened to this great art exchange \nand, as well, to what we were doing in Houston?\n  Let me close by saying, Mr. Speaker, I want to support this bill \nextensively, and it will help all of these institutions across America.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 889, the ``Foreign \nCultural Exchange Jurisdictional Immunity Clarification Act.''\n  H.R. 889 makes a modest but important amendment to the \n``expropriation exception'' of the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of \n1976. Specifically, it ensures that foreign states are immune from \nsuits for damages concerning\n\n[[Page H3959]]\n\nthe ownership of cultural property when: that property is in the United \nStates pursuant to an agreement between the foreign state and the U.S. \nor a U.S.-based cultural or educational institution; the President has \ngranted the work at issue immunity from seizure pursuant to the \nImmunity from Seizure Act; and the President's grant of immunity from \nseizure is published in the Federal Register.\n  The expropriation exception remains available to all claims \nconcerning misappropriated cultural property to which these factual \ncircumstances do not apply.\n  I would not support this bill if it did not contain a sufficient \nexception for claims arising from artwork stolen by the Nazis, their \nallies, and their affiliates.\n  H.R. 889 has just such an exception, ensuring that victims of Nazi \nart theft continue to have the opportunity to pursue justice in court.\n  This exception is appropriate in light of the sheer scale and the \nparticularly concerted efforts of the Nazis to seize artwork and other \ncultural property from their victims.\n  The particular sensitivity surrounding compensation for artwork \nstolen by the Nazis has been highlighted in recent months by the motion \npicture Woman in Gold, which tells the story of Maria Altmann.\n  Mrs. Altmann's efforts to retrieve works by Gustav Klimt that the \nNazis had taken from uncle in Austria in the 1930's led to an important \nSupreme Court decision that held that the expropriation exception \napplied to claims arising prior to the FSIA's enactment in 1976, which \nallowed Nazi-era victims to file suit for damages in federal court.\n  It is also critical to note that the bill's sponsors worked with the \nConference on Jewish Material Claims Against Germany to revise the \nNazi-era exception to ensure that it was broad enough to be a \nmeaningful exception.\n  As a result, the Conference has stated, for itself and for the \nAmerican Jewish Committee, that it will not oppose this bill.\n  I also note that all of the FSIA's other exceptions to sovereign \nimmunity remain available to potential plaintiffs with claims \nconcerning the ownership of cultural property.\n  In particular, I note that this bill does nothing to affect the \nattempts by Chabad to seek enforcement of its 2011 judgment against \nRussia, both because such judgment would pre-date the effective date of \nthis bill and because it was not predicated on the loan of any artwork \nto the U.S., meaning that this bill would not effect that case even if \nit had been in effect in 2011.\n  To the extent it may be necessary, I would encourage consideration of \nadding clarifying language that this bill does nothing to affect \nenforcement of an already-entered judgment.\n  H.R. 889 is narrowly tailored to ensure that it provides for just \nenough immunity to encourage foreign states to lend their cultural \nproperty to American museums and universities for temporary exhibits \nand displays without protecting more than we intend to protect.\n  I recognize that some people may instinctively recoil at the idea of \nany bill that grants any level of immunity to a foreign state when \nownership of a work of art or other cultural object is at issue.\n  But I would not support a bill that foreclosed all possibility of \nredress for such people.\n  And, H.R. 889 does not do that.\n  It simply ensures that works that have already been granted immunity \nfrom seizure by the President pursuant to the Immunity from Seizure Act \nare also immune from suits for damages, which is in keeping with the \nAct's purpose of encouraging foreign countries to lend their works to \nAmerican institutions without fear of litigation based on the act of \nlending those works.\n  I thank Representative Steve Chabot, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob \nGoodlatte, and Committee Ranking Member John Conyers, Jr. for their \nleadership on this issue and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further requests for time, but I \nwould like to recognize Lafayette and Washington. The Hermione, the \nboat that brought Lafayette to Washington, a replica thereof, has just \ncome to Virginia, and there is a recognition of that at Mount Vernon \ntonight. I think we should recognize their portraits here. They helped \nthis country become free from the shackles of Great Britain and become \nthe great country we are.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 889.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3959-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3959-H3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               SUPPORTING LOCAL LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and agree to \nthe resolution (H. Res. 295) supporting local law enforcement agencies \nin their continued work to serve our communities, and supporting their \nuse of body worn cameras to promote transparency to protect both \ncitizens and officers alike.\n  The Clerk read the title of the resolution.\n  The text of the resolution is as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 295\n\n       Whereas the United States Department of Justice issued a \n     report titled, ``Police Officer Body-Worn Cameras'', which \n     details a number of benefits of body-worn cameras, \n     including--\n       (1) increased transparency and citizen views of police \n     legitimacy;\n       (2) improved behavior and civility among both police \n     officers and citizens; and\n       (3) increased evidentiary benefits that expedite resolution \n     of citizen complaints or lawsuits and improving evidence for \n     arrest and prosecution; and\n       Whereas the University of Cambridge's Institute of \n     Criminology conducted a 12-month study on the use of body-\n     worn cameras used by law enforcement in the United Kingdom \n     and estimated that the cameras led to a 50 percent reduction \n     in use of force, and in addition, complaints against police \n     fell approximately by 90 percent: Now, therefore, be it\n       Resolved, That the House of Representatives--\n       (1) recognizes all law enforcement agencies and officers \n     for their tireless work to protect us and make our \n     communities safer;\n       (2) recognizes the potential for the use of body-worn \n     cameras by on-duty law enforcement officers to improve \n     community relations, increase transparency, and protect both \n     citizens and police; and\n       (3) encourages State and local law enforcement agencies to \n     consider the use of body-worn cameras, including policies and \n     protocols to handle privacy, storage, and other relevant \n     concerns.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson \nLee) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H. Res. 295, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would like to begin by thanking the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al \nGreen) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) for introducing \nthis resolution and commend them for their work on this important \nissue.\n  Policing is an inherently dangerous job. Our law enforcement officers \ndeserve our gratitude for the work they do on a daily basis to make \nsure that our streets are safe, the most helpless in our communities \nare protected, and those who commit crimes are brought to justice.\n  I am very concerned that force is used appropriately and that police \nofficers are taking appropriate steps to protect innocent civilians \nwhen they make encounters. There is increasing unrest in our urban \ncommunities about policing.\n  I am also concerned with the repeated targeting of our police and law \nenforcement personnel. Last week, a terror suspect believed to be \nplotting to behead a Boston officer was killed in a confrontation with \nBoston police. Last month, two police officers were killed by criminals \nhoping to become cop killers. Officers Dean and Tate, responding to a \nroutine traffic stop in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, were gunned down by a \ngroup of five men.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  This comes on the heels of more widely known murders last year of \nOfficers Ramos and Liu in New York, who were reportedly targeted by a \nman looking to kill a police officer.\n  It is clear that we must find a better way for our police and \ncitizens to interact both in everyday situations and when more \ndifficult circumstances\n\n[[Page H3960]]\n\narise. In May, the Judiciary Committee held a very informative and \nproductive hearing on policing in the 21st Century, where we looked at \nmany of these issues, including the use of body-worn cameras by police \nofficers.\n  Body-worn cameras present an opportunity to strengthen police and \ncitizens' interactions, but there are many issues surrounding the use \nof body-worn cameras that should be addressed by legislators, law \nenforcement, and the general public before Congress or State \nlegislatures mandate widespread use of this technology.\n  We must be cognizant of the cost and resources associated not just \nwith outfitting officers with body-worn cameras, but with the \nregulations, training, and compliance associated with their use. We \nshould also be aware of the costs and privacy implications associated \nwith storing the footage of body-worn cameras.\n  Police routinely interact with crime victims, including minors, and \nmembers of the general public. Would all of these interactions be \nrecorded and stored by law enforcement agencies? For how long? Who \nwould have access to this information? For instance, could it be \nobtained in a civil suit, a divorce or custody case, or as part of a \nFreedom of Information Act request?\n  If an officer exercises his or her discretion to turn off a camera, \nit is possible the courts would impose an adverse inference against the \ngovernment if a defendant then argued that something improper happened \nwhile the camera was not filming. The courts could also impose an \nadverse inference if there is a technical or storage glitch that \ninterferes with taping or access to the video.\n  Society must also decide if it wants this technology recording us on \na constant basis. Last week, the President signed the House-passed USA \nFREEDOM Act into law, which ended bulk metadata collection by the NSA.\n  We should exercise caution before mandating use of a technology that \nhas the potential to gather and store information about Americans, many \nof them innocent civilians, based simply on a person's interaction with \na police officer.\n  Body-worn police cameras can serve an important purpose in improving \ninteractions between law enforcement and the general public and be a \nvaluable source of evidence of wrongdoing; but we, as lawmakers and as \na society, must ensure that this technology is used appropriately.\n  We have achieved this before when addressing the use of police \ndashboard cameras, but we must now do so again in a situation that is \npotentially much more intrusive.\n  Several police departments have already begun using body-worn \ncameras, and various pilot programs are also underway. Their successes \nand pitfalls will be instructive as we explore expanded use of this \ntechnology.\n  I once again thank the gentleman from Texas for his work on this \nresolution and also applaud the work of our law enforcement officers \nnationwide.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today to support this resolution and to thank my colleagues \nfor putting forward H. Res. 295, particularly Mr. Al Green of Texas and \nMr. Clay and Mr. Cleaver--both of whom represent the Missouri area--and \na number of other Members who have joined in on sponsoring this \nlegislation.\n  I like this because it is a kick-start to what Members of Congress, \nMr. Speaker, have been talking about, and what we have talked about, \ncriminal justice reform.\n  As we well know, we in the Judiciary Committee are receiving \ninformation. We are listening to Members; we are obviously listening to \nMembers who are committed and dedicated, and we are committed to \ncriminal justice reform.\n  This is the right kind of kick-start to be able to put on minds of \nindividuals that we know that this effort of criminal justice reform \nrequires the communication and cooperation of our law enforcement \nofficers and as well to recognize the vitality and the importance of \ncommunities who have argued Black lives matter--or they have just \nargued that lives matter, which they do.\n  Let me, first of all, join Mr. Goodlatte on acknowledging the tragedy \nof police shootings. Whether or not it was the heinous shootings in New \nYork on two occasions and probably more or whether or not it was a \nrecent incident in Houston, Texas, when a valiant officer was mowed \ndown by a fleeing felon, or any number of incidents that have caught \nour men and women in the line of fire--and their families have seen \ntheir service, their life, and their contributions snuffed out by \nviolence--that is not something that we applaud and we certainly abhor.\n  I believe the language in this resolution gives us the sense of \nCongress that allows us to recognize all law enforcement agencies and \nofficers, thanking them for their tireless work to protect us and make \nour communities safer, and recognize the potential for the use of body-\nworn cameras by on-duty law enforcement officers, to improve community \nrelations, increase transparency, and protect both citizens and police.\n  I will assure you that the Judiciary Committee will thoughtfully look \nat legislation that fits squarely on the framework of this taking into \nconsideration many concerns and encourages State and local law \nenforcement agencies to consider the use of body-worn cameras, \nincluding policies and protocols, to handle privacy, storage, and other \nrelevant issues.\n  I am glad those are recognized because we are a country of laws, and \nwe recognize the civil liberties and civil rights of all citizens.\n  As we discuss this legislation, however, I want to emphasize the \nimportance of the timing. It is time for comprehensive policing and \ncriminal justice reform. We are witnessing a sea change unlike many \nothers with support for this great cause spanning the ideological and \nparty divide. We in the Judiciary Committee have spoken about it and \nare finding common ways to work together.\n  In the area of policing, the problems revealed by several of the more \nnotorious incidents involving the use of lethal force against unarmed \ncitizens have captured the attention of the Nation over the past few \nmonths and demonstrates a critical need for a national response.\n  Law enforcement officers individually will indicate training is a key \nelement of this. Any response to these tragic events must go hand in \nhand with a holistic view of criminal justice reform. It will do us no \ngood to be able to point at one group and not try to help another, so I \nam very grateful that my State, the State of Texas, has contributed to \nthis dialogue and most recently in grand jury reform.\n  As I have joined with my colleagues to acknowledge and celebrate law \nenforcement and encourage the move forward on criminal justice reform, \nI am grateful to again do it today, but we should also look at a vast \narray of opportunities.\n  Sentencing and prison reform should be on our agenda. One such \nproposal would give the Federal Bureau of Prisons the discretion to \nrelease nonviolent prisoners who served at least half of their \nsentence, are 45 or more years old, and who have not been disciplined \nfor a violent offense. This would not only alleviate some prison \novercrowding, but it would dip into the $75 billion that we are paying \nfor incarceration.\n  Congress should also look at the fact in the Federal system that \nright now we give 47 days for 54 days of good time. If we did one for \none, it would be an opportunity to save millions of dollars, at least \n$41 million; and 4,000 persons would be able to be lifted who would be \nable to be rehabilitated.\n  One of the more difficult parts of coming into the criminal justice \nsystem is the journey of coming out of it. Where an individual has paid \nhis or her debt, the process of reentering society is paid with \ntremendous and often insurmountable obstacles.\n  I have drafted legislation that will allow those with a criminal \nconviction to have a fair chance to compete for jobs with Federal \nagencies and contractors. This ``ban the box'' measure delays a \npotential employer's inquiry into the applicant's criminal history \nuntil later in the hiring process. Employers can still ask, but pushing \nthe inquiry into a later stage in the process where you have seen \nwhether this person is ready and able to have a job.\n  Again, this resolution speaks about our view and affection for our \nlaw enforcement and adding more tools. Each of us have had wonderful \nexperiences with those men and women who serve.\n\n[[Page H3961]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, the time for comprehensive policing and criminal justice \nreform has arrived. We are witnessing a sea shift unlike any others, \nwith support for this great cause spanning the ideological and party \ndivide.\n  In the area of policing, the problems revealed by several of the more \nnotorious incidents involving the use of lethal force against unarmed \ncitizens has captured the attention of the nation over the past few \nmonths and demonstrates the critical need for a national response.\n  And any response to these tragic events must go hand-in-hand with \nchanges to the entirety of our criminal justice system.\n  As a member of the House Judiciary Committee; as the ranking member \nof the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations; and as a Representative from Houston, let me extend my \nthanks to the Congressman from my home state of Texas for contributing \nto the discussion of this very important and timely issue.\n  Just as I have joined with him in Houston before--to acknowledge and \ncelebrate law enforcement and to encourage and move forward criminal \njustice reform--I am grateful to do so again today.\n  The very fact that this measure is on the floor today is a great \nindicator that Congress is ready for comprehensive criminal justice and \npolicing reform.\n  This is why I am looking at reforms that will address all aspects of \nour criminal justice system and drafting legislation accordingly.\n  One such proposal would give the Bureau of Prisons discretion to \nrelease nonviolent prisoners who have served at least half their \nsentence, are 45 or more years old, and who have not been disciplined \nfor violent conduct while in prison.\n  This would would not only alleviate some prison over-crowding, it \nwould result in substantial cost savings by removing the expensive \nmedical care for older prisoners.\n  By including a clarification of the federal prisoner good time credit \nlaw, the cost savings of this proposal is even more significant. \nCongress intended for all federal prisoners to be eligible for 54 days \nof good time credit, not 47 days as currently interpreted by the \nFederal Bureau of Prisons.\n  This small change--just one week per year--will not only reflect our \noriginal intent, it will save at least $41 million annually.\n  One of the most difficult parts of coming into the criminal justice \nsystem is the journey of coming out of it.\n  For an individual who has paid his or her debt, the process of re-\nentering society is paved with tremendous, and often insurmountable, \nobstacles.\n  I have drafted legislation that will allow those with a criminal \nconviction to have a fair chance to compete for jobs with federal \nagencies and contractors. This ``ban-the-box'' measure delays a \npotential employer's inquiry into the applicant's criminal history \nuntil later in the hiring process.\n  Employers can still ask--but pushing the inquiry until a later stage \nin the process allows applicants to get a foot in the door and be \nconsidered at the early stage on their merits alone.\n  Many studies, including one released by the Journal of Adolescent \nHealth, demonstrate that the adolescent brain continues to develop as \nyoung persons mature well into their 20s. Yet, we begin holding our \nyoung offenders accountable as adults when they reach the age of 18, \n16, and sometimes even earlier. And we send them off to what many \ndescribe as ``criminal college.''\n  This is why I am developing legislation that will provide judges with \nnew and different options when a young offender comes before them. \nThese options will give judges discretion to tailor a punishment to \nthat young offender's needs.\n  And, when sending a young offender to prison is necessary, my \nlegislation will ensure that the Bureau of Prisons separates these \nyoung offenders out from the rest of the prison population and provides \nspecialized programs for their needs. This will put young offenders on \na path for change, not one of crime.\n  It is not enough to improve the system of criminal justice, we must \nalso address the unnecessary loss of life that can result from police \nand civilian interactions. Reform must take a step towards increasing \ntrust between our communities and law enforcement.\n  This is why I am developing legislation that will provide law \nenforcement agencies with the funding and assistance to put in place \nthe policies, protocols, and training programs in accord with national \naccreditation standards.\n  But rebuilding the trust in this relationship also requires greater \ntransparency when government responds to incidents involving the use of \nlethal force against unarmed citizens.\n  This is why I have drafted legislation that provides incentives and \nsupport for jurisdictions to bring in an independent investigation and \nprosecution team for an unbiased review of such incidents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time on this debate.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure at this time to yield \n5 minutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), the \nauthor of this legislation.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, it is always an honor to stand in \nthe well of the House and have an opportunity to advocate on behalf of \nthe constituents of the Ninth Congressional District. Today is no \nexception.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to stand here in support of bipartisan \nlegislation, legislation that encourages law enforcement to use body \ncameras. This legislation is legislation that I am proud to say has \nreceived a good deal of support and a good deal of consideration and \ndeliberation.\n  I would like to thank the Speaker of the House, Mr. Boehner, for his \nassistance in bringing this legislation forward. Of course, the \nHonorable Nancy Pelosi must be given kudos as well. I thank her for \nallowing the legislation to come forward and assisting.\n  The Democratic whip, Mr. Hoyer, I want to thank him because we had a \nconversation concerning this legislation. Of course, the chairperson of \nthe Judiciary Committee, the Honorable Bob Goodlatte, he and I have had \nan opportunity to talk through this legislation, and I am eternally \ngrateful for the consideration that you have given, sir, and I thank \nyou.\n  I also would like to thank the dean of the House of Representatives, \nthe Honorable John Conyers. He has been here on so many occasions when \nlegislation that is exceedingly important has been passed upon and has \nbeen a voice, a voice on all of these issues through the years. I am \nproud to say that I had an opportunity to speak to him about this \nlegislation.\n  Of course, I want to thank Mr. Ted Poe of Texas. He and I came to \nCongress together, and we worked together. This is a piece of \nlegislation that he was the first to sign onto, H. Res. 295.\n  Mr. Emanuel Cleaver of Missouri, he and I have worked together to \nshepherd this from the very beginning, and he is still a part of it. He \nis not here tonight, but he is with us on this legislation. I am proud \nto say he is a friend, and he has been a partner throughout the effort \nto bring this legislation to the floor of the House.\n  Mr. Luetkemeyer, he has been a friend in this; Mr. Clay of Missouri; \nMr. Yoder of Kansas; and, of course, Ms. Clarke of New York--all \nfriends and all supportive of this resolution.\n  Mr. Speaker, this resolution, as has been indicated, is the \nbeginning. I don't see it as the end of a process. I see it as more of \na preamble with the Constitution to follow. I see it as a lawyer might \nsee an opening statement with the closing statement yet to come.\n  Of course, as a Christian, I see it as a part of Genesis, with many \nrevelations yet to come. It is a good first step, and it is a good step \nin the right direction. I don't see it as the end of the process, but I \ndo want to commend and thank those who have helped us to get to this \npoint.\n  I would cite now, if I may, a Justice Department report. This report \nstyled ``Police Officer Body-Worn Cameras'' found that body-worn \ncameras increased transparency. People have the opportunity to see what \nactually took place. It makes a difference because this will increase \npolice legitimacy.\n  Officers don't have to get into disputes about what actually \noccurred. The empirical evidence is there by way of the camera's eye.\n  It will improve citizen and police behavior. Once the camera is on \nand once people know that it is on--that is both citizens and police \nofficers--their behavior tends to be adjusted such that we get better \nresults.\n  It will improve effective prosecution. This is evidence that can be \nintroduced into court. When it is introduced, it can help effectuate \npositive results.\n  Another study, a study from the University of Cambridge, its \nInstitute of Criminology, after a 12-month study, found a 50 percent \nreduction in the use of force as a result of body cameras, a 50 percent \nreduction in use of force, a 90 percent reduction in complaints against \npolice officers as a result of body cameras being utilized.\n  Of course, there is a final study that I will cite in Rialto, \nCalifornia. This\n\n[[Page H3962]]\n\nreport from Rialto, California, indicates that, after 1 year of use of \nbody cameras, there was a 60 percent reduction in the use of force and \nan 88 percent reduction in complaints against police officers.\n  The evidence is in. It is clear that these body cameras do provide an \nopportunity for us to have the transparency we need, for us to provide \nlegitimacy for both police officers and citizenry but, more \nimportantly, to reduce the complaints that we see emanating from scenes \nthat are disputed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield the gentleman an additional 2 minutes.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as I indicated, we see a \nreduction in complaints. As we view the many incidents that have \noccurred around the country, there is no question that there is a \ndivide. I believe that these body cameras can span the chasm across the \ndivide and make a difference in the perception that we have in the way \nour police and our communities interact with each other.\n  I am proud to be a sponsor, and I am proud to have the cosponsors \nthat we have. I am proud that the chairperson of the Judiciary \nCommittee has signed onto this and that the ranking member of the \nJudiciary Committee is on board.\n  I want to thank my colleague from Houston, Texas, the Honorable \nSheila Jackson Lee, who has served on the Judiciary Committee for many, \nmany years, and I am most appreciative that she, too, finds favor with \nthis piece of legislation. I am honored that she is on the floor \ntonight to shepherd it through, and I pray that my colleagues all will \nsupport what I believe to be a piece of legislation that can span the \nchasm between the police and the community in a most positive way.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I have no speakers remaining, and I am \nprepared to yield back.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume as I am the final speaker.\n  First of all, I thank the gentleman from Texas for his very eloquent \nexplanation of this legislation. Let me add my appreciation as well to \nChairman Goodlatte, to Ranking Member Conyers, and to Chairman \nSensenbrenner. It is certainly my pleasure to manage and to work with \nthis legislation, in the purpose of this legislation.\n  I close with just a few points that I feel compelled to comment on. \nAs I do so, I am not giving all of the names of those fallen. As I have \nindicated, we tragically buried an HPD officer just a couple of weeks \nago and, of course, officers in Mississippi, officers in New Mexico, in \nOmaha, Nebraska, and in Pennsylvania, among others. We recognize that \nwe are challenged and that we must find that common ground. Again, I \nnote that this kick start will help us to look at comprehensive \ncriminal justice reform.\n  Let me just add one last point on the young offenders issue that may \nbe somewhat similar to the video that has now imploded across the \nairwaves of America in McKinney, Texas. One study dealing with young \noffenders or individual adolescents includes a report by the Journal of \nAdolescent Health which demonstrates that the adolescent brain \ncontinues to develop as young persons mature well into their twenties; \nyet we begin holding our young offenders accountable as adults when \nthey reach the age of 18 and sometimes earlier, and we send them off to \nwhat many describe as a criminal college. So I am hoping that we will \nhave legislation that can address by science the concept, if you will, \nof how we treat those from 18 to 24.\n  This legislation allows us to build on policing and community trust. \nI am looking forward to working with law enforcement agencies with the \nfunding and assistance to put in place the policies and protocols \ndealing with training, deescalation, accreditation. That is, of course, \nsomething that we hope to be working on with the full Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  There are some stark differences of treatment between two cities--the \ncity of Charleston, South Carolina, where a tragic incident occurred \nand where the city responded immediately, and the city of Cleveland, \nwhere a tragic incident occurred and where the city did not respond \nimmediately.\n  Then, this past weekend, we saw confusing footage, I think, that \ndealt with teenagers at a pool party. We know that police were called. \nWe know that this party was, really, a party of girls who happened to \nbe African American, and we understand that some boys, who tend to like \nto find girls, came and may have caused somewhat of a disturbance. The \nreason I think it is important as we discuss this legislation is that \nthe bill does indicate our appreciation for law enforcement. My words \nsay that this will allow us to kick-start and look at issues where we \ncan work together to get along. But as the video indicates, we see a \nscattering of young people, and we see a number of foul-mouthed \ncomments being made coming from one particular officer. They are quotes \nI will not offer to repeat on this floor.\n  I submit for the Record, Mr. Speaker, an article from The Atlantic \nas, I think, this is a testament to how we can work to avoid this kind \nof public incident.\n\n                   [From the Atlantic, June 8, 2015]\n\n                          (By Yoni Appelbaum)\n\n       On Friday, a large group of teens gathered for a pool party \n     in the city of McKinney, Texas. Shortly thereafter, someone \n     called the police. And by Sunday night, as footage of the \n     police response spread across the internet, the McKinney \n     Police Department announced it was placing Eric Casebolt, the \n     patrol supervisor shown in the video, on administrative \n     leave.\n       It is the latest in a string of incidents of police using \n     apparently excessive force against African Americans that has \n     captured public attention. And it took place at a communal \n     pool--where, for more than a century, conflicts over race and \n     class have often surfaced.\n       The video shows a foul-mouthed police corporal telling the \n     young men he encounters to get down, and the young women to \n     take off, although far more obscenely. When several seated \n     young men appear to ask, politely, for permission to leave, \n     he explodes at them: ``Don't make me fucking run around here \n     with thirty pounds of goddamn gear in the sun because you \n     want to screw around out here.'' The corporal was white. The \n     young people he detained were, almost without exception, \n     black.\n       The video next shows him repeatedly cursing at a group of \n     young women, telling them to move on. Then he wrestles one to \n     the ground. As bystanders react in horror, and several rush \n     toward the young woman as if to her assistance, he draws his \n     sidearm. They flee. He returns to the teenager, wrestles her \n     back down, forces her face into the ground, and places both \n     knees on her back.\n       The McKinney police said, in a statement, that they were \n     called to respond to the Craig Ranch North Community Pool for \n     a report of ``a disturbance involving multiple juveniles at \n     the location, who do not live in the area or have permission \n     to be there, refusing to leave.'' They added that additional \n     calls reported fighting, and that when the crowd refused to \n     comply with the first responding officers, nine additional \n     units were deployed.\n       The mayor, Brian Loughmiller, described himself as \n     ``disturbed and concerned,'' and the police chief vowed ``a \n     complete, and thorough, investigation.''\n       Like many flourishing American suburbs, McKinney has \n     struggled with questions of equity and diversity. The city is \n     among the fastest-growing in America, and its residents hail \n     from a wide range of backgrounds. Formal, legal segregation \n     is a thing of the past. Yet stark divides persist.\n       In 2009, McKinney was forced to settle a lawsuit alleging \n     that it was blocking the development of affordable housing \n     suitable for tenants with Section 8 vouchers in the more \n     affluent western portion of the city. East of Highway 75, \n     according to the lawsuit, McKinney is 49 percent white; to \n     its west, McKinney is 86 percent white. The plaintiffs \n     alleged that the city and its housing authority were \n     ``willing to negotiate for and provide low-income housing \n     units in east McKinney, but not west McKinney, which amounts \n     to illegal racial steering.''\n       All three of the city's public pools lie to the east of \n     Highway 75. Craig Ranch, where the pool party took place, \n     lies well to its west. BuzzFeed reports that the fight broke \n     out when an adult woman told the teens to go back to \n     ``Section 8 housing.''\n       Craig Ranch North is the oldest residential portion of a \n     2,200 acre master-planned community. ``The neighborhood is \n     made up of single-family homes,'' says the developer's \n     website, ``and includes a community center with two pools, a \n     park and a playground.'' Private developments like Craig \n     Ranch now routinely include pools, often paid for by dues to \n     homeowners' associations, and governed by their rules. But \n     that, in itself, represents a remarkable shift.\n       At their inception, communal swimming pools were public, \n     egalitarian spaces. Most early public pools in America aimed \n     more for hygiene than relaxation, open on alternate days to \n     men and women. In the North, at least, they served bathers \n     without regard for race. But in the 1920s, as public swimming\n\n[[Page H3963]]\n\n     pools proliferated, they became sites of leisure and \n     recreation. Alarmed at the sight of women and men of \n     different races swimming together, public officials moved to \n     impose rigid segregation.\n       As African Americans fought for desegregation in the 1950s, \n     public pools became frequent battlefields. In Marshall, \n     Texas, for example, in 1957, a young man backed by the NAACP \n     sued to force the integration of a brand-new swimming pool. \n     When the judge made it clear the city would lose, citizens \n     voted 1,758-89 to have the city sell all of its recreational \n     facilities rather than integrate them. The pool was sold to a \n     local Lions' Club, which was able to operate it as a whites-\n     only private facility.\n       The decisions of other communities were rarely so \n     transparent, but the trend was unmistakable. Before 1950, \n     Americans went swimming as often as they went to the movies, \n     but they did so in public pools. There were relatively few \n     club pools, and private pools were markers of extraordinary \n     wealth. Over the next half-century, though, the number of \n     private in-ground pools increased from roughly 2,500 to more \n     than four million. The declining cost of pool construction, \n     improved technology, and suburbanization all played important \n     roles. But then, so did desegregation. As historian Jeff \n     Wiltse argues in his 2007 book, Contested Waters: A Social \n     History of Swimming Pools in America:\n       Although many whites abandoned desegregated public pools, \n     most did not stop swimming. Instead, they built private \n     pools, both club and residential, and swam in them. . . . \n     Suburbanites organized private club pools rather than fund \n     public pools because club pools enabled them to control the \n     class and racial composition of swimmers, whereas public \n     pools did not.\n       Today, that complicated legacy persists across the United \n     States. The public pools of mid-century--with their sandy \n     beaches, manicured lawns, and well-tended facilities--are \n     vanishingly rare. Those sorts of amenities are now generally \n     found behind closed gates, funded by club fees or homeowners' \n     dues, and not by tax dollars. And they are open to those who \n     can afford to live in such subdivisions, but not to their \n     neighbors just down the road.\n       Whatever took place in McKinney on Friday, it occurred \n     against this backdrop of the privatization of once-public \n     facilities, giving residents the expectation of control over \n     who sunbathes or doggie-paddles alongside them. Even if some \n     of the teens were residents, and others possessed valid guest \n     passes, as some insisted they did, the presence of ``multiple \n     juveniles . . . who do not live in the area'' clearly \n     triggered alarm. Several adults at the pool reportedly placed \n     calls to the police. And none of the adult residents shown in \n     the video appeared to manifest concern that the police \n     response had gone too far, nor that its violence was \n     disproportionate to the alleged offense.\n       To the contrary. Someone placed a sign by the pool on \n     Sunday afternoon. It read, simply: ``Thank you McKinney \n     Police for keeping us safe.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is not dealing with a vast group \nof protesters, which, ultimately, did occur in the last 24 hours in \nthat area. This is dealing with youngsters. Many of us raise children \nand send them to pools and various camps, and we hope they will be \nwell, but this is understanding the whole level of law enforcement. \nAgain, I believe it is time for the Congress to re-create the criminal \njustice system.\n  Juveniles are naturally fearful of authority and lack maturity when \nfaced with fearful events. Running is the natural instinct of most \nyouth, and in this case, the youth attempted to leave when the police \napproached to disperse the crowd. Then the police chased, shooting a \nTaser. When the officer confronted the young girl with aggression, \nother youth attempted to help her--that is, teenagers--who were also \nthreatened with force by the officers. These children received mixed \nmessages. Establishing trusting relationships between youth and police \nofficers is of the utmost responsibility.\n  What I would say is that the outrage and the expressions of a \ncommunity and parents came about because we were not talking to each \nother, because actions did not track what those young people were doing \nin McKinney. They were being teenagers. They were running. They may \nhave had the incidences of misbehavior, and, frankly, they could have \nbeen handled in a way that the misbehavior could have been addressed.\n  Why now?\n  Again, I opened with the remarks that we now have an opportunity to \nkick-start this wonderful discussion of criminal justice reform. \nWonderful? Yes, because, in America, we are a nation of civilians and \nlaw. The civilian law enforcement is made up of those who implement \nthose laws, but the Constitution reigns as well. I look forward to \nworking with the chairman and the ranking member and all of the Members \nof this body and the Judiciary Committee for a very constructive \njourney on letting the American people know that we hear their pain, \nthat we respect those who uphold the law, and that we are going to work \nconstructively to do that.\n  I left Houston while talking to a police officer. I know he is not \nlistening, but let me just simply say thank you for the service that \nyou give. Hopefully, he will hear this and will know that we are \ncommitted to working together in this Congress. I ask my colleagues to \nsupport House Resolution 295.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Al Green) and the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Cleaver) \nfor their hard work on this, for coming to see me and others on our \nside of the aisle about this important issue, and for working with us \non getting the language straight in this resolution in order to make \nsure that we are properly encouraging this exploration while also \ntaking into account the issues that arise with the use of body cameras.\n  I want to thank the ranking member and the former chairman of the \nJudiciary Committee, Mr. Conyers, and the ranking member of the \nsubcommittee, Ms. Jackson Lee, for their work on this as well. I also \nwant to thank all of the staff involved.\n  This is an important issue, and it will help to inform us as we move \nahead on a number of issues related to criminal justice reform. I urge \nmy colleagues to support the resolution.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and agree to the resolution, H. Res. 295.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3963-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3963]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

To the \n     best of our knowledge and belief at this time, there is no \n     challenge to this election. The State of Mississippi does not \n     require nor receive ``unofficial results'' from all counties \n     and, at this time, we have only received unofficial results \n     from four (4) counties. The attached numbers were obtained \n     through The Daily Journal, Tupelo, Mississippi. The outcome \n     of the election does not appear in doubt and we anticipate \n     Mr. Trent Kelly will be certified.\n       The deadline for counties included in the First \n     Congressional District to transmit certified election results \n     to our office is 5:00 p.m. on June 12, 2015. As soon as the \n     official results are certified to this office by all counties \n     involved, an official Certificate of Election will be \n     prepared for transmittal as required by law.\n       If you have any questions or need additional information, \n     please call Kim Turner, Assistant Secretary of State at (601) \n     359-5137 or Amanda Frusha, Director of Elections Compliance \n     at (601) 359-5213.\n           Sincerely,\n                                         C.

Mr. Speaker, friends and colleagues, I \nhave the honor of welcoming the new representative from Mississippi's \nFirst Congressional District. For me, that means he will be \nrepresenting the neighboring district in the northeast corner of the \nState, which most of you are familiar with; but also, for others, this \nmeans that he will be representing the birthplace of Elvis Presley.\n  Trent Kelly is from the little-known town of Saltillo, Mississippi. \nThe local folk call it Salt-illo, population 3,393. He knows the \ndistrict well, having served as district attorney for the largest \njudicial district in that area. Representative Kelly has also served in \nour Nation's military and has spent 29 years in the Mississippi \nNational Guard.\n  Representative Kelly will be serving out the term of our dear former \ncolleague Alan Nunnelee, who passed away in February. As he steps into \nhis seat, we hope that he will follow Alan's example of service and \ndedication to the people of Mississippi.\n  Our colleague Gregg Harper will now join me in welcoming our friend \nfrom Lee County, Mississippi.\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, it is my great honor and pleasure to welcome \nthe newest Member of this body, Congressman Trent Kelly.\n  I am confident that Trent Kelly will carry on the legacy of his \npredecessor, our late colleague, Representative Alan Nunnelee, one of \nimpeccable constituent services and an unyielding commitment to this \ncountry and her citizens.\n  I look forward to working with Representative Kelly as he serves the \nFirst Congressional District and the people of the great State of \nMississippi.\n  Congressman, I am so honored to stand here and welcome you to the \nfloor of the House of Representatives.\n  Trent Kelly.\n  Mr. KELLY of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Thompson, \nCongressman Harper, and the rest of the Mississippi delegation; and, \nmost importantly, thank you, God.\n  I would also like to thank Senator Wicker and Senator Cochran, who \nare present.\n  Thank you to my family, which would include my mother and my wife and \nmy three children and my brother, who cannot be here.\n  Thank you to my friends who are in the gallery above.\n  Thank you to the citizens of the First Congressional District of \nMississippi and to my fellow Members.\n  I am humbled and honored to be able to serve this great Nation in \nthis capacity.\n  Thank you, and God bless you, each and every one.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3965-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H3965]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER\n\n  The SPEAKER.

When the Committee of the Whole rose earlier today, \nan amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Posey) had been \ndisposed of, and the bill had been read through page 156, line 15.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I yield to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen) for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. I thank the chairman for yielding, and I thank him \nfor his great work on this appropriations bill.\n  Madam Chairman, for over 20 years I have been a staunch advocate for \nreducing aircraft noise over northern New Jersey. I have attended \ndozens of public hearings and meetings with officials from the FAA and \nresponded to thousands of calls from constituents whose lives have been \naffected by increased aircraft noise.\n  While the safety of airplane passengers is paramount and the vitality \nof our air transport system is important, people on the ground have a \nright to a quality of life with a minimum exposure to air noise \noverhead.\n  Despite spending over $70 million in taxpayer dollars on the New \nYork, New Jersey, and Philadelphia airspace redesign project, time and \ntime again the Federal Aviation Administration has turned a deaf ear to \nthe tremendous impact air noise has had over northern New Jersey. I \nrecently wrote two letters to the FAA to bring my constituent concerns \ndirectly to Administrator Michael Huerta's attention. To date, these \nletters and my constituents' pleas for help have gone unanswered.\n  As the FAA proceeds with the New York, New Jersey, and Philadelphia \nairspace redesign, they must factor air noise into their calculations. \nI look forward to working with the chairman to ensure that this is \ndone.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I want to again thank the gentleman for raising this \nimportant issue. I appreciate his dedication to ensuring that his \nconstituents' air noise concerns are adequately addressed by the FAA.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n\n\n          Amendment Offered by Ms. Maxine Waters of California\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 4__.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to establish any asset management position (including \n     any account executive, senior account executive, and troubled \n     asset specialist position, as such positions are described in \n     the Field Resource Manual (Wave 1) entitled ``Transformation: \n     Multifamily for Tomorrow'' of the Department of Housing and \n     Urban Development) of the Office of Multifamily Housing of \n     the Department of Housing and Urban Development, or newly \n     hire an employee for any asset management position, that is \n     located at a Core office (as such term is used in such Field \n     Resource Manual) before filling each such asset management \n     position that is located at a Non-Core office (as such term \n     is used in such Field Resource Manual) and has been vacated \n     since October 1, 2015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I rise to offer an \namendment regarding HUD's multifamily transformation plan. I will \nultimately withdraw this amendment because I know that there will be \nRepublican opposition, but I think it is important for me to speak out \nagainst the ill-advised plan.\n  The Department of Housing and Urban Development is currently in the \nprocess of a major consolidation of its multifamily offices, which it \nhas dubbed the multifamily transformation plan. I have been vocal in my \nskepticism of HUD's assurances that this plan will bring about \nsignificant savings without impacting program delivery.\n  In fact, last year this House approved an amendment to the fiscal \nyear 2015 appropriations bill that required HUD to follow a \ntransformation plan that maintains asset management staff in its field \noffices. I fought for this amendment because I believe strongly that \nHUD's plan to consolidate the important function of asset management \nfrom 17 hubs overseeing 50 field offices into just 5 hub locations and \n7 satellite offices would significantly impair program delivery without \nresulting in significant cost savings.\n  Asset management is a hands-on job which calls for an intimate \nknowledge of the local housing market and frequently requires staff to \nmake on-site visits to troubled properties. That is why it is so \nimportant to have asset management staff in local field offices to \nrespond to local needs.\n  Unfortunately, I have been hearing from advocates that HUD has been \nfailing to replace vacancies in asset management positions in field \noffices and is only hiring new asset management staff in hub locations. \nThis is unacceptable. There are already two field offices that have \ncompletely shuttered because they have no working staff. In Los \nAngeles, we have already lost 15 asset management staff who have not \nbeen replaced.\n  My amendment would ensure that HUD prioritizes the hiring of asset \nmanagement staff in local field offices for vacancies that occur in the \nnext fiscal year instead of continuing to consolidate this important \nfunction to a select few hub and satellite locations. It would help \nensure that our multifamily field offices remain open and operating at \ncurrent staffing levels. Without this amendment, local multifamily \noffices will continue to have more vacancies that go unfilled.\n  I regretfully ask unanimous consent to withdraw my amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Yoho\n\n  Mr. YOHO. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of subpart E of part 5 of the \n     regulations of the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development \n     (24 C.F.R. Part 5, Subpart E; relating to restrictions on \n     assistance to noncitizens).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Florida and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. YOHO. Madam Chair, my amendment simply ensures that no funds can \nbe used to circumvent current law which prevents illegal immigrants \nfrom obtaining housing assistance. Spending should be prioritized based \non the needs of American taxpaying citizens, not those who are residing \nin our country illegally.\n  Constituents back in my district and throughout the country work hard \nevery day, and their needs should not play second fiddle to those of \nimmigrants who broke our laws and came into this country illegally.\n  With the continued efforts by some in this country to disregard the \nrule of law, much to the detriment of taxpaying Americans, I truly \nbelieve this amendment is necessary to clarify and reinforce the intent \nof Congress as it pertains to housing assistance providing via HUD.\n  This is a simple, commonsense amendment that shows the hard-working \nAmerican citizens that we are serious when it comes to spending their \ntax dollars and that we will not use their hard-earned money to \nprioritize and reward those who break our laws. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this amendment and support the rule of law.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I do oppose this amendment. \nOn the face of it, it simply restates existing regulations, but I fear \nthere is another motive at play, that is, an anti-immigrant agenda.\n\n[[Page H3973]]\n\n  Let me explain what I mean. This amendment feeds into the widely held \nmisperception that many undocumented individuals are, in fact, \nobtaining Federal benefits despite restrictions--verification \nprocedures--specifically designed to prohibit such activity.\n  We must not allow this appropriations bill to become a platform to \ndenigrate immigrants in this country or to score political points at \ntheir expense. We need real solutions. We need to actually fix our \nbroken immigration system. We shouldn't be wasting valuable floor time \non amendments such as these. We would be better served by moving \ncomprehensive immigration reform, fully debating it in this Chamber.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  We are ready to do that. We can pass comprehensive immigration \nreform, if the Speaker would bring it to the floor, this very week. \nUntil then, I would ask restraint on amendments that in no way alter \nexisting law and regulation and only serve to stir controversy, \nreinforce prejudices, and distract us from the business at hand.\n  I urge defeat of this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. YOHO. Madam Chair, this amendment is strictly about the rule of \nlaw and following the rule of law. I agree we shouldn't have to debate \nimmigration here. This is not about this. This is about following the \nrule of law.\n  At this point, I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gohmert).\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Chair, this amendment has nothing to do with being \nanti-immigrant. In fact, the gentleman's comments play into that \naccusation. This is entirely incorrect and inappropriate. In fact, it \nreminds me of a comment a President made from right up there at that \npodium that no illegal aliens would get ObamaCare. Somebody thought \nthat was not true and said so. It turns out it was not true. They have \ngotten it.\n  I went home and talked to a number of people that were in and around \nWalmart this weekend--immigrants, people that are here legally, and \nthey can't find work and they need help. They did everything to come \nhere legally and properly--Hispanic Americans, Asian Americans, African \nAmericans, Anglo Americans--and they just need help.\n  I would submit, if we are going to be true to the oath we took to our \nConstitution and the laws which uphold our Constitution, we need to be \nabout helping those that are under our care, those who have come \nlegally.\n  I support the gentleman's amendment, and I appreciate him doing it. \nIt is a pro-immigrant amendment for immigrants that will come legally, \nand there are plenty of those here.\n  Mr. YOHO. Madam Chair, to the ranking member, I would love to have \nthat discussion down the road about responsible immigration reform, and \nI think we need to have that. The American people expect it. They \ndeserve it, and I look forward to having that.\n  In the meantime, this is just a commonsense amendment that strictly \nputs the emphasis on following the rule of law, and I think all \nAmericans, regardless of what side of the aisle, would stand supporting \nthe Constitution, the very document that we all took an oath to.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Florida will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 16 Offered by Ms. Jackson Lee\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of section 5309 of title 49, United \n     States Code.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Texas.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank the ranking member, Mr. Price, and his \nstaff, as well as the chairman, Mr. Diaz-Balart, for their work on \nsomething that is very close and near and dear to many Members' hearts. \nIt certainly is close to mine.\n  The Jackson Lee amendment was passed last year. I am grateful to have \nthe opportunity this year to restate the fact that this amendment \nindicates that none of the funds made available by this act under the \nheading ``Federal Transit Administration: Transit Formula Grants'' may \nbe used in contravention of section 5309.\n  This is, as I said, an amendment identical to the Jackson Lee \namendment. Might I just briefly speak to this amendment. It affirms the \nimportance to the Nation of projects that create economic development, \nparticularly in the transportation area.\n  It particularly says that the Secretary of Transportation may make \ngrants under this section to State and local governments; it has the \nauthority to assist in financing capital projects, small start-up \nprojects, including the acquisition of real property.\n  The key is that these grants under State and local authority can \nundertake capital projects, which means that, when local governments \npropose their projects, the Secretary has the authority to go forward. \nNothing can contravene that authority.\n  It is well documented that nothing enhances the competitiveness of a \nNation in this increasingly globalized economy than investments in \ntransportation and infrastructure capital projects.\n  I will include an article about transportation dated March 31, 2015, \ninto the Record.\n\n              [From the Houston Chronicle, Mar. 31, 2015]\n\n            Study Finds Houston Traffic Congestion Worsening\n\n                            (By Dug Begley)\n\n       As workday commutes go, Raj Dada's isn't terrible. He lives \n     east of Jersey Village, an easy drive from the freeway. His \n     off-ramp from Interstate 10 puts him practically in front of \n     his job near Bunker Hill.\n       In each of the past three years, though, the daily drive \n     has gotten worse, Dada said.\n       ``I leave earlier than I used to,'' he said Monday morning \n     as he stopped for gas near his office. ``Even on weekends, \n     it's taking longer to get around all the construction and \n     traffic.''\n       It's a common dilemma for Houston motorists. Congestion in \n     Houston increased sharply from 2013 to 2014, according to a \n     report released Tuesday by TomTom, developer of the mapping \n     and traffic data fed to phones and other GPS devices.\n       Analysts said trips in the region on average last year took \n     25 percent longer than they would have in free-flowing \n     conditions, compared with 21 percent longer in 2013.\n       This means that a hypothetical 30-minute, congestion-free \n     trip, on average, takes about 52 minutes at peak commuting \n     times. For an entire year, it means drivers waste 85 hours--\n     more than 3.5 days--plodding along the highways and streets \n     of Houston.\n       It's the first increase in TomTom's traffic index for \n     Houston in four years after three consecutive years of slight \n     declines.\n       Growing cities with robust economies tend to experience the \n     biggest increases in traffic. Oil price dips notwithstanding, \n     Houston certainly fits the bill, said Tony Voigt, the program \n     manager for the Texas A Transportation Institute's Houston \n     office.\n       Voigt said local analysis supports the conclusion in the \n     TomTom report: More local streets and highways are more \n     congested for more hours of the day. Even weekend trips to \n     some spots--notably retail corridors--can be increasingly \n     time-consuming.\n       ``This is a result of more people living here as compared \n     to two or three years ago and our economy being very active \n     and healthy,'' Voigt said.\n       Nick Cohn, senior traffic expert for TomTom, said the \n     opposite is true in places where job prospects are not as \n     strong, based on the company's worldwide traffic research.\n       ``In Moscow, where there has really been an economic \n     slowdown and gas prices are up, there has been a slowdown,'' \n     Cohn said.\n       Moscow and other international cities continue to \n     experience traffic far worse than cities in the U.S. In the \n     United States, Houston ranked 12th-worst among major cities \n     for traffic, compared to 85th worldwide.\n       News that 11 other American cities have worse congestion \n     isn't comforting to Houston drivers.\n       ``It's terrible,'' said Debbie Curry, 60, a lifelong \n     Houstonian. ``Traffic in this city has gotten worse. When I \n     moved (to western Houston) I thought it would get better. It \n     did for a little while; now it's as bad as it's ever been.''\n       Reasons why Houston drivers spend so much of their time in \n     traffic vary, but most theories circle back to explosive \n     growth.\n\n[[Page H3974]]\n\n       ``Some of the congestion on U.S. 290 and on (Loop 610 \n     North) is, of course, construction-related,'' Voigt said. \n     ``But what we are really seeing is travel demand is greater \n     overall, and this is causing the peak congestion periods to \n     spread out.''\n       Peak commutes, once contained to two hours each in the \n     morning and evening, are spreading to three and sometimes \n     four hours. Though it means more days when traffic is heavy \n     for longer periods, the gradual growth of peak commuting \n     periods isn't all bad, Cohn said.\n       ``It means at least when possible they are being flexible \n     with those work-to-home and home-to-work trips,'' Cohn said, \n     noting that an alternative could be a more compressed--but \n     more severe--peak commuting period.\n       Houston-area officials have a long list of road-widening \n     projects planned over the next decade, along with some \n     transit growth. Suburban areas, notably Conroe and The \n     Woodlands, are exploring their own transit options. It's a \n     pattern across the U.S., Cohn said.\n       Each city faces different obstacles, Cohn said. Houston's \n     lack of density could make transit less effective, but public \n     transportation remains a critical part of any congestion \n     relief as roads dominate.\n       Many municipalities, state transportation officials and \n     counties in the area have made ``significant requests for \n     roadway dollars,'' said Houston Councilman Stephen Costello, \n     chairman of the Transportation Policy Council of the Houston-\n     Galveston Area Council.\n       Those projects are not just about relieving traffic now, \n     but about building before it gets worse, Costello said.\n       Any improvements are constrained by funding, which federal \n     and state lawmakers have been slow to deliver. Federal \n     officials remain at an impasse about a long-term \n     transportation bill, and many have shown reluctance to \n     increase federal highway spending. Texas voters last year \n     approved $1.7 billion for state highways, leaving about $3.3 \n     billion in additional money needed, according to the Texas \n     A Transportation Institute.\n       That funding shortfall has many, especially officials in \n     suburban Houston, worried as their traffic worsens and \n     projects crawl toward completion, said West University Place \n     Mayor Bob Fry.\n       ``I think outside (Loop 610) is going to be worse for \n     traffic than inside the Loop,'' Fry said. ``Inside is built \n     out, and it's not going to get worse like it is outside.''\n       In the urban core, Fry said, transit is the important \n     investment. He said Metro's upcoming redesign of bus service \n     will ``help quite a bit.''\n\n\n                            Personal choice\n\n       With projects slow to take shape, Cohn said drivers might \n     see the best results by using an increasing and improving \n     array of traffic information available to them. Houston's \n     TranStar system--a partnership of Houston, Harris County, the \n     Texas Department of Transportation and the Metropolitan \n     Transit Authority--is one of the largest and most \n     comprehensive real-time traffic systems in the country.\n       ``There used to be a big difference between what the \n     highway authority has and what real-time traffic systems \n     have,'' Cohn said. ``It is more of a unified service now.''\n       When a motorist finds alternate routes to avoid congestion, \n     it helps not just that driver but also others because one \n     less vehicle is clogging up the problem spot.\n       Reliance on the information, and better personal planning, \n     might be the best relief for traffic now.\n       ``I don't think drivers can sit back and wait for some big \n     infrastructure project,'' he said.\n                                  ____\n\n\n               [From the Houston Chronicle, Feb. 5, 2013]\n\n              Congestion A Constant for Houston Commuters\n\n                            (By Dug Begley)\n\n       Houston region has been rated as having the sixth worst \n     commute in the nation based on hours of delay.\n       The good news is that traffic congestion isn't getting much \n     worse in the Houston area. The bad news is it was pretty bad \n     to begin with.\n       Houston commuters continue to endure some of the worst \n     traffic delays in the country, according to the 2012 Urban \n     Mobility Report released Tuesday by the Texas A \n     Transportation Commission. Area drivers wasted more than two \n     days a year, on average, in traffic congestion, costing them \n     each $1,090 in lost time and fuel.\n       And it's unlikely to get any better, researchers and public \n     officials say.\n       ``I think as rapidly as this area is growing, (the \n     challenge) is just trying to stay where we are,'' Harris \n     County Judge Ed Emmett said of the traffic congestion.\n       Planned toll projects on U.S. 290 and eventually Interstate \n     45 will help ease traffic, just as the Katy Freeway managed \n     lanes did in 2008, Emmett said.\n       Drivers take the congestion in stride and devise their own \n     strategies to deal with the hassle. Roger Wilson, 54, takes a \n     park and ride bus from Katy, but his co-worker Brad Steele, \n     39, drives in from Spring. Over lunch Monday, both claimed \n     their method was best.\n        ``Yeah, you get to read or sleep,'' Steele told Wilson, \n     ``but I would rather have my car.''\n       But as long as Houston attracts jobs, and those jobs \n     attract workers, commuting hassles will persist, said Tim \n     Lomax, a co-author of the mobility report.\n        ``We're hitting the limits of improving traffic by \n     widening the roads,'' said Stephen Klineberg, co-director of \n     the Kinder Center for Urban Research at Rice University.\n       With 4 million people in Harris County, and another 1 \n     million coming in the next 20 years, the region will embrace \n     new development patterns that reduce the need for driving--\n     but on its own terms and without abandoning the car, \n     Klineberg said.\n       ``Suburban areas are developing town centers and walkable \n     urbanist developments,'' Klineberg said, pointing to \n     developments in The Woodlands, Sugar Land and Pearland.\n\n\n                            Drivers adapting\n\n       The new patterns follow years of steady outward growth, \n     leading to greater distances between homes and workplaces.\n       Based on the mobility report, in 1982 drivers spent about \n     22 hours each year stuck in congestion, a figure that has \n     increased almost every year since. Traffic congestion peaked \n     in 2008 at 55 hours, the same year two carpool/toll lanes \n     along I-10 opened between downtown and Katy. The lanes took \n     five years to complete and cost $2.8 billion.\n       But some of the best ways to reduce congestion are less \n     costly. As Houston drivers have acclimated to rush-hour \n     traffic jams, they've become more adept at saving themselves \n     time.\n        ``People are adjusting when they leave,'' Lomax said, \n     noting resources that provide real-time traffic information. \n     As smartphones and computers become more common, and workdays \n     come with greater flexibility for some people to work from \n     home, commuters can adjust to less-stressful drive times.\n       Thus, even though they have the sixth-worst commute in the \n     country based on hours of delay, the region's drivers rank \n     21st on a new calculation that determines how much extra time \n     drivers have to build into their trips. The new measure, \n     called the freeway planning time index, shows drivers don't \n     have to build in as much extra time as others, because \n     planning and good freeway clearance rates by tow trucks keep \n     roads moving, Lomax said.\n       Public transit can provide some relief, but with jobs in \n     Houston divided among a dozen or so job areas, it's hard for \n     public transit to carry everyone where they need to go \n     efficiently, Lomax said.\n       Still, drivers and elected officials said traffic \n     congestion is spreading farther from the urban core and \n     growing.\n\n\n                             Trucking hurt\n\n        ``I think within the next two years it is going to get \n     worse,'' said Liberty County Commissioner Norman Brown, who \n     said traffic is already worsening for some Dayton-area \n     drivers.\n       Some congestion on the region's fringes is the result of \n     trucking and manufacturing, Brown said. The mobility report \n     found congestion accounted for $646 million in cost to \n     businesses reliant on trucking in 2011, up from $490 million \n     in 2007.\n       Emmett said the shipping growth demonstrates the need for \n     investment in rail and other methods to move goods.\n       Lomax said congestion caused by flourishing truck business \n     can be a good problem to have.\n       ``Economic recession seems to be the one foolproof way of \n     controlling congestion,'' Lomax said. ``But nobody's saying \n     that is a solution.''\n\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Just to emphasize, finally, whether it is seaways, \ndams, highways, or tollways, whether it involves other modes of \ntransportation, transportation projects are major engines driving the \neconomy. That is why we are here on the floor. It is important for the \nlocal communities to be drivers of that. The metropolitan regions will \nnot be able to maintain economic vitality without this investment.\n  Finally, the Jackson Lee amendment clearly speaks to the global \naspects of the Secretary of Transportation having the ability to work \nwith our local and State governments.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in restating that the Secretary of \nTransportation has authority to work with local and State entities on \nthe proposed projects that they have and for these projects to continue \nto grow and develop to ease traffic congestion.\n  Madam Chair, Let me thank Subcommittee Chairman Diaz-Balart and \nRanking Member Price for their leadership on this important legislation \nand for the opportunity to explain my amendment.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment adds at the end of the bill the following \nnew section providing that:\n\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act \n     under the heading `` Federal Transit Administration--Transit \n     Formula Grants'' may be used in contravention of section 5309 \n     of title 49, United States Code.\n\n  This amendment is identical to the Jackson Lee Amendment to H.R. \n4775, the Transportation, Housing and Urban Development Appropriations \nAct for FY2015 adopted by the House last year by voice vote.\n  In particular, the Jackson Lee affirms the importance to the nation \nof projects that create economic development, particularly in the \ntransportation area.\n\n[[Page H3975]]\n\n  Pursuant to section 5309 of title 49, the Secretary of Transportation \nmay make grants under this section to State and local government the \nauthority to assist in financing capital projects, small startup \nprojects, including the acquisition of real property.\n  This section further supports capacity improvements, including double \ntracking, and it specifically relates to work that deals with projects \non approved transportation plans.\n  That is key; section 5309 of title 49 grants to State and local \ngovernments the authority to undertake capital projects, which means \nthat when local governments propose their projects, the Secretary has \nthe authority to go forward on them.\n  It's instructive to consider what some of the nation's leading \ntransportation and economic development organizations have to say about \nthe importance and economic impact of investments in local light rail \ncapital projects.\n  It is well documented that nothing enhances the competitiveness of a \nnation in this increasingly globalized economy, than investments in \ntransportation infrastructure capital projects.\n  Whether it is the seaways, dams, highways, or tollways, and whether \nit involves other modes of transportation, transportation projects are \nmajor engines driving the economy.\n  And it is important for the local community to be the drivers of \nthat.\n  Metropolitan regions will not be able to maintain its economic \nvitality without the ability to create and preserve infrastructure that \nsupports the movement of people and goods throughout our country.\n  The Jackson Lee Amendment clearly speaks to the global aspect of the \nSecretary of Transportation having the ability to work with our local \nand State governments.\n  Houston is the fourth most populous city in the country; but unlike \nother large cities, we have struggled to have an effective mass transit \nsystem.\n  Over many decades Houston's mass transit policy was to build more \nhighways with more lanes to carry more drivers to and from work.\n  The city of Houston has changed course and is now pursuing Mass \ntransit options that include light rail.\n  This decision to invest in light rail was and is strongly supported \nby Houstonians by their votes in a 2003 referendum and by their \nincreased usage of light rail service made possible in part by \ntransportation appropriations bills.\n  Specifically, Harris County voters passed a massive referendum \nproposal that was to set the stage for transit for the next 20 years.\n  It included a first stage of four light rail lines, to be complete by \n2012, and a master plan for a 65-mile system, to be complete by 2025.\n  An April 2014 report by the Houston METRO on weekly ridership states \nthat 44,267 used Houston's light rail service, which represented a \n6,096 or 16% increase in ridership from April of the previous year.\n  This increase in light rail usage outpaced ridership of other forms \nof mass transit in the city of Houston: metro bus had a 2.3% increase \nover April 2013; metro bus-local had a 1.3% increase over April 2013; \nand Metro bus-Park and ride had a 8.0% increase over April 2013.\n  In a story published February 5, 2013, the Houston Chronicle reported \non the congestion Houston drivers face under daily commute to and from \nwork.\n  According to the Chronicle article, in 2011 Houston commuters \ncontinue to enjoy some of the worst traffic delays in the country, and \nHouston area drivers wasted more than two days a year, on average, in \ntraffic congestion, costing them each $1,090 in lost time and fuel.\n  Today, those figures have increased to 3.5 days a year wasted in \ntraffic congestion, costing them each $1,850 in lost time and fuel.\n  To put it in simpler and starker terms: A driver in Houston could see \n154 movies this year or purchase 21 tickets to a home Texans game with \nthe money wasted because of poorly maintained or traffic-clogged roads.\n  Expanded light rail is critical to Houston's plan to meet its \ntransportation and environmental challenges, ease its traffic \ncongestion, and improve its air quality.\n  Places most likely to see immediate benefit from light rail in \nHouston are the 50,000 students that attend the University of Houston \nand Texas Southern University.\n  Funds made available under this deal should be available to support \nlocal government decisions of the Houston Metropolitan Transit \nAuthority and the city of Houston to expand rail service.\n  When we put our minds to it, we can get things done.\n  In Houston, we built a port 50 miles from the ocean, created the \nworld's greatest medical center in the middle of open prairie, and \nconvinced the federal government to base its astronauts in a hurricane \nzone 870 miles from the launch pad.\n  Each of those achievements shares a common element: elected officials \nhave advocated, built public support, and brought the agencies \ntogether.\n  Members of Congress should respect the decisions of state and local \ngovernments when it comes to deciding how they will spend funding made \navailable for public transportation under this appropriations bill.\n  I ask my colleagues to again support the Jackson Lee Amendment and \naffirm the authority of the Secretary of Transportation to work with \nlocal governments to develop local transit projects that will relieve \ntraffic congestion, efficiently move people and goods, create jobs and \nmaintain America's status as the leading economy in the world.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the Jackson Lee amendment, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment Offered by Mr. Brooks of Alabama\n\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to provide financial assistance in contravention of \n     section 214(d) of the Housing and Community Development Act \n     of 1980 (42 U.S.C. 1436a(d)).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Alabama and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alabama.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Chair, America recently blew through the \n$18 trillion debt mark. America's Comptroller General warns that \nAmerica's debt path is unsustainable.\n  In short, Washington's financial irresponsibility threatens America \nwith a debilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that risks destroying the \nAmerica our ancestors sacrificed so much to build.\n  With this impending financial crisis as a backdrop, I ask the House \nof Representatives to have the courage, to have the backbone, to be \nfinancially responsible. The House can do that in part by adopting my \namendment that eliminates Federal Government housing subsidies for \nillegal aliens.\n  How big is this problem? Census Bureau data analyzed by the Center \nfor Immigration Studies in 2012 reflects that at least 130,000 \nhouseholds headed by self-identifying illegal aliens live in public or \nsubsidized housing. That is potentially hundreds of millions of \ntaxpayer dollars being illegally taken by illegal aliens with the tacit \nor open consent or even the encouragement of the United States \nGovernment.\n  Think about that for a moment. While American families struggle to \nmake ends meet, while America faces a debilitating and destructive \ninsolvency and bankruptcy, while American families and lawful \nimmigrants are being forced to wait in line for public housing, this \nadministration ignores the law to spend potentially hundreds of \nmillions of taxpayer dollars subsidizing illegal aliens, thereby \nencouraging their illegal conduct.\n  Madam Chair, my amendment is simple. It prohibits funding to \nsubsidized housing in violation of section 214(d) of the Housing and \nCommunity Development Act that, for clarity, bars HUD from providing \ntaxpayer assistance for the benefit of an applicant ``before \nimmigration documentation is presented and verified'' by DHS' automated \nSystematic Alien Verification for Entitlements system or a subsequent \nsuccessful appeal.\n  Unfortunately, this administration ignores the law and permits \nillegal aliens to move into public housing before the legality of their \nstatus is finally determined.\n  Also, unfortunately, the administrative and legal process being what \nit is, it takes as much as 2 years to evict illegal alien tenants after \ntheir illegal alien status is discovered.\n  Madam Chair, it is unacceptable that, in a time of out-of-control \nUnited States debt and deficit, HUD violates the law to give limited \npublic housing benefits to illegal aliens, rather than needy American \ncitizens and lawful immigrants.\n  Madam Chair, I urge the adoption of my amendment that, first, denies \npublic housing subsidies to illegal aliens; and, second, underscores \nthe sense of\n\n[[Page H3976]]\n\nCongress that the law must be obeyed and that it is wrong to use public \nhousing subsidies to reward illegal aliens for their illegal conduct.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition to \nthis amendment. Once again, we have an amendment that, on its face, \nsimply restates existing law. In fact, the gentleman offering the \namendment has acknowledged that existing law categorically prohibits \nHUD benefits from going to undocumented persons.\n  What is going on here? What is lurking beneath the surface? I fear \nsomething is. An anti-immigrant agenda based on fear and prejudice \nwould appear to be the answer.\n  We are feeding into widely held misconceptions that so many \nundocumented immigrants are seeking and receiving Federal benefits, \nthat Federal programs, Federal dollars, are being abused and misused.\n  Well, we do need to have a remedy for our broken immigration system. \nAs I said earlier, a comprehensive immigration reform bill, bipartisan, \npassed the Senate last Congress. It could be placed on this floor \ntomorrow and pass overwhelmingly. That doesn't appear to be happening. \nInstead, what we have is this drumbeat of measures that are denigrating \nthe immigrant community.\n  We need to have some restraint in this body on such amendments. They \ndon't alter existing law. They do, I am afraid, though, stir \ncontroversy. They reinforce prejudice and stereotypes. They distract us \nfrom the business at hand.\n  I think it is an unworthy amendment. I urge my colleagues to reject \nit, and I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart), the \nchairman of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  I think it is important to just kind of always try to lower the \ndecibels as much as we can.\n  This amendment, as both gentlemen have said, does not change current \nlaw. It doesn't change current HUD policies. It merely restates current \nlaw. I don't, frankly, see a reason to have the amendment. Likewise, I \ndon't see a big reason to oppose the amendment that just, again, \nrestates current law. I ask all sides to try to lower the rhetoric on \nthis issue. This amendment does not change anything.\n  As the ranking member knows, I have been involved in trying to get \nimmigration reform for a long, long time and have worked with a number \nof Republicans and Democrats. I will tell you that both sides have had \nopportunities to get it done, and neither side got it done when they \nhad the opportunity to get it done. I am hoping that we will be able to \nget it done.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  But this is not the time and place to have that debate. So, again, \nwhile I don't see the need for this amendment, I don't see what the \nissue is of objecting to an amendment that, in essence, does absolutely \nnothing.\n  I thank the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price) for allowing me \nsome of his time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the chairman, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Madam Chair, I find it interesting and \nsomewhat perplexing how my good friend across the aisle talks about an \nanti-immigrant agenda appealing to fear and prejudice.\n  It seems that whenever we start talking about border security and \nlawful immigration, the race card is played. And I would submit that \nthat is because, in part, there is an absence of rational sound public \npolicy for the position taken.\n  Let's emphasize something. America has, far and away, the most \ngenerous lawful immigration policy in the world. No nation is as \ncompassionate with respect to lawful immigrants as the United States of \nAmerica is, and I challenge anyone to say different.\n  I wish that this kind of amendment was not necessary, but when you \nhave got an executive branch that has shown itself to be willingly \nlawless, to the point that two Federal judges, one in Pennsylvania and \none in Texas, have had to render a decision trying to force this \nadministration to obey the law, then I would submit, Madam Chair, that \nit is important to have these kinds of amendments to also deny the \nfunding that otherwise would be used for that lawless conduct.\n  I ask for support of the amendment. I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Brooks).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Alabama will \nbe postponed.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Engel\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Department of Transportation, the Department \n     of Housing and Urban Development, or any other Federal agency \n     to lease or purchase new light duty vehicles for any \n     executive fleet, or for an agency's fleet inventory, except \n     in accordance with Presidential Memorandum--Federal Fleet \n     Performance, dated May 24, 2011.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Madam Chair, on May 24, 2011, President Obama issued a \nmemorandum on Federal fleet performance that required all new light-\nduty vehicles in the Federal fleet to be alternative fuel vehicles, \nsuch as hybrid, electric, natural gas, or biofuel, by December 31, \n2015.\n  My amendment echoes the President's memorandum by prohibiting funds \nin this act from being used to lease or purchase new light-duty \nvehicles unless that purchase is made in accord with the President's \nmemorandum.\n  I have submitted identical amendments to 17 different appropriations \nbills over the past few years, and every time they have been accepted \nby both the majority and the minority. I hope my amendment will receive \nsimilar support today.\n  Global oil prices are down. We no longer pay $147 per barrel. But \ndespite increased production here in the United States, the global \nprice of oil is still largely determined by OPEC.\n  Spikes in oil prices have profound repercussions for our economy. The \nprimary reason is that our cars and trucks run only on petroleum. We \ncan change that with alternative technologies that exist today.\n  The Federal Government operates the largest fleet of light-duty \nvehicles in America, over 635,000 vehicles. More than 6,000 of these \nvehicles are within the jurisdiction of this bill, being used by the \nDepartment of Transportation and the Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment.\n  When I was in Brazil a few years ago, I saw how they diversified \ntheir fuel by greatly expanding their use of ethanol. People there can \ndrive to a gas station and choose whether to fill their vehicle with \ngasoline or with ethanol and also possible blends as well. They make \ntheir choice based on cost or whatever criteria they deem important.\n  So I want the same choice for America's consumers. That is why I am \nproposing a bill in Congress, as I have done many times in the past, \nwhich will provide for cars built in America to be able to run on a \nfuel instead of, or in addition to, gasoline. If they can do it in \nBrazil, we can do it here, and it would cost less than $100 per car to \ndo.\n  So, in conclusion, expanding the role these alternative technologies \nplay in our transportation economy will help break the leverage that \nforeign-government-controlled oil companies hold over Americans. It \nwill increase our Nation's domestic security and protect consumers.\n  I urge that my colleagues support the Engel amendment.\n  In conclusion, I would just say that energy policy is something that \nis really important, and we can take a very\n\n[[Page H3977]]\n\nsmall step tonight to move closer to energy independence and protecting \nthe American consumer. I would urge all my colleagues on both sides, as \nthey have in the past, to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Engel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Hultgren\n\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Federal Aviation Administration for the bio-\n     data assessment in the hiring of Air Traffic Control \n     Specialists.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer my amendment, which \ndefunds a troubling hiring test put forth by the FAA which has led to \ncheating and questionable hiring practices for air traffic controllers.\n  The intent of my amendment is not to slow hiring, but to stop the \nFAA's use of a discredited gatekeeper hiring test.\n  I represent more than 270 air traffic controllers in Illinois' 14th \nCongressional District. More than a year ago, the FAA made an \ninexplicable and obscure change to its longstanding hiring practices, \nwith few details given about how the changes would be implemented and \nwith little advance warning.\n  Setting aside its decades-long process by which qualified Collegiate \nTraining Initiative students and military veterans were given \npreference in hiring, the FAA implemented a new biographical \nquestionnaire, or Bio Q, which contains such questions as, ``How many \nsports did you play in high school?''\n  With no way to know what a right answer is, how to improve on the \ntest, or what their final score was, many otherwise highly qualified \napplicants failed, after spending countless resources and time training \nto become air traffic controllers.\n  The new procedures caused the agency to divert the hiring process \naround highly qualified, CTI-certified trainees and experienced \nveterans, jeopardizing air travel safety in favor of off-the-street \nhires, some of whom have little experience or ambition.\n  Since then, the FAA has been under fire following a six-month \ninvestigation which uncovered that FAA or aviation-related employees \nmay have assisted in giving potential air traffic controller recruits \nspecial access to answers on the Bio Q to help them gain jobs with the \nFAA.\n  This cheating is greatly disturbing and jeopardizes any shred of \ncredibility of the Bio Q that it had any accurate or fair test to \ndetermine who should be an air traffic controller.\n  Yet, we are now finding out that the cheating may run deeper than \nfirst reported, possibly with knowledge at the highest levels of the \nFAA.\n  If additional FAA or aviation-related employees helped applicants \ncheat on the Bio Q, it is imperative that we expose those responsible \nand determine how widespread and systemic the misconduct is.\n  I have urged Congress to compel the FAA to appear before the American \npeople to get to the bottom of this troubling discovery. These \ninvestigations uncover just how discredited the Bio Q is in any hiring \nprocess.\n  But until we get answers to these questions, like who knew about the \ncheating, when did they know about it, and how did they cover it up, we \ncannot let the FAA employ people unfairly using the highly flawed Bio Q \nas a gatekeeper.\n  In addition, we still don't know what will happen to those who have \neither failed the Bio Q, aged out of the hiring process, or both.\n  Disqualifying highly trained, certified graduates and military \nveterans because they did or did not play sports in high school is \nridiculous. This amendment would restrict funding for the Bio Q, \nstopping its use by the FAA.\n  When you climb into an airliner, you trust the pilot, the crew, and \nthe air traffic controllers will keep you safe. I have introduced H.R. \n1964, the Air Traffic Controllers Hiring Act of 2015, to reverse the \neffects of the FAA's policy, restore safety and confidence to air \ntravel, and to make sure we have the best and brightest in our control \ntowers.\n  I have hopes that this legislation can move quickly through the House \nand have urged the Transportation Committee to hold a hearing on the \nbill. Now that Aviation Subcommittee Chairman LoBiondo has cosponsored \nthe legislation, I am looking forward to the committee's consideration.\n  Until then, this amendment will help restore some sanity back to the \nFAA.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Illinois \n(Mr. Lipinski), my good friend and colleague.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman for yielding and for \nhis work on this amendment and on the bill.\n  As the gentleman said, early last year, the FAA switched course on \nits hiring process by moving from the AT-SAT, which was a tried-and-\ntrue, knowledge-based test, to a bio-data assessment. The change had a \ntremendous impact on the 36 Air Traffic Collegiate Training Initiative \nschools.\n  I have one of the best of these schools in my district, Lewis \nUniversity. Lewis 2 years ago won the Loening Trophy as the best \naviation program in the Nation.\n  Maybe students chose to attend Lewis and these other schools because \nof the advantages that CTI schools provided under the old hiring \nsystem. They decided at a young age to enroll in a program fostered by \nthe FAA and were given the opportunity to excel on the AT-SAT, which \nwas unfairly pulled out from under them.\n  Madam Chair, this amendment is a step in the right direction towards \nfixing the misguided policy change that had a negative impact on \nstudents and the universities that invested significant resources in \ntraining our future generations of air traffic controllers.\n  But I need to emphasize that this amendment should not come at the \ncost of slowing down the hiring of air traffic controllers. We have \nalready suffered from a hiring and training slowdown and cannot afford \nfurther delays to staffing an essential safety function of the FAA.\n  Our hard-working air traffic controllers are already understaffed, \nand Congress must ensure that we are increasing their ranks quickly and \nwith well-trained air traffic controllers.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes.''\n  Mr. HULTGREN. I thank my colleague from Illinois, and I would also \nurge my colleagues to support this passage and to make sure that we \ncontinue to have the safest air traffic control towers in the world.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I very reluctantly, actually, claim \ntime in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I actually understand and, frankly, \nlistened very intently to the gentleman's concerns, and I actually want \nto work with him to make sure that nothing is used that is absolutely \narbitrarily, or frankly, totally unfair. And so I think the gentleman's \nconcerns are very, very valid.\n  At this time, however, and that is why I say ``very reluctantly'' \nhave to oppose, because, again, at this moment, I am concerned, hearing \nthe other gentleman from Illinois mention the fact that we want to make \nsure that we don't slow down the hiring of the air traffic controllers. \nWe need to hire another 1,500 new controllers in 2016.\n  So I not only appreciate the gentleman's concerns, but I, in fact, \npotentially could share a lot of his concerns.\n  But again, reluctantly at this time, because I am concerned about \npotentially slowing down the hiring of new controllers, I reluctantly \nhave to oppose his amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Hultgren).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. HULTGREN. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n\n[[Page H3978]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Illinois \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Meehan\n\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. 416.  None of the funds made available by this Act for \n     Amtrak capital grants may be used for projects off the \n     Northeast Corridor until the level of capital spending by \n     Amtrak for capital projects on the Northeast Corridor during \n     fiscal year 2016 equals the amount of Amtrak's profits from \n     Northeast Corridor operations during fiscal year 2015.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Chair, before I begin my comments, I would like to \nthank Chairman Diaz-Balart and Ranking Member Price for all of their \ndiligent work on this bill.\n  My amendment seeks to prioritize investment in Amtrak's Northeast \nCorridor, which is its most heavily traveled route, by ensuring that \noperating profits that are earned there stay there.\n  Last year, Amtrak's Northeast Corridor line earned nearly $500 \nmillion in operating profit. More than 100,000 Americans get on a train \nthat travels along the Northeast Corridor every day, but instead of \nreinvesting those dollars into improvements in the line's \ninfrastructure, much of that money was sent across the country, used to \nsubsidize money-losing, long-distance Amtrak routes. This has left \nAmtrak's most heavily traveled route less funded, and it has delayed \nneeded improvements to Amtrak's only line that actually turns a profit.\n  This amendment will fix that. It will ensure that the dollars Amtrak \nearns along the Northeast Corridor are invested into improvements in \nthe line's infrastructure. It will make travel along Amtrak's most \nheavily used route safer, and it will also do so without adding to the \ntaxpayers' burden.\n  This amendment will codify the principle that was passed in the \nPassenger Rail Reform and Investment Act, and I might add that that was \napproved with more than 300 votes in this House earlier this year. This \ntracks that same principle. And that legislation passed with the \nleadership of my friend and fellow Pennsylvanian, Chairman Bill \nShuster, which requires that Amtrak direct capital investments into the \nNortheast Corridor, where it is needed most.\n  Madam Chair, more than 11 million Americans rode an Amtrak train \nbetween Boston and Washington last year. Many more used rail lines like \nSEPTA or Metro-North, operating on tracks owned by Amtrak, to get to \nwork every day. The tragic derailment in my own area of Philadelphia \nlast month has shown that there is a desperate need to improve the line \nand strengthen capital investments in the region.\n  This amendment will ensure Amtrak makes smart investment decisions \nand directs capital spending where it is needed most. It will help \nAmtrak tackle the backlog of capital projects that plague the Northeast \nCorridor. It will reduce delays. It will mean safer, more efficient \ntravel for millions of Americans who rely on Amtrak's Northeast \nCorridor every year. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Diaz-Balart).\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, there is a lot of work that goes into this bill and \nthere is a lot of work that goes into the amendments, but I will tell \nyou that the gentleman from Pennsylvania has worked nonstop to find \nreal solutions to deal with making sure that Amtrak is safe and, in \nparticular, that the Northeast Corridor is as viable and as safe as \npossible. So I just must commend the gentleman for his hard work, for \nthe way that he has just worked this issue day in, day out to get to \nthe point where we are today.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I wish to claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I too want to commend my \ncolleague for offering this amendment. I understand his intent. There \nare significant capital needs on the busy Northeast Corridor. It is \nAmtrak's busiest and most successful corridor. It is a fundamental flaw \nof this bill that we are unable to provide for the kind of investments \nthat the service in that corridor warrants and, indeed, that the \nservice of Amtrak nationwide warrants.\n  But the effect of this amendment, I fear, in the environment of \ninadequate investment, this would provide a much-needed boost in \ninvestment in the Northeast Corridor. It may be still not enough, but \nit would do so at the expense of the rest of the Amtrak network, and \nthat should give us pause when we consider this amendment.\n  The amendment would require Amtrak to spend at least $1.2 billion--\nthe annual amount of Northeast Corridor revenues--on Northeast Corridor \ncapital projects before they could spend any of their Federal capital \nfunding elsewhere. This would have the effect of halting all capital \nprojects that are not on the Northeast Corridor, including all \ninformation technology, upgraded safety technology, until very late in \nthe fiscal year at the earliest, and possibly longer, should projects \non the Northeast Corridor not be ready to advance. This would also \nhinder Amtrak's ability to manage State and long-distance service.\n  I know that all of these consequences are probably not my colleague's \nintent, but it does demonstrate the types of consequences that we need \nto consider when making such a policy change. I ask colleagues to vote \nagainst this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Madam Chair, before I close my comments, I think it is \nimportant to recognize that the same principle has already been adopted \nby 318 Members of this body, including a near unanimous vote by my \ncolleague from the other side of the aisle, his colleagues on that side \nof the aisle.\n  I will also say that I am not sure that the gentleman understands the \nactual effect of the bill. It simply is to reinvest the profits that \nare made on the Northeast Corridor. These are being made by the \ninvestments that are being made by the taxpaying people who are \npurchasing those tickets. We can still look for ways to fund other \nparts of the system around the country where they can earn their \ninvestments on merit.\n  We are asking, in light of the fact that this is a line which is so \nheavily used, the priorities be placed where they are most needed.\n  Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Pennsylvania \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue, implement, or enforce the proposed \n     regulation by the Federal Aviation Administration entitled \n     ``Operation and Certification of Small Unmanned Aircraft \n     Systems'' (FAA-2015-0150) without consideration of the use of \n     small unmanned aircraft systems for agricultural operations, \n     as defined in 14 CFR 21.25(b)(1).\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chairwoman, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. A point of order is reserved.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nNewhouse) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3979]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Chair, I rise today to introduce an amendment on \nan important topic that will undoubtedly have a growing impact not just \non our Nation's agricultural sector, but on our economy as a whole.\n  The use of unmanned aerial vehicles, or UAVs, has enormous \npossibilities for our economy, whether it is providing cost-effective \nmeans to deliver packages, photographing housing for Realtors, \nbroadcasting sports games, assisting law enforcement with tracking \ncriminals, or providing mobile WiFi hubs for Internet access. However, \none vastly underconsidered outcome for UAV technology is that it could \npotentially transform our Nation's agricultural sector.\n  Ideas have been considered using UAVs to survey cropland, to \ndetermine property lines, or to help plan for planting, spraying, \nwatering, or harvesting of crops; however, the potential applications \nare even greater. Depending on how this technology evolves, UAVs may be \nequipped with special cameras to determine if crops are dry and need \nextra water and where and how much should be applied. They may also be \nused to apply pesticides or fertilizers with precision to ensure that \ntoo little or too much isn't being used. And depending on their \nsophistication, someday, UAVs may even be used to harvest the food we \ngrow.\n  The potential applications don't just stop there, though. In my \ndistrict last year, we experienced the worst forest fire in Washington \nState history, consuming hundreds of thousands of acres. In the future, \nfirst responders, the Forest Service, and other stakeholders may be \nable to use UAVs to monitor the spread of fire to get people out of \nharm's way or to better predict where to best apply water and fire \nretardants. They could even help with identifying dry or overgrown \nareas in advance to help stakeholders know where treatment is needed, \nwhich could prevent fires in the first place.\n  Madam Chair, I appreciate the steps the FAA has taken in releasing \ndraft rules regarding UAVs and that the FAA has been more agreeable in \nallowing testing of UAVs for commercial purposes.\n  While I understand that safety and privacy are enormous concerns \nbeing considered by the FAA, it is also important that we do not fall \nbehind other nations in utilizing this technology, which are currently \ndeveloping and innovating in this industry more rapidly than we are \nhere in the United States.\n  Madam Chair, my amendment today is simple. It merely limits FAA's \nrulemaking on UAVs if the rules do not take into consideration \nagricultural applications of UAVs in the rulemaking process.\n  I appreciate the work the FAA is doing on this matter, and I hope the \nfinal rules that are expected later this year generously allow for the \nsafe testing and commercial use of UAVs, ensuring the amazing \nagricultural prospects for these technologies are well considered in \nthe process.\n  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Washington?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Newhouse\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___. None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to issue, implement, or enforce regulations by the \n     Federal Aviation Administration entitled ``operations and \n     certification of small unmanned aircraft systems'' (FAA-2015-\n     0150) in contravention to 14 CFR 21.25(b)(1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Washington and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE. Madam Chair, in my previous comments, I addressed this \namendment, which is in order, and I would just submit those comments to \nbe used for this particular amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Newhouse).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Garrett\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to implement, administer, or enforce the final rule \n     entitled ``Implementation of the Fair Housing Act's \n     Discriminatory Effects Standard'', published by the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development in the Federal \n     Register on February 15, 2013 (78 Fed. Reg. 11460; Docket No. \n     FR-5508-F-02).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New Jersey and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Jersey.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Chair, I rise today, as I have done in the past, \nto offer an amendment that attempts to restore some sanity, fairness, \nand certainty to our housing market. My amendment would undo harmful \neconomic actions taken by the administration that weaken credit \navailability and job creation. You see, the Department's final rule \nimplementing the Fair Housing Act's discriminatory effects standard \nestablishes regulations promoting the use of a legal theory known as \ndisparate impact.\n  What is disparate impact? Disparate impact liability allows the \ngovernment to allege discrimination on the basis of race or other \nfactors based solely on statistical analyses that find disproportionate \nresults among different groups of people and--get this--regardless of \nany evidence of any actual discriminatory actions or intent. Let me \npoint that out again--regardless of any evidence of actual \ndiscrimination.\n  If, for example, a mortgage lender uses a completely \nnondiscriminatory standard to assess credit risk, such as maybe a debt-\nto-income ratio, they can still be found to have discriminated if the \ndata shows different loan approval rates for different groups of \nconsumers.\n  So real and actual discrimination must be prosecuted to the fullest \nextent of the law. I think that is something everyone here can agree \non. But under the example that I just laid out, that lender could even \nhave specific antidiscriminatory practices in play, in other words, he \nwould have rules in his business in place, but still be found liable \nunder this theory.\n  Predictably, by creating a presumption of discrimination, this rule \nwill result in a perverse regulatory scheme where lenders, insurers, \nand landlords would effectively be required to intentionally \ndiscriminate among different classes of borrowers. Why? Just to protect \nthemselves from becoming entangled in the regulatory pretzel-like logic \nof this administration.\n  So if we specifically consider the examples of homeowner insurance \ncommonly considered factors, including an applicant's claim history, \nconstruction material, the presence or absence of a security system, \nthe distance to the firehouse, well, they could be barred if they were \nfound to result in creating a statistical disparity for a class defined \nby race or ethnicity or gender.\n  You see, sound risk-based lending insurance underwriting and pricing \nthat unintentionally results in a statistical disparate outcome, that \nis not discrimination; rather, accurate risk identification and \nclassification is absolutely essential to the lending of insurance \nbusinesses.\n  In addition to being unfair and unwise, the HUD rule is also \nunnecessary. Why? Because protected class characteristics are already \nprohibited from consideration in the risk assessment process.\n  You see, State law already prohibits insurers from recording race, \nfor example. The HUD rule requiring race considerations there turns on \nits head and violates these laws. You see, all 50 States in this \ncountry have antidiscriminatory provisions in their housing insurance \nregulations, and there is no claim that these have been insufficient. \nThe Federal Government, therefore, should be encouraging sound business \npractices, not punishing them to utilize them.\n\n[[Page H3980]]\n\n  We have seen what risky lending practices can do to our economy \nalready. Although I believe the Supreme Court will strike down \ndisparate impact theory, we should do all we can in our power to rein \nin an administration policy that will increase the cost and undermine \nthe availability of credit throughout the economy.\n  Now, to this Chamber's credit, let me point out, this House recently \npassed my amendment to the Commerce-Justice-Science Appropriations bill \nthat would prevent the DOJ from using this very same theory.\n  I hope that we will continue to take a stand against this flawed \nlogic and theory and promote sound business practices.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  With that, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I wish to claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I rise in opposition to this amendment. \nIt would nullify a critical enforcement tool that has been used, for \nexample, to rule against discrimination and racially discriminatory \nzoning requirements, practices that exclude families with children from \nhousing, discrimination by lenders, zoning requirements that \ndiscriminate against group homes housing individuals with disabilities. \nIt is a critical enforcement tool, and it would be a very, very bad \nmistake to pass this amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine \nWaters), the ranking member of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Madam Chair, I rise in strong \nopposition to this amendment. I am very surprised that this amendment \nis being brought by my friend, Mr. Garrett.\n  Mr. Garrett's amendment seeks to empower HUD's efforts in enforcing \nthe Fair Housing Act in such a way that relies on the disparate impact \ndoctrine. It weakens our ability to protect Americans from \ndiscriminatory policies that deny them access to quality housing, \nquality neighborhood schools, and other resources.\n  The disparate impact doctrine is a very effective legal tool that has \nbeen used for decades to address seemingly neutral policies that have \nthe effect of discriminating against protected classes.\n  The disparate impact doctrine provides legal redress for victims of \nhidden discrimination. It ensures that women cannot be evicted from \ntheir apartments solely because they were victims of domestic violence, \nand it ensures that veterans with disabilities are not barred from \nliving in certain places solely because of the lack of accommodations \nfor their disability. This amendment ignores the realities of harmful \ndiscrimination in our Nation today, and it would eliminate well-\nestablished, decades-old protections for American families.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green), another outstanding Financial Services member.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Madam Chair, this amendment would absolutely, \ntotally, and completely allow discrimination against our veterans. If \nyou are a veteran and you need a service animal and if there is an area \nthat is set aside with no pets allowed, that service animal can become \na pet. We cannot allow veterans to be discriminated against.\n  With reference to this amendment being a theory, all 11 circuit \ncourts have upheld it. It is not a theory. It is a standard. It is a \nstandard that the courts adhere to, and it is a standard we ought not \nabrogate. We must continue.\n  I am absolutely, totally, and completely opposed to this amendment, \nand I beg that my colleagues would go on record as being opposed to it \nas well.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield to the gentleman from Florida \n(Mr. Diaz-Balart).\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I am wary of considering an amendment \non a rule and regulation that is currently pending before the Supreme \nCourt. The sponsor of the amendment is a good man, but I would hope \nthat we would wait for the Court to issue its ruling and then the \ncommittee of jurisdiction can properly debate and consider what, if \nany, legislative action should be taken. For those reasons, I urge a \n``no'' vote on this amendment.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. I thank the gentleman for yielding me the time, and I \nstrenuously urge all Members to vote ``no'' on this particular \namendment.\n  The fact is that residential segregation in this country has limited \nopportunities for people for so many years. And I don't mean \nsegregation just in terms of race--people who are excluded because of \nrace, because of gender, because of all types of reasons.\n  If we say that disparate impact has no place, then we will be \nprecluded from looking into how disparity just causes people to have \ndifferent chances to live the American Dream. We will be consigned to \nhaving to find a smoking gun or intent before we can take action to try \nto make this country fairer and more open.\n  This is a very bad amendment, and I urge all Members to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I yield back the balance of \nmy time.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Chair, how much time remains?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New Jersey has 1 minute \nremaining.\n  Mr. GARRETT. The gentleman said, ``The fact is.'' Well, everything we \nhave heard for the last 5 minutes as the facts has absolutely nothing \nto do with this bill. This bill has nothing to do with vets and service \nanimals. This bill has nothing to do with domestic violence and women \nnot being able to be in the house. This has nothing to do with any of \nthe weakening of State standards whatsoever.\n  This bill basically simply says that, if a lender to you says that \nyou live in a wooden house versus a stone house, there might be \ndifferent rates for your insurance. It says that, if your house is \nmiles from a fire department and your house is right next to the \nfirehouse, there might be different rates for the insurance and the \nmortgages and the loans you get on that house. Those are not \ndiscriminatory practices. Those are reasonable practices that \nbusinesses enter into. It has nothing to do with all of the examples \njust given.\n  This bill says we should continue to go after and prosecute when \nthere is evidence of discrimination and intentional discrimination. \nThis bill will not end that. This bill will not end your ability to \nlook into the examples the last gentleman just raised. It would simply \nsay that businesses should be allowed to use standard rationales in \ntheir risk analysis, whether it is debt-to-income ratio or construction \nmaterials and the like.\n  For those reasons, along with the other reasons I have already said \nand the host of organizations that support this legislation, and that \nthis House just passed last week on the CJS bill, we should do so again \ntonight.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New Jersey \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Ellison\n\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available in this Act may \n     be used to enter into a contract with any person whose \n     disclosures of a proceeding with a disposition listed in \n     section 2313(c)(1) of title 41, United States Code, in the \n     Federal Awardee Performance and Integrity Information System \n     include the term ``Fair Labor Standards Act'' and such \n     disposition is listed as ``willful'' or ``repeated''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H3981]]\n\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, this amendment simply says that the United \nStates Government should not give appropriations and pay contracts for \npeople or companies who have been found to have willful or repeated \nviolations of the Fair Labor Standards Act. In other words, if you have \nrepeatedly and willfully stolen the wages of workers and you have a \nFederal contract, then you are not the kind of contractor who the \nAmerican people, through the U.S. Congress, want to do business with.\n  No hard-working American should ever have to worry that her employer \nwill refuse to pay her when she works overtime or take money out of her \npaycheck, especially if she works for a Federal contractor. The \npractice is known as wage theft. Right now, Federal contractors who \nviolate the Fair Labor Standards Act are still allowed to apply for \nFederal contracts.\n  This amendment, which my colleagues from the Progressive Caucus join \nme in, will ensure that funds may not be used to enter into a contract \nwith a government contractor that willfully or repeatedly violates the \nFair Labor Standards Act. The amendment ensures that those in violation \nof the law do not get taxpayer support and should not get the rewards \nthat other good contractors receive.\n  It is important to point out to Members contemplating this amendment \nthat, if you are a contractor who pays your workers on time, who does \nwhat you are supposed to do, who has avoided willful violations and \nrepeated violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act, you should not, as \na good contractor, have to compete with somebody who gets a competitive \nadvantage by stealing the pay of their workers. We should have good \ncontractors competing for contracts, not contractors who make willful, \nrepeated violations of the Fair Labor Standards Act.\n  This amendment relies upon violations reported to the Federal Awardee \nPerformance and Integrity Information System.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  That system looks back 5 years to review criminal, civil, or \nadministrative agency actions which have a final disposition.\n  This amendment differs from previous amendments that I have offered \nsimilar to it because it targets actors who willfully or repeatedly \nengage in wage theft. The amendment would ensure that a single \ninadvertent violation would not disqualify a contractor, but it would \nshow clearly that someone who had made repeated and willful violations \nwould not be able to benefit from the contract.\n  I urge Members to vote in favor of this particular amendment because \na penny worked for and a penny earned must be a penny paid; \nparticularly when that penny is derived from a company with a Federal \ncontract, we have a right to believe that we are going to be treated in \nan honest way.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I want to commend my friend \nfrom Minnesota for offering this amendment. Every worker is entitled to \nreceive pay, fair pay, for the hours they work. We know, unfortunately, \nthere are employers, as the gentleman has stated, who refuse to pay for \novertime, who make their employees work off the clock, who refuse to \npay the minimum wage. These things go on.\n  The least we can do is take steps to ensure that those employers \ndon't receive new Federal contracts. That is what the gentleman's \namendment does. I commend him for offering it and urge colleagues to \nsupport him.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Minnesota has 1\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman for the \nsupport for this amendment.\n  Let me just point out a few things for Members contemplating this \namendment.\n  An important think tank looked at this question and found that in \ntotal, the average low-wage worker loses a stunning $2,600 a year in \nunpaid wages, representing about 15 percent of their earned income.\n  One thing that I believe Democrats and Republicans can agree on is \nthat, if you break your back on the job all day long trying to earn a \nliving and you don't get paid what you are supposed to get paid and \nyour check is light, we all have to agree that that is wrong.\n  I expect to have an all green board up there because to do otherwise \nwould say that you want to stand on the side of the wage thieves, the \nones who are willfully and repeatedly making violations of the Fair \nLabor Standards Act.\n  I think that, as the United States Congress, we should stand together \nand say a penny worked is a penny that is going to be paid, and we are \ngoing to insist upon it.\n  Finally, I just want to say that breaking the law is a bipartisan \nproblem. Nobody can stand with the contractors who do this. It is one \nthing to underpay your workers in a way that is consistent with the law \nby paying them the Federal minimum wage rate--I want to raise it; we \nmay not agree on that--but for sure, we have got to agree that, for \npeople who work for Federal contractors, we have got to insist that the \ncontractors who pay these workers even less than they have earned \nshould not benefit from a Federal contract.\n  To help the workers, we have to do this, and to help the honest \nFederal contractors, we have to do this.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, the gentleman's amendment is obviously \nvery well intentioned.\n  However, the amendment, as drafted, is so broad that, for example, a \ncontractor could be excluded for something as minor as failing to \ndisplay a poster in a break room. Again, it is well intentioned.\n  We have to remember something. We fund a lot of contracts in this \nbill, everything from phone service to the computer systems that ensure \nan orderly and efficient air space. Potentially, this amendment could \neliminate a number of those transportation-industry-dependent \ncontracts.\n  Nobody wants to allow for lawbreaking; but, because it is so broadly \ndrafted, the unintended consequences, I think, that folks could be \ncaught in this are a lot more than I think many folks understand.\n  Again, though it is a well-intentioned amendment, I would urge a \n``no'' vote on this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 28 Offered by Mr. Emmer of Minnesota\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     used to carry out any enrichment as defined in Appendix A to \n     part 611 of title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, for any \n     New Start grant request.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Minnesota and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Minnesota.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Madam Chair, I rise to address an issue that \nis playing a role in crippling America's transportation system by \ndriving our deficits and exacerbating the need for bailouts of the \nhighway trust fund. As we debate how to fund transportation, one of the \nmost vital functions of government, this body is being forced to make \nhard choices.\n  I want to thank Chairman Diaz-Balart, the ranking member, and the \nmembers of the subcommittee for their\n\n[[Page H3982]]\n\nwork on bringing this appropriations bill to the floor. Their work is \ndefinitely appreciated by me and my constituents. That said, it is \ninconceivable to me that, as we kick the can on a long-term \ntransportation authorization bill, we continue to allow frivolous \nspending on transit projects.\n  As important as New Starts transit projects are to my State and my \ndistrict, one would think that every last available dollar would go \ntowards ensuring transit New Starts have the funding needed to make a \nline operational and as cost effective as possible.\n  Madam Chair, that is not what is happening. Within Federal grant \napplications, extras are being included that can dramatically raise the \ncost of transit New Starts.\n  Excessive enrichments such as artwork, landscaping, and bicycle and \npedestrian improvements such as sidewalks, paths, plazas, site and \nstation furniture, site lighting, signage, public artwork, bike \nfacilities, and permanent fencing are included in the overall grant \napplication.\n  Even more shocking is that the Federal Transit Administration doesn't \ninclude these extra costs into the cost-effective measurements for the \noverall cost of the project which serves to deceive taxpayers and \nCongress as to the project's real price tag.\n  Madam Chair, in my district alone, I have cities that have placed a \nmoratorium on new business development due to severe transportation \nissues. It is insane to me and my constituents that we blindly spend \nmoney on the niceties rather than prioritize funds for the necessities.\n  There are numerous reasons that our Federal highway trust fund \ncontinues to run deficits and we will continue to have that debate; but \none place that we can agree, certainly, is that Federal taxpayers \nshould absolutely not be paying for things like artwork, furniture, \nlighting, and bike racks while transportation projects remain \nunfinished across America.\n  I understand the need and desire for transit projects--I have them in \nmy district--which is why I have offered this amendment. We should make \nfunds available to ensure more Federal dollars go to what the hard-\nworking taxpayers who fund these accounts expect, transit projects, \nrather than expensive add-ons that are driving deficits in our transit \naccounts.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, in considering this \namendment, it is important to be very clear about what the amendment \nmeans when it refers to enrichments.\n  This refers to improvements to a transit project like a sidewalk, \npaths, plazas, lighting, and signage, things that can help individuals \nin utilizing transportation infrastructure and ensure that they do so \nin safety.\n  Unfortunately, Madam Chair, there are approximately 4,000 pedestrian \ndeaths, comprising 14 percent of overall traffic fatalities each year. \nThese enrichments are just the kinds of projects that could help reduce \nthe risk for pedestrians, for bicyclers, and other users of our \nsystems.\n  Now, the gentleman offering this amendment is just bordering on \nridicule when he talks about site lighting. Really, site lighting? What \nis more important to promoting safety, promoting visibility, and \ndiscouraging those who would prey on individuals than site lighting?\n  Site lighting is extremely important in improving general safety in \npublic places. It is incredibly important for protecting individuals \nagainst crime, including harassment and assault. That is what we are \ntalking about here.\n  Now, the amount of funding that goes towards such enrichments is \nsmall relative to other expenditures, but it is a commonsense way that \nwe can enhance our transportation projects, we can broaden their use, \nand, above all, we can ensure that they are safe for all users.\n  It is an unwise amendment, Madam Chair, and I urge its rejection.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Madam Chair, how much time do I have \nremaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman has 2 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Thank you, Madam Chair.\n  I have the utmost respect for my colleague from North Carolina, but \nhe actually makes the argument for the amendment as opposed to opposed \nto it.\n  Yes, it reduces risk for bicyclists and pedestrians when you talk \nabout signage, when you talk about certain lighting, when you talk \nabout certain enhancements that are add-ons to the project that the \nFederal Government and the Federal taxpayer dollars are intended to \nfund.\n  The Federal taxpayer dollars should be going to the transit project \nthat it is intended for, instead of all the extras. The local \nauthorities should be responsible for those.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment. It is a \nclear-cut amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Emmer).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from Minnesota \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Ms. Bass\n\n  Ms. BASS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the spending reduction \n     account), insert the following:\n       Sec. ____.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     may be used by the Federal Transit Administration to \n     implement, administer, or enforce section 18.36(c)(2) of \n     title 49, Code of Federal Regulations, for construction \n     hiring purposes.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentlewoman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from California.\n  Ms. BASS. Madam Chair, as the economy continues to recover, 8.5 \nmillion Americans are still unemployed. Meanwhile, the effectiveness of \nlocal transportation agencies to spur job creation in their local \ncommunities is unnecessarily obstructed by restrictive Department of \nTransportation policies.\n  Limiting the ability of local officials to contribute to targeted job \ngrowth is detrimental to local economies across the United States, \nespecially in communities where many remain jobless.\n  Local hiring and procurement policies have helped to provide quality \njob opportunities to residents in communities hardest hit by the \neconomic downturn.\n  My local hire amendment is designed to help spur local job creation \nthrough federally funded transportation projects nationally.\n  My amendment would prevent the Department of Transportation from \nissuing regulations that prevent local hiring. Specifically, it would \nlimit the regulations and burdens placed on local governmental \nagencies, preserve the competition and cost-effectiveness mandates in \nour current rules that govern Federal transit grants, and give local \ntransportation agencies the necessary flexibility to apply \ngeographically targeted preferences when making hiring decisions for \nfederally funded transit and highway projects.\n  It is important to note that this local hire amendment does not \nrequire transportation agencies to implement local hiring policies. It \nsimply gives local leaders the opportunity to do so if they determine \nit is in the best interest of their communities.\n  Madam Chair, I urge my colleagues to support this important \namendment. It will reduce burdensome regulations and spur local job \ncreation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n\n[[Page H3983]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, (before the short title), insert \n     the following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used by the Administrator of the Federal Aviation \n     Administration to institute an administrative or civil action \n     (as defined in section 47107 of title 49, United States Code) \n     against the sponsor of the East Hampton Airport in East \n     Hampton, NY.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom New York and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, I am proud to represent a district that is \nhome to some of the most scenic destinations in the country, and all \nforms of transportation are part of our tourism economy. Yet, with the \nhigh season upon us, many of my constituents are finding themselves \nbewildered by actions of the FAA. Federal agencies ought to stand by \ntheir word and keep their commitments to Members of Congress and to the \ncitizens we represent.\n  In 2012, the FAA made assurances to my predecessor that, in light of \na 2005 court settlement between the FAA and a community group, the town \nof East Hampton, New York, would not be subject to certain regulations \nafter December 31, 2014, when certain grant assurances expired and, \nthus, could adopt restrictions on the use of their airport without FAA \napproval.\n  The FAA has written that the town can proceed on certain course and \nnot fear FAA reprisal for their actions. Earlier this spring, the \ndemocratically elected town board passed a set of airport regulations--\nall predicated on the FAA's written assurance to not take negative \naction against the town. Recently, however, the FAA has started \nwavering.\n  I am offering this amendment, which is 100 percent consistent with \nthe prior written assurance made by the FAA. This amendment will hold \nthe FAA to its word on this critical local issue, a local issue that \nshould have a local solution--bring all sides to the table to improve \nthe quality of life on the East End this high season.\n  Madam Chair, I urge all of my colleagues to support this effort. The \npeople of the East End communities across Long Island and around \nAmerica deserve straight answers and follow-through from government \nagencies.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I do this, though, simply \nto express some concerns about this amendment and others like it that \nwe have heard over the course of this debate.\n  I do have some concerns about limiting flight path options for the \nFAA in a piecemeal fashion from the floor of the House. The FAA needs \nto have appropriate flexibility to use flight paths in the wisest ways, \nparticularly if there are safety risks for incoming or outgoing \naircraft. I do think, however, that the FAA needs to take note and be \nmore responsive to the concerns that have been raised in these \nlimitation amendments, and there have been several this evening and in \nthe prior days of this debate.\n  I also want to observe that the FAA's authorization expires at the \nend of the fiscal year. Now, as I mentioned in the debate last week, \nour colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee are \nexploring options to reform the FAA, including separating the FAA from \nthe Department of Transportation, allowing it more independence over \nthe use of its resources.\n  I would say this is an important time to encourage caution, to \nencourage our colleagues to think very carefully about a more \nindependent FAA, one that does not have to rely on annual \nappropriations. Would it be as attentive to concerns such as those \nraised by communities and by our colleagues here tonight? We ought to \nmove very cautiously in this area.\n  I strongly urge the FAA Administrator, in observing this parade of \nlimitation amendments, to take note to ensure that the FAA is more \nattentive to the concerns that are raised by communities when \ndeveloping their new flight procedures.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Madam Chair, I thank the gentleman from North Carolina \nfor his comments. Certainly, concerns within the First Congressional \nDistrict of New York are the reason this amendment is being offered. I \nstrongly urge my colleagues to support this important amendment so as \nto ensure that these local issues have local control.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Zeldin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Lewis\n\n  Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Page 156, after line 15, insert the following new section:\n       Sec. 416.  Notwithstanding Mortgagee Letter 2015-12 of the \n     Department of Housing and Urban Development (dated April 30, \n     2015) or any other provision of law, the Secretary of Housing \n     and Urban Development shall--\n       (1) implement the Mortgagee Optional Election (MOE) \n     Assignment for home equity conversion mortgages (as set forth \n     in Mortgagee Letter 2015-03, dated January 29, 2015), \n     allowing additional flexibility for non-borrowing spouses to \n     meet its requirements; and\n       (2) provide for a 5-year delay in foreclosure in the case \n     of any other home equity conversion mortgage that--\n       (A) has an FHA Case Number assigned before August, 4, 2014; \n     and\n       (B) has a last surviving borrower who has died and who has \n     a non-borrowing surviving spouse who does not qualify for the \n     Mortgagee Optional Election and who, but for the death of \n     such borrowing spouse, would be able to remain in the \n     dwelling subject to the mortgage.\n\n  Mr. LEWIS (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I reserve a point of order on the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida reserves a point of \norder.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman from Georgia and a \nMember opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Madam Chair, I rise today to offer an amendment to H.R. \n2577.\n  When I was first elected in 1987, Congress created the first \nnationwide Home Equity Conversion Mortgage program. Also known as \nreverse mortgages, these loans differ from traditional mortgages and \nhave very good intentions. They are designed to help seniors stay in \ntheir homes by using the values of their properties as a means for \nliving more stable and independent lives. Since the borrowers must be \n62 years of age or older, lenders often advise some borrowers to remove \nyounger spouses from the titles. This allows them to be eligible for \nthe program or to qualify for greater loans. Unfortunately, Madam \nChair, many seniors are experiencing challenges in the program's actual \noperation.\n  For example, a citizen in my district, Mrs. Helen Griffin, reached \nout to my office last year. She and her husband took out a reverse \nmortgage on their home. In order to qualify, she agreed to be taken off \nthe title. The lender promised that she could be added back on the \ntitle at a later date if they refinanced. Unfortunately, she and her \nhusband had no idea how expensive refinancing would be. Like so many \nothers, Mrs. Griffin was now in a dangerous financial situation. Upon \nthe reverse mortgage borrower's death, a surviving spouse is required \nto pay the full balance due on the loan--or 95 percent of the value of \nthe property--simply to remain in their home.\n  My amendment would protect people like Mrs. Griffin and allow them \nmore time to protect themselves from foreclosure. I think we must do \neverything in our power to inform and protect unknowing senior couples \nfrom the danger of not only losing their loved ones but also their nest \neggs.\n  Madam Chair, I want to thank the gentleman from Florida and his staff \nfor working so hard on this legislation and for making a commitment to \nthis issue. I look forward to continuing to work with the gentleman to \nmake sure that we do all that we can to realize\n\n[[Page H3984]]\n\nthe full goal of this important program.\n  Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to withdraw the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Denham\n\n  Mr. DENHAM. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. ___.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used for high-speed rail in the State of California or for \n     the California High-Speed Rail Authority, nor may any be used \n     by the Federal Railroad Administration to administer a grant \n     agreement with the California High-Speed Rail Authority that \n     contains a tapered matching requirement.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Madam Chair, once again, I am here one more year, \noffering another amendment to end this incredible waste of taxpayer \ndollars.\n  I have been clear about my position on high-speed rail. High-speed \nrail has a future in the United States. It just can't be done as it is \nbeing done in California--$70 billion over budget and completely \nchanged from the proposition that the voters originally voted on. If \nthe Governor and the Obama administration are committed to bringing \nthis high-speed rail to fruition, then it should go back before the \nvoters and actually uphold the will of the voters.\n  This is a case study. If you want to get it wrong, if you want to end \nhigh-speed rail across the Nation, then go ahead and continue to waste \ndollars in California on a project that continues to have many \ndifferent flaws. This authority in California is not only demolishing \nhomes, but it is demolishing businesses. The only way they can continue \nto get right-of-way is through eminent domain--slashing farms, tearing \ndown businesses, and now kicking people out of their homes.\n  Today, it was announced that, instead of ending the initial \nconstruction segment in the outskirts of Bakersfield, the rail work \nwill now stop just north of Shafter--a full 8 miles of what the \noriginal segment was--with still no operating segment that will allow \npeople to travel from one end of the State to the other or even from \none end of the valley to the other. Currently, if you ride Amtrak from \nnorth to south, you have to get off in Bakersfield, get on a bus, go \nover the mountains, and take that bus until it hits rail in the LA \narea. Now we are going to have a bus in Shafter. This just doesn't make \nany sense. They continue to change over and over again.\n  In the wake of Amtrak accident 188 and with the incredible focus on \nsafety that is necessary to pass PTC across the country, why wouldn't \nwe take high-speed rail dollars and actually fix the safety \nimprovements that need to be done in California? Where is the \ncommitment to safety? Let's fix the positive train control and make \nsure that our trains in California are safe, and let's end this project \nthat continues to waste taxpayer dollars.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, this amendment is a new \ntwist on an amendment that the gentleman from California has been \noffering over the last few years. The net result, however, is the same. \nIt would stop the development of California high-speed rail in its \ntracks, so to speak.\n  The amendment would prevent the Federal Railroad Administration from \nadministering the funding that California received under the American \nRecovery and Reinvestment Act. This would have the effect of preventing \nthe FRA staff from providing routine project delivery oversight or \ninvoicing on all of the environmental work funded under the grant \nagreement.\n  Do we want the Federal Government to conduct oversight on the \nprojects that receive Federal funding?\n  Furthermore, with the Recovery Act funds set to expire at the end of \nfiscal year 2017, the amendment would make it virtually impossible for \nthe California High-Speed Rail Authority to spend all of its funding by \nthe deadline. It would put the completion of the project in grave \njeopardy. In January, Governor Brown and other California leaders came \ntogether to mark the commencement of construction for California's \nhigh-speed rail project. The project is expected to create 20,000 jobs \nper year.\n  I include for the Record two letters--one from industry and one from \nlabor groups. Both support the California high-speed rail project.\n                                                     May 12, 2015.\n     Hon. Mario Diaz-Balart,\n     Chairman, Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related \n         Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives, Washington DC.\n     Hon. David E. Price,\n     Ranking Member, Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and \n         Related Agencies, Committee on Appropriations, House of \n         Representatives, Washington DC.\n       We are writing to voice our strong support for public works \n     investment, including recent efforts to develop, construct \n     and deliver high-speed intercity passenger rail service for \n     the first time in American history. Specifically, we oppose \n     the inclusion of harmful riders in the fiscal year (FY) 2016 \n     Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act that would target or impede \n     efforts to construct any specific high-speed rail projects, \n     including the California High-Speed Rail program.\n       American public works infrastructure is at an inflection \n     point, and this will be a pivotal year as the U.S. Congress \n     deliberates Federal highway, transit, rail and aviation \n     policy bills, and debates how to fund Federal transportation \n     programs that will meet our Nation's future mobility needs. \n     Meanwhile, the State of California, in partnership with the \n     Federal government, has made significant investments in \n     intercity high-speed passenger rail. In January, the \n     California High-Speed Rail Authority (the Authority) hosted a \n     ``Groundbreaking Ceremony'' for the California High-Speed \n     Rail program to mark the commencement of sustained \n     construction, which will accelerate this year and create \n     20,000 jobs annually for the next five years. Additionally, \n     the bids on the Authority's first two construction contracts, \n     valued at almost $2.2 billion, came in significantly under \n     budget.\n       To date, the State of California has committed the majority \n     of the funding that has been committed to build the program's \n     initial operating section. And last year, the Authority \n     secured the ongoing appropriation of 25 percent of all future \n     California State Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund auction \n     proceeds for the high-speed rail program--a dedicated revenue \n     stream capable of producing hundreds of millions of dollars \n     annually for direct funding or financing. The private sector \n     is now also exhibiting a great deal of interest in investing \n     in the program.\n       We believe that America is a country with bold vision that \n     does big things, and we believe that robust investment in \n     infrastructure benefits our industry and the American public. \n     Congressional efforts to impede new public works projects in \n     any one state send the wrong message to local, state and \n     private sector investors in every state who are willing to \n     invest in sorely needed new infrastructure projects in any \n     mode of transportation.\n       Moreover, the California High-Speed Rail program represents \n     the first ever effort to build an intercity high-speed \n     passenger rail system in this country. California is at the \n     forefront of developing an entirely new American industry \n     where investments in and the development of new technologies, \n     manufacturing capabilities, and innovative business practices \n     will create high-skilled, good paying jobs and benefit \n     American public works for decades. The Authority is also \n     operating under a Community Benefits Agreement with skilled \n     building trades and contractors to promote training and \n     apprenticeship programs and provide opportunities for \n     disadvantaged workers. Halting or impeding this seminal \n     program at its outset will set our industry back and \n     jeopardize thousands of new middle-class jobs.\n       We believe that the California High-Speed Rail program may \n     serve as model of a Federal, state, industry and labor \n     partnership that creates jobs, links economies and \n     communities, preserves our environment and builds a \n     sustainable future. Therefore, we respectfully oppose the \n     inclusion of harmful riders in the fiscal year (FY) 2016 \n     Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related \n     Agencies Appropriations Act that would target or impede \n     efforts to construct any specific high-speed rail project, \n     including the California High-Speed Rail program.\n         American Train Dispatchers Association; Brotherhood of \n           Electrical Workers; Brotherhood of Railway Signalmen; \n           International Association of Machinists and Aerospace \n           Workers; International Brotherhood of Boilermakers; \n           International Union of Operating Engineers; North \n           America's Building Trades Unions; SMART Transportation \n           Division; State Building and Construction Trades \n           Council of California; Transportation Communications \n           International\n\n[[Page H3985]]\n\n           Union; Transportation Trades Department, AFL-CIO; \n           Transport Workers Union International; UNITE HERE!\n                                  ____\n\n                                                     June 1, 2015.\n     Hon.

Jack Reed, Ranking Member,\n     Subcommittee on Transportation, HUD, and Related Agencies, \n         Committee on Appropriations, U.S. Senate, Washington DC.\n       Dear Senators Collins and Reed: As you prepare to consider \n     the Senate's version of the fiscal year (FY) 2016 ``THUD'' \n     appropriations bill, we are writing to ask you to avoid using \n     the measure to set up roadblocks to transportation \n     investment. Specifically, we wanted to make you aware of \n     policy language contained in the House version of the FY 2016 \n     THUD bill that seeks to block federal approvals for the \n     California high speed rail program.\n       In January, Governor Jerry Brown and other California \n     leaders commemorated the beginning of construction on the \n     nation's largest infrastructure project: a high-speed \n     railroad connecting Southern and Northern California through \n     the Central Valley. This program, in which the state will be \n     the primary funder, will bring together public and private \n     funds to create a transformative investment for California \n     and the nation. During construction, the program will create \n     20,000 jobs per year. After it is open, it will help ensure a \n     sustainable and growing economic future for California.\n       By including language in its appropriations bill intended \n     to withhold federal support and approvals for the project, \n     the House is sending a message to all the states that major \n     infrastructure projects--even after receiving federal grants \n     and multiple federal approvals--are at risk of being halted \n     in their tracks based on political considerations in \n     Washington, DC.\n       In a May 11 letter to House appropriators, OMB Director \n     Shaun Donovan also expressed the Administration's opposition \n     to the language in the House bill dealing with the California \n     High-Speed Rail program.\n       We believe that the California high speed rail program will \n     serve as model of a Federal, state, industry and labor \n     partnership that creates jobs, links economies and \n     communities, preserves our environment and builds a \n     sustainable future. Therefore, we respectfully request that \n     your subcommittee produce a bill free of any harmful riders \n     in the FY 2016 Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, \n     and Related Agencies Appropriations Act that would impede \n     efforts to construct any specific high-speed rail project, \n     including the California High-Speed Rail program.\n       Thank you for your attention to our views.\n           Sincerely,\n     American Council of Engineering Companies.\n     American Public Transportation Association.\n     American Road and Transportation Builders Association.\n     Association of Independent Passenger Rail Operators.\n     Railway Supply Institute.\n     U.S. High Speed Rail Association.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. The administration has been very clear \nthat it strongly opposes provisions in this bill that would restrict \nthe development of high-speed rail. Moreover, the California \ncongressional delegation has overwhelmingly opposed these restrictive \nriders in the past, and I am happy to stand with them again tonight, \nurging my colleagues to oppose this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DENHAM. I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. LaMalfa).\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Madam Chair, I thank my colleague, Mr. Denham, for his \nhard work on curtailing this waste of taxpayer money.\n  Here are just a few of the headlines currently on the Internet about \nCalifornia's high-speed rail project: ``Why California's High-Speed \nRail is Off Track''; ``High-Speed Rail Brings Fears of Gutted \nCommunities and Noise''; ``High-Speed Rail Foes Cite Noise, Property \nValue Concerns''; ``Protesters Rail Against High-Speed Rail Route \nProposal''; ``High-Speed Rail Opponents Expected to Converge at LA \nMeeting''; finally, ``What an Unholy Mess This California Bullet Train \nMeeting is Going to Be.''\n  This is all reflected in southern California planning for a route \nthat isn't even planned yet; yet billions of dollars of the California \ntaxpayers--but even more importantly, in this body, Federal taxpayer \ndollars--are being planned and spent and will be spent if we don't stop \nthis here tonight for a route, for a plan, for a project that isn't \neven a plan.\n  You couldn't send astronauts into outer space without a plan to bring \nthem back, yet they are hell-bent on this project to spend the money as \nfast as they can without having any idea where the route is going to \ngo; and we are seeing people all over California protest it, for a \nproject that has tripled in price from what the voters saw as Prop 1A \njust 7 years ago. Yet here we are 7 years later with a groundbreaking \nthat consists of knocking down some of the houses and buildings without \nany track being laid, without a real project they can actually count on \nbeing a true route under Prop 1A from San Francisco to Los Angeles. We \nneed to put a stop to this now.\n  Mr. DENHAM. Madam Chair, as you have heard, this project is $70 \nbillion over budget. It has a shortfall of $87 billion. If my \ncolleagues in California, if the minority party of this body would like \nto continue on with this project, then where is the $87 billion? I \ndon't see a proposal from them, nor do I see a proposal from the \nGovernor for $87 billion.\n  We have priorities in the State. As you may know, we are going \nthrough a big drought in California. We would love to create the jobs. \nLet's utilize the billions of dollars that would be spent on high-speed \nrail over the next several decades on water projects that would \nactually help our infrastructure, our agriculture, as well as people \nthroughout California.\n  There is a good way to spend taxpayer dollars. This is not it. We \ncannot afford to leave the next generation with an $87 billion hole \nthat will continue to not only put California in further debt, but will \ncontinue to show that our priorities are misguided.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Denham).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Peters\n\n  Mr. PETERS. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used in contravention of Executive Order 11246 (relating \n     to Equal Employment Opportunity).\n\n  Mr. PETERS (during the reading). Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the amendment be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom California?\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Objection is heard.\n  The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Peters) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. PETERS. Madam Chair, no American should be fired, denied a job or \na place to live for being who they are or because of whom they love. \nEvery American deserves to be treated equally and with dignity.\n  My amendment would make a simple change to the text of the bill but \nmake an important difference in the lives of LGBT Americans across the \ncountry. President Obama signed an executive order in July 2014 to \nprohibit Federal contractors from discriminating on the basis of sexual \norientation or gender identity against their employees or those seeking \nemployment. This amendment would affirm that order by ensuring that no \nfunds in the bill are used to conflict with the President's rule. It \nwould demonstrate to the American people that Congress supports \nfairness and equality for all.\n  Today, only 18 States and the District of Columbia have \nnondiscrimination protections for LGBT communities in sexual \norientation and gender identity in both employment and housing. That \nmeans that in a number of States an LGBT individual can get married in \nthe morning and fired from his or her job or denied an application in \nthe afternoon for no other reason than the change in marital status. \nThat is unacceptable. As a country that believes in equality for all \npeople, we must do better.\n  June is Pride Month, and in cities and towns across the country, \nmillions\n\n[[Page H3986]]\n\nof Americans will celebrate the vibrant diversity of the LGBT \ncommunities who are enriching our society. As we look forward toward \nfull nondiscrimination, we can help provide at least a small window of \nequality for all members of the LGBT community by passing this \namendment. I urge my colleagues to stand on the side of equality and \nagainst discrimination and support this amendment.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Price).\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Madam Chair, I simply want to commend him for offering this amendment \nand offer my enthusiastic support.\n  In various ways, we ensure that the Federal Government doesn't pay \nsubstandard wages, doesn't do other things that are detrimental in the \nworkplace or that set a low bar, set a low standard. This amendment \nadds to that, I think, in a very constructive way. It adds to worker \nprotections by preventing any company that does business with the \nGovernment from firing employees based on who they are and whom they \nlove.\n  I commend the gentleman. It is a fine amendment. I hope colleagues \nwill support it.\n  Mr. PETERS. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the ayes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n                    Amendment Offered by Mr. Mullin\n\n  Mr. MULLIN. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to enforce subpart B of part 750 of title 23, Code of \n     Federal Regulations, regarding signs for service clubs and \n     religious notices as defined in section 153(p) of such part.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Oklahoma.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Madam Chair, churches and civic groups are in danger of \nbeing forced to tear down their informational highway signs. Some of \nthese signs have stood for decades. The current law states that \nreligious and civic groups can no longer have signs larger than 8 \nsquare feet. That is 2 feet by 4 feet. However, ``Free Coffee'' signs \nin the same law are unlimited in size.\n  My amendment would allow churches and civic organizations to keep \ntheir signs that are larger than 8 square feet. This is a reasonable \namendment. It would be beneficial to the safety of the traveling public \nand allow our Federal Government to focus its resources on more \ncritical infrastructure uses. We need to be focusing on repairing our \nroads and bridges, not tearing down church signs.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, this amendment would \nsuspend enforcement of rules governing the size of billboards for \nreligious organizations and service clubs. These rules have been in \nplace for a long time--since 1975.\n  As I understand it, the gentleman is seeking to increase the \nallowable size of billboards for religious organizations and service \nclubs from 8 square feet to 32 square feet. This isn't the appropriate \nplace to deal with this issue. We have barely heard of it before it was \noffered. We certainly haven't had extensive deliberations, haven't \nheard from State authorities, local authorities, people who have a \nstake in this. It needs to be reviewed and debated within the context \nof the surface transportation authorization.\n  The authorizing committees are in the midst of working on the new \nauthorization bill right now. That is where I would suggest the \ngentleman might want to take his concerns. This is not the place here \ntonight. I urge colleagues to reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MULLIN. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nBridenstine), my colleague.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Madam Chair, I rise today to give my very strong \nsupport to this amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma.\n  The Federal Government creates a regulation. That regulation says \nthat, if you are a church or if you are a civic group or if you are \nsome kind of community organization, you are limited in the size of \nyour sign to 8 square feet, 2 feet by 4 feet; however, if you are a \nbillboard company, you can have 25 feet by 60 feet. This is \ndiscrimination against churches and civic groups that I think is \ninappropriate.\n  I would also say that the State of Oklahoma has weighed in. The State \nof Oklahoma would like to regulate the signs in the State of Oklahoma. \nI think that is absolutely not only appropriate, but I think it is \nconstitutional that the State have the right to regulate the signs in \nits own State.\n  Here is the sad part that I would like to let people know and \nunderstand. If the State of Oklahoma chooses not to enforce this \nFederal regulation that is discriminatory, then the State of Oklahoma \nrisks losing 10 percent of its Federal funding for roads. This is the \nFederal Government using Oklahoma taxpayer dollars against the State of \nOklahoma. It is Federal bullying.\n  This amendment offered by my colleague from Oklahoma is a good \namendment. I fully support it, and I highly recommend my colleagues \nsupport it.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Our churches and our civic organizations have better ways \nto spend their limited resources than tearing down signs. Our States \nwould have more time on their hands to be looking at our roads and \nbridges if they didn't have to go out and enforce a law that our State \ndoesn't even want. If we could simply be focusing on the important \nissues, like our roads and our bridges, not wasting Federal dollars and \nState dollars on enforcing an out-of-date law, this wouldn't even \nsimply be an issue.\n  I would urge my colleagues to support this commonsense amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grothman\n\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     under the heading ``Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development--Housing Programs--Project-Based Rental \n     Assistance'' may be used for any family who is not an elderly \n     family or a disabled family (as such terms are defined in \n     section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of 1937 (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437a(b)) and who was not receiving project-based \n     rental assistance under section 8 of such Act (42 U.S.C. \n     1437f) as of October 1, 2015, and the amount otherwise \n     provided under such heading is reduced by $300,000,000.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n\n                              {time}  2145\n\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. The first thing we should look at when we look at this \nbudget is cost, and this is one program that is going up in cost. We \nare still in a position in this budget in which we anticipate borrowing \nabout 14 percent. We have the $18 trillion debt.\n  This amendment will reduce the cost in this budget by $300 million, \nwhich by itself is nothing to sneeze at, but the real reason for this \namendment is the perverse incentives in Section 8 and other tenant-\nbased rental assistance programs.\n  All of these programs are conditioned upon, first, having little or \nno income. It is wrong to encourage people not to work. As I get around \nmy district, I find so many employers who cannot find employees today, \nin part, because they feel it pays better not to work.\n\n[[Page H3987]]\n\n  Secondly, and more importantly, this program, like so many other \nprograms designed to help poor people, has a huge marriage penalty \nassociated with it. In order to get this low-income housing, it almost \nencourages one--it does encourage one--to have children without a \nmother and father at home. To continue this program or even expand this \nprogram to more people is to just destroy the moral fiber of America.\n  This amendment is tailored to not include or not reduce low-income \nhousing for the elderly or disabled. I am aware of the fact that we \nhave people in this country on Social Security maybe making $500 a \nmonth, and they may find it very difficult to find anywhere else to \nlive, so I am not chipping away at that part of the program.\n  I will give you an example. In my district, I talked to someone who \nran one of these low-income projects--not Section 8, but more of a \nproject-based one--and they were very proud of what nice, low-income \nhousing it was. It was very nice, very generous. They pointed out the \nonly thing you needed to do to get these apartments for $25 a month was \nto not have a job. Now, can you imagine anything so foolish as to \nencourage people to not have a job?\n  In any event, I hope this amendment passes. I hope there is nobody \nelse in this room who would have any objection to this commonsense \namendment designed to restore the moral fiber that made America great.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, if there is an air of \nfamiliarity about this amendment and what the gentleman has just said \nabout his amendment, listeners may want to tune in and remind \nthemselves of virtually this same amendment being offered last week.\n  I should begin by saying that tenant-based Section 8 housing--a \nprogram, by the way, that conservatives should love because it is \nmarket based and the tenants pay a substantial portion of their income \nin rent--tenant-based Section 8 housing in this bill is just barely \nheld even, with more or less level funding. Of course, other things in \nthe bill are treated much worse.\n  The gentleman apparently thinks there is too much money in this bill, \ntoo much investment, with thousands on waiting lists across this \ncountry. This amendment would certainly increase those waiting lists.\n  Now, last week, it was $614 million cut; this week, it is a $300 \nmillion cut--so not quite as many people would be evicted. This week, \nthe gentleman is saying that the elderly and the disabled would not be \nevicted. Who does that leave? It leaves everybody else; it leaves \nworking families.\n  I ask anyone in this body to go to their local community house \nauthority and ask about those waiting lists. Ask how many people are \nwaiting for a roof over their head who are willing to work, willing to \nparticipate in financing, but need a leg up, the kind of support that \ntenant-based and project-based Section 8 represents.\n  It escapes me why the gentleman would offer this amendment in a bill \nthat is already at rock bottom.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this amendment, just as we did last \nweek, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. I do not give up hope that, by the time this budget \nrolls around next year, you see the wisdom of the amendment.\n  I think a lot of people get confused when they find waiting lists for \nthis sort of program. If you are handing out apartments for $25 a \nmonth, of course, there are going to be waiting lists; so that is not \nsurprising. Even then, there are certain areas in my State, in my \ndistrict, where they are trying to find people who are not in the local \narea to fill these units because there is an excess of units.\n  Nevertheless, I think you want to think about the perverse incentives \nyou have in a program in which, the more you work, the more your rent \ngoes up. In order to get in, in the first place, you almost can't work \nat all; and, secondly, what the long-term effect on our society is if \nyou would tell somebody that, if they raise a child out of wedlock, you \nget a free, air-conditioned, maybe two-bedroom, two-bath apartment, but \nif you get married to somebody with a job, you lose that apartment--is \nthat the type of incentive we want for the next generation?\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                   Amendment Offered by Mr. Grothman\n\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill (before the short title), insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act \n     under the heading ``Department of Housing and Urban \n     Development--Public and Indian Housing Programs--Tenant-Based \n     Rental Assistance'' may be used for any family who is not an \n     elderly family or a disabled family (as such terms are \n     defined in section 3(b) of the United States Housing Act of \n     1937 (42 U.S.C. 1437a(b)) and who was not receiving tenant-\n     based rental assistance under section 8 of such Act (42 \n     U.S.C. 1437f) as of October 1, 2015, and the amount otherwise \n     provided under such heading is reduced, the amount specified \n     under such heading for renewals of expiring section 8 tenant-\n     based annual contributions contracts is reduced, and the \n     amount specified under such heading for administrative and \n     other expenses of public housing agencies in administering \n     the section 8 tenant-based rental assistance program) is \n     reduced, by $300,000,000, $210,000,000, and $90,000,000, \n     respectively.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. I think all we talked about in that last amendment \napplies to this amendment, with one additional thing that people should \nfind offensive, because here we are dealing with project-based rental \nassistance.\n  Not only are we encouraging some people not to work very hard, not \nonly are we encouraging people not to raise children in an old-\nfashioned nuclear family, we are also kind of having a strong element \nof corporate welfare here, too, which is something I don't care for.\n  Over time, we have this kind of industry growing up in which you \noperate low-income housing. In some ways, I assume people are entering \ninto it because it is more profitable than a pure, free market sort of \nthing; and I would think that people who are opposed to corporate \nwelfare ought to be opposed to it for that reason as well.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, here we go again with, once \nagain, a reprisal of the amendment offered last week and rejected.\n  The amendment offered tonight separates that amendment in two: \ntenant-based Section 8, project-based Section 8.\n  The argument does apply, I think, to any of this assisted housing. It \nbehooves us to reflect on some numbers, I think. On any given night, \n575,000 of our constituents are homeless, absolutely homeless. That is \n50,000 veterans, by the way.\n  They get on these waiting lists for these Section 8 projects, and the \nwaiting lists often have thousands of names. They finally get into \nSection 8. They are paying a large proportion of their income in rent. \nThey are struggling to get a leg up and struggle to find jobs.\n  By the way, how likely is one to find a job if one is homeless? If \nyou are talking about self-reliance, isn't it better to have a roof \nover your head and have some of the basics of life so you can go out \nand seek work?\n  Evictions, we are talking about evictions here. How does kicking out \nchildren and how does kicking out families promote marriage, for \ngoodness' sake? How does it promote wedlock? How does it promote self-\nreliance? It is likely to promote destitution and desperation.\n  We are a better country than this. I plead with colleagues, look at \nthis amendment closely. Think about what we stand for. Think about the \nfact that this bill is already inadequate. Let's not make it worse.\n\n[[Page H3988]]\n\n  Reject this amendment, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GROTHMAN. First of all, I would like to clarify something in the \namendment. The amendment does not apply to people who were receiving \nrental assistance--and neither did the other amendment--prior to \nOctober 1 of this year. It is not a matter of kicking people out; it is \na matter of not putting any further people on.\n  Furthermore, I think we have to discuss how generous this benefit is. \nThere are so many people in our society who are living with parents, \nliving with other family members, living with roommates, and working to \nafford that rent. To give somebody a freestanding apartment--some of \nthese are very nice apartments, two-bedroom, two-bath, air-conditioned \napartments--without having to work at all to receive that apartment is \njust a horrible incentive.\n  I would ask the gentleman to go back in his district and talk to \npeople who live in the neighborhoods where they have these subsidized \nprojects. One of the things I find is that sometimes people who live in \nmaybe high-end areas and are not familiar with these get confused.\n  I think, if you talk to people who know people who live in this \nsubsidized housing, you will have no problem finding many anecdotes of \npeople who are clearly not hurting materially; and, in order to keep \ntheir subsidies going, they cannot work, work harder, or get raises. \nAbove all, they can't get married.\n  I think you have to ask yourself whether we ought to continue these \nprograms that are around year after year after year or whether it is \nhigh time to look at these programs; change the underlying \nqualifications; change the time limits; change the amount that has to \nbe paid; and, quite frankly, also sometimes look at the very generous \naccommodations that the government is providing, quite frankly, more \ngenerous accommodations than a lot of people who are working quite hard \nhave.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Grothman).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n                     Amendment Offered by Mr. Issa\n\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the amendment.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       At the end of the bill, before the short title, insert the \n     following:\n       Sec. __.  None of the funds made available by this Act may \n     be used to acquire a camera for the purpose of collecting or \n     storing vehicle license plate numbers.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 287, the gentleman \nfrom California and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, this amendment reflects a simple principle. \nThe government does not and should not have unchecked power to track \nAmerican citizens.\n  There are many very legitimate reasons to observe license plates \nusing camera technology. Every day in America, law enforcement drives \nthrough neighborhoods looking for stolen cars. Cameras and computers \nidentify the number of that plate and run it against a database to see \nif it is stolen.\n\n                              {time}  2200\n\n  But again, there is no reason to store that data. The bulk collection \nof the location of every American's automobile is well beyond a \nreasonable standard. It is a difficult one, but it is simple in this \ncase.\n  The Federal Government should not provide money for cameras that \nindiscriminately bulk collect information on where you are at all \ntimes. I hope that this amendment will spark a healthy dialogue similar \nto the one we had on the PATRIOT Act, one in which we agreed that with \na court order you can collect this kind of data, with a court order you \ncan seek it, with a known database of stolen cars or wanted criminals, \nyou can compare a camera image.\n  But the simple collection, in bulk, of your location of your car, 24 \nhours a day, using thousands, tens of thousands or perhaps millions of \ncameras, is far too ``1984'' for Members of this body or the American \npeople.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, this amendment is well-\nintentioned, I realize, but I think it is an overreach and certainly \nnot appropriate for this appropriations bill.\n  Records of license plate information can serve as a helpful clue to \ninvestigators. They can produce leads in criminal cases. This \ninformation is also used routinely by law enforcement and by the \nNational Center for Missing and Exploited Children to help find missing \nchildren.\n  I understand there are legitimate privacy concerns. I share those \nconcerns. But there is already a Federal law that governs the use of \nsuch data. The data is not used to track citizens in real time, despite \nwhat some assert.\n  Putting restrictions on law enforcement's ability to obtain and use \nthis license plate information without really fully exploring the facts \nor giving due consideration to the consequences, this needs to be done \nby the appropriate committees. But doing it here tonight seems risky \nand unreasonable, actually, to expect us to legislate on this matter in \nthe context of this appropriations bill.\n  Madam Chair, I will insert into the Record a letter from the \nFraternal Order of Police and other law enforcement entities asking \nCongress not to limit the use of this information.\n                                                National Fraternal\n\n\n                                              Order of Police,\n\n                                                February 23, 2015.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Harry M. Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. John A. Boehner,\n     Speaker of the House, House of Representatives Washington, \n         DC.\n     Hon. Nancy P. Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Senator McConnell, Mr. Speaker, Senator Reid and \n     Representative Pelosi: I am writing on behalf of the members \n     of the Fraternal Order of Police to express our concern about \n     continued efforts to portray automated license plate \n     recognition (ALPR) as an ongoing, national real-time tracking \n     system operated by law enforcement. This is emphatically not \n     the case.\n       We believe that there is a fundamental misunderstanding as \n     to how ALPR technology is deployed and used by law \n     enforcement and other public safety agencies. Many people, \n     including members of Congress, are under the impression that \n     this technology is being used by our national security \n     apparatus to geotrack our citizens and monitor their \n     movements. Indeed, a Dear Colleague letter circulated last \n     year in support of an amendment defunding this technology was \n     entitled, ``Stop NSA-like geotracking of innocent \n     Americans.''\n       This is not the case. To begin with, ALPR data is simply a \n     photograph of a vehicle's license plate in a public place at \n     a particular point in time. Geotracking is the use of Global \n     Positioning System (GPS) data to track over time the movement \n     of a specific electronic device capable of emitting GPS \n     location information. Conversely, ALPR data is collected \n     anonymously without personally identifying information. A \n     government agency with access to ALPR data may connect that \n     data to personal information from a State's vehicle \n     registration system, but if they do so without a legitimate \n     law enforcement or public safety purpose, then they are in \n     violation of the Drivers' Privacy Protection Act. Any other \n     use of the data would be an unjustifiable violation of \n     privacy and Federal law.\n       Thousands of local, State and Federal law enforcement \n     agencies use ALPR data every day to generate leads in \n     criminal investigations, apprehend murderers, respond to \n     Amber and Silver alerts, find missing children, recover \n     stolen vehicles, and protect our borders. Even something as \n     simple as the use of cameras at traffic lights and toll \n     booths has a beneficial impact on the safety of our roadways.\n       The FOP would also submit that the only difference between \n     the use of ALPR technology and an officer taking down license \n     plate information along with the time, date and location is \n     the efficiency by which the data is collected. Every State in \n     the Republic mandates that every vehicle have a mounted and \n     clearly visible license plate for the specific purpose of \n     contributing to public safety, whether the data is collected \n     by a fellow citizen, law enforcement officer or camera.\n       With these facts in mind, it is our hope that Congress will \n     recognize the substantial benefits this technology makes to \n     public safety and oppose any legislation or amendment that \n     would restrict the use of ALPR by law enforcement.\n       On behalf of the more than 335,000 members of the Fraternal \n     Order of Police, I thank you\n\n[[Page H3989]]\n\n     for your consideration of our views. If I can provide any \n     further information about law enforcement's use of ALPR \n     technology, please do not hesitate to contact me or Executive \n     Director Jim Pasco in my Washington office.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                 Chuck Canterbury,\n     National President.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                    March 9, 2015.\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader,\n     House of Representatives.\n     Hon. Mitch McConnell,\n     Majority Leader.\n     Hon. Harry Reid,\n     Minority Leader, U.S. Senate, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi, Leader McConnell, and \n     Leader Reid: We are deeply concerned about efforts to portray \n     automated license plate recognition (ALPR) technology as a \n     national real-time tracking capability for law enforcement. \n     The fact is that this technology and the data it generates is \n     not used to track people in real time. ALPR is used every day \n     to generate investigative leads that help law enforcement \n     solve murders, rapes, and serial property crimes, recover \n     abducted children, detect drug and human trafficking rings, \n     find stolen vehicles, apprehend violent criminal alien \n     fugitives, and support terrorism investigations.\n       There is a misconception of continuous government tracking \n     of individuals using ALPR information. This has led to \n     attempts to curtail law enforcement's use of the technology \n     without a proper and fair effort to truly understand the \n     anonymous nature of the data, how it is used, and how it is \n     protected.\n       We are seeing harmful proposals--appropriations amendments \n     and legislation--to restrict or completely ban law \n     enforcement's use of ALPR technology and data without any \n     effort to truly understand the issue. Yet, any review would \n     make clear that the value of this technology is beyond \n     question, and that protections against mis-use of the data by \n     law enforcement are already in place. That is one of the \n     reasons why critics are hard-pressed to identify any actual \n     instances of mis-use.\n       If legislative efforts to curtail ALPR use are successful, \n     federal, state, and local law enforcement's ability to \n     investigate crimes will be significantly impacted given the \n     extensive use of the technology today.\n       We call on Congress to foster a reasonable and transparent \n     discussion about ALPR. We believe strong measures can be \n     taken to ensure citizens' privacy while enabling law \n     enforcement investigators to take advantage of the \n     technology. Strict data access controls, mandatory auditing \n     of all use of ALPR systems, and regular reporting on the use \n     of the technology and data prevent misuse of the capability \n     while enabling law enforcement to make productive use of it. \n     Adoption and enforcement of strong policies on the use of \n     ALPR and other technologies by individual law enforcement \n     agencies would also help.\n       We strongly urge members of the House and Senate to \n     understand and recognize the substantial daily benefits of \n     this technology to protect the public and investigate \n     dangerous criminals. We urge opposition to any bill or \n     amendment that would restrict the use of ALPR without full \n     consideration of the issue.\n           Sincerely,\n       J. Thomas Manger, Chief of Police, Montgomery County Police \n     Department, President, Major Cities Chiefs Police \n     Association; Chief Richard Beary, President, International \n     Association of Chiefs of Police; Mike Sena, Director, \n     Northern California Regional Intelligence Center, President, \n     National Fusion Center Association; Ronald C. Sloan, \n     Director, Colorado Bureau of Investigation, President, \n     Association of State Criminal Investigative Agencies; Sheriff \n     Donny Youngblood, President, Major County Sheriffs' \n     Association; Bob Bushman, President, National Narcotic \n     Officers' Associations' Coalition; Jonathan Thompson, \n     Executive Director, National Sheriffs' Association; William \n     Johnson, Executive Director, National Association of Police \n     Organizations; Mike Moore, President, National District \n     Attorneys Association; Andrews Matthews, Chairman, National \n     Troopers Coalition.\n\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. I urge opposition to the amendment, and \nI yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, in closing, I respect the gentleman's opinion, \nbut we are not legislating on this appropriations bill. What we are \ndoing is determining that the relevant committees of jurisdiction have \nnot authorized broad collection of data of the American people.\n  The committees of jurisdiction have not authorized this sort of \nproactive tracking of people because, at some point, someday there may \nbe a reason to use that database. So, in fact, it is perfectly \nappropriate not to spend the money, not to authorize the money until or \nunless the authorizing committees have made a thorough decision of what \nshould be authorized and what safeguards need to be in order.\n  So my amendment will simply limit, until such time as a legislating \namendment or authorization from a committee can, in fact, ensure that \nwe both authorize law enforcement to collect and protect the privacy of \nAmerican citizens because, ultimately, these are the taxpayer dollars \nof the American citizens and the privacy embodied in the Constitution \nand guaranteed to every citizen.\n  Therefore, I insist that Members consider voting for an amendment \nthat recognizes, just as the minority clearly said, we have not yet had \na debate on the basis under which we should pay for the bulk collection \nagainst the American people without their permission or safeguards of \ntheir rights.\n  I urge support for the amendment, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Issa).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. ISSA. Madam Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from California \nwill be postponed.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last \nword.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Madam Chair, we are coming to the end of \nseveral days of floor debate on the 2016 Transportation, Housing and \nUrban Development Appropriations bill.\n  I want to, again, express my appreciation to Chairman Diaz-Balart, \nsubcommittee members from both sides of the aisle, and our remarkable, \ndedicated staff for all the hard work that has gone into this bill and \nfor the orderly and civil character of our floor deliberations.\n  I very much wish that all of this work and all of our efforts at \ncooperation were being more adequately rewarded, but they are not. And \nthat is not the chairman's fault. It is the fault of the majority's \nprofoundly misguided and flawed budget policy, a policy that has left \nthis bill a mere shadow of what it should be and has decimated the \ninvestments a great country should be making.\n  Make no mistake, Madam Chair, our roads, our highways are crumbling. \nOne out of every nine bridges in this country is structurally deficient \nand in need of repair or replacement.\n  Americans spend the equivalent of one work week a year sitting in \ncongestion caused by overcrowded highways. The capital backlog for our \ntransit systems is nearly $78 billion.\n  And make no mistake, our public housing resources don't meet the \nbasic needs of millions of vulnerable and low-income Americans. On any \ngiven night, 575,000 of our constituents, including more than 50,000 \nveterans, are homeless. The maintenance backlog for public housing \napproaches $25 billion.\n  Madam Chair, this is a defining crisis for our generation. This bill, \nwhich is intended to help improve housing and transportation options \nand create jobs for hard-working American families, will, instead, dig \nthe hole deeper by cutting everything from safety programs to \ntransportation construction grants to maintenance budgets for public \nhousing.\n  It would be bad enough if the cuts were limited to our transportation \nand housing systems, but Republicans have taken the same shortsighted \napproach with each of this year's domestic appropriations bills.\n  Unfortunately, the majority has targeted domestic appropriations to \nbear the entire brunt of deficit reduction. That means deep cuts, not \njust to our transportation and housing infrastructure but also to \nresearch support, programs that make college more affordable, the very \nthings that make this country the envy of the world.\n  Meanwhile, the majority lacks the courage to address the real drivers \nof the deficit, which I think most Members of this Chamber realize are \ntax expenditures and entitlement spending.\n  In the 1990s, we achieved budget surpluses as the result of concerted \nbipartisan efforts to balance the budget through a comprehensive \napproach. We actually paid off $400 billion of the national debt.\n  Until we have a similar budget agreement this year, one that sets \nresponsible funding and revenue levels across\n\n[[Page H3990]]\n\nthe board, we cannot write a bill that addresses our country's \ncrumbling roads and bridges, that brings our rail system up to first-\nworld standards, or that provides shelter for America's elderly, \ndisabled, and other vulnerable populations.\n  In fact, we cannot make any of the investments that we simply have to \nmake to continue as the greatest country in the world. So I implore my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' on this shortsighted, irresponsible bill, but \nbeyond that, to consider the long-term consequences of the fiscal \ncourse we are on. We simply have to make a correction for our country's \nsake.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I move to strike the last word.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I want to thank the ranking member, \nfirst, for his kind words towards me right now but, more importantly, \nfor his willingness to work with me, to spend the time, the effort. \nBoth he and his staff, the committee staff, have, frankly, worked \nawfully hard on making sure we do the best job that we can, and I am \ngrateful for that.\n  I just very briefly want to just mention that this bill, this is a \nbill that prioritizes funding and funds our country's priorities. It is \na balanced bill.\n  And very important, Madam Chair, this is a bill, that, yes, it does \nnot raise taxes.\n  Now, I know that a lot of folks have talked about the President's \nrequests and the President's requests. And the President's requests for \nthis area are much higher in many areas than what this bill is funding.\n  But let's remember a couple of things. The President has massive \ntaxes, tax increases in his proposals, number one. And also, that this \nbill adheres to not only the budget that was passed by Congress, House \nand Senate, but this bill adheres to the law, the law that was passed \nby Congress and signed by the President of the United States, the so-\ncalled ``sequester'' law.\n  So if we go above and beyond that level, which some people, I guess, \ndon't remember, it is fake. It gets sequestered.\n  So, Madam Chair, again, I thank the ranking member for his hard work.\n  This is a balanced bill. It is a good bill. It is a responsible bill. \nIt pays and funds the priorities of this great country. And I am going \nto ask for our colleagues to give us a favorable vote on this fine \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "09"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/09/house-section/article/H3990-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H3990-H3998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE ACTING CHAIR\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

There is 1 minute remaining.\n\n                              {time}  2309\n\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL changed his vote from ``aye'' to ``no.''\n  Mrs. DINGELL changed her vote from ``no'' to ``aye.''\n  So the amendment was agreed to.\n  The result of the vote was announced as above recorded.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will read.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Transportation, Housing and \n     Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, \n     2016''.\n\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise \nand report the bill back to the House with sundry amendments, with the \nrecommendation that the amendments be agreed to and that the bill, as \namended, do pass.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Ms. \nFoxx) having assumed the chair, Ms. Ros-Lehtinen, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2577) \nmaking appropriations for the Departments of Transportation, and \nHousing and Urban Development, and related agencies for the fiscal year \nending September 30, 2016, and for other purposes, directed her to \nreport the bill back to the House with sundry amendments adopted in the \nCommittee of the Whole, with the recommendation that the amendments be \nagreed to and that the bill, as amended, do pass.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment reported from the \nCommittee of the Whole? If not, the Chair will put them en gros.\n  The amendments were agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. DELANEY. Madam Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. DELANEY. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Delaney moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2577 to the \n     Committee on Appropriations with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       In the ``Capital and Debt Service Grants to the National \n     Railroad Passenger Corporation'' account, on page 47, line \n     11, after the dollar amount relating to capital investments, \n     insert ``(increased by $6,000,000)''.\n       Page 116, line 12, after the dollar amount, insert \n     ``(reduced by $6,000,000)''.\n\n  Mr. DELANEY (during the reading). Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Maryland?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes in \nsupport of his motion.\n  Mr. DELANEY. Madam Speaker, this is a final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Madam Speaker, imagine if this Congress were focused on how the \nforces of innovation and globalization were changing our economy and \nmaking it harder for our businesses to compete, large and small.\n  Madam Speaker, imagine if this Congress were focused on the fact \nthat, while we are creating jobs, we are increasingly creating two \ntypes of jobs--high-skilled jobs, which are reserved for those people \nwith the best educations, and low-skilled, low-paid jobs. Increasingly, \nwe are not creating middle-skilled jobs--the kind of jobs that have \nsupported middle class families for decades.\n  Madam Speaker, imagine if this Congress were focused on the fact \nthat, while the standard of living of average Americans is going down, \nthe friction in their lives is going up, including the fact that so \nmany of them have longer commutes--overbearing commutes--because of \ninadequate transportation, commutes that are taking time away from \ntheir families and from their communities.\n  Madam Speaker, if this Congress were focused on those three things, \nthen it would quickly conclude that our top domestic economic priority \nshould be increasing our investment in our infrastructure because this \nCongress would understand that rebuilding America makes us more \ncompetitive. This Congress would understand that a national \ninfrastructure program is the best jobs program we could have because \nit creates good jobs, and it is sound economics.\n\n                              {time}  2315\n\n  This Congress would understand that better infrastructure improves \nthe quality of life of our constituents; and because it has been so \nbipartisan for so many years, it could be something that unifies us, \nand it would understand that rebuilding America is not an expense but \nan investment, and we would probably score it that way dynamically.\n  But unfortunately, Madam Speaker, that is not the Congress we have \nhere this evening because we are doing precisely the opposite this \nevening, and we are cutting our investment in infrastructure. When you \nlook at the facts, that is a strange conclusion indeed.\n  But, Madam Speaker, I am optimistic. I am optimistic that one day, \nhopefully soon, this Congress can do something transformative around \ninfrastructure and rebuild our country. I believe we can pay for it by \nfixing our broken international tax system, where we have trillions of \ndollars\n\n[[Page H3997]]\n\ntrapped overseas, and creating pathways for that money to come back to \nrebuild our country.\n  While we wait for that day to happen, Madam Speaker, we still should \nbe doing smart and sensible things to improve our infrastructure. My \namendment does that.\n  My amendment increases funding for Amtrak so they can better \nimplement the positive train control system, which is technology that \nis proven to make commuter rail trains safer. The National \nTransportation Safety Board has said that, if this system were in place \nsince 2004, we would have had 30 fewer accidents, including preventing \nthat terrible tragedy that we all stood here and mourned about 30 days \nago in Pennsylvania.\n  So I ask my colleagues to support the amendment to increase funding \nfor Amtrak so that they can better implement smart technology, the \npositive train control system. Like most investments in infrastructure, \nit is good for our constituents--in this case, public safety--and it is \nalso a good investment for our country. I urge support of the \nDemocratic motion to recommit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time, Madam Speaker.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  Mr. DIAZ-BALART. Madam Speaker, this bill that is in front of us \nfunds programs that are the backbone of our economy and the safety net \nof those who need it. These are issues that we must fund responsibly, \nadequately, and on time. This bill does precisely just that. It does so \nafter a lengthy, open process. It does so while looking at the \nindividual issues one by one.\n  I know some people like to criticize this Congress. This is not the \nCongress--this is not the Congress, however--that made ``shovel-ready'' \na joke phrase. This is a Congress who wants to act responsibly, and \nthis bill does just that. It makes the most of what we have. It makes \nthe most of what we have in our coffers. It acknowledges that we can't \njust simply have everything that everybody wants at a time when we do \nhave to pick priorities, when we have to spend responsibly and wisely. \nThis bill in front of us has no tax increases, Madam Speaker.\n  Now, let's be very clear: fostering economic growth has always been a \ntop priority in our appropriations bills, and this one is no different. \nYou see, our businesses and communities rely on safe and efficient \nroads and rails and waterways and airways to facilitate the billions \nand billions of dollars of commerce that our economy depends on. So we \nchoose to prioritize transportation infrastructure projects that will \nhelp improve our Nation as a whole; that will make traveling across the \ncountry easier; and, make no mistake, that will also make traveling \nacross country safer, a safer place to travel.\n  Madam Speaker, from increasing funding for critical agencies like the \nFAA, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, and the \nPipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration to providing the \nFederal Railroad Administration with the resources it needs for its \nsafety and research programs, this bill does not sacrifice safety in \nany way at all, in any shape or form.\n  Madam Speaker, the other primary responsibility of this bill is to \nprovide for important housing programs. It ensures that our veterans \ncontinue to have access to the VASH program. It takes care of our most \nvulnerable citizens, such as the elderly and people with disabilities. \nIt does that.\n  Let me just briefly address the specifics of this motion.\n  We have already taken action on the floor to add $9 million to Amtrak \nfor inward-facing cameras to improve the safety of Amtrak's operation, \nbut let me say something else. We have spent literally hundreds of \nhours on this bill. We have done so in a bipartisan way, in an open \nway. We held six public hearings with agency and department heads--six \npublic hearings. We considered amendments in committee, and we have \nspent, as all of you know, 3 days on the floor now and considered about \n80 amendments on this bill after 3 days in an open, transparent \nprocess. It has been an open and transparent process. We have taken \namendments on this floor from both sides of the aisle.\n  So despite, obviously, budgetary constraints, this bill accomplishes \nall of what it should. We have worked hard at what we had to fund, and \nwe got it done in a smart, purposeful, responsible way, yes.\n  Let me say something else that this Congress is doing. We are making \nserious progress on our appropriations bills this year. We are moving \nahead faster and through an open process faster than we have in many \nyears, getting the necessary work done in a timely and open and \nresponsible fashion.\n  So now we have this motion to recommit. What is the purpose of this \nmotion to recommit? Why wasn't it done as an amendment during the 3 \ndays when we were here?\n  I urge a ``no'' vote, and let's get this good bill passed out of the \nHouse.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mr. DELANEY. Madam Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 5-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by 5-\nminute votes on passage of the bill and agreeing to the Speaker's \napproval of the Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--ayes 181, \nnoes 244, not voting 8, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 328]\n\n                               AYES--181\n\n     Aguilar\n     Ashford\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Ellison\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Hinojosa\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.
