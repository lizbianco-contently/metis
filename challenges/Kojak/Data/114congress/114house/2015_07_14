Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen of the House, we ought \nnot bet against Ukraine and Georgia.\n  I recently returned from a bipartisan delegation of the House \nDemocracy Partnership that visited Ukraine and Georgia over the Fourth \nof July recess. Our purpose was to reflect this body to those \nparliamentary bodies in Ukraine and Georgia.\n  I--and I know the other members of the House Democracy Partnership--\ncame away with a feeling of encouragement and a feeling of gratitude \nfor the tenacity and very seriousness with which the Ukrainians and the \nGeorgians are pursuing freedom.\n  These are two nations that desperately want to be in the orbit of the \nWest. They desperately want to be a part of the EU; they desperately \nwant to be a part of NATO, and they are doing everything they can to \nstiff-arm and push back from the aggression of Vladimir Putin. They \nneed our help; they need our encouragement, and they need our support.\n  It is said that there are some who look at this as the front line of \nthe rising voices against authoritarianism, and I think that is true. \nWe have got to do everything we can in this body not only to provide \nthe economic support and other support that these countries need, but \nalso to do everything we can to push the administration to do the right \nthing as well.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5119-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5119-H5120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, this is a big day on Capitol Hill. The \nIranian agreement has been signed. Hopefully, we will all have a chance \nto study it and think through the implications of this historic event, \nbut the legislative clock is ticking down on another area. We have only \n10 legislative days left this month before we face another \ntransportation funding cliff.\n  The expectation now is that there will be a 34th short-term \ntransportation extension that we have faced since our last, meaningful \n6-year reauthorization. People are scrambling for another short-term \nfunding source to keep us going for the next few months that targets, \npresumably, $8 billion to $11 billion to get us through the end of the \nyear.\n  This is actually worse than no solution at all because it perpetuates \nthe uncertainty, the crisis mentality, the inability of State and local \ngovernments that rely on this Federal partnership to supply \napproximately one-half of the capital expenditures for our surface \ntransportation.\n  This uncertainty comes at a time when our bridges, roads, and transit \nsystems are all in serious areas of disrepair. We are desperately in \nneed of bigger, longer-term projects.\n  It is a myth that somehow we can't afford to take action. The public \nis paying now hundreds of dollars a year in damage to each of their \nvehicles, costs far in excess of a few cents a day for a gas tax \nincrease.\n  American commuters and businesses are suffering over $120 billion a \nyear in costs related to congestion, costs directly related to \ninadequate infrastructure. People are tying themselves in knots when \nthere is a simple, obvious solution.\n  As pointed out in a delightful op-ed in The Washington Post on July \n9, we should simply follow Ronald Reagan's example and fill up \nAmerica's highway trust fund.\n  They ask how the famously tax-cutting conservative President raised \nthe Federal user fee--the gas tax--on motor fuels 125 percent. While he \nwas concerned about general taxation, he was absolutely comfortable \nwith having user fees cover specific costs like the fuel tax for \naviation or inland waterway fees.\n  He worked with Republicans in Congress, who demonstrated significant \nsupport for user fee increases. He then gave his Secretary of \nTransportation, Drew Lewis, free hand to lay the groundwork.\n  Finally, when he decided to support a gas tax increase, his \nDepartment of Transportation swung into action, as did Ronald Reagan \nhimself. He gave an eloquent speech November 29, 1982, on\n\n[[Page H5120]]\n\nThanksgiving Day, calling on Congress to come back into session and \napprove the gas tax increase.\n  We have the opportunity for such leadership today. My proposed gas \ntax increase, H.R. 680, is supported by all the major interest groups: \nunions, the Chamber of Commerce, truckers, AAA, transit, local \ngovernment, environmentalists, engineers, and contractors.\n  The same approach has been used in 20 States since 2012 to raise \ntransportation revenues. Six States have raised the gas tax already \nthis year, six red Republican States. It is simple. My bill would \nprovide the money necessary to actually pass a 6-year bill. It would be \nsustainable so we wouldn't be back in the same pickle in a year, 2 \nyears, or 5 years.\n  Finally, it is dedicated so people can count upon it to implement the \nsteps necessary to rebuild and renew America's infrastructure.\n  It is time to stop temporizing, and it is time to act. Filling the \nhighway trust fund with borrowed money inadequate to do the job but \nenough to avoid responsibility is not a solution that we can be proud \nof, especially when America is ready and Ronald Reagan pointed the way.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5120-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5120]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 AFTER 45 SEASONS, 50 CONSECUTIVE WINS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize and \ncongratulate St. Cloud Cathedral High School baseball coach Bob Karn on \nbeing named not only the Regional Coach of the Year, but also the \nDiamond National Coach of the Year, by the American Baseball Coaches \nAssociation.\n  Under Coach Karn's direction, the Crusaders have won 50 consecutive \ngames, and this year, they celebrated their second straight State \ntitle. These impressive statistics are nothing new for Coach Karn. Karn \nhas coached a total of 45 seasons, and under his leadership, Cathedral \nhas a record of 736-237 and nine State championships.\n  Coach Karn, you have made a lasting impact on the lives of your \nplayers, and they will no doubt use all you have taught them wherever \nthey go. Your team, your school, and your community have all benefited \nfrom your leadership.\n  Thank you so much for everything that you do. Keep up the excellent \nwork, and best of luck next season.\n\n\n              Accountable Regulation, Not More Regulation\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the \nREINS Act.\n  In my time in Congress, one message I consistently hear at home is \nWashington is not listening to the people. Unelected, nameless \nbureaucrats continue to impose harmful and burdensome regulation on the \nAmerican people.\n  In total, compliance with Federal regulation costs $1.8 trillion a \nyear. These regulations are devastating to small business and cost \nAmerican families nearly $15,000 a year.\n  Using the REINS Act, the new Congress has stepped up to the plate. \nUnder the REINS Act, major rules from Federal agencies would require \ncongressional approval before enactment. Through Congress, the American \npeople would have up to 70 days to view a major rule before it is ever \ncalled for a vote. To prevent long legal challenges, courts are allowed \nto ensure agencies have adhered to all necessary requirements before \nfinal implementation.\n  Finally, the REINS Act allows for Congress to disapprove of any minor \nrule, thus holding this administration accountable and protecting \nagainst a runaway Federal Government.\n  I am a proud cosponsor of the REINS Act, which restores the \ndemocratic process in favor of those who originally formed our \ngovernment, the people.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this vital legislation.\n\n\n                      Transportation is Our Future\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, transportation is the key to the \nfuture economic growth of my district and our Nation.\n  For years, the Federal highway trust fund has run deficits and \nfostered an environment of waste and frivolous spending. This week, \nCongress is poised to pass another short-term fix. While I applaud the \nefforts of Chairmen Ryan and Shuster, my constituents need long-term \nanswers and solutions to the transportation gridlock and congestion \nthat stifles growth and expansion.\n  Projects in my district, such as Interstate 94, which is one of the \nmost congested corridors in the region, are slowing development and \ncost commuters valuable time and money while they are stuck in traffic. \nU.S. Highway 10 has become such an issue that cities are placing \nmoratoriums on new business development.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a travesty, and my constituents have every right \nto be frustrated. I call upon this body to work to pass a long-term \nfunding bill and give our constituents the certainty they deserve in \ntheir transportation system.\n\n\n       One of St. Cloud's Finest is One of the World's Strongest\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize St. \nCloud's own Nick Tylutki for his second-place finish at the \nInternational Powerlifting Federation World Championship in Salo, \nFinland.\n  This past year, after topping 108 competitors, Nick won the national \ntitle and a ticket to the world championship in Finland. With eight \nprevious world championships under his belt, Nick finished higher than \never before, coming just shy of completing a 744-pound deadlift for the \ngold.\n  In addition to his successful powerlifting career, Nick is also a St. \nCloud police officer and SWAT team operator. As a child, Nick dreamed \nof becoming a police officer, and that dream was realized 7 years ago \nwhen he joined the St. Cloud police force.\n  I congratulate Nick on his impressive silver medal at the world \nchampionship, and I thank him for his service as one of St. Cloud's \nfinest.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5120-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5120-H5121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n MARKING THE OCCASION OF THE ``NEW HORIZONS'' SPACECRAFT REACHING PLUTO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Neal) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NEAL. Mr. Speaker, I rise this morning to mark the occasion of \nthe New Horizons spacecraft reaching Pluto.\n  New Horizons launched on January 19, 2006, and since 2007, has been \ntraveling steadily at 30,000 miles per hour. This morning, at \napproximately 7:49:57 a.m., the New Horizons spacecraft rendezvoused \nwith Pluto, three billion miles away from Earth. Having just passed \nPluto this morning, New Horizons will continue on in the Kuiper belt.\n  Standing here as the spacecraft just passed Pluto, I take great pride \nin noting that a Massachusetts astronomer helped in the discovery of \nits existence. While Clyde Tombaugh formally discovered Pluto, it was \nBoston astronomer Percival Lowell's calculations that led the way. The \nP and the L that make the astronomical symbol for Pluto serve as a \ntestament to Lowell's part in the discovery of this small planet.\n  Lowell's contribution to astronomy also stands today with the \nestablishment of the Lowell Observatory located in Flagstaff, Arizona. \nPercival Lowell inspired countless generations with his advocacy of \nastronomy, and more than 80,000 visitors each year go through the doors \nof the observatory.\n  I am certainly proud to have known Lowell's descendants, the Putnam \nfamily, for years; and I admire their continued advocacy of the Lowell \nObservatory.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  New Horizons is the first in the ``New Frontiers'' series, inspired \nby another son of Massachusetts, President John Kennedy, who said about \nthe need to explore space: ``We set sail on this new sea because there \nis a new knowledge to be gained, new rights to be won, and they must be \nwon and used for the progress of all people.''\n  President Kennedy's support of our Nation's first space program set \nus on course for hope and optimism for our future.\n  New Horizons' accomplishment this morning, along with other \ninitiatives such as the International Space Station, which I am very \nproud to say that I supported and recall that in this institution, the \nspace station survived by\n\n[[Page H5121]]\n\none vote at a precarious time in our history. It serves today as a \nstrong reminder of the continued importance of space exploration and \nthe very smart people that are drawn to this initiative.\n  I also want to close by saying that I would hope that we might remind \nourselves of the optimism of the Kennedy years and the space \nexploration program which Kennedy highlighted and helped to inaugurate \nbut which he never got to see many of the benefits of, a sentiment that \nall Members of Congress should grasp, and that is that the candidate \nwho offers the best sense of optimism for the future is generally the \ncandidate that prevails. During the course of a campaign when one makes \narguments on behalf of a particular initiative, we are also to \nunderstand that it is part of forming a government. So optimism becomes \ninfectious in our political system when embraced properly.\n  I hope today, as we celebrate this remarkable achievement of New \nHorizons and just the thought that that spacecraft travels at 30,000 \nmiles per hour and the fact, at 3 billion miles from Earth, America's \nscience, achievement, and initiative have once again prevailed in this \nworld, that we will continue to support these space initiatives and \nembrace the notion and the role that science plays in our lives.\n  Thank you Percival Lowell, and thank you President John Kennedy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5121-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nCUT ILLEGAL ALIEN LABOR SUPPLY THAT COSTS AMERICAN JOBS AND SUPPRESSED \n                                INCOMES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, yesterday Democrat Presidential \ncandidate Hillary Clinton unveiled her economic program stating: ``The \ndefining economic challenge of our time is clear. We must raise incomes \nfor hard-working Americans so they can afford a middle class life. We \nmust drive strong and steady income growth that lifts up families''; \nand, ``The measure of our success must be how much incomes rise for \nhard-working families.''\n  Clinton concluded that: ``If you work hard and do your part, you \nshould be able to get ahead. But over the past several decades, that \nbargain has eroded.''\n  Hillary Clinton identifies the problem and goals; however, I submit \nher trickle-down Federal Government dictates solution, while splendid \nrhetoric, misses the target entirely.\n  What changed over the past several decades that eroded the American \ndream?\n  Three decades ago, America gave amnesty to millions of illegal \naliens. That amnesty beget millions and millions in more illegal \naliens. This illegal alien tsunami has done more to take jobs from and \nsuppress wages of struggling American families than anything else over \nthe past three decades.\n  The Pew Hispanic Center established in 2009 that American workers \nlost 7.8 million job opportunities to illegal aliens. A more recent \nFAIR study estimates Americans lost 8.5 million job opportunities to \nillegal aliens.\n  Economic studies reveal that wage suppression caused by the surge in \ncheap, illegal alien labor costs American high school graduates an \nestimated $800 per year and America's low-skilled labor an estimated \n$2,300 per year in income. But it is not just illegal alien labor that \nundermines American opportunity and the American Dream for American \ncitizens.\n  America's generous legal immigration policy created a second tsunami \nof legal foreign labor that doubles the economic damage to struggling \nAmerican families. Census Bureau, Homeland Security, and Labor \nDepartment data offers a startling and sobering insight for Americans \nin the 16-65 age bracket.\n  While the American economy created 5.6 million net new jobs in the \n16-65 age bracket over the past 14 years, American-born citizens lost \n127,000 net jobs. All net job gains and more went to illegal and legal \nimmigrants. While American-born citizens lost 127,000 jobs, foreign-\nborn persons gained 5.7 million jobs.\n  Worse yet, when you factor in population growth, there were 17 \nmillion more Americans in the 16-65 age bracket not working in 2014 \nthan in 2000.\n  Contrary to the propaganda of amnesty and open border proponents and \ntheir media allies, immigrants gained across the labor market in lower \nskilled jobs, such as maintenance, construction, and food service, and \nmiddle skilled jobs, like office support and healthcare support, and \nhigher skilled jobs, including management, computers, and healthcare \npractitioners.\n  The propaganda that immigrants only do jobs Americans won't do is not \nsupported by fact. Immigrants gained jobs while Americans lost jobs in \neach of the following high-paying industries: architecture, \nengineering, transportation and material moving, office and \nadministrative support.\n  Further, American-born citizens of all major races lost ground. The \npercentage of working African Americans dropped 9.2 percentage points; \nHispanic Americans dropped 7.7 percentage points; Caucasian Americans \ndropped 6.1 percentage points.\n  In a dig at Jeb Bush, Clinton added that Americans ``don't need a \nlecture, they need a raise.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Hillary Clinton is right. America does not need \nlectures. America needs solutions. And the number one job and economic \nsolution for Americans is securing America's borders and implementing a \nrational immigration policy that reflects economic conditions and \nprotects American jobs and American wages for struggling American \nfamilies.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5121-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5121]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA FESTIVAL OF THE ARTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania).

Mr. Speaker, this past weekend, over \n125,000 people flocked to Pennsylvania's Fifth District to attend the \n49th annual Central Pennsylvania Festival of the Arts, affectionately \nknown as Arts Fest.\n  Every July, people gather in State College, Pennsylvania, to enjoy \nworks of art, live music, and great foods.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. DeSantis) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. DeSANTIS. Mr. Speaker, Congress, at this juncture, has one \noverriding task, and that is to stop President Obama's capitulation to \nIran. Make no mistake, this is less a deal than it is a list of \nconcessions to the world's leading state sponsor of terrorism. And \nthere is a reason why you see smiles on the ayatollahs in Tehran and \nJavad Zarif in Vienna.\n  Congress should stop this deal because it gives billions of dollars \nto the Iranian regime, which Iran will use to foment jihad and \nterrorism throughout the Middle East. Congress should stop this deal \nbecause it validates Iran's entire nuclear infrastructure--no \ndismantling, not even Iran's underground nuclear bunker at Fordo, which \nhas no rational peaceful purpose.\n  Indeed, Iran is crossing all of President Obama's red lines. \nPresident Obama had said you could not have Fordo, he said you could \nnot have a plutonium reactor in Iraq. He said you could not have \nadvanced centrifuges because there is no peaceful purpose for any of \nthose, and yet this final deal validates each and every one of those \npieces of Iran's nuclear arsenal.\n  Congress should stop this deal because it removes sanctions from \nIran's Quds force and its commander, Qasem Soleimani, who are \nresponsible for killing hundreds of American soldiers in\n\n[[Page H5122]]\n\nIraq. And indeed, when I served in Iraq, Iran was responsible for \nkilling more Americans than even al Qaeda in Iraq.\n  Why reward those with American blood on their hands by lifting \nsanctions on them?\n  Congress needs to stop this deal because it stabs our allies in the \nback, most notably, our trusted ally Israel. Iran threatens to wipe \nIsrael off the map and refers to Israel as a one-bomb country.\n  Congress needs to stop this deal because the inspections are not snap \ninspections. Indeed, the inspections depend on Iran allowing the \ninspections, and there is an entire bureaucracy set up so that even if \nyou end up getting approval, Iran will have the ability to remove their \noffending conduct and conceal it before the inspectors see it.\n  The bottom line is that this deal does not dismantle Iran's nuclear \ninfrastructure. The deal empowers Iran. It makes the world less safe by \npaving Iran's path to the bomb.\n  It is a time for choosing in this House. Congress must act swiftly \nand decisively and reject this capitulation. This deal cannot stand.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5122-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5122]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                THE PRESIDENT'S FOREIGN POLICY SCORECARD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Walker) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, the President's foreign policy has been \ndisastrous for more than 6 years. If you are keeping score at home on \nthis deal with Iran, feel free to add another major error in the box \nscore, labeled, ``The Failed Obama Doctrine.''\n  President Obama's insistence on force-feeding a deal with Iran is \ntroubling. The unrelenting attempt to boost his legacy has created a \ngross lack of discernment. The President and his State Department have \nleft a trail of detrimental decisions with deteriorating relationships \nthroughout the world.\n  How can we forget the President's blurred red lines in demanding that \nSyria's Assad end his human rights violation? After the President drew \nhis line in the sand, Assad responded with the bombing of hospitals and \nthe use of chemical weapons against his own people.\n  The President has failed to show any initiative or strategy and has \nconsistently attempted to lead from behind. Meanwhile, of all people, \nRussia's Vladimir Putin was the one who intervened in this \ninternational crisis.\n  Speaking of Putin, the President's posture with Putin has been \npitiful.\n  Of course, it was President Obama who mocked Presidential candidate \nMitt Romeny's 1980s concern of Russia being a threat. Maybe it is time \nPresident Obama revisited Ronald Reagan's foreign policy of the 1980s.\n  Wasn't it Vice President Joe Biden that claimed the President's work \nin Iraq would be one of the greatest achievements of this \nadministration?\n  Syria, Russia, Benghazi, Iraq, ISIS, and we are supposed to be \nexcited about a deal with the world's leader in state-sponsored \nterrorism. All the while, we have given the cold shoulder to Israel, \nour greatest ally in the Middle East for generations, as we have \nlistened to, over the weekend, shouts from Iran, ``Death to Israel. \nDeath to America.''\n  The great majority of Americans had hoped that our President would \nfind the strength to increase the sanctions on Iran rather than remove \nthem and surrender control of inspections to Iran. As a Member of \nCongress, I will stand against any agreement that doesn't completely \nstrip Iran of all nuclear capability.\n  While we are at it, Mr. President, maybe it is time to stop ignoring \nthe imprisonment of Saeed Abedini, Jason Rezaian, Bob Levinson, and \nAmir Hekmati, our four Americans in Iran. Both the House and the Senate \nhave showed compassion and strength demanding these Americans return \nhome to their families. Saeed has been held for over 1,000 days while \nhis children plead for his release.\n  I agree with the President when he exclaimed: ``We should always do \neverything in our power to bring these Americans home safe.''\n  Mr. President, it is time to honor the commitment you have made to \nthese men, these families, and to all Americans.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  May I close with the words of the Prime Minister of Israel in \nagreeing that this is ``a mistake of historic proportion.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate the life and to note \nthe recent passing of Kentucky State Trooper Eric K. Chrisman of \nLawrenceburg, Kentucky.\n  On June 23, Trooper Chrisman was killed in the line of duty during a \nvehicle collision while responding to a distress call. Trooper Chrisman \nwas 23 years old and had served on the force for only 6 months.\n  The fact that in this year alone 64 law enforcement officers have \nalready been killed while serving in the line of duty gives great \ntestament to the dangers and challenges officers face every single day.\n  Inscribed on the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial are the \nwords, ``Carved on these walls is the story of America, of a continuing \nquest to preserve both democracy and decency, and to protect a national \ntreasure that we call the American Dream.''\n  Trooper Chrisman gave his life while striving to preserve democracy \nand decency, and I thank him for his service and his devotion to his \ncommunity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5122-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5122-H5123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LAW ENFORCEMENT AND FIRST RESPONDERS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, just a few weeks ago, in Fulton County, \nGeorgia, officers of the Fulton County Police Department were alerted \nto shots fired in a neighborhood around 1:30 in the morning.\n  The initial call indicated that a man was terrorizing citizens by \ngoing house to house, banging on doors and firing a weapon. Officers \nimmediately responded and began searching for the gunman.\n  About 45 minutes later another call was received, reporting gunfire \nin another part of the same neighborhood. Additional officers were \ndispatched.\n  One of the officers responding to the second call was Detective \nTerrence Green, a 22-year veteran of the Fulton County Police force. \nUpon arriving in the neighborhood, officers could hear shots coming \nfrom the direction of one of the homes.\n  As Terrence Green and his fellow officers bravely moved toward the \ngunfire, they were unknowingly walking into an ambush.\n  When the officers were in range, the gunman emerged from a concealed \nposition and began firing upon the officers. While running for cover, \nthe officers returned fire, and in the ensuing firefight the gunman was \neventually wounded.\n  When the officers approached the gunman, they discovered that two of \ntheir own officers had also been shot during the ambush. All three were \nrushed to the hospital, where the gunman was treated for nonlife-\nthreatening wounds.\n  However, Detective Green had received a fatal shot to the head and \naround 4:30 in the morning succumbed to his injuries, leaving behind \nfour young children.\n  In all aspects of the term, Detective Green is a hero. He put himself \nin harm's way to protect the lives of others.\n  I wish I could stand here today and say that what happened to \nTerrence Green was an isolated incident; but, unfortunately, this \nscenario plays out much too often in the cities, towns, and boroughs \nacross America.\n  But even in the midst of imminent danger, officers like Detective \nGreen courageously fulfill their duty to protect and serve the people \nof this Nation. And I am grateful to those men and women who willingly \nput their lives on the line for us daily.\n\n[[Page H5123]]\n\n  It is the cop walking the streets, the officer on patrol, the \nsergeant on watch, or the deputy responding to a call who are on the \nfront lines in our States, counties, and cities.\n  Whether the call is for a crime in progress, an automobile accident, \nor a natural disaster, they are often the first on the scene to render \naid, give comfort, or even save a life.\n  While they don't do their job for accolades nor do they expect our \ncontinuous praise, it is encouraging for someone to occasionally say \nthank you.\n  But instead of thanking them for their dedication to duty, some \nofficials instead publicly criticize our law enforcement community. \nThis unwarranted public criticism not only undermines the morale of our \nlaw enforcement officers, but it undermines the public trust in these \ndedicated servants.\n  With a growing number of violent protests and riots in our Nation, \ntensions between the police and the public have grown significantly \nover the past several years.\n  But instead of using their positions of influence to diffuse the \ntension, certain officials have stoked the fire, which has rekindled \ndistrust and encouraged public unrest.\n  Careless remarks, such as comparing American law enforcement officers \nto terrorist organizations like ISIS, have placed more officers' lives \nat risk and have sparked more anti-law enforcement sentiment across our \nNation.\n  As a result, public bashing of our police has skyrocketed and now \nAmerican law enforcement officers feel they have been thrown under the \nbus by the very people that should be supporting them.\n  Recently, during a meeting with local first responders in my \ndistrict, I asked if there was something I could do to help them.\n  They asked for me to go back to Washington, D.C., and tell our \ngovernment officials to please stop undermining them, to stop publicly \ncriticizing them for doing the job they are tasked to do.\n  ``Please make Washington understand,'' they said, ``that it is \nincredibly demoralizing to be putting your life on the line, fighting \ncrime, while those in positions of leadership are making you out to be \nthe criminal.''\n  Mr. Speaker, as with any organization, there are a few in law \nenforcement that haven't held themselves to the high standards of \ndedication expected within the law enforcement community, and those who \nviolate the public trust should and most often are removed from their \npositions to face harsh disciplinary action.\n  But just as every elected official in Washington, D.C., our peace \nofficers have sworn an oath to uphold and defend the Constitution of \nthe United States.\n  And while there are some instances where officers have strayed off-\ncourse, from what I have seen in the short time that I have been here, \nas a whole, law enforcement has a better record of upholding their \noaths than some of the elected officials here in Washington.\n  Mr. Speaker, our law enforcement officers deserve our admiration, \nrespect, and appreciation, and today I want to thank them for the work \nthey do for us.\n  I want to thank the spouses and the families who have endured many \nsleepless nights while their loved ones were responding to a call.\n  And to the families of those that have given their lives in the line \nof duty, on behalf of a grateful Nation, I thank you for your sacrifice \nfor our safety, security, and freedom.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5123-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5123]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, exactly 2 months ago, I came to the floor to \nspeak out against this House's reckless inaction on the highway trust \nfund, needlessly endangering hundreds of thousands of good-paying jobs. \nYet here we are again, with only 10 legislative days left before the \nhighway trust fund runs out of money. Mr. Speaker, this is harmful and \nit is wrong.\n  According to the American Society of Civil Engineers, 73 percent of \nConnecticut's roads are in poor or mediocre condition. These poor road \nconditions cost the average Connecticut\n\n[[Page H5124]]\n\ndriver $628 in otherwise unnecessary repairs and expenses every year. \nThirty-five percent of Connecticut's bridges are structurally \ndeficient, functionally obsolete, or both.\n  A great nation does not respond to crises with duct tape. A great \nnation leads with bold action. I urge the leadership of the House to \nwork with us to pass a long-term highway bill and invest in America's \ninfrastructure.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5124-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5124]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SUPPORT OUR PUBLIC LIBRARIES\n\n  (Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania.

I \napplaud the Tredyffrin and Paoli Public Libraries across Pennsylvania's \nSixth District in their efforts to promote lifelong learning, \nentertainment, and enrichment.\n  Our public libraries are local treasures that add value and promote \nlearning in our communities.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to highlight America's infrastructure \ncrisis.\n  Almost 30 percent of our Nation's major roadways, and 50 percent in \nCalifornia, are in poor condition, meaning they must be rebuilt, not \njust patched up.\n  Drivers are now paying a hidden pothole tax, the extra cost to \nmaintain a car because of bad roads. In California, the average driver \npays $760 because of poor roads. People and goods are slowed down by \ncongestion.\n  In just 10 legislative days, our highway trust fund expires. Congress \nmust pass a long-term surface transportation bill to ensure that the \nUnited States has the best infrastructure.\n  In May, this Congress kicked the can down the road and passed a \nshort-term bill. It seems we are likely to do that again. This is not a \nresponsible way to govern.\n  We should invest in our transportation system to be globally \ncompetitive and to move these goods efficiently. Drivers want less time \nstuck in traffic and more time at home with their families.

Mr. Speaker, while the Ayatollah has preached \n``Death to America,'' the United States and the West have made a deal \nwith the deceitful wolf of the desert.\n  Iran promises to temporarily cut back and not continue its nuclear \nweapon development capability. Then Iran will receive sanction relief. \nIt will be able to export oil and receive billions of dollars in cash.\n  In 5 years, the embargo on most conventional weapons against Iran \nwill be lifted. In 8 years, Iran will be able to import ICBMs. In 10 \nyears, the deal expires and Iran can develop nuclear weapons, thus \nlegitimizing the number one state sponsor of terrorism and allowing it \nto be a nuclear weapons power.\n  This is dangerous. This will start a nuclear arms race. Israel will \nbe less safe. So will America.\n  In theory, this deal is supposed to give us ``peace in our time,'' to \ncoin a phrase.

Mr. Speaker, far from backing Iran's path to a nuclear \nweapon, the inherently flawed deal announced this morning preserves and \nlegitimizes Iran's nuclear program. The fact that Iran is celebrating \nand that our allies are not should tell you everything that you need to \nknow about this deal.\n  I have read the deal. I have it right here.\n  I believe that it will usher in a terrifying new era of proliferation \nin which neighboring nations feel no choice but to build nuclear \nprograms of their own, while the massive sanctions relief in the deal \nwill provide Iran with hundreds of billions of dollars in new funds to \nfoment terrorism around the globe and prop up its proxies, like Assad \nin Syria and Hamas, to launch brutal attacks on Israel.\n  The measure of success and diplomacy is not simply whether agreement \nis reached; it is whether a good agreement is achieved.

We need a long-term \nbill, and we need it now.\n  In my congressional district alone, there are 421 bridges that are \nstructurally deficient. Just earlier this month, I stood alongside the \nMurray Baker Bridge in Peoria that runs over the Illinois River, the \nheart of my district. Its structure is in need of replacement.\n\n[[Page H5125]]\n\n  Further northwest, where I live, there is the Interstate 74 Bridge. \nJust over the weekend, I stood alongside it. It spans the Mississippi \nRiver. It was built for traffic of about 40,000 cars. Today it \naccommodates about twice that many.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to talk about this Iran deal. \nPresident Obama has made a deal with Islamic Republic of Iran, a \nterrorist regime that regularly leads chants of ``Death to America,'' \nburns our flag, and has killed hundreds of American soldiers.\n  In April, Energy Secretary Moniz said inspectors would have \n``anywhere, anytime access'' to Iran's civil and military sites. \nUnfortunately, this deal sets forth no such requirement.\n  Under the deal, inspectors can only ask for permission to access \nIranian military sites, like their fortified underground facility in \nFordow. Decisions about access will be left to Iran's leaders, who have \nsaid that inspectors will not be permitted to inspect military sites \neven ``in their dreams.''\n  This deal doesn't require the release of the American hostages being \nheld by Iran's Government. It has no acknowledgement of Israel's right \nto exist. These provisions would signal that Iran is serious about \nchanging their ways, but they have said no. And that is why Congress \nshould reject this bad deal.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5125-2", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SAN DIEGO PRIDE MONTH\n\n  (Mrs. DAVIS of California asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, June may be LGBT Pride month. \nBack home in San Diego we continue to celebrate well into July, and we \nsure have something to be proud of this year.\n  The Supreme Court finally affirmed what all of us know to be true, \nthat love is love, that equality is for everyone, and that \ndiscrimination against one is discrimination against all.\n  Without knowing the outcome of the Supreme Court decision, but \nknowing that all are created equal, San Diego Pride appropriately chose \nthis year's theme as ``Liberty and Justice for All.'' As we continue to \npush toward that goal, we can't forget that there is more to be done.\n  LGBT individuals still do not have workplace or housing protections \nin many States. Many LGBT students aren't protected from bullying in \nschools, and transgender individuals, in particular, face added \nobstacles that arise from stigma and ignorance.\n  So while we have much to be proud of, there is still work for this \nHouse to do. Let's come together to ensure that truly there is liberty \nand justice for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5125-3", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        IRAN NUCLEAR NEGOTIATION\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, from the very beginning of the \nnegotiations, President Obama and Secretary Kerry placed far too much \nfaith in the Iranian regime. Trusting Iran to adhere to the terms of \nthis agreement is a fool's errand.\n  This deal allows Iran to continue research on advanced nuclear \ntechnologies. Over the course of the deal, the temporary restrictions \non Iran's nuclear weapons program will wind down. President Obama \nadmitted himself that toward the end of the agreement Iran's nuclear \nbreakout time could shrink almost down to zero.\n  Meanwhile, Iran will receive sanction relief, a boon of $100 billion \nin frozen assets, at the same time while chanting ``death to America'' \nand ``death to Israel.''\n  The agreement lifts an arms embargo of conventional weapons in 5 \nyears, and they will even achieve the ability to have intercontinental \nballistic missiles in 8 years, meaning Iran will have even more money \nand more weapons to continue to destabilize Iraq, Syria, and its \nneighbors in the Mideast and, with the advent of ICBMs, even the United \nStates of America.\n  Congress now has 60 days to review this plan and see if there is \nsomething good in it or not, but we need to be very cautious. Just to \ntake any deal is not a good deal. So it is time that we be tough with \nIran.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5125-4", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5125]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CUTTING OFF YOUR NOSE TO SPITE YOUR FACE\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, let's not forget the kind of regime \nthat exists in Iran, a country that will soon be receiving billions of \ndollars in sanctions relief.\n  Look at this poster. Friday was Al Quds Day in Iran. And what were \nthey all doing? Officially sanctioned parade, shouting ``death to \nAmerica'' and ``death to Israel.''\n  Iran has been labeled as a U.S.-designated state sponsor of terrorism \nfor over three decades now. Yet, just yesterday the White House \nspokesman couldn't even confirm that Iran would remain on the terrorism \nlist after this deal.\n  How hard a question is it to answer, Mr. Speaker? Will the \nadministration's next concession to Iran be to remove it from the \nterrorism list in addition to the billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief?\n  Doing so would mean that we will be helping to finance Iran's support \nfor terror, most of it aimed at us and our ally, the democratic Jewish \nState of Israel.\n  Look at this poster, Mr. Speaker, where the Supreme Leader says, ``No \ncure for barbaric Israel, but total annihilation.''\n  Doing so would be a problem of serious consequences to the United \nStates.

Mr. Speaker, several weeks ago the President announced \nresumption of diplomatic relations with Cuba.\n  While we celebrate the implications of a renewed relationship both \nfor Cuban and American citizens, the citizens of my own home district \ndo so with guarded welcome.\n  Mr. Speaker, the U.S. territories of the Virgin Islands and Puerto \nRico and our geographic proximity to Cuba makes us a direct economic \ncompetitor. All indicators point to massive growth in Cuba's tourism \nindustry.\n  While the U.S. Virgin Islands continues to be a premier tourist \ndestination particularly for Americans, with more than 2.7 million \ntourists in 2014 alone, Cuba is shaping to be a formidable competitor.\n  Prior to resumption of relations, a report from the Caribbean Tourism \nOrganization showed just over 3 million visitors to Cuba in 2014 \ncompared to 2.7 for the Virgin Islands and 3 million in Puerto Rico.\n  However, in the first quarter of 2015, the Cuban Government has \nalready reported more than 1.4 million tourist visits, a number that \nmore than doubles the amount reported for the Virgin Islands and Puerto \nRico during this same time.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States must consider its own island \nterritories of the U.S. Virgin Islands and Puerto Rico in the \nadvancement of diplomatic relations with Cuba.

Some of us in the \nMinnesota delegation, including my colleagues John Kline and Betty \nMcCollum, have highlighted the need for critical repairs and \nconstruction for these schools.\n  The issue is not just financial, though.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Breast Cancer Awareness \n     Commemorative Coin Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       The Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Breast cancer is the most common cancer among American \n     women, except for skin cancers. Today, about 1 in 8, or 12 \n     percent of, women in the United States will develop invasive \n     breast cancer during their lifetime. This is an increase from \n     1 in 11, or 9 percent of, women in 1975.\n       (2) Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer \n     death in women. The chance of dying from breast cancer is \n     about 1 in 36. Thanks to earlier detection, increased \n     awareness, and improved treatment, death rates from breast \n     cancer have decreased since about 1989.\n       (3) There is a strong interest among the American public to \n     do more to tackle this disease. The National Cancer Institute \n     estimates $16.5 billion is spent in the United States each \n     year on breast cancer treatment. Assuming that incidence and \n     survival rates follow recent trends, it is estimated that \n     $17.2 billion will be spent on breast cancer care in the \n     United States in 2014.\n       (4) Finding a cure for breast cancer is a goal of the \n     United States Government.\n       (5) The National Institutes of Health dedicated an \n     estimated $674 million for breast cancer research in Fiscal \n     Year 2014. In Fiscal Year 2014, the Department of Defense's \n     Breast Cancer Research Program received $120 million.\n       (6) While the National Institutes of Health and the \n     Department of Defense program on Breast Cancer research \n     remain the largest funders of breast cancer research in the \n     United States, in 2013, the National Cancer Institute funding \n     was reduced by nearly $66 million since 2011. The funding \n     level for the Department of Defense Breast Cancer Research \n     Program has remained consistent since 2012, however this \n     amount represents a 20-percent decrease from 2011 funding \n     levels.\n       (7) Additional private sector support for breast cancer \n     research will help us find cures for breast cancer even \n     faster.\n       (8) It is estimated that in the United States 231,840 women \n     will be diagnosed with and 40,290 women will die of cancer of \n     the breast in 2015. This means that every 13 minutes a woman \n     dies of breast cancer in the United States.\n       (9) However, due to disease type and lack of adequate care, \n     African-American women have the highest death rates of all \n     racial and ethnic groups overall and are at least 44 percent \n     more likely to die of breast cancer as compared to other \n     racial and ethnic groups.\n       (10) Breast cancer used to be considered a disease of aging \n     but recent trends show that more aggressive forms of the \n     disease have been increasingly diagnosed in younger women.\n       (11) Breast cancer is the most frequently diagnosed cancer \n     among nearly every racial and ethnic group, including \n     African-American, American Indian/Alaska Native, Asian/\n     Pacific Islander and Hispanic/Latina women.\n       (12) Clinical advances, resulting from research, have led \n     to increased survival from breast cancer. Since 1990, death \n     rates from breast cancer have dropped over 34 percent.\n       (13) Among men in the United States it is estimated that \n     there will be 2,350 new cases of invasive breast cancer and \n     440 breast cancer deaths in 2015.\n       (14) At this time there are more than 3.1 million breast \n     cancer survivors in the United States.\n       (15) It is estimated that breast cancer costs $12.5 billion \n     in lost productivity. Such productivity losses will increase \n     with projected growth rate and aging of the U.S. population \n     if cancer mortality rates stay constant in the future.\n       (16) There is a better chance of survival and there are \n     more treatment options with early stage detection through \n     mammograms and clinical breast exams.\n       (17) Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women \n     worldwide, with an estimated 1.7 million new cases of breast \n     cancer among women worldwide in 2012.\n       (18) Breast Cancer Research Foundation (BCRF) is considered \n     one of the most efficient cancer research charities.\n       (19) Of every dollar donated to BCRF, $0.91 goes to \n     research and awareness programs--88 cents towards research \n     and 3 cents towards awareness.\n       (20) Founded in 1993, the BCRF has raised more than $500 \n     million to fuel discoveries in tumor biology, genetics, \n     prevention, treatment, survivorship and metastasis, making \n     BCRF one of the largest private funders of breast cancer \n     research in the world. For 2014-2015, BCRF committed $58.6 \n     million in research, including $11.6 million to the \n     international Evelyn H. Lauder Founder's Fund focused on \n     metastasis, to support the work of more than 220 researchers \n     at leading medical institutions across six continents (25 \n     states and 14 countries).\n       (21) Susan G. Komen (Komen) is the largest non-government \n     funder of breast cancer research, funding research that spans \n     the breast cancer continuum from basic biology to treatment \n     to survivorship.\n       (22) Over the past 5 years, more than 80 cents of every \n     dollar spent by Komen has gone directly to its mission to \n     save lives and end breast cancer by empowering people, \n     ensuring quality care for all and energizing science to find \n     the cures.\n       (23) Since its inception in 1982, Komen has invested more \n     than $2.6 billion towards its mission, including more than \n     $847 million in over 2400 research grants and 450 clinical \n     trials in 48 states and 21 different countries. Recent \n     funding has focused on research to stem metastatic and \n     aggressive disease, find scientifically sound preventive \n     strategies, and investigate environmental links to breast \n     cancer development.\n       (24) Today, BCRF and Susan G. Komen continue their work to \n     advance research and support programs for patients and their \n     families.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nMaxine Waters) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Sessions), the distinguished chairman of \nthe Rules Committee.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman, my dear friend \nfrom Missouri, for this opportunity to allow me to speak today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my friends and colleagues, including \nthe gentlewoman from New York, Congresswoman Carolyn B. Maloney, in \nsupport of H.R. 2722, the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin \nAct.\n  This bipartisan legislation supports research only and awareness with \na new $1 gold minted coin, proceeds of which will benefit breast cancer \nresearch.\n  Mr. Speaker, breast cancer research is one of the most important \npieces of research that the Federal Government and other organizations \nperform on behalf of the American people and people all around the \nworld. This is going to allow, for the first time ever, for these \ncongressionally approved coins to be minted in pink gold in honor of \nthe fight against breast cancer.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, I wear this pin of the breast cancer fight. I \napplaud organizations all across the country that are not only trying \nto make progress in this issue, but are making sure that awareness \nabout breast cancer and actual research to eliminate this deadly \ndisease, that progress is being made. That is what the funds would do \nfrom private contributions of individuals all around the United States.\n  There will be approximately 231,840 cases--new cases--of breast \ncancer among women and 2,350 new cases of breast cancer in men this \nyear alone. That means that every 13 minutes, a woman will die of \nbreast cancer in the United States, making breast cancer the second \nleading cause of death in women in the United States.\n  I think it is important that we understand what we are trying to \naccomplish with this coin and this act today. The bottom line is that \nthe United States Congress allows several organizations each year to be \nable to mint coins on behalf of highlighting the services that they \noffer to the American people.\n  It comes at no cost to the taxpayers of this country. As a matter of \nfact, the Treasury makes a small amount of money as a result of their \ndoing the work.\n  Mr. Speaker, what will happen is that through this legislation \ntoday--that is very intricate and well understood--no money outside of \nany money that is brought to bear would be for anything other than \nbreast cancer research. I am aware of the sensitivity of taxpayer money \nand how that might be used, but no taxpayer money would be used for \nthis effort today.\n  I want to recognize not only the people in breast cancer research, \nbut also many of the survivors all across this country who are \nrecognizing that the awareness and highlighting this project and the \nmoney that would be brought to bear of how important that is.\n  I would say to my colleagues today that breast cancer research cannot \nbe done entirely through taxpayer money. We are counting on outside \nmoney. This is allowing the American people to buy coins, just as we \ndid when I handled the Boy Scout coin with the 100th anniversary of the \nBoy Scouts several years ago. People who were part of the Boy Scouts of \nAmerica paid money in, and it helped us to sell the coin and to \ncelebrate the 100th anniversary of the Boy Scouts.\n  That is exactly what this coin would do also. It would be money from \ncitizens all across this country that would highlight breast cancer \nawareness and the research dollars that would come as a result of that. \nThat is why we are here today, the incredible medical research that is \nimproving the lives of those who are diagnosed and undergoing treatment \nfor breast cancer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe this is the right thing to do for breast \ncancer research, and I want to thank my colleague, Carolyn B. Maloney, \nwho has been doing this bill, not only for the hard work necessary to \nget 290 Members of Congress to say we want to vote on this bill, but \nalso the awareness that, if we will join ranks with millions of people \nwho are back home in our congressional districts who want to see breast \ncancer be solved in our lifetime, that it means that it would be all of \nus across this country.\n  I want to thank the gentleman who is handling this on behalf of the \nFinancial Services Committee, the gentleman from Missouri, for his \ngreat work. I think that this is an overwhelmingly bipartisan bill \nwhere the money will go 100 percent for research, not a dime of \ntaxpayer dollars, and it is a well-understood process that is in the \nbest interests of cancer research for our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in favor of H.R. 2722, introduced \nby my distinguished colleague on the Financial Services Committee, \nRepresentative Carolyn B. Maloney, the ranking member of the Financial \nServices Subcommittee on Capital Markets and Government Sponsored \nEnterprises.\n  I commend the gentlewoman for introducing the bill before us today, \nthe Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act, which provides a \nchance\n\n[[Page H5129]]\n\nfor all of us to come together to raise awareness about this critical \nhealth issue that impacts the lives of so many women and families.\n  Mr. Speaker, the statistics are startling. Approximately one in eight \nwomen in the United States will develop invasive breast cancer during \nher lifetime; and many of these women, approximately 1 in 36, will lose \ntheir lives from this horrible disease.\n  This means that every 13 minutes, a woman in this country will die \nfrom breast cancer. That is 40,290 women in the United States are \nexpected to die from breast cancer in 2015 alone.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  While this disease affects women in every community across this \ncountry for a variety of reasons, such as the lack of adequate care, \nthe likelihood of dying from the disease is particularly high for \nAfrican American women. In fact, African American women had a 44 \npercent higher rate of breast cancer mortality than White women. That \nis why the conversation we are having here today is so important.\n  With increased awareness, early detection, new research, and better \nmedicine, we can save lives, thousands of them each year. If \nconsideration of the bill before us today causes at least one woman to \nget screened for breast cancer, we will be better off for it.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill before us today, which will \nhelp raise awareness and modest sums for the fight against breast \ncancer.\n  Again, I urge adoption of the bill, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as \nshe may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney), the author of this legislation.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good \nfriend and colleague from the great State of California for yielding me \nthe time and for her leadership in so many important areas before this \nbody.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very, very proud to rise today to urge the passage \nof H.R. 2722, the Breast Cancer Awareness Commemorative Coin Act, a \nbill that I authored with my good friend and colleague, Congressman \nPete Sessions from Texas. I also want to add my thanks to Chairman \nHensarling, Ranking Member Maxine Waters of the Financial Services \nCommittee, and the House leadership for bringing this bill so quickly \nto the floor.\n  And a very special thank-you to my partner in this effort, \nCongressman Sessions, who has worked with great commitment and, I would \nsay, creativity in bringing this bill forward and has selflessly worked \nto have it passed in this body. With his leadership, we were able to \nsecure over 307 cosponsors supporting the passage of this bill in \nwriting.\n  What we are doing together with this bill is we are going to save \nAmerican lives. I am absolutely delighted that Senator Heidi Heitkamp \nfrom North Dakota, who is, herself, a breast cancer survivor, has \npledged to put 100 percent of her effort to making sure that the \npassage of this bill happens in the United States Senate.\n  In the United States, over 200,000 new cases of breast cancer will be \ndiagnosed this year, and more than 40,000 women will die. Breast cancer \nis the second leading cause of cancer death in women, and over 2,000 \nmen will be diagnosed. Many people think that it is a woman's disease, \nbut there will be, on average, over 400 men a year who will die from \nbreast cancer. There is only one thing, and one thing only, that can \npossibly save these lives, and that is research.\n  The Breast Cancer Commemorative Coin Act will create the opportunity \nto raise millions of dollars for badly needed breast cancer research \nwithout spending one taxpayer dime. Money buys research, and research \nsaves lives. Make no mistake, there have been significant advances in \nmedical research and better detection efforts over the years. But \n40,000 women are still dying every year, and so much more needs to be \ndone.\n  I suspect that absolutely everyone in this body and everyone who is \nlistening who hears my voice today knows someone that they love, some \nwoman they admire, some family member that they care for who has been \ntouched by the shadow of breast cancer. Through this bill, we offer \nthem hope.\n  Our bill directs the U.S. Mint to create up to 50,000 $5 gold coins, \n400,000 silver dollars, and 750,000 clad commemorative coins and make \nthem available for purchase by the public throughout 2018 so that the \nAmerican public can be involved with their dollars themselves making a \ndecision to support breast cancer research.\n  These coins will feature designs submitted and judged through a \nnational art competition that will symbolize the fight against this \nterrible disease. The gold coin will be unique, made out of the \nbeautiful, highly-prized pink gold to reflect the pink ribbon, an \ninternational symbol of breast cancer awareness. Like the ribbon, we \nhope that Americans across this Nation will be wearing the pink gold \ncoin.\n  Actually, Mr. Speaker, there has never been a pink gold commemorative \ncoin made like this in U.S. history. This will be another congressional \nfirst.\n  This bill is a creative way to raise awareness about breast cancer \nentirely from private funds for critically needed research that is \nnecessary to find a cure. The proceeds will be split between two \noutstanding organizations: the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and \nSusan G. Komen. Over the years, the Breast Cancer Research Foundation \nand Komen each have raised hundreds of millions of dollars for breast \ncancer research across this Nation.\n  I am privileged to represent the Breast Cancer Research Foundation \nand appreciate the constant support and effort from its founder, Evelyn \nLauder, who has passed but created this wonderful organization, and \nMyra Biblowit, president of the Breast Cancer Research Foundation. The \nResearch Foundation has been responsible for many of the cures that \nhave come forward and breakthroughs.\n  There are 3.1 million Americans alive today because of cures that \nhave been financed by the Breast Cancer Research Foundation and Komen. \nBoth organizations have low administrative cost rates so that the \nmajority of every dollar received goes directly to research. For \ninstance, for every dollar donated to the Breast Cancer Research \nFoundation, 91 cents goes directly to research, and that is incredibly \nimportant.\n  The bill requires that every dollar generated through the coin \nprogram must also be matched by private fundraising dollars that are \nraised by these two organizations. The coin program has the potential \nto raise millions of dollars to save lives--and at absolutely no cost \nto the American taxpayer. It can raise as much as $8 million. The money \nwill buy research, and the research will save lives. When so many lives \nare on the line, every dollar counts, every dollar matters.\n  I thank my colleagues, particularly my partner in this effort, \nCongressman Sessions, for their support, and I urge their continued \nbipartisan support in passing the Breast Cancer Commemorative Coin Act.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Just to reiterate, the gentleman from Texas and the fine ladies from \nNew York and California have really done a good job of explaining this \nbill. The importance of this, the fact that we are going to try and go \nafter one of the Nation's leading killers, a disease that has claimed \nmany lives, I think it is important to show that the bipartisan support \nhere and the well wishes and good intentions of the group are something \nwhere it is nice to see something like this happen in Congress.\n  I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2722, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. AMASH. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n\n[[Page H5130]]\n\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5130-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5130-H5132]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      HOMES FOR HEROES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nMaxine Waters) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 251, the Homes for \nHeroes Act of 2015.\n  This bill, introduced by my colleague from Texas, Congressman Al \nGreen, would establish the position of special assistant for Veterans \nAffairs within HUD to coordinate services provided to homeless veterans \nand to serve as HUD's liaison to the Department of Veterans Affairs, \nthe U.S. Interagency Council on Homelessness, State and local \nofficials, and nonprofit service organizations. The position is \ncurrently in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special \nNeeds. This transfer highlights the importance of this issue.\n  H.R. 251 would also require HUD to submit a comprehensive annual \nreport to Congress on the housing needs of homeless veterans and the \nsteps undertaken by HUD to meet these needs.\n  Previous iterations of H.R. 251 have garnered broad support in the \npast. In 2013, the bill passed by a vote of 420-3; in 2012, by a vote \nof 414-5; in 2009, by a vote of 417-2; and in 2008, by a vote of 412-9.\n  Our servicemen and -women continue to bravely serve our country both \nhere and abroad. The least we can do is ensure they have proper access \nto the services offered to them. This bill represents a step in that \ndirection.\n  I urge my colleagues to again support this worthy endeavor.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I would like to thank my colleague and friend, Mr. Green, for \nintroducing this important bill, the Homes for Heroes Act of 2015.\n  This bill aims to help prevent low-income veteran families from \nfalling into homelessness, while also providing relief for those who \nare currently homeless. This bill achieves these aims by elevating a \nposition at HUD aimed specifically at coordinating efforts to ensure \nthat all Federal agencies working to house our homeless veterans are \nworking together at maximum capacity. This position will work closely\n\n[[Page H5131]]\n\nwith the HUD Secretary to achieve these outcomes.\n  The Homes for Heroes Act will also ensure the long-term coordination \nof services for homeless veterans by requiring HUD to submit a \ncomprehensive annual report to Congress on the housing needs of \nhomeless veterans.\n  This bill will help ensure that we continue to make progress on the \ngoal of ending veteran homelessness so that we can ensure that every \nveteran has a roof over their head. Recent efforts to house our \nhomeless veterans have seen bipartisan support in both the House and \nSenate in the form of supporting robust funding for the HUD-Veterans \nAffairs Supportive Housing program, also known as HUD-VASH. This bill \nshould be no different.\n  Our veterans have been at the forefront of protecting this country, \nand we have an obligation here in Congress to protect and provide for \nthose who are most vulnerable. No person in the country should be \ndeprived of a safe, decent, and affordable place to call home. No \nperson should be deprived of a roof over their head. This bill would \nhelp to ensure that we are taking care of those who have taken care of \nthis country.\n  In addition, this bill is supported by the National Alliance to End \nHomelessness, a national advocacy organization committed to preventing \nand ending homelessness in the United States.\n  An identical bill passed the House last Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to again pass this important piece of legislation.\n  I want to thank Mr. Green for his persistence in bringing forth this \nlegislation. It is another wonderful moment for him.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban \nDevelopment estimates that almost 50,000 veterans are homeless on any \ngiven night. That means that right now there are roughly 50,000 of our \nNation's heroes on the streets, without shelter, struggling to find a \nplace to live.\n  This is not how our country should treat the men and women who have \nrisked their lives to protect our Nation. The issue of homeless \nveterans needs to be addressed and resolved, and it needs to be done \nnow.\n  It has always been a priority of mine to eliminate veterans \nhomelessness not just in my home State of New Hampshire, but all across \nthis great Nation. I think my colleagues will all agree with me that we \nmust ensure our veterans and their families have access to affordable \nhousing in order to help promote their independence and well-being.\n  When I was mayor of New Hampshire's largest city, Manchester, I \nlaunched a homeless veterans initiative by working with leaders at \nLiberty House, a safe, supportive, and substance-free housing community \nfor those transitioning out of homelessness.\n  Our veterans deserve equal treatment and access to HUD housing and \nhomeless assistance programs. We can start now by cutting down the \nbureaucracy, bureaucratic hurdles, and by ensuring that the highest \ncare is given to our veterans. This bipartisan bill is a step in the \nright direction.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green) for fighting on \nbehalf of homeless veterans. I am proud to rise in support of our \nNation's heroes, and I am proud to support H.R. 251.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green), the ranking \nmember of the Subcommittee for Oversight and Investigations of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the ranking member very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am so honored to stand on the floor with the \ngentlewoman. Her reputation for supporting the needs of the homeless \nacross the length and breadth of our country is widely known and \ngreatly appreciated and, quite frankly, celebrated.\n  She has been there for the homeless, she has spoken up in committee, \nand she has passed legislation to assist. So it does not surprise me \nthat she would be supportive of this legislation.\n  While it does not surprise me, I still must say that I am greatly \nappreciative for her support because her support makes a difference in \nlegislation moving forward from our committee.\n  I am also honored to thank the chair of the committee, Mr. \nHensarling, who, without question, reservation, or hesitation, \nimmediately concluded that this legislation should have an opportunity \nto be voted upon. He has been a supporter of the legislation in the \npast, and I thank him for his current support.\n  Mr. Luetkemeyer has been supportive of the legislation, and I thank \nhim for his willingness to allow it to come to the floor as quickly as \nit has. Sometimes it can take a little longer than we would like in \ngetting legislation to the floor, but the gentleman immediately \nresponded, and this legislation has made its way to the floor.\n  I also would like to thank the gentleman from New Hampshire, who \nspoke very eloquently about the needs of veterans. It means a lot to me \nto know that we have the breadth of support in the House of \nRepresentatives that we have.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe that it is almost sinful for us in the richest \ncountry in the world to pass veterans who are living in the streets of \nlife, holding signs indicating that they are homeless and that they \nneed help. I believe that the richest country in the world can afford \nto provide for those who return home and are homeless.\n  I think that, when a person signs up to serve in the military, you do \nnot know where that assignment will take you. It could very well mean \nthat you will go to some distant place or it could mean that you will \nstay right here within the continental United States.\n  But when you sign up, you sign up to go wherever you are told and to \ndo whatever is required, and a good many of those who sign up and go \nand do what is required don't always return home the same way they \nleft.\n  As a result, we see not only veterans on the streets asking for help, \nbut you see veterans who are sometimes without all of their body parts. \nIt is especially painful when you see a person who has served the \ncountry and who may be in a wheelchair now who is asking for assistance \non a street corner.\n  I am proud to thank the Obama administration for the work that has \nbeen done to eradicate homelessness among our veterans. In Houston, \nTexas, we had a meeting with the HUD Secretary and others.\n  At that meeting, our mayor announced that we were ending homelessness \nin Houston, Texas, in the sense that a person who needs help could find \nhelp if one is a veteran in Houston, Texas. That means a lot to me to \nknow that my hometown city is now moving forward and is helping those \nwho are living in the streets of life.\n  This piece of legislation, H.R. 251, makes permanent what is already \ntaking place. There is a person who is there to look out for veterans \nin HUD, but we want to make sure that that person is there permanently. \nThat is what this legislation does.\n  You have heard about the reports that will have to be submitted. It \nis exceedingly important that we know how many people are homeless in \nthe veterans population, and it is exceedingly important to know what \nit costs to house and to take care of them. These are the kinds of \nthings that the report will reveal to all who wish to know.\n  It is also important for us to understand that this is not an effort \nthat we can end, because we are making progress. Progress is important, \nbut to continue the progress and to completely eradicate this \nhomelessness, we have to have people who are there, acting \nas sentinels, as watchmen, for those who have served us well. That is \nwhat this person will do who will be stationed in HUD.\n\n  For further edification about the situation in terms of homelessness \namong the veterans population, let me share the statistical information \nwith you:\n  In January of 2014, the demographics indicated that, on any given \nnight, as was indicated, about 50,000 veterans--49,933--were homeless.\n  Let's talk about the people themselves and not allow them to become \nnumbers. Here is what the statistical information further reveals: 12 \npercent of the homeless adult population are veterans.\n\n[[Page H5132]]\n\n  It reveals that 20 percent of the male homeless population are \nveterans. It reveals that 51 percent of individual homeless veterans \nhad disabilities, 51 percent who need our help, 51 percent who will \nbenefit from having a person whose job it is to monitor and to make \nsure that they are taken care of.\n  Further, it would reveal that 70 percent have substance abuse \nproblems, which is something that we really don't like to talk about. \nWe know that it exists, and we know that something can be done about \nit, but you need someone who is there as a sentinel, as a watchman, to \nmake sure that these needs are taken care of.\n  Many of them developed their substance abuse problems while in the \nmilitary, while serving the country. That is unfortunate, but it is a \nfact. What we want to do is to make sure that we take care of all of \nthem.\n  I am so honored to say to you that this bill has received great \nbipartisan support in the past, overwhelmingly so, I might add.\n  I also want to just thank my colleagues by reminding us of Ruth \nSmeltzer's words:\n\n       Some measure their lives by days and years, others by \n     heartthrobs, passions, and tears; but the surest measure \n     under the God's Sun is what for others in your lifetime have \n     you done.\n\n  I want to thank all who are going to do what they can to help \neliminate homelessness among the veterans population and those who will \nsupport this piece of legislation. Hopefully, we will get it passed in \nthe Senate such that we won't next term find ourselves supporting this \nsame legislation.\n  I thank the ranking member again so much for her many years of \nservice and for her support for this legislation as well as for the \nmany years of support that she has accorded those who have lived in the \nstreets of life.\n  God bless her, and God bless our country.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, in closing, just to reiterate and, \nagain, congratulate and associate our remarks with the fine gentleman's \nfrom Texas (Mr. Al Green), one can see that his hard work and advocacy \nand his passion for this issue is unparalleled. We certainly want to \ncontinue to support him, and we urge the support of this body for his \nfine bill here, H.R. 251.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support to H.R. 251, the \n``Homes for Heroes Act of 2015,'' which would amend the Department of \nHousing and Urban Development Act to establish in the Office of the \nSecretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) a \nSpecial Assistant for Veterans Affairs.\n  Our military veterans deserve our deepest gratitude for the courage \nand valor they demonstrated in service while defending the United \nStates of America.\n  I support this bill strongly because it ensure veterans fair access \nto HUD housing and homeless assistance programs, coordinates all HUD \nprograms and activities relating to veterans, and betters serves as a \nHUD liaison with the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA).\n  Also, terminating the position of Special Assistant for Veterans \nPrograms in the Office of the Deputy Assistant Secretary for Special \nNeeds would create more coordinated relations that will better serve \nthe needs of our nation's veterans.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, in our country, there are approximately 107,000 \nveterans (male and female) who are homeless on any given night.\n  And perhaps twice as many (200,000) experience homelessness at some \npoint during the course of a year.\n  Many other veterans are considered near homeless or at risk because \nof their poverty, lack of support from family and friends, and dismal \nliving conditions in cheap hotels or in overcrowded or substandard \nhousing.\n  In my hometown of Houston for example, between the years 2010 and \n2012, the number of homeless veterans increased from 771 to 1,162.\n  President Obama and the Congress made a commitment to end \nhomelessness by 2015.\n  However, even with all the progress this administration has made, \nuntil we have every veteran permanently sheltered in the United States, \nwe have not succeeded.\n  I have always devoted myself in these efforts, as I know of the kind \nof impact assisting our heroes to get back on their feet can have on \nthe well-being of our communities.\n  H.R. 251, the ``Homes for Heroes Act of 2015,'' is a positive step \ntowards the right direction in our effort to support our nation's \nheroes, who have put their lives on the line for our protection.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot let this issue of homelessness continue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in voting in support of H.R. 251.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Carter of Georgia). The question is on \nthe motion offered by the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) \nthat the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 251.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5132-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5132-H5134]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HOUSING ASSISTANCE EFFICIENCY ACT\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass \nthe bill (H.R. 1047) to authorize private nonprofit organizations to \nadminister permanent housing rental assistance provided through the \nContinuum of Care Program under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance \nAct, and for other purposes.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1047\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Housing Assistance \n     Efficiency Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. AUTHORITY TO ADMINISTER RENTAL ASSISTANCE.\n\n       Subsection (g) of section 423 of the McKinney-Vento \n     Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. 11383(g)) is amended by \n     inserting ``private nonprofit organization,'' after ``unit of \n     general local government,''.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1047, the Housing Assistance \nEfficiency Act, introduced by the gentleman from California (Mr. \nPeters). This bill makes a technical correction to the 2009 HEARTH Act \namendments to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act.\n  H.R. 1047 will accomplish two goals:\n  First, it would restore the ability of nonprofit organizations to \nadminister permanent housing rental assistance provided through the \nMcKinney-Vento Continuum of Care program.\n  Second, it would authorize the HUD Secretary to reallocate any \nhousing assistance provided from the Emergency Solutions Grants Program \nthat is unused or returned or that becomes available after the minimum \nallocation requirements under McKinney-Vento have been met on an annual \nrather than on a semiannual basis.\n  In 2009, the HEARTH Act amended McKinney-Vento to combine the Shelter \nPlus Care program and the supportive housing programs into a single, \ncompetitive program.\n  When combining the activities of the previous programs into one, the \nHEARTH Act also created a new requirement that only States, units of \nlocal governments, or Public Housing Agencies--PHAs--could administer \nrental assistance. Previously, these public entities had used private \nnonprofit organizations to administer the assistance.\n\n[[Page H5133]]\n\n  H.R. 1047 corrects an unintended consequence of the HEARTH Act by \nrestoring nonprofit participation. The bill maximizes community \nflexibility to allow existing nonprofits that operate leased housing to \nhomeless families and individuals to continue to manage their McKinney-\nVento grants as rental assistance as well as to continue to develop \ninnovative practices that assist homeless families and individuals.\n  Finally, H.R. 1047 reduces a regulatory burden by requiring HUD to \nreallocate unused Emergency Solutions Grants Program funds only once \nper year. As I understand from HUD and many nonprofit organizations, \nthere are very few unused funds available; yet, a complicated \nreallocation program, as required by current law, must be conducted \ntwice a year even if the amount is miniscule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to pass this commonsense \nlegislation that is supported by the administration and many of the \nnonprofit organizations that continue to serve homeless populations \nwith limited resources.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I want to thank my colleague from California (Mr. Peters) for working \non this important issue and introducing this bill.\n  This bill, entitled the Housing Assistance Efficiency Act, makes two \nkey changes to the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act that are long \noverdo.\n  Specifically, this bill is designed to fix two technical problems \nthat have arisen in HUD's homeless assistance programs due to technical \nerrors in the language in the HEARTH Act, which was a bipartisan bill \nthat significantly reformed the homeless assistance programs in 2009.\n  Among other things, HUD's homeless assistance programs help homeless \npeople pay rent when they move out of shelters or off the streets and \ninto housing.\n  Since the inception of these programs, local nonprofit organizations \nhave received funding from HUD to administer efficient and cost-\neffective rental assistance programs, working with local landlords to \nget places for homeless people to live.\n  Unfortunately, in 2009, when certain programs were merged under the \nHEARTH Act, these nonprofits became ineligible to directly administer \npermanent rental assistance.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  This unintentional result of the HEARTH Act has created huge \nuncertainty on the ground for many nonprofits who work hard to house \nour homeless populations across the country. The permanent fix in H.R. \n1047 would be extremely helpful for communities that are working to end \nhomelessness for chronic individuals, veterans, children, and other \npopulations.\n  The second provision in H.R. 1047 addresses the Emergency Solutions \nGrants Program, a program aimed at homelessness prevention and rapid \nrehousing activities. The bill would amend the current HUD requirement \nto reallocate unused, returned, or otherwise newly available funds \ntwice per year to just once per year. This change provides HUD and \nlocal agencies with administrative relief, while having no negative \nimpact on beneficiaries of these programs.\n  In addition, this program is supported by the National Alliance to \nEnd Homelessness, a national advocacy organization committed to \npreventing and ending homelessness in the United States. An identical \nbill passed the House last December on the suspension calendar by voice \nvote. I urge my colleagues to again vote in favor of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from California (Mr. Peters).\n  Mr. PETERS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Today, I rise to urge passage of the Housing Assistance Efficiency \nAct, a bill that I introduced earlier this year. As the ranking member \nsaid, an identical version of this legislation passed the House by \nvoice vote last December.\n  Many laws are intended to ensure efficiency in Federal agencies but \noften have unintended consequences, preventing agencies from serving \nthe public and costing taxpayers money.\n  Currently, the Department of Housing and Urban Development's \nContinuum of Care Program is forced to spend too much time fulfilling \nadministrative obligations, instead of helping individuals and families \ntransition out of homelessness and putting them on a path to \nindependent living.\n  This legislation will reduce government inefficiency and make it \neasier for Americans struggling to find a foothold to access the \nalready existing resources available to them.\n  Twice each fiscal year, HUD has to reallocate unused or returned \nfunds in the Emergency Solutions Grants Program. Because funds are \nalmost never unused or returned under this program, the reallocation of \nfunds takes a lot of time and human capital to complete but with little \nend purpose.\n  It is administratively more efficient to reallocate funds only once \nper year. This frees up HUD employees to provide more human resources \ntoward better providing service to constituents. We shouldn't saddle \nHUD with more administrative work that isn't helping anyone.\n  In addition to mandatory fund allocations, HUD faces a mountain of \npaperwork as it tries to administer that important system used by more \nthan 3 million Americans each year. Prior to 2009, private nonprofits \ncould administer rental assistance through HUD's Continuum of Care.\n  Nonprofits are uniquely positioned to handle the needs of those \nseeking rental assistance, using expertise in individual communities of \nvulnerable populations to serve the clients where they are.\n  The HEARTH Act, however, muddled rental assistance laws, and private \nnonprofits were left off the list of entities allowed to administer \nrental assistance. Currently, only States, local government units, or \npublic housing agencies can dispense this housing assistance, although \nnonprofits have substantial experience and the ability to reach \nvulnerable populations that is often unavailable to government \nprograms.\n  Private nonprofits can still execute other homelessness programs, but \nthey have to go through public housing agencies or another layer of \nbureaucracy to get rental assistance to their clients or to the \nlandlord. This creates more bureaucratic burdens when individuals and \nfamilies really need the help quickly to stay in their homes.\n  Passing this bill would remedy both these problems, make HUD a more \nefficient agency, and get homelessness assistance to those who need it \nmore quickly. This is particularly important in San Diego, where access \nto affordable housing has been continually one of our region's biggest \nobstacles and where we have the third largest homeless population in \nthe country. By passing today's bill, we can help HUD be more efficient \nand ensure that community experts and nonprofits are not hamstrung by \nFederal inaction.\n  In their statement supporting this legislation, the San Diego Housing \nFederation said: ``This bill removes barriers to helping get important \nresources to those who need it most.'' Mr. Speaker, that is what it is \nall about.\n  I urge my colleagues to help pass this legislation and take \nsubstantive action to improve government efficiency and help fight \nchronic homelessness in our country.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I reserve the balance of my time, Mr. Speaker.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, we just want to reiterate our support \nfor H.R. 1047. We feel it corrects some problems that have arisen \ninadvertently.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, today, I rise in support of H.R. \n1047, the Housing Assistance Efficiency Act. This bill would remove \nnon-essential administrative boundaries in order to better serve our \nnation's homeless population.\n  Under the McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act, only a state, local \ngovernment, or public housing agency may administer housing assistance \nto our nation's homeless.\n\n[[Page H5134]]\n\nThis regulation prevents many non-profit agencies--which often have \ndeep ties to our communities--from assisting the homeless.\n  Like many districts and states, the State of Alabama faces many \nchallenges in addressing the needs of our homeless. We can accomplish \nthis by correcting any unintended legislative consequences and taking \naction to create the most fast-acting and efficient system of housing \nassistance possible.\n  The Housing Assistance Efficiency Act addresses these problems by \nincreasing efficiency, eliminating red tape, and expediting the process \nof providing safe, stable shelter for homeless communities.\n  I congratulate my colleague from California, Congressman Peters, for \nremaining vigilant and continuing to be a voice for our most vulnerable \ncommunities. This is a valuable opportunity to eliminate barriers and \noffer a faster and more financially responsible approach to assisting \nthe homeless.\n  While we continue our efforts to help the homeless, we must remain \nmindful of our long-term goals. I urge my colleagues to help pass this \nlegislation and reaffirm our commitment to the alleviation of \nhomelessness in all of our communities.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1047.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5134-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5134-H5135]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      PRESERVATION ENHANCEMENT AND SAVINGS OPPORTUNITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2482, the \nPreservation Enhancement and Savings Opportunity Act of 2015.\n  As my colleague from Minnesota, a longtime advocate of this \npreservation bill, will explain shortly, this bill provides technical \nchanges to the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident \nHomeownership Act of 1990, or LIHPRHA, to allow property owners access \nto their profits while ensuring long-term preservation of affordable, \nmultifamily housing properties.\n  By correcting the inequities resulting from a fixed return on \ninvestment, we are providing for continued preservation of an important \nasset and facilitating future recapitalization to maximize the \nremaining useful life of the LIHPRHA properties without any cost to the \nFederal Government.\n  HUD recognized the need to address this issue in the administration's \nfiscal year 2015 and fiscal year 2016 budget requests. \nAdministratively, HUD has removed the limitation on distributions in \nsimilar circumstances where it had the authority to do so but has \ndetermined it lacks such authority with the LIHPRHA portfolio.\n  This bill ensures the continued viability of the properties through \ncontinued adherence to the use agreement. This includes compliance with \nphysical need requirements and requirement to provide for any \nidentified capital needs.\n  I would like to reemphasize that this provision does not result in a \ncost to the Federal Government and ensures long-term preservation. I \nthank the gentleman from Minnesota for his hard work on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  This bill is the product of years of thoughtful consideration and \nnegotiations. I am very pleased with the compromises that were reached \non this bill, especially some additional tenant protections that \ninclude rent affordability restrictions for existing tenants.\n  There are currently about 640 properties that are subject to \nrestrictions in the Low-Income Housing Preservation and Resident \nHomeownership Act of 1990, otherwise known as LIHPRHA. LIHPRHA imposed \nsome significant restrictions on property owners, which have proven to \nbe problematic by making it more difficult for property owners to \npreserve these aging properties.\n  This bill would help address this issue by providing affected \nproperty owners with greater flexibilities on the condition that they \ncomply with basic requirements that ensure that the properties are \nadequately maintained\n\n[[Page H5135]]\n\nand that tenants do not see dramatic increases in rents.\n  By providing these flexibilities, property owners will have better \naccess to capital to carry out repairs and other improvements that will \nhelp preserve these aging properties and ultimately benefit tenants. \nParticularly in light of the current rental housing crisis, this is an \nimportant bipartisan measure that seeks to preserve our affordable \nhousing stock. I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe distinguished gentleman from Minnesota (Mr. Paulsen), who has been \nan advocate on this issue for a long, long time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of the legislation, the \nPreservation Enhancement and Savings Opportunity Act. Let me start by \nthanking the gentleman and the ranking member of the committee for \ntheir long efforts to bring this legislation forward with support.\n  As was mentioned, in 1990 Congress enacted the Low-Income Housing \nPreservation and Resident Homeownership Act, or LIHPRHA, to preserve \nand extend the availability of low-income housing throughout the \ncountry.\n  Many low-income housing properties at that time were nearing the end \nof a 20-year period of the owner's obligation to maintain below-market \nrents for qualified tenants, and Congress was worried about a flood of \nthousands of properties coming out of the low-income housing pool.\n  Congress used LIHPRHA to create new incentives, in the form of low-\ninterest restructured mortgages, to entice property owners to maintain \ntheir properties as low-income housing. In exchange for the incentives, \nowners who agreed to extend low-income use of properties became \nobligated to operate properties as low-income housing for 50 years or \nthe remaining useful life of the properties, whichever would be \ngreater.\n  Property owners also agreed to a fixed cap on their allowed annual \ncash distributions from rents from the properties. The cap was designed \nto provide the owners with an 8 percent equity return, based on \nproperty values at the time. The income from the properties above the \ncap is still the owner's money, but it is held at HUD in an account \nthat the owners have no right to access until the end of that 50-year \nperiod.\n  These 8 percent distribution limits, while initially workable, over \ntime have resulted in very adverse and unexpected consequences, in \nparticular relating to the Federal income tax liabilities of the \nowners. Initially, owners were able to offset a portion of their taxes \nowed with depreciation and mortgage interest deductions. The 8 percent \ncash distributions were sufficient to meet those tax obligations.\n  However, since that time, rents have increased, and deductible \nmortgage interest and depreciation deductions have decreased for \nLIHPRHA property owners. This effectively means that the annual Federal \ntaxable income of the owners has increased substantially, despite the \nfact that their allowed cash distributions have remained capped at a \nconstant dollar amount fixed in the 1990s.\n  Mr. Speaker, in recent years, for example, owners' income tax \nliabilities have often been more than double the amount of cash \npermitted to be distributed to them under the law, and this is unfair \nto LIHPRHA property owners. It will only worsen over time.\n  Fortunately, there is a simple solution to the problem. The \nPreservation Enhancement and Savings Opportunity Act will allow LIHPRHA \nproperty owners to access their funds held at HUD, after all operating \nexpenses and property maintenance costs have been paid. More \nimportantly, removing the limitation on distributions will not result \nin any cost to the Federal Government, as the funds belong to the \nowners and not to HUD.\n  The legislation also requires individuals refinancing LIHPRHA \nproperties to provide adequate rehabilitation and replacement reserves. \nIt includes protections for low-income housing tenants from excessive \nrent increases.\n  Removing the limitation on distributions and the refinancing \nprovisions will facilitate additional recapitalization of these \nproperties by private sector developers and other preservation \nentities, which will in turn extend the availability of low-income \nhousing across the country for those who most need it. This all happens \nat no additional cost to American taxpayers.\n  Mr. Speaker, I insert into the Record a letter to Chairman Hensarling \nand Ranking Member Waters from nine national housing organizations \nendorsing this bill.\n  I close by asking my colleagues to join me in support of this \nlegislation.\n\n                                                    June 11, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services.\n     Hon. Maxine Waters,\n     Ranking Minority Member, Committee on Financial Services.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling and Ranking Member Waters: The \n     undersigned organizations urge you to support H.R. 2482, the \n     Preservation, Enhancement and Savings Opportunity Act of \n     2014. The bill provides technical changes to the Low Income \n     Housing Preservation and Resident Homeownership Act of 1990 \n     (LIHPRHA) while ensuring long-term preservation of these \n     affordable multifamily housing properties.\n       When LIHPRHA was enacted, property owners were provided \n     incentives to maintain the affordability of the properties \n     for low and moderate income renters for the remaining useful \n     life of the properties in exchange for relinquishing the \n     right to prepay the mortgage after 20 years. As part of the \n     process, the owners' equity contributions in the property \n     were redefined but a contractual limitation on property \n     income distributions remained, even though all surplus funds \n     belong to the ownership entity. Such a limitation was \n     workable twenty years ago, but as the mortgages mature the \n     annual distribution becomes insufficient to address \n     increasing tax liabilities.\n       The bill would remove the limitation on distributions and \n     provide the ownership entity/sponsor access to its own funds \n     to address tax liabilities or other expenses while ensuring \n     continued preservation and adherence to the properties' use \n     agreements. Such action provides additional incentives for \n     future investors to recapitalize these multifamily \n     properties, therefore extending their useful life and the \n     continuation of a scarce housing resource for years to come. \n     For the last 15 years, HUD has administratively removed \n     limitations on distributions where it had the authority to do \n     so. HUD has concluded that it lacks this authority with the \n     LIHPRHA portfolio.\n       The bill's changes to LIHPRHA have no associated budgetary \n     or tax cost to the Federal Government and ensure the \n     preservation of an important housing resource. We urge you to \n     support H.R. 2482.\n           Sincerely,\n         Council for Affordable and Rural Housing (CARH); \n           Institute of Real Estate Management (IREM); Institute \n           for Responsible Housing Preservation (IRHP); Mortgage \n           Bankers Association (MBA); National Affordable Housing \n           Management Association (NAHMA); National Apartment \n           Association (NAA); National Association of Home \n           Builders (NAHB); National Leased Housing Association \n           (NLHA); National Multifamily Housing Council (NMHC).\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMissouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. \nMaxine Waters) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Missouri.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today, I rise in support of H.R. 2997, the Private Investment in \nHousing Act of 2015. This bill, introduced by my colleague, the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross), would authorize the Secretary of \nHousing and Urban Development to establish a demonstration program to \nmake assisted multifamily properties more energy and water efficient at \nno cost to U.S. taxpayers.\n  Currently, HUD spends in excess of $7 billion in annual energy and \nwater costs for HUD-assisted properties. These properties are generally \nolder, with inefficient energy and water usage. In most cases, owners \nof these older assisted properties lack the capital to modernize their \nbuildings to perform energy and water efficiency.\n  H.R. 2997 would create a demonstration for no more than 20,000 \nassisted units where HUD would enter into agreements with \nintermediaries--most likely, nonprofit entities--to produce energy and \nwater efficiency in exchange for a share of the savings.\n  This demonstration and the subsequent contract with the intermediary \nwould allow these entities to raise capital from private investors and \nfoundations. HUD would not provide upfront capital investments for any \nenergy retrofits and there would be no risk to the Federal Government.\n  Savings due to the retrofits, verified by an independent third party, \nwould then result in HUD remitting a portion of the savings back to the \nintermediaries. If savings are not realized, the loss is absorbed by \nthe private investors or foundations.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2997 is an example of the public-private \npartnership innovation needed to attract capital investment to our \npublic- and assisted-housing stock. This demonstration, in addition to \nthe Rental Assistance Demonstration program, is the beginning of \nbipartisan legislative initiatives to bring private sector resources \nand management to affordable housing for low- and very low-income \nfamilies.\n  As chairman of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee of the \nFinancial Services Committee, I am working with Members on both sides \nof the aisle to develop legislation similar to H.R. 2997, which would \nmake the operations of HUD and its programs more efficient. Today's \nbill is a step in that direction.\n  In addition to the sponsor, Representative Ross, I want to thank the \nranking member of the Housing and Insurance Subcommittee, Mr. Cleaver, \nalong with Representatives Himes of Connecticut and Delaney of \nMaryland, for their hard work on this legislation.\n  I urge all Members to support H.R. 2997, and I reserve the balance of \nmy time.\n\n[[Page H5137]]\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill would create a pilot program within HUD which \nwould allow for energy and water efficiency upgrades to be made to \ncertain private multifamily HUD properties at no cost to the \ngovernment.\n  Under this innovative pilot program, investors would provide all of \nthe upfront capital to make the improvements, and they would only get \npaid based on a portion of the cost savings that result from the \nimprovements. If there are no cost savings, the losses would be \ncompletely on the investors, not HUD or the taxpayers.\n  This is a rare win-win situation. HUD and taxpayers benefit from cost \nsavings; tenants benefit from the improvements made to their homes; \ninvestors benefit from the profits, and of course, the environment \nbenefits from the more responsible use of natural resources.\n  This bill also ensures accountability by requiring a third-party \nevaluation to verify any cost savings and also by requiring the \nSecretary to report on the outcomes of the pilot within a year of \nenactment.\n  There is simply no reason for bipartisan bickering on a bill like \nthis. I urge my colleagues to support this bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Florida (Mr. Ross), a distinguished member of the \nHousing and Insurance Subcommittee.\n  Mr. ROSS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and Ranking Member Waters \nfor their support.\n  As the chairman pointed out, currently, HUD spends more than $7 \nbillion annually in energy and water costs. In our current fiscal \nenvironment, we must look to new technology and for innovative \nsolutions to generate savings for both taxpayers and the Federal \nGovernment.\n  Today, I am proud to ask my colleagues to join me in supporting \nbipartisan H.R. 2997, the Private Investment and Housing Act. This \nlegislation will establish a demonstration project that will encourage \nprivate sector entities to retrofit and modernize a limited number of \nHUD multifamily housing units at absolutely no cost to taxpayers.\n  This legislation is necessary because nonprofits and other entities \nthat focus on financing for affordable housing are unable to enter into \ncontractual agreements to retrofit HUD multifamily housing units. \nImagine leveraging private capital to enhance the livability and \ninhabitability of affordable housing at no cost to the taxpayers or the \nFederal Government.\n  It doesn't involve any risk to the Federal Government or the \ntaxpayer. In fact, investors take the first loss position on energy \nupgrades. If energy savings from these projects are not realized after \nprivate entities enter these contracts, the Federal Government does not \npay anything, period.\n  If savings through these projects are achieved, they would lower \nHUD's energy expenditures by as much as 20 percent, creating tremendous \nsavings for the taxpayer. Private entities who take on the risk to \nretrofit these units will receive a $1 return for every $1 in cost \nsavings that are verified by a third party.\n  The demonstration program created by this legislation would help \nimprove up to 20,000 HUD-assisted apartments receiving project-based \nrental assistance, supportive housing for the elderly, or supportive \nhousing for persons with disabilities.\n  The demonstration projects will help a limited number of people at \nfirst in Florida and across the country. However, over time, once it is \na proven success, more than 48,000 eligible properties in the State of \nFlorida and the 900 units in my district alone may be able to benefit, \nagain, at no expense to the taxpayer.\n  In addition to the direct economic benefits to taxpayers, these \nupgrades will bring meaningful health and other benefits to the \nfamilies living in the buildings, creating a healthier and safer \nenvironment for residents.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Representative Jim Himes; \nRepresentative Emanuel Cleaver, ranking member of the subcommittee; and \nRepresentative John Delaney, for their support on this legislation.\n  I also want to thank Enterprise Community Partners for their support \nof this legislation and for the support of projects that encourage a \npublic-private partnership in affordable housing.\n  I ask you join me in supporting this legislation to engage the \nprivate sector to help HUD reduce their annual $7 billion in energy and \nwater spending.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I urge support, and I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I encourage support for H.R. 2997. I \nthink it is a great idea to, again, go into a public-private \npartnership and utilize that as an opportunity, again, at no cost to \nthe taxpayers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2997.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5137-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5137-H5140]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       MORTGAGE SERVICING ASSET CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1408, as amended. I want to thank the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter) for introducing the \nlegislation.\n  Mortgage servicing assets, or MSAs, also known as mortgage servicing \nrights, are contracts to service mortgage loans. Historically, these \nassets have been held by banks and credit unions that have existing or \ndeveloping relationships with their customers.\n  However, the Basel III negotiations dramatically changed the capital \nrequirements for MSAs, forcing many financial institutions to sell off \nthese assets. Many have been sold to hedge funds or other nonbanks with \nlittle to no experience in dealing directly with consumers.\n  In recent years, a bipartisan group of five members of the Financial \nServices Committee sent letters to Federal banking regulators asking \nwhether or not they have studied MSAs or MSA performance during the \nfinancial crisis before finalizing the Basel-generated capital \nrequirements. The answer was pretty clear; the regulators had not.\n  There was no consideration of MSAs, how the assets have performed \nhistorically, or the impact that higher capital would have on \nconsumers. What is more disconcerting is MSAs exist only in the United \nStates. These are a uniquely American product. Nowhere else in the \nworld do MSAs exist; yet it was international regulators who decided \nhow these assets should be treated.\n  Last year, New York State superintendent of financial services \nBenjamin Lawsky addressed MSAs before a meeting of the Institute of \nInternational Bankers. Lawsky stated:\n\n       We are finding we are creating giant nonbank servicers who, \n     in a couple of instances . . . are not fully prepared to deal \n     with this exponential rise in their portfolios, and they \n     don't have the capacity to service the loans they are taking \n     on.\n\n  Lawsky went on to say:\n\n       While, on the one hand, we were trying to get rid of a \n     problem, we made a different problem worse.\n\n  H.R. 1408 is a straightforward, bipartisan bill. The bill simply says \nthat the U.S. banking regulators need to go back and study MSAs and the \nimpact the new capital requirements will have on consumers. Given what \nwe have seen in this space in the last year, I think it is not only \nappropriate but completely necessary that we take another look at MSAs.\n  I want to, again, thank Mr. Perlmutter for his work on this \nlegislation, and I ask that my colleagues support our effort to ensure \nthat a more methodical approach is taken by the banking regulators.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  During the foreclosure crisis of the last several years, we have \nlearned how important the role of mortgage servicing is to our economy \nand our constituents. I am proud of the work we did in the Dodd-Frank \nAct and of the work that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau \ncontinues to do to reform the practices of the mortgage servicing \nindustry.\n  Unfortunately, this Congress has not been able to move legislation on \nbroader housing finance reform. While we have left this business \nunfinished, there has been a large shift in the structure of the \nmortgage servicing industry, as nonbank servicers who are supervised by \nState regulators play a much larger role than they have in the past.\n  That is why I am supporting the good, bipartisan work Mr. Perlmutter \nand Mr. Luetkemeyer have engaged in to make sure that State and Federal \nregulators are working together to understand the changes in the \nmortgage servicing industry and to make sure bank and nonbank services \nare treated appropriately under new financial rules.\n  This study will give regulators the information they need to monitor \nthe impact of capital standards on the mortgage servicing market and \nencourage State and Federal regulators to work together to ensure that \nall mortgage services are appropriately capitalized, regardless of who \nregulates them.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  H.R. 1408 will ensure that regulators are paying close attention to a \nvital part of our housing and financial system, and I am happy that we \nwere able to work with the majority to pass this bill.\n  So I thank you, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a distinguished member \nof our Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank the manager, my friend from Missouri.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1408, the Mortgage \nServicing Asset Capital Requirements Act.\n  Mortgage servicing is a very valued product for our community banks. \nI am proud to represent several mortgage service firms connected to \ncommunity banks in my State of Arkansas.\n  Having mortgage servicing assets connected with a residential lending \nportfolio adds value; it is incidental and important to banking; and, \neffectively, it is a proper hedge, a natural hedge for that residential \nlending business.\n  However, because of Basel III's capital requirements imposed on \nmortgage servicing organizations, many banks are being forced to sell \ntheir MSA portfolios to hedge funds or nonbanks, which don't really \nhave the experience with the local customers in a personal, \nknowledgeable way like our community banks do.\n  MSAs are unique, as the gentleman from Missouri said, to the United \nStates, but they are being regulated by\n\n[[Page H5139]]\n\nrules developed by an international body without any study as to \nwhether additional capital is even needed or any review on the impact \nof customer relationships.\n  In my view, while staying implementation of these capital \nrequirements during a study, as provided in the original version of the \nbill, would be optimal, it is nonetheless imperative that the impacts \nof this rule be thoroughly analyzed, vetted, and understood.\n  I thank my friends, the gentlemen from Colorado and Missouri, for \ntheir work. I ask my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Perlmutter), and I \nwould like to thank him for the work that he has put into this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, to my friend from California, I thank \nCongresswoman Waters, Chairman Hensarling for allowing me to bring this \nforward, my friend from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), and I appreciate \nthe remarks of the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill).\n  So after years of working on this issue, I am glad to see our work is \nculminating with the passage of H.R. 1408 today.\n  The language before us today represents a compromise simply requiring \nthe Federal banking regulators--and by those I mean the Federal \nReserve, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, the National Credit \nUnion Administration, and the Office of the Comptroller of Currency--to \njointly study the capital treatment of mortgage servicing assets or \nmortgage servicing rights, and I will say MSRs or MSAs, under the Basel \nIII Accords. It is nearly identical to section 116 of S. 1484, offered \nby Chairman Shelby in the Senate Banking Committee.\n  Now, it differs from the original bill passed out of the Financial \nServices Committee on March 26 that included language to delay the \ncurrent rule while regulators conducted a study and then proposed new \nappropriate capital requirements for MSRs. While many of us wish the \nbill included those provisions, the study is what is key. The study \nwill be an important step in informing how we proceed with future \nactions establishing the appropriate capital requirements for MSRs.\n  Now, what does H.R. 1408 require?\n  Under H.R. 1408, regulators will have 6 months to study and report \nback to Congress many outstanding questions about the mortgage \nservicing industry, including:\n  One, the risk to banks and credit unions of holding mortgage \nservicing assets, MSAs;\n  Two, how the assets performed during the financial crisis;\n  Three, the ability to establish a value and liquidity for MSAs;\n  Four, the impact of imposing Basel III capital requirements on banks \nversus nonbank servicers; and\n  Five, the impact to consumers and the ability of regulated banks to \nservice mortgages that they originate.\n  The mortgage servicing industry has shifted since the financial \ncrisis of 2008, as Congresswoman Waters mentioned. We have seen a \nsignificant sale of MSRs and MSAs from banks to nonbanks, including to \nspecialty servicers, private equity firms, and hedge funds.\n  In 2013, about $1.03 trillion of mortgage servicing rights were sold, \nwith a vast majority going to nonbank servicing companies. Moreover, \nthe percentage of loans serviced by nonbanks has steadily increased \nfrom 12 percent to almost 31 percent.\n  Now, why is the market shifting?\n  While there are several factors for the growth in nonbank servicing \nactivity, I believe the primary driver has been the capital treatment \nof MSAs under the Basel III Accords.\n  Basel III was always intended to apply to the largest, most \ninterconnected globally active banks, but the MSA capital treatment is \nactually having the greatest impact on our smaller community banks.\n  Basel III caps the value of MSAs that depository institutions can \ncount towards their tier 1 capital at 10 percent. Any MSAs that exceed \nthe 10 percent threshold are subject to 100 percent risk weight, a \nstandard that will increase to 250 percent by 2018.\n  Why is this a concern?\n  In addition to the capital treatment, there is a discrepancy between \nhow banks and nonbank servicers are regulated. So there is additional \nregulation that comes down on the community banks while that same kind \nof regulation isn't seen by the nonbank servicers. And if there were to \nbe another sudden market disruption or downturn, it is important we \nunderstand if nonbank mortgage servicers have the capacity or the \nexpertise to manage defaults or modifications.\n  The Financial Stability Oversight Council, the FSOC, in its 2014 \nannual report specifically named the transfer of mortgage servicing \nrights to nonbanks as a ``potential emerging threat.''\n  The report says: ``MSRs are increasingly being transferred to nonbank \nmortgage servicing companies. While the CFPB and State regulators have \nsome authority over these companies, many of them are not currently \nsubject to prudential standards such as capital, liquidity, or risk \nmanagement.''\n  Adam Levitin, the Democratic witness at our hearing, spoke favorably \nand in support of the bill, saying:\n  ``MSRs have traditionally been an important asset class for \ndepositories, as their value provides a countercyclical offset to \nmortgage origination activity, and MSR accounting is subject-enough to \ngive depositories room to smooth their earnings.\n  ``Basel III changes make MSRs an unattractive asset for banks.''\n  Representative Luetkemeyer and I have questioned whether the \nprudential regulators struck the right balance between limiting risk \nexposure and ensuring that depository institutions can still compete \nwith the nonbank entrants in the mortgage servicing arena. From the \nconversations we have had with the regulators, it is clear they did not \nstudy the specific capital treatment applied to MSAs and the impacts on \nconsumers and the market.\n\n  Banks want to continue servicing mortgages they originate and \nmaintain these connections to their communities, as Mr. Hill mentioned. \nHowever, if the current capital requirements remain in effect, it would \nmake it more and more difficult.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will place in the Record two letters that we have \nreceived--one dated July 13 from the American Bankers Association, the \nother dated July 14 from the National Association of Federal Credit \nUnions--in support of H.R. 1408. I am glad that we were able to seek \nand reach a compromise on this bill. I urge the quick passage of H.R. \n1408.\n\n                                 American Bankers Association,\n\n                                                    July 13, 2015.\n     Re: ABA Support for H.R. 1334, H.R. 1408 and H.R. 1529\n       Members of the House of Representatives: On behalf of the \n     members of the American Bankers Association (ABA), I am \n     writing to express our strong support for three banking \n     related measures that are scheduled for consideration on the \n     House suspension calendar on Tuesday, July 14.\n       H.R. 1334, the Holding Company Registration Threshold \n     Equalization Act, introduced by Representatives Steve Womack \n     (R-AR), Jim Himes (D-CT), Ann Wagner (R-MO) and John Delaney \n     (D-MD), would extend to savings and loan holding companies \n     (SLHCs) the Securities and Exchange Commission shareholder \n     registration and deregistration thresholds enacted under the \n     JOBS Act.\n       The JOBS Act did not expressly extend the new shareholder \n     thresholds to savings and loan holding companies (SLHCs) as \n     defined by the Home Owners Loan Act. However, Congress did \n     not intend to treat SLHCs differently from bank and bank \n     holding companies. H.R. 1334 would correct this oversight and \n     extend the shareholder registration and deregistration \n     requirements to SLHCs.\n       This bill passed the House Financial Services Committee on \n     May 20, 2015 by a vote of 60-0 and passed the full House last \n     Congress by an overwhelming vote of 417-4. We urge the \n     members to once again pass this legislation.\n       In addition, the House will consider H.R. 1408, the \n     Community Bank Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital Requirements \n     Act of 2015 introduced by Representatives Ed Perlmutter (D-\n     CO) and Blaine Luetkemeyer (R-MO). This ABA supported \n     legislation would defer implementation of the Basel III rules \n     on mortgage servicing assets (``MSAs'') until the impact of \n     the new rules can be studied and alternatives explored.\n       Many banks that make mortgage loans also engage in \n     servicing, which primarily consists of collecting mortgage \n     payments and forwarding them to the ``owner'' of the loan; \n     collecting insurance and tax payments; and addressing \n     problems such as late payments, delinquencies, and defaults. \n     Banks commonly sell mortgage loans into the secondary market \n     but retain the right to service the loan (called ``servicing \n     retained''). This strategy is an important way for banks to \n     maintain valuable connections with their\n\n[[Page H5140]]\n\n     customers, while managing interest rate risk by selling long-\n     term credit assets.\n       Banks are retaining less mortgage servicing due to Basel \n     III's unfavorable capital treatment of MSAs. As a result, \n     Basel III is unintentionally increasing the concentration of \n     servicing held by less regulated, non-bank firms such as \n     mortgage companies, REITs, hedge funds, and private equity \n     firms that are not subject to the new capital restrictions. \n     The long-term relationships that banks and their customers \n     have established should not be penalized by Basel III's \n     punitive capital treatment of MSAs.\n       Banks should be encouraged to service the loans that they \n     make to their customers. This legislation stops the negative \n     effects until the impact can be fully examined. The bill does \n     not apply to the large international banks that Basel III was \n     meant to address.\n       H.R. 1408 passed the House Financial Services Committee on \n     March 26 by a strong bipartisan vote of 49-9. ABA urges \n     strong support for this legislation.\n       The House will also consider H.R. 1529, the Community \n     Institution Mortgage Relief Act of 2015, introduced by \n     Representatives Brad Sherman (D-CA) and Blaine Luetkemeyer \n     (R-MO). This bipartisan legislation, which passed the House \n     Financial Services Committee by a vote of 48-10, would exempt \n     from the escrow requirements imposed under the Dodd/Frank Act \n     loans held by small creditors with less than $10 billion in \n     assets. ABA supports the legislation's expansion of the \n     Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's (CFPB) ``small \n     servicer'' exemption to include servicers that annually \n     service 20,000 or fewer mortgage loans. These important \n     exemptions recognize the strong history of small institutions \n     in providing high-quality mortgage servicing, even with \n     limited staff and resources of smaller institutions.\n       Given their track record, small servicers should be \n     incentivized to continue to service mortgage loans. \n     Unfortunately, existing regulations are having the opposite \n     effect. The existing escrow rules have the potential to drive \n     small creditors from the mortgage market because it is \n     difficult, if not impossible, for them to provide escrow \n     services in a cost effective manner. Further, imposing escrow \n     requirements often runs counter to customer preference as \n     many mortgage customers prefer to pay tax and insurance bills \n     on their own and not establish escrow accounts. Without the \n     exemptions provided in this legislation, customers of smaller \n     institutions will face higher costs to offset the cost of \n     compliance for a service which they do not in some cases even \n     want. Worse, some customers will face fewer credit choices as \n     small local lenders choose to exit the mortgage market rather \n     than incur the added staffing and technical expenses of \n     adding escrow services. This is an important piece of \n     legislation and ABA urges the House to pass H.R. 1529.\n                                                 James Ballentine,\n            Executive Vice President, Congressional Relations and \n     Political Affairs.\n                                  ____\n\n                                           National Association of\n\n\n                                        Federal Credit Unions,\n\n                                     Arlington, VA, July 14, 2015.\n     Re: Support for the Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital \n         Requirements Act of 2015 (H.R. 1408)\n\n     Hon. John Boehner,\n     Speaker, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Nancy Pelosi,\n     Minority Leader, House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Speaker Boehner and Leader Pelosi: On behalf of the \n     National Association of Federal Credit Unions (NAFCU), the \n     only trade association exclusively representing the federal \n     interests of our nation's federally insured credit unions, I \n     write today to urge your support of the Mortgage Servicing \n     Asset Capital Requirements Act of 2015 (H.R. 1408), as \n     amended, when it comes to the House floor. This bipartisan \n     measure introduced by Representatives Perlmutter and \n     Luetkemeyer would, among other things, ensure that the \n     National Credit Union Administration (NCUA) study its second \n     risk-based capital proposal's impact on credit union mortgage \n     servicing assets.\n       As you know, NAFCU has concerns about many aspects of the \n     NCUA's risk-based capital proposal including the portion \n     relative to mortgage servicing assets which has a risk weight \n     of 250 percent. NAFCU believes this is artificially high and \n     a risk weight of 150 percent is more appropriate. This \n     portion of the proposal is indicative of much larger issues \n     with NCUA's proposal and NAFCU continues to believe it is a \n     solution in search of a problem. In short, this entire \n     proposal should be withdrawn until adequate cost-benefit \n     analysis is done to determine the impact it will have on \n     credit union lending and job creation. While NAFCU does not \n     oppose a risk-based capital regime for credit unions, it must \n     be done properly through statue with ample Congressional \n     input.\n       Not only does NAFCU urge passage of H.R. 1408 to look at \n     the mortgage servicing assets portion of the NCUA's risk-\n     based capital proposal, but we also encourage the House to \n     support and schedule action on the Risk-Based Capital Study \n     Act of 2015 (H.R. 2769). This bipartisan legislation, \n     introduced by Representatives Fincher, Posey and Denny Heck, \n     would require NCUA to study the full impact of the entire \n     risk-based capital proposal on credit unions and report back \n     to Congress before taking any final action on the proposal.\n       Again, thank you for scheduling the consideration of the \n     Mortgage Servicing Asset Capital Requirements Act (H.R. 1408) \n     on the floor this week. We urge strong support for this \n     legislation and hope the appropriate capital requirements for \n     credit unions continue to be a focus in the House during this \n     Congress.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Brad Thaler,\n                            Vice President of Legislative Affairs.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to reiterate my support and \nthanks for the hard work of the gentleman from Colorado. He has been a \nleader on this issue, and certainly it has been a pleasure to work with \nhim.\n  I urge passage of H.R. 1408, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1408, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to require \ncertain Federal banking agencies to conduct a study of the appropriate \ncapital requirements for mortgage servicing assets for banking \ninstitutions, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5140-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5140-H5142]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SBIC ADVISERS RELIEF ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H5141]]\n\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 432, the SBIC Advisers Relief Act. \nThis legislation allows for commonsense changes that will ultimately \nallow for greater small business capital formation and job creation.\n  The SBIC Advisers Relief Act streamlines the registration and \nreporting requirements for advisers to small business investment \ncompanies, or SBICs. These are advisers to investment funds that make \nlong-term investments in United States small businesses and have to the \ntune of more than $63 billion since 1958.\n  SBICs are heavily regulated and closely supervised by the U.S. Small \nBusiness Administration, and they have been for more than 55 years. The \nexisting regulatory regime surrounding SBICs includes an in-depth \nexamination of management, strong investment rules, numerous operation \nrequirements, recordkeeping, examination and reporting mandates, and \nconflict of interest rules. These entities and the management of these \nentities are anything but unregulated.\n  This robust regulatory framework has been well-recognized by \nCongress. The intent of Congress in including certain exemptions in \nDodd-Frank was to reduce the regulatory burden on smaller funds and \nSBICs. However, the law has resulted in some unintended consequences \nthat need to be addressed.\n  The SBIC Advisers Relief Act does three things:\n  One, it allows advisers that jointly advise SBICs and venture funds \nto be exempt from registration, combining two separate exemptions that \nexist: one for advisers of SBICs and a separate one for advisers of \nventure funds;\n  Two, it excludes SBIC assets from the SEC's assets under management \nthreshold calculation; and\n  Three, it exempts from State regulation advisers of SBIC funds with \nless than $90 million in assets under management, leaving those \nentities to be regulated by the SBA, as they are today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we can all agree that these changes are common \nsense. This legislation is not only broadly bipartisan, but it also \nincludes changes suggested by the SEC.\n  Most importantly, the bill is comprised of sensible provisions that \nprevent redundant regulatory mandates and allow for greater investment \nin America's small businesses.\n  The Financial Services Committee has thoroughly examined this \nbipartisan legislation in both a legislative hearing and a markup. H.R. \n432 passed the committee by a vote of 53-0 in May. Identical \nlegislation passed the House last year by a voice vote.\n  I want to thank the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney) for her help on the bill.\n  I urge support of H.R. 432, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am once again pleased to support this bill related to \nsmall business capital formation. This legislation has broad bipartisan \nsupport and clarifies the intent of Congress when we passed Dodd-Frank.\n  H.R. 432, which Representatives Luetkemeyer and Maloney worked on in \na bipartisan fashion, exempts advisers to small business investment \ncompanies, or SBICs, from registration with the SEC in cases where they \nare inappropriately being required to do so.\n  Under the Dodd-Frank Act, Congress explicitly exempted advisers to \nSBIC funds and advisers to venture capital funds from registration. \nHowever, the SEC has interpreted the language in the act as still \nrequiring registration if a fund's adviser advises both.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  This, to me, is not consistent with the act, and I applaud the \nauthors of this bill for solving this problem.\n  This bill would also exclude SBIC fund assets from the calculation of \nfund assets triggering the $150 million registration threshold, another \nprovision I believe is reasonable.\n  The SBIC program was created in 1958 to help small businesses grow. \nIt is a self-funded program and has provided needed capital to \ncommunities via the partnership between the Small Business \nAdministration and private businesses.\n  I am also comfortable with the exemptions provided in this \nlegislation because the SBA actively oversees SBICs, ensures \ncompliance, and restricts leverage. I am pleased that we are able to \nwork together in this committee to ensure the continued vitality of \nthis longstanding program.\n  Last Congress, I met with an SBIC located just outside of my \ndistrict, Escalate Capital Partners, which finances technology firms. \nSince 2010, the firm has financed 27 companies and increased its \npayroll by 2,000 jobs.\n  However, this firm is being inadvertently caught up in unnecessary \nSEC registration because, with SBIC assets under management being \ncounted, it exceeds the $150 million exemption threshold we established \nin Dodd-Frank.\n  Without undermining the key systemic risk and investment protection \nrequirements we established under Dodd-Frank, H.R. 432 provides \nEscalate Capital Partners and similarly situated SBICs with targeted \nrelief.\n  So I applaud the bipartisan coauthors and urge Members to support \nthis bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), a member of the Financial \nServices Committee and distinguished chairman of the Capital Markets \nand Government Sponsored Enterprises Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 432, the SBIC \nAdvisers Relief Act.\n  First I want to say thank you to the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. \nLuetkemeyer) for his hard work and leadership on this issue, among \nothers, and on the legislation, which passed out of the Financial \nServices Committee unanimously this past May.\n  And what would it do? It would fix yet another unintended consequence \nof the Dodd-Frank Act, an interpretation of the bill that would require \nunnecessary and costly registration of investment advisers who all play \na very critical role in our economy today.\n  You see, the Dodd-Frank Act amended the private fund exemption under \nthe Advisers Act to include an explicit exemption for advisers to both \nventure capital funds as well as advisers to Small Business Investment \nCompanies, SBICs.\n  Whatever the merits of changing the private fund exemption in this \nway, Congress very clearly intended to exempt advisers to such funds \nfrom the burdens and the added costs associated with yet another SEC \nregistration.\n  Unfortunately, due to the way the legislation text has been \ninterpreted, someone who happens to advise both a venture capital fund \nand, also, an SBIC is being required now to also register with the SEC. \nThis makes absolutely no sense and is clearly contradictory to the \nstatutory language.\n  There is no valid argument or reason to require an adviser to \nregister simply because they happen to advise both a venture capital \nfund and an SBIC. You see, such a requirement would not in any way \nenhance investor protection or promote capital formation.\n  It is also important to note that SBICs are already overseen and \nexamined by the Small Business Administration; so registration with the \nSEC would not only be unnecessary, but duplicative as well.\n  So why is all of this important? Why do we have the legislation here \ntoday? Well, according to the Small Business Investor Alliance, initial \nregistration costs with the SEC are estimated to be in excess of \n$100,000 a year and annual costs can run up to $250,000 a year. That is \nmoney. That is money that could otherwise be used for salaries and \nhiring more people and in helping the economy.\n  In conclusion, it is important to keep in mind that the small \nbusinesses that we are talking about often don't have an array of \nlawyers or compliance specialists to deal with registration and \noversight from the SEC. Oftentimes these are businesses that only have \na handful of employees.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer) and all \nmy colleagues on the other side of the aisle on the Financial Services \nCommittee who support this. I urge passage of the underlying bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as \nshe may consume to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. \nMaloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. I thank the ranking member for\n\n[[Page H5142]]\n\nyielding and for her leadership on this committee and in so many other \nareas.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 432, the SBIC Advisers \nRelief Act. And I am pleased to be an original sponsor of this bill \nalong with my colleague, the gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), \na tremendous leader on the Financial Services Committee not only on \nthis bill, but in so many other areas.\n  The SBIC Advisers Relief Act fixes a truly unintended consequence of \nDodd-Frank. Under Dodd-Frank, an investment adviser that only advises a \nventure capital fund is exempt from SEC registration.\n  Likewise, an investment adviser that only advises Small Business \nInvestment Companies, or SBICs, is also exempt. But an investment \nadviser that advises both a venture capital fund and an SBIC is not \nexempt for some reason.\n  This makes no sense, and it provides no additional protections for \ninvestors. Moreover, it discourages investment advisers who may have \nexperience advising successful venture capital funds that have invested \nin larger, more mature enterprises from bringing their expertise to \nSBICs who want to invest in similar startups. This ultimately restricts \nsmall businesses' access to much-needed investment capital.\n  Our bill fixes this problem by clarifying that investment advisers \nthat advise both venture funds and SBICs are also exempt from SEC \nregistration.\n  This fix does not pose any investor protection concerns because SBICs \nare already subject to strict oversight by the Small Business \nAdministration, which supports SBICs by providing a guarantee on funds \nused by SBICs to invest in other small businesses.\n  The SBIC program has a long history of success and has provided \nearly-stage financing for companies that have since grown to become \nworldwide icons, such as Apple, Intel, and Staples.\n  This bill is identical to a bill that passed the House by voice vote \nlast Congress, and it passed unanimously in the Financial Services \nCommittee earlier this year. I, therefore, urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 432.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill), who is a member of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank Chairman Luetkemeyer.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 432, the SBIC Advisers \nRelief Act. This commonsense bill eliminates costly, confusing, and \nduplicative regulations by State and Federal governments on Small \nBusiness Investment Companies, SBICs, like Diamond State Ventures and \nMcLarty Capital Partners in Little Rock, Arkansas, by correcting the \nunintended consequence of drafting in the Dodd-Frank Act.\n  Diamond State, which was named SBIC of the year in 2011 by the Small \nBusiness Administration, has made over 18 investments in small \nbusinesses in my State, employing over 2,300 Arkansans and investing \nover $40 million in Arkansas businesses.\n  SBICs are already heavily regulated by the SBA and provide \nsignificant, long-term investments in small businesses across the USA.\n  While Dodd-Frank exempted advisers that solely advise SBIC funds from \nregistering with the SEC, it was silent on the concept of State \nregulation of Federally licensed SBIC funds, creating confusion and \nrequiring this action today. It is going to save money, legal fees, \naccounting fees, and make our SBICs much more cost-effective.\n  With that, I thank Chairman Luetkemeyer and our colleagues for their \nwork on this issue and urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. Mr. Speaker, I just want to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney) for her hard work in helping \ncosponsor this bill, Ranking Member Waters, as well as the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Hill) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nGarrett) for their support and kind words.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1334, the Holding Company \nRegistration Threshold Equalization Act.\n  I would like to thank Representatives Womack, Himes, Wagner, and \nDelaney for their bipartisan work to achieve a unanimous vote in the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  H.R. 1334 provides a technical correction to the JOBS Act in the \ntruest sense of the term. The JOBS Act updated the shareholder \nthreshold for bank holding companies to register and deregister under \nthe Securities Exchange Act to 2,000 shareholders and 1,200 \nshareholders respectively.\n  However, due to a technical oversight, the statute did not \nspecifically extend the same treatment to savings and loan holding \ncompanies, despite their being similarly organized to bank holding \ncompanies.\n  Since the enactment of the JOBS Act, dozens of bank holding companies \nhave taken advantage of these provisions while savings and loan holding \ncompanies have been forced to wait for action from Congress to correct \nthe error.\n  By putting savings and loan holding companies on par with banks, H.R. \n1334 provides these institutions the same flexibility as banks to \nreduce their SEC-related compliance costs and better deploy capital \nthroughout their communities. H.R. 1334 is identical to legislation \nthat received 417 votes in the House last Congress.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in supporting this commonsense, \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my understanding that this bill addresses an \noversight in the JOBS Act that established new,\n\n[[Page H5143]]\n\nhigher thresholds for registration, termination of registration, and \nsuspension of public reporting for banks and bank holding companies, \nbut not for savings and loan companies.\n  In the JOBS Act, we recognized that banks and bank holding companies \nwere inadvertently becoming public companies by virtue of their \nsecurities being distributed to a larger number of shareholders than \npermitted under the securities laws, even though these institutions \nwere largely held within their own communities.\n  Accordingly, we provided banks and bank holding companies with \nregulatory relief by raising the thresholds that trigger public company \nreporting.\n  H.R. 1334 would extend this relief to savings and loan companies \nwhich, like banks and bank holding companies, are still subject to \nmandatory public reporting requirements by the banking regulators; so \ninformation will continue to be available to shareholders and the \npublic.\n  Last Congress, we passed this noncontroversial bill out of committee \nand on the House floor. Since that time, the Securities and Exchange \nCommission has, under its own authority, proposed to extend the JOBS \nAct provision to savings and loan companies.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  The SEC estimates that approximately 90 of the 125 savings and loan \nholding companies that have a class of registered securities would be \neligible to terminate registration or suspend reporting under its \nproposal.\n  I am pleased to support this bill, which will extend the benefits we \nprovide in the JOBS Act to those 90 companies that represent an \nadditional class of community banks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Womack).\n  Mr. WOMACK. Mr. Speaker, I thank the manager of this legislation for \nthe time. I would like to also thank Chairman Hensarling and the entire \nFinancial Services Committee for, yet again, ensuring that this bill, \nthe Holding Company Registration Threshold Equalization Act, is put in \nfront of the full House and sent on to the Senate.\n  I would also like to express my gratitude to my colleagues on both \nsides of the aisle, Representative Himes, Representative Wagner, and \nRepresentative Delaney, for their continued efforts to codify this \nnecessary JOBS Act clarification.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the third time that I have come to the floor to \nspeak on this truly bipartisan bill, and it is unfortunate that we are \nstill without a successful resolution to the problem because we can all \nagree that small community banks and savings and loan holding companies \nwere not the cause of the financial crisis. They shouldn't be treated \nas if they were.\n  That is exactly why the House and Senate eliminated some of the \nunnecessary burdens placed on our small lenders by passing the JOBS Act \nin the 112th Congress. However, the JOBS Act, which raised the \nregistration threshold and decreased deregistration threshold for bank \nholding companies, unfortunately didn't explicitly do so for savings \nand loan holding companies as well. Mr. Speaker, this was an oversight.\n  Thanks to the oversight, savings and loan holding companies are still \nhaving to spend their resources to comply with regulations intended for \nlarger banks, instead of sharing the same ability bank and bank holding \ncompanies have been granted to focus on serving the lending needs of \ntheir communities.\n  A cosponsor of the JOBS Act, I can say with absolute certainty that \nexcluding savings and loan holding companies was not our intent. H.R. \n1334 would correct this oversight and would simply ensure that savings \nand loan holding companies are treated in the same manner as bank and \nbank holding companies, something my colleagues confidently affirmed \nwhen this bill passed in the 113th Congress 417-4.\n  Mr. Speaker, they say the third time is the charm. I am hopeful that, \nwith the Senate's newfound leadership, we will finally get this bill \nwhere it needs to be, on the President's desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to help me get it there by supporting the \npassage of H.R. 1334.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to \nstand here with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle today to \nsupport so many pieces of legislation that have come out of the \nFinancial Services Committee.\n  I have always said with Dodd-Frank, where there were technical \nproblems or oversights or unintended consequences, that I would work \nwith my colleagues on the opposite side of the aisle, and much of what \nyou see here today, that is what we have done.\n  Just as there may have been some unintended consequences in Dodd-\nFrank, we find that with the JOBS Act, there were unintended \nconsequences; and certainly, I stand with them in correcting those. It \ncould happen in any legislation; we know that. This is an example of \nthat. I am very, very pleased to support this legislation today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time at this moment.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Garrett), the chairman of \nthe Capital Markets Subcommittee.\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for his work on this. \nI also thank Mr. Womack and Mr. Himes of Connecticut for all of their \nwork on H.R. 1334.\n  I am thankful for the great bipartisan message that we just heard \nfrom the ranking member as well on the JOBS Act, and I will look \nforward to working with her even more for those technical corrections \non the Dodd-Frank piece of legislation. I am looking forward to doing \nthat going forward.\n  As she says, there is little doubt that the JOBS Act did have a \npositive impact upon our economy, as evidenced by the boost in initial \npublic offerings since 2012 and the number of companies, both public \nand private, that are taking advantage of some of the law's provisions \nright now.\n  Title VI of the JOBS Act included an important provision that the \ngentlewoman talked about, that increased the outdated shareholder \nthresholds that determined just when banks and bank holding companies \nhave to register with the SEC.\n  These thresholds, by the way, they have been around for a long time. \nThey haven't been changed for over four decades. What they were doing \nis they were basically forcing the smaller companies, the small banks, \nto register as full reporting companies with the SEC, and that is \nreally a very costly burden on them. It is very often the case that it \nis inappropriate for small lenders who are already regulated and \nexamined by a series of bank regulators.\n  As the gentlewoman points out, we had a slight oversight in the \ndrafting of the JOBS Act. The SEC, at first, they did not include \nsavings and loans companies under the updated threshold; and this made \nno sense, particularly when considering that S perform largely the \nsame functions as banks and are overseen by the same regulators.\n  With few exceptions, S tend to be generally small institutions \nthat serve the local communities. This registration with the SEC would \nhave had the ultimate effect of raising the cost of lending to families \nand small businesses.\n  This would be the exact opposite of what the JOBS Act intended. The \nunderlying legislation would make a technical correction to the JOBS \nAct. It would ensure that the S are able to take advantage of the \nnew provisions of the law.\n  One final point, while the SEC, last December, proposed to include \nS under the new thresholds, a regulation that can be taken away at \nany moment is no substitute for what we have here, statutory text. \nCongress has a clear role here to step in and fix the issue.\n  Again, I thank Mr. Womack and Mr. Himes for their work in fixing that \nissue; and I urge passage of the underlying legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Capital Markets for his leadership on this. I want \nto thank the ranking member for her spirit of\n\n[[Page H5144]]\n\nbipartisan cooperation in fixing this part of the JOBS Act.\n  In conclusion, it is my hope that this House will pass this good, \ncommonsense measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1334, the Holding Company Registration Threshold Equalization Act of \n2015.\n  In 2012, Congress raised the threshold number of shareholders a bank \ncan have before they must register with Securities and Exchange \nCommission from 500 to 2,000.\n  At the same time, Congress raised the threshold for bank shareholders \nfrom 300 to 1,200 before a bank could deregister for the Securities and \nExchange Commission and convert to a private bank.\n  However, due to a drafting oversight, these raised thresholds \ncurrently do not apply to savings and loan institutions.\n  These institutions are vital for the continued development and growth \nof our economy.\n  For a large segment of American homeowners, savings and loan \ninstitutions are the primary source of financial assistance for \npurchasing a home.\n  Some would say that the structure in which these companies are built \nis the same structure that our country was built. They are generally \nlocally owned and privately managed; and communities use these \nbusinesses as a savings institution and use these funds to help other \nindividuals in the community construct, purchase, repair, or refinance \ntheir home.\n  With a locally owned, community driven foundation, it is wrong to \nsubject these businesses to the same level of oversight and regulation \nas a large bank without affording them the same registration and \nderegistration thresholds.\n  I support this bill because I believe Congress must use every effort \nto build up the American people on a local level. We are not going to \ngrow our economy from Washington, D.C., but we can create an \nenvironment on a state and local level that empowers Americans to grow \nthemselves.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from Arkansas, Mr. Womack, for his \nhard work on this issue and I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1334.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5144-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5144-H5145]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             SMALL COMPANY SIMPLE REGISTRATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and \npass the bill (H.R. 1723) to direct the Securities and Exchange \nCommission to revise Form S-1 so as to permit smaller reporting \ncompanies to use forward incorporation by reference for such form.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1723\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1723, the Small Company Simple \nRegistration Act. I would like to thank Representative Wagner and \nRepresentative Sewell for their efforts to successfully move this \nlegislation through the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous, \nbipartisan vote.\n  H.R. 1723 simplifies the registration process by amending the SEC's \nform S-1 registration statement, the basic registration form for new \nsecurities offerings, to allow smaller reporting companies to \nincorporate by reference any documents filed with the SEC after the \neffective date of the form S-1.\n  This forward incorporation by reference eliminates the need for \nfiling excessive paperwork with each subsequent filing, thereby \nlowering compliance costs associated with filing redundant paperwork. \nStreamlining this requirement allows eligible companies to direct more \nresources to growing their business.\n  H.R. 1723 is consistent with the recommendations of the SEC's \nGovernment-Business Forum on Small Business Capital Formation final \nreport and has been endorsed by several witnesses before the Capital \nMarkets Subcommittee.\n  For example, Tom Quaadman of the United States Chamber of Commerce \ntestified that, by enacting H.R. 1723, smaller companies can use \nforward incorporation as a way to streamline disclosures and get the \ninformation to investors without repetitive disclosures. He went on to \nsay that the explosion of disclosures for smaller companies isn't \nproviding material information to investors.\n  Additionally, Professor John Coffee with Columbia University Law \nSchool previously testified that, for some time, the SEC's Government-\nBusiness Forum on Small Business Capital Formation has called for \nchanges to permit smaller reporting companies that have filed a form S-\n1 to incorporate, by reference, documents filed with the SEC. I believe \nthis one does have real efficiency justifications and could help \nsmaller issuers.\n  H.R. 1723 is a commonsense update to our securities laws that will \nmore appropriately tailor their requirement for smaller companies. I \nask my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1723.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1723, the Small Company Simple Registration Act of \n2015 is a commonsense provision to help smaller companies avoid having \nto obtain an audit related to a filing that is itself already audited. \nThe bill would no longer require a company to amend its registration \nstatement when it issues a quarterly or annual filing.\n  Although one witness noted the concern that all information would no \nlonger be reflected in a single document, she recommended that the \nSEC's public filing system be improved and that the issuer be required \nto post the registration statement on its Web site, complete with \nhyperlinks to the documents that are incorporated by reference. This \nseems like a reasonable approach. I believe that the SEC can do both \nand likely would if H.R. 1723 is passed.\n  This one change has the potential to help companies save $10,000, and \nwith all SEC filings able to be quickly found online, it does not \ndiminish investor protections in any way.\n  Last Congress, this provision was unfortunately attached to a larger \nbill that did not make a lot of sense. I am glad to see it has now been \noffered on its own, as I think it now has a much better likelihood of \nmoving to the President's desk. I certainly support the adoption of \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as she may \nconsume to the gentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Wagner), who is the \nauthor of this bill.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Mr. Hurt, for \nyielding.\n  I am glad that the House is taking up H.R. 1723, the Small Company \nSimple Registration Act, which will take a much-needed step in helping \nremove financial barriers and make it more efficient for small \nbusinesses to go public.\n  This bipartisan legislation, which I have sponsored with Ms. Terri \nSewell from Alabama and which was approved by the House Financial \nServices Committee on a completely unanimous\n\n[[Page H5145]]\n\nvote of 60-0, would make a simple change in the basic registration form \nfor new securities offerings, the form S-1.\n  Specifically, it would allow smaller reporting companies to \nincorporate by reference any documents filed with the SEC after the \neffective date, which means that those companies will not have to go \nthrough the trouble of refiling the form S-1 again and again.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  This will have a profound impact on these small companies by cutting \ncompliance costs, as they will not have to file redundant paperwork and \nwait on the SEC to approve their filing in order to raise capital and \ngrow their small business.\n  Small companies are increasingly leading the way in terms of \ntechnological innovation and job creation but consistently struggle \nwith finding adequate access to capital in order to grow their \nbusiness. It is a fact that small businesses are the main driver of \neconomic growth in our country, as they create more jobs than any other \nbusiness sector in America.\n  In fact, the Kauffman Foundation, which is a nonprofit economic \nresource organization based in Kansas City, Missouri, estimated in 2010 \nthat startups create an average of 3 million jobs annually and stated: \n``Without startups, there would be no net job growth in the U.S. \neconomy.'' It is clear that we must empower small businesses with every \navenue to grow and, therefore, create jobs.\n  For many small businesses looking to take the next step in expanding, \ngoing public is an attractive option that grants them access to the \ncapital markets and allows them to issue stock to a wider range of \ninvestors. However, the ``price of admission'' for this avenue to \nraising capital is continually increasing through the amount of \ncompliance and red tape required. For many, it simply is not worth it.\n  Indeed, our securities laws are structured today in a way that favors \nlarge companies over small startups, which are struggling to gain \nmarket share, by increasingly requiring more legal compliance and \nproviding exemptions for companies over certain revenue thresholds.\n  The JOBS Act from 2012 made many improvements to this system and \nprovided small companies additional access to the equity markets. My \nbill, the Small Company Simple Registration Act, expands upon the \nprogress of the JOBS Act by making securities registration forms more \nefficient for the main driver of our economy, small business.\n  During a hearing before the House Financial Services Committee \nearlier this year, a representative of BIO, Mr. Kovacs from PTC \nTherapeutics, testified about their experiences with doing a follow-on \noffering inside of a year of their IPO using form S-1. Ultimately, they \nhad to go and update the entire S-1, which is a process that took weeks \nof work and required help from outside legal counsel.\n  If the ``forward incorporation by reference'' provision from H.R. \n1723 had been in place, they could simply include a reference to any \nadditional documentation filed alongside their original S-1 form, which \nwould have taken much less time and required significantly less legal \nhelp.\n  Additionally, investors would still be protected by having access to \nall needed information from the S-1 form, as well as any additional \ndocumentation.\n  I would like to close by urging support for this commonsense and \nstrong bipartisan piece of legislation that would streamline the \npaperwork that small businesses are required to file. This is something \nthat the SEC's own working group on small business capital formation \nhas recommended for several years now, but which the SEC itself has \nfailed to act upon.\n  Furthermore, this piece of legislation passed the committee earlier \nthis year on a unanimous vote 60-0.\n  I urge passage of this legislation.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I am pleased to also support this legislation. This bipartisan \nlegislation is another example of how we can work together on the \nFinancial Services Committee on behalf of small businesses in this \ncountry.\n  Both Democrats and Republicans have said over and over again that we \nmust do everything that we can to support our small businesses. That is \nfrom capital formation to making sure that we get rid of bureaucratic \nrules and regulations.\n  Again, this is another great example of that, and I am pleased to be \na part of that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I would, again, like to thank the ranking member for working together \non this piece of bipartisan legislation.\n  I also want to thank the chairman, Chairman Hensarling, as well as \nRepresentative Wagner and Representative Sewell, for their laser focus \non streamlining SEC regulations that are unnecessary and costly while \nstill maintaining a rock-solid commitment to investor protection. It is \nmy hope the House will adopt this measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

REPEAL OF INDEMNIFICATION REQUIREMENTS.\n\n       (a) Derivatives Clearing Organizations.--Section 5b(k)(5) \n     of the Commodity Exchange Act (7 U.S.C. 7a-1(k)(5)) is \n     amended to read as follows:\n       ``(5) Confidentiality agreement.--Before the Commission may \n     share information with any entity described in paragraph (4), \n     the Commission shall receive a written agreement from each \n     entity stating that the entity shall abide by the \n     confidentiality requirements described in section 8 relating \n     to the information on swap transactions that is provided.''.\n       (b) Swap Data Repositories.--Section 21 of such Act (7 \n     U.S.C. 24a) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)(7)--\n       (A) in the matter preceding subparagraph (A), by striking \n     ``all'' and inserting ``swap''; and\n       (B) in subparagraph (E)--\n       (i) in clause (ii), by striking ``and'' at the end; and\n       (ii) by adding at the end the following:\n       ``(iv) other foreign authorities; and''; and\n       (2) by striking subsection (d) and inserting the following:\n       ``(d) Confidentiality Agreement.--Before the swap data \n     repository may share information with any entity described in \n     subsection (c)(7), the swap data repository shall receive a \n     written agreement from each entity stating that the entity \n     shall abide by the confidentiality requirements described in \n     section 8 relating to the information on swap transactions \n     that is provided.''.\n       (c) Security-based Swap Data Repositories.--Section \n     13(n)(5) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 25 (15 U.S.C. \n     78m(n)(5)) is amended--\n       (1) in subparagraph (G)--\n       (A) in the matter preceding clause (i), by striking ``all'' \n     and inserting ``security-based swap''; and\n       (B) in subclause (v)--\n       (i) in subclause (II), by striking ``; and'' and inserting \n     a semicolon;\n       (ii) in subclause (III), by striking the period at the end \n     and inserting ``; and''; and\n       (iii) by adding at the end the following:\n\n       ``(IV) other foreign authorities.''; and\n\n       (2) by striking subparagraph (H) and inserting the \n     following:\n\n[[Page H5146]]\n\n       ``(H) Confidentiality agreement.--Before the security-based \n     swap data repository may share information with any entity \n     described in subparagraph (G), the security-based swap data \n     repository shall receive a written agreement from each entity \n     stating that the entity shall abide by the confidentiality \n     requirements described in section 24 relating to the \n     information on security-based swap transactions that is \n     provided.''.\n       (d) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this Act shall \n     take effect as if enacted as part of the Dodd-Frank Wall \n     Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act (Public Law 111-\n     203) on July 21, 2010.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Hurt) and the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine \nWaters) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to yield \nall remaining time to the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) and \nask unanimous consent that he be allowed to control the time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 1847, the Swap Data Repository and \nClearinghouse Indemnification Correction Act of 2015.\n  I want to thank Mr. Hurt and Chairman Hensarling for allowing the \nAgriculture Committee to manage time with them today. The members of \nour committee have always appreciated the close working relationship \nthat we have with the Financial Services Committee on these financial \nand regulatory issues.\n  H.R. 1847 is a targeted correction to remove barriers to information \nsharing. Dodd-Frank currently requires indemnification agreements from \nforeign regulators requesting information from U.S. swap data \nrepositories or derivatives clearing organizations.\n  The agreements state that the foreign regulators will abide by \ncertain confidentiality requirements and indemnify the U.S. commissions \nfor any expenses arising from litigation relating to the request for \ninformation.\n  Unfortunately, the concept of indemnification does not exist in many \nforeign jurisdictions. Therefore, some foreign regulators cannot agree \nto these requirements. This may hinder our ability to make workable \ndata sharing arrangements with those regulators and, ultimately, \nfragment the marketplace by encouraging them to establish their own \ndata repositories.\n  H.R. 1847 addresses this potential data sharing problem by removing \nthe indemnification requirements from current law, while maintaining \nexisting provisions requiring confidentiality obligations.\n  This technical correction has been a longstanding priority for \nCongress. Similar legislation passed the House in the 113th Congress by \na vote of 420-2 and passed the House again this year as part of H.R. \n37, the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act.\n  Additionally, this identical language was included in H.R. 2289, the \nCommodity End-User Relief Act, after a small technical change was \noffered by Ms. Moore and Mr. Crawford and accepted by the House.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1847 to ensure \nthat regulators and market participants have access to a global set of \nswap market data.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                     Committee on Agriculture,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 13, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing concerning H.R. \n     1847, the ``Swap Data Repository and Clearinghouse \n     Indemnification Correction Act of 2015.''\n       This legislation contains provisions within the Committee \n     on Agriculture's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your \n     having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite \n     this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on \n     Agriculture will forego action on the bill. This is being \n     done on the basis of our mutual understanding that doing so \n     will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Agriculture with respect to the appointment of \n     conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the \n     subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding, and would request that you include a copy \n     of this letter and your response in the Committee Report and \n     in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of \n     this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               K. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                              Committee on Financial Services,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, July 14, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael Conaway,\n     Chairman, Committee on Agriculture,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Conaway: Thank you for your July 13 letter \n     regarding H.R. 1847, the ``Swap Data Repository and \n     Clearinghouse Indemnification Correction Act of 2015''.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on \n     H.R. 1847 so that it may move expeditiously to the House \n     floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving action on \n     the bill, the Committee on Agriculture is in no way waiving \n     its jurisdiction over any subject matter contained in the \n     bill that falls within its jurisdiction. In addition, if a \n     conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support \n     any request that your committee be represented therein.\n       Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this \n     letter in our committee's report on H.R. 1847 and in the \n     Congressional Record during floor consideration of the same.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, transparent trading of derivatives, along with realtime \nreporting of trades to swap data repositories, is a crucial element of \nthe Dodd-Frank Act.\n  This bill makes necessary technical changes to better enable our \nNation's regulators to share that data about derivatives with one \nanother and with their foreign counterparts.\n  An unintended result in Dodd-Frank of trying to protect both \nregulators and the data repositories from burdensome litigation was \nthat other regulators lacked the authority to pay future legal \nexpenses, thus threatening to prevent the sharing of information.\n  This was clearly not intended as one of the primary goals of title \nVII, to enable regulators and the public to better understand the \nderivatives market. H.R. 1847 addresses those concerns and is supported \nby the industry and advocates, like Americans for Financial Reform, \nalike.\n  I also understand that the bill includes additional changes to the \nlegislation requested by the SEC to better target the statutory change.\n  I thank Representative Moore and Representative Crawford for working \ntogether in a bipartisan manner to address these issues and solve a \nvery real threat to cross-border regulatory cooperation and oversight.\n  I urge support of this legislation, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Crawford) and thank him for his \ncontinued work on this technical but critical issue.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Chairman, I thank the distinguished chairman of the \nsubcommittee, Mr. Scott, and I would like to thank the other cosponsors \nof this bill, Mr. Huizenga, Ms. Moore, and Mr. Maloney, for joining me \nin this bipartisan effort to help bring transparency to the global swap \nmarkets. I certainly appreciate the subcommittee chairman's support as \nwell.\n  While I might not agree with every provision in the Dodd-Frank law \ntoday, I believe we are working towards its bipartisan goal of giving \nregulators the tools they need to improve systemic risk mitigation in \nthe global financial markets.\n  I think everyone agrees that the lack of transparency and the over-\nthe-counter derivatives markets escalated the financial crisis of 2008. \nIn order to provide market transparency, the Dodd-Frank law requires \nposttrade reporting to swap data repositories, or\n\n[[Page H5147]]\n\nSDRs as they are called, so that regulators and market participants \nhave access to realtime market data that will help identify systemic \nrisk in the financial system. So far, we have made great strides in \nreaching this goal, but, unfortunately, a provision in the law \nthreatens to undermine our progress unless we fix it.\n  Currently, Dodd-Frank requires a provision requiring a foreign \nregulator to indemnify a U.S.-based SDR from any expenses arising from \nlitigation relating to a request from market data. While the intent of \nthe provision was to protect market confidentiality, in practice, it \nthreatens to fragment global data on swap markets because it is a major \nstumbling block to our regulators' abilities to coordinate with foreign \ncounterparts.\n  The intended result is a fragmented global data framework where \nregulators were unable to see a complete picture of the marketplace. \nWithout effective coordination between international regulators and \nSDRs, monitoring and mitigating global systematic risk is severely \nlimited.\n  My bill fixes this problem by removing the indemnification provisions \nin Dodd-Frank. This legislation has broad bipartisan support and passed \nthe House by an overwhelming vote of 420-2 in the last Congress, as \nChairman Scott indicated. Additionally, both the SEC and CFTC are on \nrecord supporting this bill.\n  If left unresolved, the indemnification provision in Dodd-Frank has \nthe potential to reduce transparency in the over-the-counter \nderivatives markets and undo the great progress already being made \nthrough the cooperative efforts of more than 50 regulators worldwide.\n  In passing this legislation, we ensure that regulators will have \naccess to a global set of swap market data, which is essential to \nmaintaining the highest degree of market transparency and risk \nmitigation.\n  I strongly urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bill.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as \nshe may consume to the gentlewoman from Wisconsin (Ms. Moore), who \nhappens to be the ranking member for the Subcommittee on Monetary \nPolicy and Trade.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the madam ranking member for this \nopportunity to speak on H.R. 1847.\n  I also want to thank all of my cosponsors on this legislation: \nRepresentative Huizenga, Representative Crawford, and Representative \nSean Patrick Maloney.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House Financial Services and Agriculture Committees \npassed this legislation with bipartisan support and without controversy \nin 2013, 2014, and 2015. This bill has passed the House several times \nwith overwhelming margins, and it is supported by the SEC.\n  At the Bipartisan Policy Center's 5-year look-back at Dodd-Frank just \nlast week, the question was put to former Commodity Futures Trading \nCommissioner Jill Sommers: What is yet to be done in Dodd-Frank that \nneeds to be done? Her answer: fixing the indemnification provision.\n  Here we are today, and we have an opportunity to do this with that \nbill. Let me try to make this really simple.\n  A major objective of the Dodd-Frank Act was to improve transparency \nand to eliminate systemic risk mitigation in global derivatives \nmarkets. This bill is a technical fix to ensure that the goal of swaps \ntransparency is realized.\n  In fact, Dodd-Frank requires post-trade reporting to swap data \nrepositories. During the crisis, these SDRs did not exist.\n  As a matter of fact, to quote Warren Buffett when he described the \nsituation we were in, he said:\n\n       Only when the tide goes out do you discover who has been \n     swimming naked.\n\n  This is a really important feature in Dodd-Frank. However, as \nwritten, a provision threatens the reporting regime and threatens to \nfragment the collection of data by imposing an unnecessary requirement \non foreign SDRs and regulators that would impede compliance.\n  By eliminating this unnecessary requirement, this bill makes it \npossible to achieve the goal of bringing comprehensive swap trade \ninformation, transparency, and oversight to the global derivatives \nmarkets.\n  Regardless of your position on derivatives or on Dodd-Frank, this \nbill makes sense, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I have no additional \nspeakers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I want to thank \nboth the Democrats and the Republicans who have worked on this.\n  The House has acted several times in a bipartisan manner on this \nlegislation--420-2 on very similar legislation. We have passed this \nmultiple times; so I would just encourage all Members to support this \npiece of legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 1847, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5147-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5147-H5149]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     IMPROVING ACCESS TO CAPITAL FOR EMERGING GROWTH COMPANIES ACT\n\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 2064, the Improving Access to Capital for \nEmerging Growth Companies Act.\n  I would like to thank the ranking member for her support of this good \nlegislation. I would also like to thank Representative Fincher and \nRepresentative Delaney for their efforts to successfully move this \nlegislation through the Financial Services Committee on a unanimous, \nbipartisan vote.\n  Mr. Speaker, a key component of the JOBS Act was the so-called IPO--\nthe initial public offering--on-ramp provisions of title I, which \ncreated a new classification of public company known as an emerging \ngrowth company.\n  Emerging growth company status allows smaller companies that are \naccessing capital in the public markets to utilize streamlined \nregistration and reporting requirements for up to 5 years after their \ninitial public offerings.\n  In doing so, emerging growth companies are able to spend fewer \nresources in complying with costly regulations that are designed for \nthe largest public companies.\n  Just over 3 years since the JOBS Act's enactment, we continue to \nwitness the successful results of its implementation. In 2014, emerging \ngrowth companies represented 86 percent of the 288 initial public \nofferings, allowing those companies to raise over $42 billion in \ncapital.\n  That capital represents real dollars that can be used by these \ncompanies to invest in research and development, in innovative \nproducts, and, most importantly, in new jobs in their communities.\n  While these numbers are encouraging, more can still be done to \nincentivize companies to access capital in our public markets.\n  H.R. 2064 will decrease the required time for a confidential \nregistration statement to be on file with the SEC before an emerging \ngrowth company may conduct a road show from 21 days to 15 and will \nfurther streamline disclosure requirements for emerging growth \ncompanies. These targeted changes to the Federal securities laws will \nmake IPOs even more appealing to emerging growth companies.\n  One witness at a previous Capital Markets and Government Sponsored \nEnterprises Subcommittee hearing commented:\n\n       We support this bill as it creates generally greater \n     optionality for issuers without altering the ultimate level \n     of required disclosure to investors. This bill is in keeping \n     with the philosophy that underlies title I of the JOBS Act \n     and the creation of safe harbors, such as ``testing the \n     waters'' and ``confidential filings.'' We believe, for \n     example, that providing issuers with the ability to file \n     without full financial statements will cut issuer time-to-\n     market, which is beneficial in mitigating market risk and \n     speeding access to capital.\n\n  I ask that my colleagues join me in supporting H.R. 2064.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  The Improving Access to Capital for Emerging Growth Companies Act is \na good bill and is the product of bipartisan compromise. The bill was \namended last year to address certain investor protection concerns while \nstill retaining key relief for small businesses.\n  H.R. 2064 amends title I of the Jumpstart Our Business Start-Ups Act \nof 2012, to provide emerging growth companies--that is, EGCs--with \nadditional flexibility when going public.\n  During a hearing on this bill in the Capital Markets and Government \nSponsored Enterprises Subcommittee, one witness expressed concerns that \n2 years of financial statements are necessary for the SEC to compare \nyears during its review, and, at a minimum, issuers should be required \nto provide what they have.\n  My fear is that, if a company were allowed to delay its filing, as \nthis bill would allow, it would only likely delay the SEC's review, \nresulting in no real benefit to the issuer.\n  I would also like to emphasize the problem Congress gets into when it \npreempts the regulators by trying to issue rules by legislation. When \nwe get it wrong, it takes another act of Congress to fix it. However, I \nsupport this legislation today because it seems as if a consensus has \nemerged that this technical fix is appropriate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Fincher), a coauthor of \nthis legislation.\n  Mr. FINCHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2064, the \nImproving Access to Capital for Emerging Growth Companies Act.\n  I was pleased to introduce this legislation with my colleague, \nCongressman John Delaney of Maryland.\n  This legislation builds upon the success of the original bipartisan \nJOBS Act, which I worked on, that created a new category of stock \noffering for emerging growth companies, which have proven to be a major \nnew source of job creation for the 21st century.\n  Job creation is the number one reason to support this legislation. As \ncompanies are able to expand and go public, they are able to hire more \nemployees and to ultimately invest more in our economy.\n  Our bill makes important changes to the registration process to \nensure that these companies have the most efficient, streamlined access \nto the market.\n  Shortening the 21-day filing period to 15 days would save companies \nexposure to some market volatility before public launch.\n  The purpose of the 21-day period is to allow the information about \nthe EGC IPO to disseminate to the public before purchase orders are \ntaken on the EGC's stock, but with today's technology, the current 21-\nday quiet period is unnecessarily long.\n  The shortened time period would allow the benefit of clearer \nvisibility in market conditions and would save companies from having to \nupdate financials and other disclosure before public launch.\n  Additionally, the bill calls for a grace period of the JOBS Act \nprotections to an issuer who loses EGC status mid-IPO process. Under \ncurrent law, if a company exceeds the EGC status criteria during the \nIPO process, it no longer qualifies for the designation.\n  This discourages a borderline EGC which may be considering going \npublic from making an offering. The grace period would allow an issuer \nwho qualifies as an EGC at the time of filing its confidential \nregistration statement for review to continue to be treated as an EGC \nthrough the date on which it completes its initial public offering or 1 \nyear has passed, whichever comes first.\n  Finally, the bill would permit EGCs to avoid incurring the \nsignificant expense and effort of preparing and having audited \nfinancials and related disclosures for past periods that will not be \nincluded in the prospectus to investors.\n  This legislation was reported out of committee unanimously, and I \nurge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support the passage of \nH.R. 2064 today.\n  This is a simple adjustment to reduce the burdens placed on smaller \ncompanies that are trying to access the market, grow their businesses, \nand hire more employees.\n  Now more than ever, as Members of Congress, we need to be focused on \nways to facilitate job creation. This bill is an important step in that \ndirection.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Delaney).\n  It is because of his leadership not only on this issue, but on small \nbusiness, the opportunities of EGCs, and the fact that his negotiations \non this legislation led us to bipartisan support.\n\n[[Page H5149]]\n\n  Mr. DELANEY. I want to thank the ranking member for her support and \nleadership on this legislation. I also want to thank the gentleman from \nVirginia for his support.\n  Most importantly, I want to thank my friend, the gentleman from \nTennessee, for giving me the opportunity to coauthor this piece of \nlegislation with him.\n  Mr. Speaker, emerging growth companies that raise capital from \nprivate investors have two options available to them to give their \ninvestors a return. The first option is to take the company public, and \nthe second option is to sell the business.\n  The data overwhelmingly suggests that, when companies go public, the \ncompanies are very likely to take the capital they raise in a public \noffering, invest it in the business, create jobs, and hire Americans, \nas compared to when companies are sold, which are often done for \nstrategic reasons that are based on consolidations and often result in \njobs being lost.\n  So, while companies are completely free to make whatever choices they \nwant to make, we, as policymakers, should certainly be trying to level \nthe playing field as it relates to initial public offerings in order to \nmake them more accessible for emerging growth companies, particularly \nif they can be done without compromising investor protection. I believe \nstrongly that H.R. 2064 does, in fact, do that.\n  My colleague from Tennessee went through the specifics in terms of \nthe processes that are being improved by the bill.\n  I have some firsthand experience with this process in having started \ntwo businesses in the private sector and in having taken them both \npublic on the New York Stock Exchange, experiences that taught me that \na company's initial public offering, as it relates to due diligence and \nscrutiny and oversight, is the day when they have the most focus by \nregulators and investors and underwriters.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  So it is certainly a time where we have an opportunity for more \nflexibility around timing, which I believe this bill does and will do \nsuccessfully. It will lead to more initial public offerings. It will \nhopefully reverse the trends that we have seen across the last several \ndecades where the number of initial public offerings have decreased.\n  As I said in my opening comments, the more IPOs we have, the more \nlikely companies are to invest in their businesses, create jobs and \nhire Americans. It is good for our economy. I urge my colleagues to \nsupport H.R. 2064.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, there are very few people in \nCongress today who have worked harder and understand better the \nimportance of access to capital for our small businesses and for job \ncreation than does the chairman of our Subcommittee on Capital Markets \nand Government Sponsored Enterprises.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from New Jersey \n(Mr. Garrett).\n  Mr. GARRETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the vice chairman for those \nremarks.\n  I do in fact rise in support of the bill, H.R. 2064, the Improving \nAccess to Capital for Emerging Growth Companies, EGCs. I also want to \nthank my friend Mr. Delaney and my other friend Mr. Fincher for their \nhard work on the underlying piece of legislation.\n  As we said before, because of the JOBS Act, we have seen a \nsignificant increase, a resurgence, if you will, in initial public \nofferings, with 2014 being the best year for IPOs in more than a decade \nnow. If you look back, study after study has shown that job creation \nexpands significantly once a company goes public.\n  So Congress then should do what? We should do more to reduce the \nburdens on these small and growing companies that want access to the \nmarkets and want access there to capital and want access, therefore, to \ngrow and expand and create job creation. That is exactly what this \nlegislation does.\n  H.R. 2064 would expand upon the success of the JOBS Act by making \nsignificant improvements in title I of that bill, including reducing \nthe number of days that an emerging growth company would have to wait \nbefore commencing with the so-called road shows once it files with the \nSEC, and it would significantly reduce and simplify the financial \ndisclosures that go along with it.\n  These are targeted and incremental changes that reflect the feedback \nand input that the Committee on Financial Services--the members who \nhave supported it, the vice chairman as well--has received since the \nJOBS Act was passed back in 2012.\n  We had a number of hearings on this, and one witness told our \ncommittee: ``This bill is in keeping with the philosophy that underlies \ntitle I of the JOBS Act, and the creation of safe harbors such as \n`Testing the Waters' and `Confidential Filings.' . . . providing \nissuers with the ability to file without financial statements will cut \nissuer time-to-market which is,'' at the end of the day, ``beneficial \nin mitigating market risk and speeding access to capital.''\n  With that said, by removing some of the ongoing hurdles to going \npublic, this bill, H.R. 2064, would help promote growth and help \npromote job creation throughout our entire country, our entire economy. \nTherefore, I urge its swift passage.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I think that this is \nthe last bill that we are taking up on suspension today. What you have \nseen is a fine example of both sides of the aisle working to do the \nbest thing that we could possibly do for our constituents.\n  There have been bills that were presented today that were suspect, \nperhaps, when they first were introduced; there were bills today where \nwe had technical corrections; there were bills today where we had \nbipartisan support where we never thought we would get bipartisan \nsupport. I would like the work that we have done on the floor today to \ndemonstrate that we do have the ability to work together in the best \ninterests of the citizens of this country; and to the degree that we \nunderstand that even in Dodd-Frank where there may still be some \nconcerns, that we can be civil about it, that we can be considerate \nabout it, and that we recognize that not only may there may be places \nfor technical corrections in Dodd-Frank, but in the JOBS Act and other \nbills that we have heard today and that we will hear in the future.\n  I am very pleased to have been a part of the work that we have done \nhere on this floor today to get together in a bipartisan way, again, to \nact in the best interests of all of the people of this country.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the ranking member \nagain and those on her side of the aisle for looking for ways we can \nwork together for job creation and streamlining of the regulatory \nstructure as it relates to our financial markets.\n  I represent Virginia's Fifth District, and over the last 10, 20 \nyears, we have seen a tremendous amount of high unemployment. I would \nsuggest to you that legislation like the legislation that \nRepresentative Fincher and Representative Delaney have put forward \ntoday is the kind of legislation that will lead to more private capital \non Main Street all across the Fifth District of Virginia and all across \nAmerica. I would suggest to you that that is why this bill deserves the \nfull support from the House of Representatives today.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Hurt) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 2064, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5149-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5149-H5150]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

They deserve to know--and all our hard-\nworking Federal employees do--that the personal information they submit \nwhen they serve our country is safe and secure and that they will be \nprotected against identity theft if their information was accessed.\n  The resignation of Director Archuleta does not solve the underlying \nproblems that made OPM vulnerable to these kinds of attacks. I intend \nto work closely with interim Director Beth Cobert to make sure OPM has \nthe resources it needs to upgrade its systems and prevent a \nreoccurrence of this event. But this breach and the one that preceded \nit underscore the larger issue of cybersecurity and how we must do more \nto make America's networks the safest in the world.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5153-5", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 FETAL ORGAN HARVESTING AND TRAFFICKING\n\n  (Mrs. ROBY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I rise to raise awareness about a \ndisturbing development. Today video surfaced of Dr. Deborah Nucatola, \nPlanned Parenthood's senior director for medical services, admitting--\nin fact, bragging--about the harvesting and trafficking of fetal organs \nafter abortions.\n  To those who haven't seen the video, I urge you and encourage you to \nwatch it. But you need to be forewarned: the casual and callous way she \ndetails how babies can be killed in such a way that their tiny hearts, \nlungs, and livers can be taken and sold for profit is simply \nhorrifying.\n  To quote Dr. Nucatola: ``We have been very good at getting heart, \nlung, and liver. So I am not going to crush that part. I am going to \nbasically crush below, I am going to crush above, and I am going to see \nif I can get it all intact.''\n  Madam Speaker, this is one of those moments as a nation that we have \nto ask ourselves: ``Who are we? Are we really going to tolerate this \ninhumanity? Are we going to look the other way while babies are \nbrutally killed and organs are harvested for profit?''\n  These are not specimens. They are babies for goodness' sake.

Madam Speaker, I rise to honor the heroic \nactions of Tim Watson of Fremont, California.\n  Last month, Tim, a Santa Clara Valley Transportation Authority \nbusdriver, was driving his bus along I-680 when he got an important \nalert. It said to be on the lookout for a child abducted at the \nMilpitas library that morning. It also included a description of the \nsuspect and child.\n  Quickly realizing that they may be on the bus, Tim pulled off the \nroad. He made up a story to the other passengers that he needed to look \nfor a missing backpack so he could go through the bus and get a good \nlook at the suspect and the child without anyone realizing something \nmay be amiss.\n  After the search, his suspicion increased, and he called the dispatch \ncenter. He was told to continue on his route and that police would \nfollow along the way. He drove his bus slowly, going at less than 30 \nmiles per hour, when Fremont police were able to meet the bus and \ncapture the suspect when it stopped at the Fremont BART station.\n  Madam Speaker, Tim's quick thinking allowed this kidnapping suspect \nto be apprehended without incident and for the child to be rescued \nsafely.\n  Thank you, Tim. Your bravery and quick thinking saved a life, held \nsomeone to account, and is an inspiration to all of us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5153-7", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5153]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          REMOVAL OF NAME OF MEMBER AS COSPONSOR OF H.R. 2722\n\n  Mr. SANFORD.

Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent that all Members have 5 legislative days in which to revise and \nextend their remarks and include extraneous materials on the topic of \nthis Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I rise today to stand \nwith my fellow members of the Republican Women's Policy Committee to \ndiscuss an issue of concern that is on the minds of every American, \nespecially moms. The topic of concern to so many today is our national \nsecurity and the need to maintain a strong military presence.\n\n[[Page H5154]]\n\n  Madam Speaker, we currently face many threats abroad, including the \nterrorist group ISIS and the newly crafted nuclear agreement with Iran. \nAs threats continue to grow overseas, so should our response. We need \nfor our Commander in Chief to lay out a plan of success. We cannot \nstand idly by while the Islamic State continues to grow. This barbaric \ngroup is an imminent threat to the United States and our allies all \nover the world.\n  Yet another national security concern facing us today is Iran, the \nworld's largest state sponsor of terrorism. Just last night, Iran and \nthe other world powers reached a so-called nuclear deal. I remain \ndeeply skeptical of this so-called deal. Furthermore, Iran has \nthreatened our greatest ally, Israel. Prime Minister Netanyahu has \nalready called this deal ``a historic mistake.''\n  The President promised us that he would walk away from a bad deal, \nbut instead he has forsaken his promises, neglected our allies, and \ndisregarded the concerns of the American people. Because of the many \nfreedoms we enjoy here in the United States, we will always have a \ntarget on our backs. This is precisely why we must maintain a robust \nmilitary presence.\n  At home in North Carolina, I have the privilege of representing the \nNation's largest Army installation, Fort Bragg. Despite the mounting \nthreats abroad, the Army began its reduction of 40,000 troops last \nweek. This included a loss of 842 soldiers at Fort Bragg. I firmly \nbelieve that any troop reduction is not in the best interests of the \nnational security we have.\n  However, in light of this troop reduction, I did receive a piece of \npositive news regarding a decision by the Air Force. The Air Force has \ndecided to stop pursuing their destructive proposal which is to close \nthe 440th Airlift Wing. Our military is one of the best and the \nbrightest. These men and women are the most well trained and well \nequipped in the world. We are blessed to live in a country that stands \nfor justice and embodies freedom and exemplifies liberty.\n  Madam Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from Missouri.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for having this \nSpecial Order. It is wonderful to join my female colleagues here on the \nHouse floor to talk about this very important issue.\n  Madam Speaker, I come to the floor today to sound the alarm about the \nmistake of historic proportions agreed to by the Obama administration \nlast night in Vienna. In his haste and desire to reach an agreement at \nany cost, the President has agreed to far-reaching concessions in \nnearly every area that was supposed to prevent Iran from acquiring a \nnuclear weapon. In contravention of his stated goal, the deal agreed to \nby the President last night affords Iran legitimacy for a partial \nnuclear program now and for a full and unfettered program after 15 \nyears.\n  Madam Speaker, let me repeat myself for the sake of clarity. Under \nthis deal, Iran will be able to develop a nuclear program with \nabsolutely no restrictions less than 15 years from now. Under this \ndeal, Iran will be allowed to continue to operate more than 6,000 \ncentrifuges and will hold on to nearly 300 kilograms of enriched \nuranium.\n  Iran will also receive hundreds of billions of dollars in sanctions \nrelief and regain the access to conventional arms and missiles that it \nhas been denied for nearly a decade. Iran will be free to transfer \nthese weapons to Hezbollah, the Syrian Government, and Yemeni rebels, \nwho all threaten our ally Israel and further inflame the region already \nin crisis. Iran will be free to use the weapons and money provided by \nthis agreement to fuel its terrorist aspirations around the region and \nthe world.\n  This is a completely unacceptable outcome for the United States, \nIsrael, our allies, and the Middle East.\n  Wagering the peace and security of the United States, Israel, and the \nworld on a small chance that a hateful and deceitful regime will \nsuddenly change its entire comportment is not only wrong, it is foolish \nand it is dangerous. Iran's decades-long record of state-sponsored \nterrorism will not change simply because this deal has been signed.\n  Just this past Friday--this past Friday, Madam Speaker--in Tehran, \nIranian mullahs led people in chants of ``death to America.'' Yet, less \nthan 72 hours later, the President is signing a deal with those \nfanatics, a deal that will eventually pave the way for Iran to obtain a \nnuclear weapon.\n  As Prime Minister Netanyahu told us in this Congress, in this very \nChamber this year, ``a bad deal is worse than no deal.'' Madam Speaker, \nthis is a bad deal.\n  The President expects Congress to stand idly by and do nothing while \nhe trades the security of the U.S. and its allies for a legacy-\nburnishing accomplishment. He expects us to sit on the sidelines while \nthe administration offers one concession after another to the Iranians \nand agrees on a deal that would endanger the stability of the entire \nMiddle East and jeopardize U.S. national security. That must not \nhappen.\n  As the 60-day review process mandated by the Iran Nuclear Agreement \nReview Act begins, Congress must unequivocally reject this agreement by \nvoting for a resolution of disapproval. We will not stand idly by while \nthe American people's security is traded for some empty promises. A \nnuclear-armed Iran would start a new arms race in the Middle East and \npose an interoperable threat to the national security of the United \nStates and our allies--especially Israel.\n  Madam Speaker, as Prime Minister Netanyahu said in this very Chamber, \nagain: ``Standing up to Iran is not easy; standing up to dark and \nmurderous regimes never is.'' But for the sake of our children and our \nchildren's children, we must face down this threat now before it is too \nlate.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I urge my colleagues to review this agreement with an eye towards \nhistory, towards the past, towards the present, and towards the future \nof a region critical to America's national interests.\n  Iran has a record of deception and hostility towards American \ninterest. No amount of wishful thinking will change their core \ntendencies. Congress must use this opportunity to stand up for what is \nright.\n  The United States must not capitulate in the face of persistent evil. \nWe must stand together, united against the threat of a nuclear Iran in \norder to guarantee a free and peaceful tomorrow.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I now yield to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Brooks).\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my dear \nfriend, the gentlewoman from North Carolina, for organizing this \nsession today.\n  Last week, when she organized this Special Order, I don't think you \nwere really entirely aware how timely the topic would be today. I am so \npleased that you did organize this, so thank you.\n  Now, many of us are still reviewing the text, having just received \nthe 150 pages, that make up this deal with Iran; but from what I have \nheard thus far, it leaves me highly skeptical that the accord that was \nreached does not advance our interests in the region and signifies a \nretreat from the world stage.\n  Let me first say that, even if we take the President at his word, the \nwords that I heard this morning--and we assume for a second that this \ndeal cuts off ``every pathway to a nuclear weapon''--there are still \nsignificant ramifications for granting $150 billion in sanctions relief \nto a country whose unofficial motto, that we just heard from the \ngentlewoman of Missouri, has become ``death to America.''\n  As Israeli Ambassador Dermer told some of my constituents just last \nnight at a Christians United for Israel speech, a $150 billion infusion \nof cash into Iran's coffers is like a trillion dollars flowing into the \nUnited States Treasury; and that money will go toward funding the \nAyatollah's terror machines, ranging from Assad's regime in Syria, \nHezbollah in Lebanon, the Houthis in Yemen, Hamas, the Islamic jihad in \nGaza, and the many other of Iran's terror proxies throughout the \nregion.\n  This is compounded by the fact that the deal will lift the \nconventional arms embargo in Iran in no more than 5 years and the \nembargo on missile sales to Iran in no more than 8 years. What the deal \nappears to do is give the Iranian regime $150 billion in sanctions \nrelief, while simultaneously allowing\n\n[[Page H5155]]\n\nthem to buy more conventional weapons, weapons that we know have been \nused in the past to actually kill American soldiers.\n  Now, this isn't to mention the unintended consequence that \neffectively shreds our foreign policy playbook that has guided the U.S. \non the world stage for decades. This is a historic mistake--not only \nwhat Prime Minister Netanyahu has said is a historic mistake for the \nworld, but it will allow Iran to continue to pursue its aggression and \nterror in the region. As the Congresswoman from Missouri said, it will \nstart a nuclear arms race in the Middle East.\n  Just today, former CIA Director, General Hayden, testified that not \nonly do we need to understand that our nuclear focus does not make \nother realities go away, even if we had a successful conclusion to \nthese nuclear negotiations, issues will remain.\n  I just want to close by reminding what our issues will Iran include. \nWe know and believe they are the largest state supporter sponsor of \nterrorism. They hold American hostages without a fair trial. They \nsupport Palestinian terrorism, and they destabilize Iraq where we have \ninvested so much treasure and lives. Hayden concluded the issue is not \njust Iran's nuclear problem; the issue is Iran itself.\n  Madam Speaker, no deal is clearly a better outcome than a bad deal; \nand I, too, am extremely concerned the Obama administration has \nnegotiated a bad deal. I assure you that my colleagues and I will leave \nno detail of the final negotiated terms unexplored as this decision \ncomes with consequences that will reverberate for generations moving \nforward.\n  The world cannot afford a nuclear Iran and thus cannot afford a deal \nwith unacceptable terms.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I yield to the gentlewoman from \nIndiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina and also my colleague from Indiana.\n  Madam Speaker, I rise to express my deepest concern that the \nPresident of the United States is signing an agreement with a leading \nstate sponsor of terrorism, Iran. This administration has collectively \ncreated a pathway for Iran to create a nuclear bomb.\n  This agreement endangers the lives of Americans by providing billions \nof dollars in sanctions relief for Iran to continue killing Americans. \nThe lack of adequate safeguards and controls in this plan that \nliterally allows Iran to choose if and when they agree to verification \nis deeply troubling, and it should be to every American, especially \nwhen we start by lifting sanctions without any verification.\n  Also, let's not forget that by lifting the weapons embargo, Iran will \nincrease their stockpile of missiles, ICBMs, directly from Russia--able \nto strike this homeland and other more advanced weapons that will lead \nto an arms race in the Middle East.\n  Once again, the President is bypassing the American people by \nthreatening a veto of any legislation that comes from here that would \ncurb his agreement.\n  The President of the United States continues to reject the will of \nthe American people. As this unrest continues, the United States has to \nmaintain our rich partnership with our allies, including Israel, \nsitting directly in line with Iran.\n  I just want to say to my colleagues here, very quickly, let's not \nforget that it was just a couple of months ago that Prime Minister \nNetanyahu of Israel stood in this very place right here. It was an \nunbelievable moment for this country.\n  He traveled all the way here to tell this body and to tell the \nAmerican people how bad of a deal and how dangerous this agreement is. \nIf you weren't here, I can tell you there was electricity in this \nplace. People were moved, and America heard for the first time what a \ndanger this was not only to us and our homeland, but the existential \nthreat to the nation of Israel. They were moved, and the next morning, \nour Nation was not the same.\n  I just appreciate so much my colleague from North Carolina for \nallowing us to talk about this tonight. See, the American people know \nthat this is not just a bad deal; this is not just a danger to our \nNation. This is the complete unravelling of the Middle East as we know \nit today, and we are going to do everything we can--I can tell you I \nwill do everything I can--to make sure that this bad deal goes away and \nwe do what we are called upon when we raised our right hand to take \nthese positions, which is to protect this Nation from attack.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I yield to the gentlewoman from Utah \n(Mrs. Love).\n  Mrs. LOVE. Madam Speaker, when it comes to the deal with Iran, I want \nto express how incredibly serious this is. That is because the stakes \nhave never been higher.\n  Are we willing to continue to gamble with America's future and \nAmerican lives?\n  Iran is a snake in the grass. Its leaders have made it very clear \nthat they want to implement sharia law, not freedom. Iran does not \nvalue human life the way we do. They have actually shown that they are \nwilling to support terrorists. They have shown that they are willing to \nhurt their own women and children.\n  On the other hand, we have a President of the United States of \nAmerica that said he will veto any efforts to stop this bad deal. That \nshows he has no interest in listening to the American people.\n  How can we claim we are fighting terror when we are giving the \nleading state sponsors of terrorism a break to the tune of billions of \ndollars? At this rate, we will all but build the nuclear weapons for \nthem in 15 years.\n  Now that a deal with Iran is in place, here is what is most \nconcerning: They will turn around and build a nuclear weapon anyway, \nfunded by the profits made from the lack of sanctions.\n  This is not a joke. This is not a game. Iran has a history of \nnoncompliance. A great indicator of what is going to happen in the \nfuture is what has happened in the past. How do we know they will never \nchange? How do we know they will change? We don't. Chances are, they \nwon't change.\n  Ronald Reagan was an advocate of peace through strength. He said that \nthe world would experience peace when the United States was a beacon of \nstrength.\n  I ask you all to stand strong with the United States against Iran and \nagainst any administration that would like to silence us, the American \npeople.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I yield to the gentlewoman from the \ngreat State of Alabama (Mrs. Roby).\n  Mrs. ROBY. Madam Chair, I thank my friend from North Carolina.\n  This is a great opportunity today for all of us ladies to be down \nhere on the floor together, having a little conversation about what we \nrecognize and can see matters to the majority of Americans, and that is \nthe safety of this country and our national defense, our ability to \ndefend against enemies. To my friend from North Carolina, there are a \nlot of those out there right now.\n  As we watch the lack of leadership in this administration, we have \nseen these enemies raise their heads, and it is by no mistake because \nthey will seek to fill a void, and that is exactly what is happening \naround the world.\n  All of our colleagues that have talked earlier in this hour about the \nbad, bad deal with Iran, this comes at a time not only where we are \nseeing the atrocities of ISIS and other groups around the world, but \nalso at a time when we have cut our military not through the muscle, \nbut into the bone.\n  All of us here, we all have military interests in some respect \nthroughout our districts. I know you have a large military presence in \nyour district and others here joining us today, our colleagues; so \neveryone here has not felt the pain of what these cuts look like.\n  To my colleagues, if we don't do something about this sequester here, \nwhen it goes into full implementation--we are already cutting combat \naviation brigades. We will have to cut even more.\n  Of course, I represent Fort Rucker, where we train these folks at the \nArmy Aviation Center of Excellence, so, certainly, these realities are \nnot lost on me; and I know you represent Fort Bragg and others here. \nThe gentlewoman from Tennessee has a large military presence.\n  I guess the conversation that I want to have with you guys today on \nbehalf of our constituents is: What are we going to do about it? We \nhave got to\n\n[[Page H5156]]\n\nfigure this out because, if we don't, it is going to be irresponsible \nas it relates to our readiness and our ability to defend this Nation.\n  We owe it to our military families, our men and women that wear the \nuniform, to ensure that they have everything that they need every time \nwe send them into harm's way. This is really a dangerous time in our \ncountry, and certainly, it is not lost to everyone here as it relates \nto Iran and the bad deal that was negotiated there.\n  We have got to be willing to do our part as it relates to that deal. \nHere in this legislative body, we have to be willing to use the tools \nthat we have and stand up against it and use the courage that we all \nhave in our hearts to fight against this, knowing that it is going to \nnot just have a huge impact on our security here at home, but our very \nimportant allies in the Middle East.\n  I just got back from a codel in the spring where we went to Saudi \nArabia, Iraq, and Israel. Our allies over there are looking at us right \nnow, going: What? What?\n  Anyway, I share my frustration with you, and I know you share it with \nme as well. We need to give the Army what they need. We need to give \nour military what they need and know that we are having the appropriate \nimpact in the parts of the world that are under so much pressure right \nnow as it relates to this plan.\n  I hope we can continue this dialogue. I appreciate all of you coming \nto the floor and letting me be a part of this.\n  I am very concerned. This is what literally keeps all of us up at \nnight, worrying about the future of our country and our safety not just \nhere at home, but for all the men and women that are serving our \ncountry abroad.\n  Again, I hope that we collectively can put our heads together and \nfigure out a way to end this sequester, particularly as it relates to \ndefense, once and for all.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I yield to the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Black).\n  Mrs. BLACK. Madam Speaker, it is an honor to be here and to be a part \nof today's Republican Women's Policy Committee on this Special Order on \nnational security, and I want to thank the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina for bringing us together on this very important topic.\n  I rise today to specifically address the President's attempts to \nstrike a deal with both Iran and Cuba.\n  First, Iran--after four missed deadlines, President Obama announced a \ndeal this morning with Iran, the world's largest state sponsor of \nterrorism and a nation whose Ayatollah famously called the United \nStates ``the Great Satan.''\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  It was a deal praised by the likes of Syria and Russia and condemned \nby our allies, such as Israel. What is more, under the agreement, \ninternational inspectors must ask Iran's permission before reviewing \nits nuclear sites, by the way, after which, Iran has 2 weeks to decide \nwhether to even grant it. All told, Iran would have 24 days to drag out \nthis process and conceal signs of noncompliance.\n  Instead of peace through strength, this agreement amounts to unrest \nthrough appeasement. Under the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, \nCongress does have the power to vote down a bad deal that threatens our \nnational security. I believe this is a bad deal, and I intend to use \nwhat we can to show the President we do not support this deal.\n  Unfortunately, the President's efforts to cozy up to rogue nations \ndoesn't end there. President Obama is attempting to normalize relations \nwith Cuba. Here again, the President is clearly more interested in \nstriking a deal--any deal--rather than knowing the details of the deal.\n  Consider this: Cuba was listed as a state sponsor of terrorism until \nthe end of May, and now the President wants to open up an embassy on \nthe shores of Havana. So can you tell me what has changed?\n  Just last week I led nearly 20 of my colleagues in sending a letter \nto the President, citing a report from the Department of Homeland \nSecurity which found more than 21,000 Cuban nationals with felony \nconvictions living within our borders.\n  These individuals are rated by our Department of Homeland Security as \na threat level 1, meaning that they are the worst of the worst. They \nhave no legal status as they have been given orders to be removed, but \nthey are roaming our streets because Cuba will not take back its \ncriminals.\n  Madam Speaker, if the President insists on opening the door to \nnegotiations with tyrants like Raul Castro, the very least he could do \nis to force this nation to follow the law on this simple matter and \ntake back these criminals into his own country. Listen, when it comes \nto Iran and Cuba, the President must put national security and the \nwell-being of the United States before his political legacy.\n  Again, I thank my colleague and friend from North Carolina for this \nSpecial Order today in order to bring these very important issues to \nthe American people.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield to the \ngentlewoman from Tennessee (Mrs. Blackburn).\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I thank the gentlewoman from North Carolina for \npulling us together.\n  Madam Speaker, when you talk about issues that are women's issues, \nright now national security is at the top of the heap.\n  As we have talked about soccer moms and Walmart moms and all of these \nother iterations and descriptions during the years, right now we are \nlooking at a category of security moms because the issue of security is \nwhat mothers are talking about.\n  I appreciate so much the gentlewoman from North Carolina's \nleadership, and we have two other colleagues who have yet to join us--\nMs. Ros-Lehtinen from Florida and Mrs. Lummis from Wyoming--to talk \nabout this issue.\n  Coast to coast, this is what people are talking about, and they sit \nin disbelief at what this administration is doing.\n  Whether it is Iran or whether it is other foreign policy, our friends \nand allies look at us, as the gentlewoman from Alabama said, and they \nask: ``What are you doing? Where have you been? What are you \nthinking?'' As we would say in Nashville, ``They have got a thinking \nproblem.''\n  Our enemies look at us and say: ``Asleep at the wheel. This is our \nopportunity.'' That is exactly what Iran is doing, and they are looking \nat what we are doing to our military.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from Alabama for talking about her love for \nFort Rucker and the men and women there. I know the gentlewoman \nprobably sits down with those in her district at Fort Rucker, like I do \nwith the families, with the leadership team, with the men and women in \nuniform at Fort Campbell, which is located in my district.\n  They are terribly concerned. They have a mission to fulfill, and it \nis despicable that this administration will continue to try to cut and \ncut and cut our military, cut the numbers, don't give them raises, \ndon't give them all the tools and training, don't give them the Flying \nHours Program that they need for redeployment.\n  Guess what, Madam Speaker. Every bit of that affects the \neffectiveness of our men and women in uniform.\n  The gentlewoman from Alabama will expand on the point of the cuts \nthat are taking place at Fort Rucker and what that means to her \nconstituents.\n  Mrs. ROBY. Madam Speaker, I appreciate the gentlewoman and just her \nshared concern here that we have for our men and women in uniform, for \nArmy aviators, and for their families as well.\n  If the sequester goes into full effect not only when we are cutting \nfrom 12 CABs now--combat aviation brigades--to 10, there is a potential \nthat we could have to go to 9.\n  What that means directly for Rucker is that we will decrease our \nstudent load, the number of Army aviation pilots that we are training. \nWhat that means for our country is that we are no longer ready.\n  I mean, you could make the argument that that, in fact, is the case \nnow. They are going to do everything we ask them to do with what they \nhave. We know that about the United States military, the best in the \nworld. Yet, we are spreading them more and more thin.\n\n[[Page H5157]]\n\n  We are fighting an enemy overseas right now. Whether you want to call \nit ``war'' or not, it is happening, and our men and women are in harm's \nway. There are boots on the ground, and if these cuts move forward, \nthey are going to suffer more.\n  I appreciate the gentlewoman for drawing attention to Rucker, and I \nknow that she feels as passionately as I about the military.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. I do, indeed.\n  The gentlewoman makes a point that is so very important, the \nreadiness and the ability to fight 21st-century warfare on a lot of \ndifferent fronts.\n  Madam Speaker, my colleagues and I will say part of that is naming \nand knowing your enemy, radical Islamist extremists. That is the enemy, \nand that is one of the reasons that this deal that the President \nannounced this morning is so terribly disturbing to us.\n  His advisors had said that no deal is better than a bad deal. Guess \nwhat. What we saw from the President this morning is a pretty bad deal.\n  Here is what Iran gets to keep in this deal: 5,060 centrifuges. It \nincludes an 8-year limitation on uranium enrichment. Think about that, \nan 8-year limitation.\n  So, then, are we setting a time certain that Iran can move forward? \nThis is something that our constituents and the American people need to \nknow about.\n  Then you look at the other components of this, the IAEA's not having \nthe ability to just move forward and inspect anytime anywhere, but \nhaving to give that 2-week notice. That is something, again, of \ntremendous concern.\n  The President has threatened to veto any legislation that impedes the \nnuclear deal. My hope is that Congress is going to stand up and say \n``no'' to the President in this deal and that we will say ``yes'' to \nincreasing the security of this Nation.\n\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield to the \ngentlewoman from Wyoming (Mrs. Lummis).\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Madam Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from North \nCarolina for sponsoring this Special Order, which allows the women of \nthe Republican Conference to talk about an issue that is affecting all \nAmericans, men and women.\n  Benjamin Netanyahu is calling this deal a historic mistake. Historic. \nThink about Israel and history. And when you have its prime minister \ncalling this a historic mistake, we should be paying attention.\n  Madam Speaker, there is a very real and present danger of nuclear \nproliferation because of this deal; so it is critical that America not \nlet her military preparedness for deterrence deteriorate. It will have \nexactly the opposite effect of that which the administration intends.\n  Consequently, we need all three legs of the nuclear triad--land, air, \nand water--for a strong defense and deterrence against attack. With a \ntriad of bombers, submarines, and ICBMs, missiles are the most \naffordable, and they are on alert, protecting America and deterring her \nenemies 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.\n  We should be talking with Poland, with the Czech Republic, and we \nshould make sure that they have an adequate missile defense. We are \ngoing to have to start talking to Saudi Arabia.\n  If Israel and Saudi Arabia are already today talking about the \nconsequences of a deal with Iran, what does that tell you? It tells you \njust what the gentlewoman from Alabama was telling us a few minutes ago \nwhen they visited there, which is that security in Saudi Arabia--\nhomeland security--is an enormous issue.\n  It is because there are always terrorists coming into Saudi Arabia, \ntrying to get at Mecca and Medina, trying to do something that will \ncause a conflagration around the world, that will incite religious \nbattles.\n  When they have one of their most feared adversaries now being in a \nposition after 8 years and having now the money because of the lifting \nof the sanctions to go ahead with a nuclear program, what do you think \nthey are going to do? What are the Saudis going to do? It is critical \nthat we maintain for world peace and the deterrence of nuclear war our \nown ability to respond and to deter.\n  Madam Chairman, I thank you for this Special Order, and I thank you \nfor your diligent work in this regard.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. Madam Speaker, I yield to the \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen).\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Madam Speaker, I want to thank my friend and \ncolleague and chair of the Republican Women's Policy Committee, \nCongresswoman Renee Ellmers, for leading the charge on this Special \nOrder so that we can discuss issues of national security.\n  As we have heard, Madam Speaker, and will continue to hear tonight, \nthere is no shortage of national security threats that are facing us \ntoday. That is not what should scare us.\n  What should scare us is that the Obama administration has no \nstrategy, no plan in place, to address some of the most serious threats \nthat are out there.\n  Perhaps the most pressing issue currently facing U.S. national \nsecurity, the security of our friend and ally, really--the Democratic \nJewish State of Israel--and, indeed, global security is a nuclear-armed \nIran.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  If we want to discuss national security threats, we can spend all day \ndiscussing the ones the administration just set into motion when it and \nthe rest of the P5+1 nations announced this nuclear agreement with \nIran.\n  Let's set aside for a moment, Madam Speaker, the fact that the \nadministration just guaranteed that Iran will become a nuclear \nthreshold state as a result of this deal, and we can all set our timers \non when that first Iranian bomb will be produced thanks to this weak \nand dangerous deal.\n  Let's focus on the fact that the administration just guaranteed that \nthe Iranian regime's billions of dollars that it is going to have to \nfill its coffers to underwrite its support for terror aimed at the U.S. \nand aimed at our interests around the world and especially our ally the \ndemocratic Jewish State of Israel.\n  Remember, this is the same regime that was responsible for building \nand providing the vast majority of roadside bombs that killed and \ninjured thousands of our brave men and women who served valiantly in \nIraq. It is the same regime that has propped up the murderous Assad \nregime in Syria, that supports the Shiite militias, all of which \ncontributed greatly to the rise of the Sunni terror group ISIL, which \nhas now become one of the greatest threats to U.S. national security as \nwell.\n  This regime is responsible for the bombing of the U.S. Marine \nbarracks and the U.S. Embassy bombings in Beirut and continues to \nsupport Hezbollah and Hamas as the terror groups that target Israel.\n  If this terrifying scenario wasn't bad enough, Madam Speaker, the \nObama administration has included in this sweetheart of a deal for the \nIranian regime lifting all U.N. Security Council resolutions, including \nthe arms embargo, and that won't even last the duration of the deal, \nbut it will be only in 5 years.\n  Madam Speaker, what has Iran done to deserve a lifting of the arms \nembargo, the lifting of sanctions against its ballistic missile \nprogram, its support for terror? Iran, in fact, continues to stoke \nsectarian violence, foments instability in the Middle East, flexing its \nmuscles with the arms and military equipment that it already has.\n  Now, we are prepared to lift the arms embargo on that murderous \nregime, lift the restrictions in place on its ballistic missile \nprogram, the most expansive program out of any country in the region.\n  What kind of message did we just send to our partners in the region \nwho fear Iran's hegemonic ambitions? We just allowed their most feared \nenemy to become a nuclear state, to have access to have even more money \nto support its illicit activities, and to bolster its conventional \nweapons and ballistic missile program.\n  Talk about threats to our national security, Madam Speaker--wow. This \nnuclear deal that the Obama administration announced this morning just \nguaranteed an all-out conventional and nuclear arms race that very well \ncould lead to what the President claimed he was trying to avoid, a war.\n  Whether it is Iran or whether it is Cuba, as Mrs. Black of Tennessee \npointed out, President Obama is going legacy shopping. I fear that \nIsrael will\n\n[[Page H5158]]\n\nbe next on Obama's legacy shopping list. I worry that President Obama \nwill force Israel to accept a bad peace deal with the Palestinians.\n  Madam Speaker, let's shut down Obama's legacy store. We just can't \nafford it. I would like to thank Mrs. Ellmers for her leadership on \nthis national security threat.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I now yield to the gentlewoman from \nNew York (Ms. Stefanik).\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Madam Speaker, just this past Monday the Iraqi \nGovernment declared that it was beginning a major military operation to \nretake western Anbar province from ISIS. This area of operation, \nincluding major cities of Ramadi and Fallujah, is the same region which \nISIS seized this past May.\n  Following this announcement, American-led coalition airstrikes \npermeated Anbar province. I fervently support U.S. and coalition \nmilitary targeted airstrikes which continue to attack the Islamic State \nwithin Syria and Iraq. Along with airstrikes, U.S. troops serve as a \npart of an advise and assist role in Iraq and continue to do so in \nAfghanistan.\n  Since September 11, 2001, the Army's 10th Mountain Division has been \nthe most actively deployed division to Iraq and Afghanistan, and I am \nhonored to represent the 10th Mountain Division, a light infantry \ndivision comprised of competent, resilient, and skilled warriors.\n  In New York's north country, we understand what fighting for our \nNation's liberties and freedoms truly means; and come this winter, \nduring the holidays, when we are at home with our loved ones, these \nbrave soldiers from the 10th Mountain Division will be serving our \nNation in highly kinetic combat zones.\n  When I speak against ISIS, their barbaric tactics, and the \ninstability they create around the world, I am speaking for my \nconstituents, the brave servicemen and -women who are overseas right \nnow, fighting to protect our national security.\n  I speak for their loved ones, the military families who are back in \nthe north country at Fort Drum, worrying about their safety, and \nlooking forward to the day they arrive back home.\n  This is why I am extremely frustrated when cuts to our defense budget \ncontinue. Sequestration is a real threat to our national security. \nSequestration was proposed by this administration, signed into law by \nthis President, and passed by a previous Congress.\n  As ISIS remains a major source of terrorism and instability \nthroughout the Middle East, here, in Congress, we must discuss real \nsolutions related to stabilizing the region, continued threats to our \nown national security, the readiness for our Armed Forces, and the \ntools they need to keep our country safe.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act provides our Nation's Armed \nForces with the resources they need to defend our national security \nagainst ISIS, and soon, this imperative piece of legislation will be on \nits way to the President for his signature.\n  A veto could threaten the safety of our Nation's servicemembers and \nour country's defense. Our national security is gravely at risk, as \nlong as ISIS remains intact and our troops are tasked with doing more \nwith less.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting our Armed Forces in \nfighting against defense sequestration, and I implore this President to \nsign the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I would like to say how much I \nappreciate receiving General Townsend to the XVIII Airborne Corps as \ncommanding general from the 10th Mountain Division.\n  I know that you appreciate him as much as I do.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Absolutely.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I now yield to the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. McSally).\n  Ms. McSALLY. Madam Chair, I appreciate you organizing this so that \nthe women in our Conference can speak about something that is vitally \nimportant to our communities.\n  Everywhere I go in my district, my constituents are concerned about \nthe security of our Nation and making sure that our men and women in \nuniform have everything they need in order to defend America.\n\n  Having served 26 years in uniform myself and representing a district \nof 85,000 veterans and two military bases, right now, we have over 750 \nof them deployed overseas in the fight against ISIS and also to work \nwith our allies to deter Russian aggression.\n  People are deeply concerned about what appears to be--and not just \nappears to be--a failed defense strategy and foreign policy out of this \nadministration. I can tell you, as I look around the world--and I have \nbeen doing national security for 30 years--we are in a more dangerous \nworld than I have ever seen in my lifetime. I have got the experience \nof six combat deployments and a couple master's degrees.\n  Taking a look at this, we don't have enough time in an hour to go \naround the world with the threats that are emanating. The one that is \nobviously taking up the news today is the bad deal related to Iran and \ntheir march towards a nuclear capability.\n  I am going to read the whole thing tonight and tomorrow and make sure \nthat we see all the details, but it seems like, on its surface, the \ngoalposts have been moved; and the deal that has been negotiated is one \nwhere, myopically, this administration wanted to get a deal, really at \nall costs.\n  That cost is quite high to our national security, to the security of \nour friends and our allies, with significant destabilization in the \nMiddle East, while we have Iran, which is the greatest state sponsor of \nterror, continuing to destabilize and fight proxy wars in the region \nand continuing to threaten Americans.\n  They have blood on their hands of American soldiers in Iraq and in \nLebanon and other places. They are continuing to threaten Israel, \ndestabilizing the region, and propping up nonstate actors in their \nproxy wars; and none of that is changing.\n  Now, we basically are legitimizing that and not addressing any of \nthese other issues while potentially lifting the arms embargo. This is \npotentially a very reckless direction that we are going in. My \nconstituents have been talking to me even today about the concerns and \njust the myopic focus of this administration on this particular bad \ndeal.\n  If we take a larger view of the Middle East, there appears to be an \nabsolutely incoherent strategy in the larger Middle East. While we have \nQasem Soleimani, the general responsible for the Quds Force, \nresponsible for all these terrorist activities that I mentioned, \nactually commanding the ground forces in Iraq to take back Tikrit, \nwhile we are providing the air power and sort of pretending that we are \nnot operating in the same space for the same objectives, then we see \nwhat Iran is doing to continue to destabilize both in Yemen, in their \nsupport to Hamas and Hezbollah.\n  All of this is just absolutely incoherent. If you were to try to ask \nsomebody what are we trying to do in the Middle East relative to Iran, \nwhich is the hegemon in the room, as a state sponsor of terror, I don't \nthink anybody could really answer that. I don't think this President \ncan answer this. There is deep concern about this lack of coherency.\n  When it comes to the fight against ISIS, we are doing these anemic \nattacks from the air. Having been a fighter pilot myself and having \nbeen involved in the targeting process--from being a flight lead in an \nA-10, all the way up to running the counterterrorism operations in \nAfrica--I am very familiar with the targeting process.\n  We are in a situation where ISIS is continuing to gain momentum, to \nrecruit foreign fighters. Over 20,000 have been recruited, and it looks \nlike they are taking us on, and they are winning because we are putting \nthe bar so high on what targets that we can actually strike--legitimate \ntargets that we are having pilots fly away from--and let continue to \nthrive and murder massive numbers of civilians in Iraq and Syria; \ngaining a foothold; gaining territory; and, in using social media, \ngaining new recruits because it looks like they are winning.\n  We have an absolute incoherent military strategy in the fight against \nISIS not using our power in the way that it should be used, with all \nthat it can bring to the fight, in order to achieve our national \nsecurity objectives.\n  We had the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs \nin\n\n[[Page H5159]]\n\nfront of us on the House Armed Services Committee a couple weeks ago, \nwhere they said, related to this strategy, hope is not a strategy, but \nit looks like that is exactly what we are relying on. We are hoping \nthat the Iraqis have an inclusive government, which they have shown \ntime and time again that they are failing to do.\n  While Iraq has their national security interests certainly in the \nregion, we have our own interests in making sure that ISIS does not \ngain a strong foothold with resources and the desire to recruit, train, \nand inspire individuals to attack Americans and take away our way of \nlife. This strategy has just been failed coming out of this \nadministration.\n  Russia, just another example, the squadron that I commanded is soon \ncoming back from a deployment to Russia, A-10s over in the region to \nhelp assure and train our allies against the continued aggression that \nwe are seeing from Russia.\n  Our incoming potential Chairman of the Joint Chiefs declared last \nweek in a hearing that he believes Russia is actually the largest \nthreat that we are potentially dealing with; yet the weakness from this \nadministration in standing up and leading to defend our national \nsecurity interests and reassure our allies is allowing Putin to fill \nthat vacuum.\n  The Baltics and the other allies that are in the region, after \nbasically the Russians were able to invade Ukraine, are wondering who \nis next and what is at stake with our NATO partners. This is just \nanother example.\n  What China is doing in the South and East China Seas is just one more \nexample of us not leading and not being able to assure our allies, \nshowing weakness. Our friends are wondering can they count on us \nanymore, and our enemies are no longer afraid of us. This is the \ndangerous world we are in.\n  Some of these factors were going to be happening anyway, but American \nleadership can make or break situations, and we can change the course \nof international events if we are leading or not leading. This \nadministration says that they are leading from behind. In the military, \nwe call that following. There is no such thing as leading from behind.\n  We need to make sure we have a strong national security strategy, \nthat we have a capable military. The impact sequestration is having on \nour military, I have friends and individuals I know that are still \nserving and trying to serve, and they are rearranging deck chairs right \nnow, trying to deal with the lack of resources and diminishing \ncapabilities in training and readiness.\n  That is not a strategy-based budget; that is a budget-based strategy. \nI have been very strong in speaking against sequestration. I think we \nneed to work together in order to make sure we can give the men and \nwomen in the military everything they need to defend America.\n  The last point I will make--and there are many to make, but we don't \nhave enough time--is that we have passed the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for the last 54 years.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  This is an important piece of legislation that gives the troops the \nauthorization, the pay raises, and everything that they need--combating \nsexual assault--all the different things that we have authorized in the \nNDAA, and this President is threatening to veto it.\n  I really hope that those around America who are listening to this \nwill rise up and call their Members of Congress, call their Senators, \ncall the White House and tell them that you don't play politics with \nour men and women in uniform. This is about national security and \nnational defense. You need to sign that bill.\n  We are working through conference right now to hopefully get it done \nbefore we go into recess. This is an important piece of legislation, \nand we should not be playing political games with our national \nsecurity.\n  So thank you, Madam Chairman, for organizing this. Thanks for the \nopportunity to come down and speak on behalf of our constituents, on \nbehalf of those in my district right now that are serving overseas, the \nmen and women in uniform. We owe it to them to make sure that we have a \nstrong national security, that we have a strong military, we give them \neverything they need, and that we provide leadership in the world.\n  We have got to continue to provide oversight to the failed foreign \npolicy and defense policy of this administration, and I look forward to \ncontinuing these discussions.\n  Mrs. ELLMERS of North Carolina. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Madam Speaker, on behalf of the members of the Republican Women's \nPolicy Committee, I would like to end this Special Order today by \nthanking our troops and their families. These men and women voluntarily \nventure into harm's way to protect our freedoms, ideals, and way of \nlife.\n  It is equally as important that we recognize the sacrifices that \nmilitary spouses and children make as well. They deserve our unwavering \nsupport for putting the safety and security of our country first.\n  May God continue to bless this great Nation and our men and women in \nuniform.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time to conclude this \nSpecial Order on national security.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5159-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5159]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\nREPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 2898, WESTERN \n    WATER AND AMERICAN FOOD SECURITY ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR \n CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 3038, HIGHWAY AND TRANSPORTATION FUNDING ACT OF \n                             2015, PART II\n\n  Mr. NEWHOUSE (during the Special Order of Mrs. Ellmers of North \nCarolina), from the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report \n(Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, we are going to spend about an hour \nhere talking about something that is of great importance to the \nAmerican people, to the economy, to the strength of America, and, \nindeed, the discussion we just heard about national security. It\n\n[[Page H5160]]\n\nis about how we can build the American economy and build jobs for the \nworking men and women of this country, the great middle class.\n  There will be much discussion in the days ahead about the Iran \nnuclear deal. That will be something that is of importance. But today, \none question that we ought to ask each other is: If we don't have a \ndeal, then what? The answer to that is: Nothing good.\n  Let's talk about Make It In America. This is an agenda that the \nminority whip put together about 4 years ago, and it is about building \nthe American economy, how we can do it. The Make It In America agenda \nhas moved along these last 4 years, almost 5 years now, with numerous \npieces of legislation, and we are going to talk about those.\n  Last week, the minority whip, Mr. Steny Hoyer, put together a hearing \non this subject matter, and those Democrats that have introduced \nlegislation over these many years and have reintroduced that \nlegislation testified at the hearing about their pieces of legislation.\n  The result of that was, wow, what if we did those things? What if we \nactually passed those pieces of legislation? What if they became law? \nWell, I tell you what it would mean. What it would mean is an enormous \nopportunity for this economy to grow and for the great American middle \nclass to enjoy higher wages, more jobs, and more opportunity.\n  Essentially, the legislation came down in these various ways. We had \ntrade legislation. For example, the big discussion we have had over the \nlast 3 months about trade policy and the Trans-Pacific Partnership is \nextremely important for American manufacturing. Done properly, it \nprobably would grow American manufacturing. On the other hand, what we \nhave seen in the many years previously is that trade policy can hollow \nout, destroy American manufacturing. So we talked about trade policy.\n  One issue of extreme importance to me is the maintenance of the Buy \nAmerica provisions. This is law that has been in place for more than 50 \nyears, and it essentially says, if you are going to spend American \ntaxpayer money, then spend it on American-made goods and equipment.\n  Tax policy is extremely important. You can, as present tax policy is \nset in place, encourage the offshoring of American jobs. American \ncorporations are taking their capital, running off to the lowest wage \nrate country in the world, planting their capital there, building their \nmanufacturing facilities, and leaving behind the American worker. So \nthere are numerous ideas on tax policy.\n  Energy policy is another issue. We now know that we have had a very \nrobust, large expansion of American energy production, natural gas and \noil, so much so that we are likely to ship off in the days ahead \nliquefied natural gas. Well, if we do a little bit of that, it is \nprobably okay. If we do too much of that, we raise American prices for \nenergy, and then we are going to see less robust American \nmanufacturing.\n  On labor policy, it is about how we encourage labor, wage rates, and \nthe reeducation for those men and women that have lost their jobs. \nEducation and research and development are extremely important.\n  These are the essential elements of the Make It In America policy. We \nwill be talking about all of these today.\n  As my colleagues come in, I want to welcome them to the floor. I see \nour colleague from the great Northeast, Ann Kuster, here. If you would \nlike to talk about some of your legislation on Make It In America, we \nwould be delighted to have you join us. I know that you have been \nworking on this a long time in your area, and you have introduced bills \nin the last Congress and you have new bills in this Congress.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Garamendi, I appreciate you yielding, and I \nappreciate you taking the time to share with the American people our \nMake It In America agenda. I really want to thank you for the fantastic \nwork that you have been doing on growing domestic manufacturing in the \ncountry.\n  We are joined by our wonderful leader, Mr. Steny Hoyer, and his \nleadership on this issue is now legendary. So thank you for that.\n  New Hampshire has had a long history of being a leader in the \nmanufacturing industry, all the way back to the paper mills at the turn \nof the century, the textile mills. At one point in Manchester, New \nHampshire, we made a mile of cloth a day, and we were leaders in that.\n  So from the beginning of the time that I have served here in \nCongress, I have been highly focused on how we can support successful \nlocal businesses and embrace innovation to help move our manufacturing \neconomy into the 21st century.\n  In New Hampshire and across the country, we have some of the hardest \nworking and most innovative companies in the world. I have had the \nopportunity to visit dozens of companies in my congressional district, \nvisiting manufacturing companies, community colleges, community groups, \nand organizations all across the Granite State that are harnessing \nthese new technologies to revitalize the manufacturing sector and \nbreathe new life into our industry.\n  In Keene, New Hampshire, in the southwest corner of my district, for \nexample, we have a Regional Center for Advanced Manufacturing, bringing \ntogether leaders from the community, from the K-12 school unit there, \npublic schools, from our community college--River Valley Community \nCollege--our State university system--Keene State University--and \nstudents and leaders from all across the region learning and teaching \nthe trades of tomorrow.\n  Coming up in October, New Hampshire will celebrate a full \nManufacturing Week. It is a fabulous program. It started out 1 day; it \nhas now exploded into a whole week. Hundreds, if not thousands, of \nstudents from the high schools will come into our manufacturing \ncompanies and will have a chance to see firsthand what this looks like, \nthese CNC machines and the computerized precision manufacturing.\n  This is not your grandfather's factory. It is not dirty. It is not \nnoisy. In fact, it is pristine clean. The machines are run on \ncomputerized programming, and every employee in the company needs to \nhave the latest in education and talent. People will be able to come in \nto the companies and see what the work is that is going on.\n  I have had the chance to see the CNC computerized machines working \nwith wood, working with textiles, working in glass, even counting and \norganizing eggs at a wonderful Pete and Gerry's Organic Eggs farm.\n  The problem is that, during the last several decades, lower wages, \nlack of access to education and skill training, and changes in our \nglobal economy have stacked the deck against our U.S. manufacturers. \nThese issues are standing in the way of innovation.\n  So that is why we have all come together with this Make It In America \nagenda: to make the right policy changes to help level the playing \nfield so that our manufacturers can grow and successfully create more \njobs. That is my number one priority: jobs and economic development.\n  As part of the Make It In America agenda that I am supporting, we \nhave developed a strong, comprehensive plan to help manufacturers \nthrive in the 21st century. The great thing about manufacturing, as my \ngood colleague, Mr. Garamendi, has pointed out, is whether you are \nworking on transportation policy, education, taxes, regulatory issues, \ntrade, or most any other issue, we can take actions that help \nmanufacturers. And that is exactly what our Make It In America agenda \nis seeking to do.\n  One bill that I introduced--and I am working hard to include it in \nthe agenda, and I am working hard to pass--is the Workforce Development \nInvestment Act. What this important piece of legislation would do is \ncreate a tax break for employers who partner with community colleges to \nprovide skill training for specific jobs in their respective \nindustries.\n  As I go around visiting these companies, they do have jobs available, \nbut they don't always have people in the community with the skills that \nthey need. And so, for example, at Nashua Community College, we got \nfunding to create a new program that would train people in this \nadvanced manufacturing, precision manufacturing computerized \ntechniques, and those people will come out with a 2-year associates \ndegree and walk directly into jobs at $55,000 with great benefits and a \ngreat quality of life right there in New Hampshire.\n\n[[Page H5161]]\n\n  My legislation would do all of this by encouraging greater \ncollaboration between community colleges and employers to make sure \nthat students not only have the right skills to succeed, but are on a \npath to employment when they graduate.\n  So again, I thank Mr. Hoyer, Mr. Garamendi, and everyone else who has \nworked to shape this strong manufacturing agenda. I am proud to be a \npart of it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Ms. Kuster, thank you so very, very much. I think New \nHampshire is very fortunate to have your leadership on manufacturing. I \nthink I want to go up there and watch your Manufacturing Week. Now, I \nam not running for President, so that is not why I would go.\n  I notice that we have our leader, who has put together this program \nover the last 5 years. He has geared us up with the hearing last week \nwith all of the members of the Democratic Caucus that have introduced \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Hoyer, you are our leader. You have made Make It In America an \nAmerican agenda. Thank you so much for that leadership. Thank you for \nbeing here and for last week's conference. We have got more work to do. \nWe need to get all this legislation in place. I know with your \nleadership we have got a good shot at it.\n  Mr. Hoyer, welcome.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank you very much, Mr. Garamendi. You do such an \nextraordinary job for California--and have for a long period of time--\nbut you are doing an extraordinary job here in Washington on behalf of \nAmerica, on behalf of America's workers, on behalf of manufacturers, \nand on behalf of making sure that we make it here and sell it here and \neverywhere. That is what Make It In America is about. Nobody, including \nmyself, has been any more tenacious in informing people about this \nagenda, and I thank you for that.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I want to thank Ann Kuster. Congresswoman Kuster and I had an \nopportunity to visit a really neat manufacturing facility in her \ndistrict not too long ago.\n  They were excited about what they were doing, and they were excited, \nas she has pointed out, about making their business more technology \nfocused and making it more efficient and more productive and, yes, more \nprofitable; but the good news is they were retaining jobs in that \neffort. I thank Congresswoman Kuster.\n  I want to thank Don Norcross, who is a new Member of the Congress, \nbut not new to supporting Make It In America--he may not have called it \nMake It In America in New Jersey--but Make It In America legislation \nand policies. Don Norcross comes from a background of a working family, \nand he has made them proud and made us proud, and we welcome him to \nthis effort.\n  I noticed also that Sheila Jackson Lee from Houston is also on the \nfloor, who has been a tenacious and very, very faithful spokesperson \nand worker on behalf of Make It In America.\n  I am proud to share with my colleagues that House Democrats held a \nhearing, as has been mentioned, this past Thursday to begin exploring \nhow to improve, expand, and adapt the Make It In America plan to meet \nthe needs and challenges of 2015 and beyond.\n  As a matter of fact, one of the things we want to find out is how we \ncan better create an environment for new technologies, for new ways of \ndoing business, for new ways of making it in America.\n  Representative Garamendi was one of 34 Members who participated at \nlast week's hearing. For the past 5 years, we have worked together in a \nbipartisan way to enact already 16 Make It In America bills into law.\n  These bills included measures to clear the backlog of patent \napplications, reauthorize the America COMPETES Act, and expand \ninvestments in workforce development, which is what Mr. Garamendi was \ntalking about and Ms. Kuster was talking about in terms of training \npeople for the new technologies.\n  If we are going to compete worldwide in this global marketplace in \nwhich we now find ourselves, America is going to be the high value end \nof the global marketplace. As a result, we need to make sure that we \neducate and train people to effectively participate and compete and \nsucceed in that high-tech environment.\n  For the past 5 years, Make It In America has been focused on creating \nthe conditions that encourage, as I said, business to innovate, \nmanufacture, and create jobs here in the United States of America.\n  Now, with the rise of new technologies with the potential of \ntransforming our economy, it is now time to update the Make It In \nAmerica plan to address today's challenges and build on past successes.\n  That is why, Madam Speaker, the hearing that House Democrats held on \nThursday was the first in what will be a series of hearings to solicit \nfeedback from Members, entrepreneurs, job creators, in other words, \neconomists, innovators, and others who have insights to share how we \ncan be more successful in creating jobs and competing. These hearings \nare entitled: ``Make It In America: What's Next?''\n  Five years have gone by. Circumstances have changed. Challenges have \nchanged. Opportunities have changed. We need to be making sure that we \nare in a position to seize those opportunities on behalf of all of our \npeople. This is a process of listening, learning, and then implementing \nthe best ideas that emerge.\n  Thursday's hearings--Mr. Garamendi, you participated in them; you \nwere one of the leaders there, which highlighted Members' ideas and \nfeedback they have received from speaking and meeting with constituents \nback home--was a great success.\n  I want to emphasize that. We take, from time to time, breaks, and we \ncall them district work periods, and some people call them vacations.\n  Almost every Member on both sides of the aisle use a district work \nperiod to go among their constituents, go to businesses, go to schools, \ngo to construction sites, go to offices, and talk to people about what \nthey think.\n  That is what our Founding Fathers had in mind: House Members, close \nto the people, listen to the people, bring their views here. That is \nwhat we did at this hearing.\n  We heard about the economic impact of the so-called Internet of \nthings, which--in my generation, what language are you speaking, \nInternet of things--which uses wireless technology to connect everyday \nobjects, your home, your refrigerator, your air conditioner, your \ntelevision, everyday objects; we are all connected now.\n  We also heard about maker faires and fab labs, where students and \nprofessionals alike can transform tinkering into innovation. I \nsometimes say, Mr. Garamendi, that one of the policies that we ought to \ndo is we ought to--a previous President talked about a chicken in every \npot.\n  We ought to give a garage to every graduating high school student. It \nseems everything is generated in a garage in America. Although, as Bill \nFoster pointed out, these fab labs and maker faires were perhaps the \nnew garages of our time.\n  Representative Garamendi, as I said, was among those who spoke about \nnew ways to help traditional manufacturing, when he discussed the role \nour shipbuilding industry plays in helping American businesses move \nnatural gas and other goods to market at home and abroad.\n  That shipbuilding industry was critically important to us winning in \nWorld War II. Now, as Mr. Garamendi pointed out, it is a shadow of its \nformer self, and we need to rebuild it, and we need to be shipping \ngoods on American fleets.\n  These were just some of the things that came up in the hearing, and I \nencourage all of my colleagues and all Americans to go online to \ndemocraticwhip.gov and read Members' testimonies.\n  Ms. Kuster's testimony is on that, Mr. Garamendi's, and Mr. Norcross' \ntestimony is on the Web; and you can see their perspective, add them \nall together, and we come up with a powerful agenda to create jobs in \nAmerica.\n  That is what we are focused on; that is what the people want us \nfocused on, and that is what we are going to work on. That is what Make \nIt In America is all about.\n  I want to express my gratitude, again, to all the Members who \nparticipated in the first hearing, including, of\n\n[[Page H5162]]\n\ncourse, the leader of this Special Order, Mr. Garamendi from \nCalifornia, and I thank him for yielding.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Hoyer, none of this would be happening were it not \nfor your leadership. You brought us together, 34 Members of the \nDemocratic Caucus, each with one or more specific pieces of legislation \nto move the Make It In America agenda, so that Americans can have those \nmiddle class jobs and beyond and above and, in the process, grow the \nAmerican economy. It is the fair way to do it. It is the right way to \ndo it; grow the American economy in a fair way so that those middle \nclass jobs are there.\n  It is the future; it has been the past; it can be the future with the \nlegislation, and each one of these ideas--trade, taxes, energy, labor, \neducation, research and infrastructure--the 34 Members of your caucus \nbrought forth legislation in each and every one of those areas.\n\n  Mr. HOYER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I yield to the gentleman from Maryland.\n  Mr. HOYER. The last item on there is infrastructure. When you build \ninfrastructure in America, you don't create jobs any place other than \nAmerica.\n  We are hopefully going to have a highway bill; and we need a \npermanent highway bill, a long-term, 6-year minimum highway bill, so \nthat we lend confidence to the marketplace that the infrastructure is \ngoing to be in place because, if we are going to Make It In America, a \ngood, solid competitive infrastructure is absolutely essential.\n  I thank the gentleman for that list. I thank him for his work. I \nthank him for the--I will say a few things while the gentleman is \nrestoring Make It In America to its rightful place.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I am going to move this thing along. I see several of \nour other colleagues have joined us here.\n  Sheila Jackson Lee, you said you had a brief presentation. Please \ntake the floor, then Mr. Norcross, and then we will--Marcy Kaptur is \nhere from Ohio. Here we go.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me add my appreciation as well to be one of \nthose Members who joined Mr. Hoyer 5 years ago to emphasize that Make \nIt In America is a double win. Make It In America, and we will make it \nin America, and that is what this message has been. I want to thank my \ngood friend from California for leading this effort.\n  I just want to read what many of our constituents appreciate as being \npart of this Make It In America. The fair trade concept, taxes, energy, \nlabor, education, research, and infrastructure, all of these are part, \nif they work fairly for the working man and woman.\n  I highlighted The Wall Street Journal earlier this year, 2014 marked \nthe best year for job growth in 15 years, with employers adding 2.95 \nmillion jobs, and the unemployment rate falling to a postrecession low \nof 5.6 percent.\n  For the first time since the recession ended, payrolls are expected \nto grow. In all of America's cities and throughout the U.S., they are \nexpected to add another 2.6 million jobs.\n  Houston is ranked as a top city for STEM occupations, jobs requiring \na degree in science, technology, engineering, and math. Of course, we \nare engaged in the energy sector, and for that, we need employees.\n  All of my colleagues who believe in Make It In America collectively \nhave put in place nearly 100 additional bills that have been introduced \nto focus on Make It In America. As well, all of us have focused on this \nconcept of skills training.\n  I introduced H.R. 73, the America RISING Act of 2015, which stands \nfor Realizing the Informational Skills and Initiative of New Graduates, \nestablishing a grant program for stipends to assist in the cost of \ncompensation paid by employers to certain recent college graduates and \nprovide funding for their further education in subjects relating to \nmathematics, science, engineering, and technology.\n  What I want to say this evening is that this is a movement that \nshould continue. I am very delighted that America recognizes that \nmanufacturing is an economic engine.\n  I want to make mention of the Houston Community College, that I have \nhad a meeting with over the last week, to particularly focus on a new \nfacility that we hope will be finalized that will have automotive \ntechnology at the highest level and manufacturing as part of its \ntraining.\n  This is to help not only recent graduates or individuals in what we \ncall early college, but it is to help adults to be retrained for \nimportant elements that will manufacture, something I want to see \nincreased in Houston, and as well will have us at the highest levels of \ntechnology.\n  It is no longer the auto mechanic; it is the automotive engineer, the \nperson who knows how to deal with sophisticated electric cars, solar-\ndriven cars, and others that make a difference in our lives.\n  I want to thank the gentleman for having this very special Special \nOrder, as he has done over the years and months, and to say that we are \ncommitted to passing legislation, building infrastructure, increasing \nour education and research, and particularly providing a new generation \nan opportunity for creating jobs and putting America, as it has been in \nthe past, at the top in production; manufacturing; research; and, \ncertainly, technology.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Thank you Congressman Garamendi for anchoring this Special Order and \nyielding me time to share with our colleagues legislation I have \nintroduced that comports with the principles underlying our Make It In \nAmerica agenda.\n  Our Make it in America plan sets forth four central guiding posts: 1. \nWe must adopt and pursue a well-developed national manufacturing \nstrategy that begins right here in America. 2. We must promote the \nexport of our manufacturing goods so that businesses can compete \ndomestically and internationally. 3. We must also encourage businesses \nabroad to bring jobs and innovation back to the United States. 4. \nLastly, and most importantly, we must train and educate a workforce \nthat will secure the sustainability of this plan.\n  As we continue this critical work of identifying and advancing \neffective policy change for our communities and collectively throughout \nthe nation, it is important that we acknowledge the great progress we \nhave made.\n  I supported the 16 Make It In America bills that have been signed \ninto law by our President.\n  Additionally, as highlighted by the Wall Street Journal earlier this \nyear, 2014 marked the best year for job growth in 15 years, with \nemployers adding 2.95 million jobs and the unemployment rate falling to \na post-recession low of 5.6%.\n  For the first time since the recession ended, payrolls are expected \nto grow in all of America's cities and employers throughout the U.S. \nare expected to add another 2.65 million jobs this year.\n  Houston is ranked as a top city for STEM occupations, jobs requiring \na degree in science, technology, engineering and math related subjects.\n  Known as the ``Energy Capital of the World'', Houston has core \nstrengths in the energy sector, import/export trade activity, medical \nadvancements and a diverse population that supports innovative growth.\n  However, Houston and other cities across the nation remain at risk of \nstalemating any progress we have made or are projected to make if we do \ncontinue to open up our job market and expand opportunities in all \ncities across the nation.\n  As we look to the pillars and priorities of our plan, which aims to \nensure that these jobs are permanent and sustainable throughout all \nsectors and populations of America, it is important to keep sight of \nthe nearly 100 additional bills my colleagues and I have introduced \ncalling for strategic action and fair enhancement of our economy as we \ncontinue to experience this growth.\n  American businesses can only remain competitive when they have the \ntrained and educated workers they need.\n  This is why I have introduced legislation that will help strengthen \nour education and skills-training programs to make sure our workers are \ngetting the preparation and certifications they need while also \nproviding an opportunity to find and retain work once trained with \nthose high-demand skills.\n  H.R. 73, the ``America RISING Act of 2015'' which stands for \nRealizing the Informational Skills and Initiative of New Graduates, \nestablishes a grant program for stipends to assist in the cost of \ncompensation paid by employers to certain recent college graduates and \nprovides funding for their further education in subjects relating to \nmathematics, science, engineering, and technology.\n\n\n ABOUT H.R. 73, THE ``AMERICA RISING ACT OF 2015'' AND THE PROBLEM IT \n                               ADDRESSES\n\n  According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, in 2012 the national \nunemployment rate for persons with a bachelor's degree was 4.5% and \n6.2% for those persons with associate's degrees among college graduates \naged 25\n\n[[Page H5163]]\n\nyears and older. For college graduates aged 18-25 these percentages \nwere higher at 7.7%.\n  Because the typical college graduate leaves college owing an average \nof $29,400, in student loan debt, a rate that has increased 6% every \nyear since 2008, the current job market offers exceedingly few \nopportunities for them to obtain employment at a salary adequate to \nservice their college loan debt.\n  There are more than 26 million small businesses in the United States, \nof these more than 4 million are owned and operated by members of \neconomically and socially disadvantaged groups.\n  In the current economic climate, small businesses are experiencing \ndifficulty in finding the resources needed to increase sales, modernize \noperations, and hire new employees.\n  Recent college graduates need the experience that can be obtained \nonly in the workplace to refine their skills and lay the groundwork for \nproductive careers.\n  Small and disadvantaged businesses need the technologically based \nproblem-solving skills possessed by recent college graduates, \nparticularly those with training in the areas of science, technology, \nengineering, and mathematics.\n  Enabling recent graduates to obtain employment with small business \nand companies operating in economically distressed areas benefits the \nnational economy by granting graduates deferred payments on their \nstudent loans with frozen interest rates while they gain essential \nbusiness management experience that they can put into practice \nthroughout their careers, while at the same time providing businesses \nthe human capital and technical expertise needed to compete and win in \nthe global economy of the 21st century.\n  The key elements of the program would be that the federal government \nwould provide relief to a corps of recent college graduates in order \nfor them to be deployed to assist struggling small and minority \nbusinesses in located in disadvantaged or economically depressed areas.\n  These are the types of business that are most in need of the \ntechnical and knowledge based skills possessed by recent college \ngraduates but least able to afford them.\n  The benefit to participants is three-fold: 1. The federal government \nwould provide relief from the piling interest rates of graduates' \nstudent loans by instating a freeze on their payments for two years \nwhile graduates who have not obtained a STEM degree are able to pursue \na second training course or certification program in the STEM fields \nwith eligibility for federal financial assistance. 2. Those graduates, \nwho would have completed a degree in the STEM fields within the past 24 \nmonths, will be eligible to receive deferment of the cost of previous \nschool balances by obtaining two years of additional education in the \nSTEM fields as well as federal financial aid to complete the training. \n3. The program participants will gain valuable experience applying the \nknowledge learned in college to the workplace after graduation or \nduring their re-training.\n  In the long run the best way to guarantee America's future economic \nprosperity is to develop and grow an entrepreneurial class of Americans \nthat is broadly represented among all demographic groups.\n  It is not enough to provide jobs that can be performed by the \nmillions of low-skilled workers who need employment now.\n  In a global economy, any such job provided cannot be protected over \nthe long haul and cannot be made lucrative enough to sustain a middle \nclass standard of living.\n  Therefore, it is critical that there exist job training and \nretraining programs to enable workers to upgrade existing skills and to \nlearn new ones.\n  I invite all my colleagues to join me in co-sponsoring H.R. 73, the \n``America RISING Act of 2015,'' which will help create the next \ngeneration of entrepreneurs and businesses that will provide good-\npaying middle-class jobs for America.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you very much, Ms. Jackson Lee. I really \nappreciate it.\n  As we talk about each of these things, you are talking labor and \neducation and the way they come together and, in doing so, increasing \nthe productivity and the ability of an American worker to get a job in \nthe new manufacturing world in which we are living.\n  These things do come together, all of these pieces of the puzzle, 34 \nMembers of the Caucus, over 100 pieces of legislation in all of these \nareas.\n  Joining us, Mr. Norcross, thank you very much for joining us today. \nYou were, I think, introduced very nicely by the minority whip. \nWelcome.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Norcross).\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Thank you. Certainly, we appreciate what you are doing \nhere today, and that is highlighting what is going on in America. In \nsouth Jersey, where I am from, born and raised, a half century ago, we \nknew what it was like to Make It In America.\n  I live in the Victor building, where the Victrolas used to be made. \nWe are not making Victrolas anymore. The Victrola turned into RCA and \nthen went on from there. My father's first job was in the building I \nnow live, which means they are not manufacturing Victrolas there \nanymore.\n  During the heyday, we built ships at New York shipyard. In fact, New \nYork shipyard was where the very first nuclear-powered merchant ship \nwas made.\n  Campbell Soup, who is still in our city, made soups, which now are \nknown around the world.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  But we look back over the last half century and see how things have \nchanged. Many of those jobs have moved out because of bad trade deals. \nI had many, many empty warehouses and manufacturing plants where once \nthousands of people worked.\n  But we are on the rise again. And I just want to highlight a couple \nof items that are going to help us make it in America again.\n  We have a startup company by Dr. Singh, who was educated at the \nUniversity of Pennsylvania, and he is now going to make SMR, small \nmodular reactors, unconditionally safe, clean, carbon-free.\n  He was looking for a place to make them. And he literally could have \ngone anywhere in the world, where many of his products currently go. He \nis coming to Camden, New Jersey, here in America.\n  Why? Because of the educational system. Because those men and women \nthat are going to be trained there are here in America and understand \nthat.\n  Because we know in education not one size fits all. Most parents--and \nyou hear it day in and day out, that they want to send their children \nto college. Well, the fact of the matter is not everybody wants or \nneeds to go to college.\n  We have those who are serving in the military, those in our trade \nprograms. And we take a look at those trade programs, they are the \nbackbone of what is going to be happening in the next generation of \nmaking it in America.\n  Because Dr. Singh is going to start out with 400 new employees and go \nto 1,000 after a few years, creating these new SMRs, which is high \ntech, but very labor intensive, whether it is arc welding, \nelectricians, carpenters.\n  And they all have to have an education. Not all of them have to go to \ncollege. Those who are going to engineer this obviously do.\n  But working with your hands is a noble trade. I like to tell people, \nas I started out as an electrician, that I am still an electrician. I \njust wear a tie.\n  But that adult learning and having a flexible way to learn, whether--\nwe heard a few moments ago about the community college system, which I \nfirmly believe is the most affordable quality education that somebody \nleaving high school can go to.\n  You know, not everybody understands when they get out of high school \nwhere they want to go. But having that educational system, whether it \nis through the community college or through an apprenticeship program, \nis the way you can make it in America.\n  Now, when we take a look back over the last 50 years, we have had our \nups and downs in America, but we always know the best social program is \na job.\n  When you have a job, many of those other issues that you are facing \nwhen you are unemployed tend to go away. And when you have that job, \nyou can make it in America.\n  I would like to thank my colleague from California for having us down \nhere today and talking about this very important issue. Making it in \nAmerica is about having a job. And when we stay focused on that here in \nCongress, America will win.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank you very much, Mr. Norcross. I knew that you \nhad come out of a family that was in the building trades. You are an \nelectrician, and you are also a Member of Congress.\n  So you are bringing something very valuable, and that is hands-on \nexperience in the working world, where the middle class has seen their \npart of the American economy stall out, not able to climb ahead.\n  But over the last 20 years, we have seen this American middle class \nbasically just barely able to hold its\n\n[[Page H5164]]\n\nground. And one of the reasons is the enormous decline in the \nmanufacturing industry in this Nation and, also, that this Nation has \nnot been keeping up with the needs of infrastructure.\n  So as we look at the Make It In America agenda, yes, education is \nabsolutely important so that the workers of today and tomorrow are \nprepared for the kind of jobs that are out there.\n  Electricians--I am sure you can speak to this--when you started in \nthe business, it was one kind of skill set and, as you proceeded, you \nhave found a need for additional.\n  Would you like to talk about how that works and the way it might \nintegrate with the small modular reactors?\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Certainly. And I appreciate you yielding.\n  When we look at the educational system, apprenticeship programs have \nbeen around since the beginning of time, whether it was the shoemaker \nor the carpenter.\n  When I started out, it was a 4-year apprenticeship program. Today it \nis up to 5 years plus, depending on what specialty area you would like \nto focus on.\n  But those are the jobs that, when you are working, you are going to \nschool, you are paying your taxes. When you are not working, you are \nnot paying your taxes, and the system is a drag. You can't find a \nbetter life.\n  So when I say the best social program is a job, it is good for \nAmerica. It pays the taxes. That means you are going to afford to send \nyour kids to college if they want to go to college.\n  I have three children. Two of them wanted to go to college. One \nwanted to become an electrician. They each value what they do so much, \nand they are proud of what they do.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Perhaps it was your testimony at the hearing that the \ngentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer) put together, and they were talking \nabout job training programs.\n  And I believe one witness, maybe you, said that the largest technical \ntraining program in the Nation are the apprenticeship programs that the \nunions run.\n  So the electricians union, IEBW, their apprenticeship program, the \nplumbers union and steelworkers and so forth each have an \napprenticeship training program. And, when taken together, it is the \nsingle largest job training program in the Nation.\n  You said you spent some time at that?\n  Mr. NORCROSS. Well, it is interesting you are bringing that up. There \nare 15 different craft unions. And the fact of the matter is sometimes \nwe can't see the forest for the trees.\n  They are the largest training--$1.9 billion a year, privately funded, \nnot through any government funds--through the apprenticeship training \nprogram of those 15 different craft unions.\n  It is so important because it is in place. That means that, when they \nare working, they are putting that next generation of people to work.\n  We need people to be in the STEMs, the engineers. But these \napprenticeship programs, over 900 sites around the country, are \ntraining carpenters, plumbers, cement masons, laborers each and every \nday, and they have been doing it.\n  The way we can help them make it in America is to start the \ninfrastructure up so that they can start that next generation of folks \nbecause an apprenticeship program only works when the journeyman is \nteaching the apprentice.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. In terms of public policy, we have passed a new piece \nof legislation, the Education and Workforce Innovation Act, last year.\n  And it seems to me that that piece of legislation, which provides \nFederal assistance for various kinds of workforce preparation, \neducation, and other activities, to the extent that that can be brought \ninto and connected with the apprenticeship programs that those labor \nunions that you just described are running out there, we might see even \na more robust program within these. And these are employer and union, \nboth of them participating in the apprenticeship programs.\n\n  Mr. NORCROSS. It is interesting you brought that up.\n  Today I spoke in front of the Building & Construction Trades Council. \nThey have a program called Helmets to Hardhats, which is taking those \nveterans who are returning home and looking for an opportunity.\n  And those opportunities aren't always there, but those building \ntrades in New Jersey alone over the last 4 years have taken 500 \nveterans into their apprenticeship programs.\n  So it is taking an existing program, giving not a handout, but just \nan opportunity to those vets. And they are some of the best apprentices \nthat we have ever had, and it works extremely well.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. We had a job fair out in California 2 weeks ago, and I \nwas talking to some of the folks that were looking for a job.\n  Many of them had gone to the community college, taken a \npreapprenticeship training program so that they would be prepared and \nhave the necessary education to go into the apprenticeship program.\n  That is a very, very important part of the Make It In America agenda: \neducation coupled with labor. It is a very, very powerful piece of \nthis.\n  Thank you so very much for participating today.\n  Closing comment?\n  Mr. NORCROSS. You bring up a good point.\n  The one issue, the preapprentice program is giving an opportunity to \nthose who might not normally look into it: Women, minorities, and those \nwho haven't been exposed to the trades. And I think that is a great \npoint.\n  Do you want to be out there when it is in the middle of the summer? \nDo you want to be out there in the cold? So the preapprentice program \nexposes them to all the different crafts to see if this is what they \nwant to do. It is a great opportunity to make it in America.\n  I thank you for the time.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Well, I am going to pass this discussion on to a lady \nwho knows a lot of manufacturing.\n  I now yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of Ohio (Ms. \nKaptur), the heart of the manufacturing center in the United States.\n  Thank you so very much for joining us this afternoon.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I want to thank you, Congressman Garamendi, for your \ncontinuing leadership on jobs in America and Make It In America.\n  It is a pleasure to join also with Congressmen Norcross and Sherman, \nwho are here tonight after hours as we attempt to bring the cause of \nthe American people here to our Nation's Capitol.\n  I want to thank you for the logo of ``Make It In America.'' We in the \nMidwest would also say ``make it and grow it in America'' because \nagriculture is a major underpinning of Ohio as well, and I know it is \nof California.\n  I want to begin my remarks tonight by saying that the American \neconomy, in a way, is upside down. We have seen two-thirds of the \nmanufacturing jobs in America eliminated over the last three decades, \nand it isn't just because of technology.\n  It is because those jobs have been outsourced to third-world \nenvironments, where people work for penny wage jobs, and their \nlivelihoods don't really increase. They aren't bettering themselves. \nThey are basically not starving. They certainly don't live a middle \nclass way of life.\n  But two-thirds of the manufacturing jobs, gone in America. And at the \nsame time, we see the financial sector growing in power. Six banks \nheadquartered on Wall Street mainly controlling the investment that \noccurs that allows the outsourcing, the very same characters that \nbrought this economy down and hurt the world through the development of \nderivatives.\n  It has been interesting to read about the Greek financial crisis and \nto see that Goldman Sachs is right in there again, creating a \nderivative instrument that can't hold water. So the inner tube is just \nleaking all over the place.\n  It is important for the American people to see that manufacturing \njobs have gone down. We have lost two-thirds of them. And the financial \nsector, meanwhile, has gained power, the very same characters that are \noutsourcing these jobs.\n  Because who has the money to invest in third-world environments? It \nsure isn't the community banks that I represent.\n  Let me point out that, over the last 30 years, we haven't had a \nsingle year where the United States was able to send more out--export \ngoods--than import from other places.\n  So we have been upside down as an economy now for going on 30 years.\n\n[[Page H5165]]\n\nAnd from my region, that means the average family has had their income \ngo down, their net effective buying power, $7,000 as the middle class \nhemorrhages.\n  Let's look at the numbers. We have had over $10 trillion of trade \ndeficit since the mid-1970s, when the first free trade agreement was \nsigned. That $10 trillion probably translates into a loss of over 40 \nmillion jobs over that period of time.\n  We are growing now sluggishly, sluggishly, because the ``make it'' \nand ``grow it'' parts of America have been very, very trimmed back.\n  If you lose two-thirds of your manufacturing jobs, you have growing \npoverty and you have sinking wages and sinking buying power across our \ncountry.\n  Now, there is a book. I recommend it to everybody. ``American \nTheocracy'' by Kevin Phillips. In chapter 8, he talks about the \nfinancialization of the U.S. economy: loss of manufacturing jobs, \nincrease of jobs in the financial sector, high rewards for the people \nthat sit at the top, but for everybody else, sinking wages and a \nshrinking middle class.\n  The derivative instruments that hurt our country and the \ncollateralized debt obligations that threw us into a spin back in 2008, \nthose weren't invented by people in Toledo, and I doubt they were \ninvented by people in Cleveland or central California. They were \ninvented by money-changers.\n  And they had figured out how to trade away American jobs, make huge, \nhuge profits for their shareholders at the expense of the rest of the \nAmerican people, the 99 percent.\n  On agriculture, I want to say that what has happened over the same \nperiod of time--because we have a vast underpinning of agriculture in \nthis country. But even with it, 15 percent of our food is now imported. \nIt used to be about 3 percent.\n  Start looking at the shelves and you are going: Oh, what did we trade \naway for that or that or that? And certainly, in pharmaceuticals, we \nhave traded away most of those jobs someplace else.\n  And isn't it interesting that the cost of pharmaceuticals hasn't gone \ndown, as we have just seen an avalanche of drugs coming in here, \nwhether they be generic or brand-name.\n  There are people who are financing this outsourcing, and they are \nsitting fat and happy in the major financial center of our country.\n  I can go through my region. I can look at companies like Dixon \nTiconderoga. It didn't close its doors in Sandusky, Ohio, because it \ncouldn't make its crayons and school supplies anymore. It was moved to \nMexico, where it sits near Mexico City. It moved from Sandusky, Ohio, \ndown there.\n  Delphi moved from the same general area, Port Clinton, Ohio. Ford \nFocus just last week announced 4,000 jobs out of suburban Detroit down \nto Mexico. Champion Spark Plug in Toledo, closed. Acklin Stamping in \nToledo, closed. Dura, Dana, Chase Bag, Textile Leather, the list goes \non and on. Ford's Maumee Stamping, there couldn't be a better Ford \nstamping plant in America than the one in Maumee--doors shut, jobs \ngone.\n  Two-thirds. That is just one part of America. Two-thirds of the \nmanufacturing jobs of this country, lost.\n  Our economy is lopsided. It is benefiting a few. We are seeding the \nfield, and that is why the American people feel the pinch.\n  I just wanted to make one other important point where the gentleman \nreferences research and innovation. There will be a patent bill coming \nup here very soon which I hope people will vote against because it will \nfurther dampen the ability of individual inventors and those working in \nour universities inventing the new products of the future and will \nreward only the big companies.\n  And I say to my colleagues, if you haven't decided how to vote on \nH.R. 9, I hope you will vote ``no'' on what is being called the \nInnovation Act because what it is, it is a transfer of more power to \nthe biggest global corporations to say to their patents: Full steam \nahead.\n  But if you are an individual out there in America or you are a person \nwho doesn't have a whole legal team of lawyers who are being paid at \nyour behest, you don't have a chance. You won't have a chance with H.R. \n9.\n  We have a bill, H.R. 2045, that I hope people will look at as an \nalternative. It is supported by all of the research universities, small \ninventors across our country, who can't afford any longer to put their \ninvention out there because they don't have the legal or financial \ncapacity to defend it.\n  There is something really insidious about what is going on with our \npatent system and will make it so much harder.\n  And I give as proof, I read in our local newspaper the other day--\nthey listed all the patents that had been approved this year over the \nfirst half of the year from my part of the country. There wasn't a \nsingle individual patent approved. Every single patent that was \napproved belonged to a company that had already been successful.\n  There wasn't even a university patent approved. I thought: Oh, my \ngoodness. This is really not going to support innovation. This only \nsupports the very same big-pocketed folks who already hold all the \npower in this society and have far too much sway in this Congress.\n  So I thank the gentleman for allowing me to add my two cents to the \ndiscussion this evening and to say the American people deserve a better \ndeal than this.\n  I hope that Members will look at our Glass-Steagall Act as well. That \nis my bill, Elizabeth Warren's bill over in the other body, to break up \nthe big banks and to have more democratic activity among the financial \ninstitutions of this country and not just lodging over two-thirds of \nthe power in the big six.\n  It is really warping our society, and it is making it much less \nrepresentative. It is harming manufacturing. It is harming agriculture. \nIt is harming innovation.\n  Thank you, Congressman Garamendi, for the phenomenal work that you do \nin allowing all of us whose districts have been so impacted to add to \nthe American fabric and represent all of America, not just the \nwealthiest part of it.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Ms. Kaptur, thank you so very much for bringing us the \nmessage from America's heartland. And, by the way, agriculture is also \na manufacturing industry. The farmer grows, but then the food \nprocessors are manufacturing that and bringing added value and a major \npart.\n  You are quite correct about the escape of capital, using tax policy \nand trade policy to encourage American companies to take their capital \nand build overseas, leaving American workers behind.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio.\n  Ms. KAPTUR. I just want to place on the record that our Glass-\nSteagall bill to essentially break up the big banks and take the \ninvestment side of the operation away from the prudent banking portion \nof it is H.R. 381.\n  We have over 60 cosponsors of our bill here in the House, and I am \nhoping, as the American people hear our message tonight, they will \nencourage their Members of Congress to sponsor our Glass-Steagall \nRestoration Act, H.R. 381.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Ms. Kaptur, thank you so very, very much. You talked \nabout things that are extremely important along the way: the trade \npolicy, our tax policy, the escape of American capital, leaving \nAmerican workers behind, economic theory, and capital and labor \nresources. If one of those leaves--in this case, capital--then the \nAmerican worker is left behind.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Make It In America agenda is all about rebuilding \nthe foundation of America's economic growth. We can do that in several \nways. I am going to wrap up with a very quick rendition of several \npolicy opportunities that present themselves to us.\n  First of all, at the bottom of that list--not because it is at the \nbottom, but because it is just there--is the issue of infrastructure. \nWe are faced with a huge challenge, one that, unfortunately, I am \nafraid the Congress will, once again, duck the challenge of creating a \nrobust program to revitalize the American infrastructure.\n  Infrastructure is the foundation. It is the sanitation, the water \nsystems; it is\n\n[[Page H5166]]\n\nthe roads, the airports; it is the rivers, the ports, and \ntransportation system.\n  The President has introduced, in the last Congress, the GROW AMERICA \nAct. We now call it the GROW AMERICA Act 2. Unfortunately, this week, \ntomorrow, our majority, our Republican colleagues, are failing to \naddress this issue.\n  Instead, they are going back to a childhood game called kick the \ncan--in this case, kick the can down the road for another 6 months \ninstead of putting in place a long-term, 5- or 6-year transportation \nprogram that can accomplish all of these things--the rail, the buses, \nthe ports, the bridges, the highways, the sanitation systems, and the \ncommunications systems. The leadership in the House on the Republican \nside is simply missing the fundamental necessity of infrastructure.\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, this goes back to the Founding Fathers. \nGeorge Washington asked Alexander Hamilton to develop an economic plan. \nHe came back with one called manufacturers; in that was an \ninfrastructure. Alexander Hamilton, the first Secretary of the \nTreasury, said that we must build the roads--postal roads at that \ntime--we must build the canals, and we must build the ports if we are \ngoing to have a strong economy. The infrastructure is critically \nimportant to the Make It In America agenda.\n  Another one, Mr. Speaker, is using our tax dollars to build the \nAmerican economy to make it in America. This is a story of two bridges. \nVery, very quickly, one bridge on the West Coast, this is called the \nSan Francisco-Oakland Bay Bridge, a multibillion dollar project, the \nother one on the East Coast, and this is on the Hudson River in New \nYork City, the Tappan Zee Bridge.\n  The San Francisco Bay Bridge, in a fit of what I call stupidity, the \nState of California decided that they would seek Chinese steel because \nit was supposed to be 10 percent cheaper to build the bridge. Well, the \nresult was 6,000 jobs were in China, a brand-new steel mill, the most \nhigh-tech steel mill in the world--and, for America, taken to the \ncleaners.\n  It was a significant overrun of multimillions of dollars, a delay of \nyears and years, steel that was shoddy, welds that were shoddy, and a \nlesson for America: spend our tax money on American-made equipment and \nsupplies. Buy American steel. Those 6,000 jobs could have been in \nAmerica. That steel mill could have been in America, and the shoddy \nwork would not have occurred.\n  New York decided to buy American steel. So what happens--on time and \nunder budget and 7,728 American jobs were created. It is the story of \ntwo coasts: California, stupid policy; New York, wise policy. Spend the \nAmerican taxpayer dollars on American-made goods and equipment.\n\n  One final thing, Mr. Speaker, and then I am going to return this over \nto the speaker. I don't know if you can see that, but that is a \nliquefied natural gas tanker. America later this year will begin to \nexport natural gas in the form of LNG, liquefied natural gas. This is a \nbig deal and a big potential for the gas industry.\n  They are going to make a lot of money because the cost of natural gas \naround the world is maybe twice to three times what the price would be \nin the United States, so the gas companies are all for shipping gas \noverseas. We need to be careful about this because, if we ship too much \noverseas, then we are going to raise the price.\n  The Cheniere facility in the Gulf Coast will take 100 tankers, and I \nhave legislation that says, if we are going to ship a strategic \nnational asset overseas, then we ought to take care of the rest of the \nnational security.\n  Shipbuilding is absolutely essential. American mariners, captains, \nand seamen and -women are absolutely essential for the American defense \nand security. Make it in America, ship it on American-built tankers--we \nare talking about tens of thousands, indeed, over 100,000 jobs and a \nsupply chain for jobs all across the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have got just a few minutes, and I notice that my \ncolleague from New York is here. The East-West show is back in force.\n  Mr. Tonko, thank you for coming in so quietly. I didn't see you on my \nleft side. Please join us, and let's talk about Make It In America.\n  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Garamendi. It is always a \npleasure to join you on the House floor to speak to any issue, but in \nthis case, to Make It In America.\n  I am certain through the hour you have talked about the capital and \nphysical infrastructure demands, but we also have to highlight the \nhuman infrastructure portion of the equation that will resound in the \ngreatest success for the Make It In America agenda, and that is \ntraining the skilled talent that we need.\n  We need to promote the development and the advancement of \nmanufacturing--advanced manufacturing, as it has been coined of late--\nbut also to understand that it is an innovation economy, and so that \nmeans dealing with issues in production with great precision.\n  That great precision requires extremely gifted skill sets and \neducation, apprentice programs in higher ed, making certain we have a \ngrowing force of engineers, where we are woefully underproducing the \namount of engineers we require.\n  There are bits of legislation that all of us have cosponsored, that \nperhaps we are leading as sponsor, that will encourage the development \nengineers that we require for our being able to be a great \nmanufacturing nation as we move forward.\n  Those are important elements, making certain that we have the \nprecision instrumentation that will enable us to, again, compete \nbecause it is not the cheapest investment, but the wisest investment \nthat is made.\n  It is not going to be significant by the dollar only, but what is the \nbest product, what is the most thoughtful product that is developed for \nwhatever needs society may have. The engineering components of all of \nthis is very important, and the skill set component is very important.\n  As we go forward, we want to make certain that that human \ninfrastructure is geared up and ready to go with cutting-edge skill \nsets that speak to today's economy. That is very important.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have always prided ourselves on a strong workforce, a \nwell-trained, well-educated, and well-equipped force that goes out \nthere and enables us to compete and compete effectively in a global \nrace on innovation. That has grown significant over the last decade.\n  We see more and more investment coming in, that human infrastructure \nfrom nations around the world that will then be competing with this \nNation to be able to export its goods, so a full complement of programs \nthat are essential in policy format and resource advocacy and investing \nin that Make It In America agenda, investment here where there are \nrightful anticipations of lucrative returns on the taxpayer dollars \nthat are invested.\n  I thank you for the laser sharp focus you put on to Make It In \nAmerica as an agenda and the underscoring of importance that you have \ndrawn to manufacturing as a sector. It was walked away from by previous \nadministrations.\n  This administration, the Obama administration, has talked about sound \ninvestment in advance manufacturing will enable us to stop bleeding the \nloss of manufacturing jobs where we are losing, at one point, one out \nof four.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  We are still perched pretty high in terms of manufacturing jobs, but \nwe have to stop that bleeding, and the way we do it is by turning it \naround with policy and resource advocacy. And I thank you again for \nyour leadership in this regard.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, thank you. I know that your previous work \nbefore you came to Congress several years ago was in the State of New \nYork working on the innovation economy. You certainly have ramped up \ninnovation economy in the State of New York, and now you are bringing \nthat experience here with legislation.\n  The Make It In America agenda, I am going to put it back up very, \nvery quickly here because you talked about this. The Make It in America \nagenda is about the middle class; it is about rebuilding the middle \nclass.\n  Thirty-four members of the Democratic Caucus talked last week about \ntheir legislation dealing with trade and taxes, energy, labor, \neducation, research, and infrastructure, about how that constellation \nof issues comes together to boost the American middle\n\n[[Page H5167]]\n\nclass, to give every American an opportunity for that middle class job. \nSo it is there.\n  I see we are about to be out of time, or maybe we are already out of \ntime, so I am going to say I want to thank my colleagues and Mr. Hoyer \nfor leading us in this.\n  Mr. Tonko, you have got 30 seconds to close.\n  Mr. TONKO. Well, I just say, let's move forward with investment. It \nhappens when we have a laser sharp focus on just where to apply our \nresources to capital, physical, and human infrastructure, so as to be \nthe strongest competitor out there in a global race for kingpin of the \ninnovation economy, and whoever wins that race, becomes the go-to agent \nfor the worldwide economy. So we can't afford to hesitate or fail in \nour attempt here.\n  Thank you, again, for leading us.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Thank you, Mr. Tonko.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5167-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5167-H5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           IRAN NUCLEAR DEAL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Sherman) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to begin by praising Mr. \nGaramendi, the gentleman from California, for this excellent \npresentation on why we should make it in America.\n  But I am here today to talk about something that was made in Vienna, \nnamely, the Iran nuclear deal. I am going to start with a few \nobservations and then get to the heart of my remarks.\n  The first observation is that we ought to set the record straight. \nThe sanctions that brought Iran to the table were imposed by Congress \nover the objection of the executive branch of government.\n  For 30 years, Congress had it right, and for 30 years, the executive \nbranch had it wrong. For 30 years, every time we passed sanctions acts, \nthey would be argued against and thwarted and watered down due to the \nefforts of several administrations.\n  The only time Congress got it wrong is when the House of \nRepresentatives got it right and passed tough sanctions legislation \nthat went over to the Senate where, unfortunately, some in the senior \nbody listened to the administrations at the time and failed to pass our \nlegislation.\n  The second observation I would like to make is that the deal in \nVienna lifts a number of sanctions which were not imposed as a result \nof Iran's nuclear activity. It provides greater sanctions relief than \nthat which was supposed to be provided.\n  I, in particular, note that the arms embargo against Iran, an Iran \nthat has created so much mischief in Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere, will \nbe phased out and the Iran Sanctions Act will be waived. The Iran \nSanctions Act was passed by the Congress in the early 1990s.\n  A review of that bill indicates that only one of three reasons it was \npassed was Iran's work with WMDs. And, of course, weapons of mass \ndestruction come in three forms, not only the nuclear, but also the \nchemical and the biological. So I would reckon that only one-ninth of \nthe reason Congress passed that bill was Iran's nuclear program, and \nyet those sanctions are being waived.\n  And finally, we see that the sanctions relief is so complete that not \nonly are we waiving our secondary sanctions and allowing Iran to do \nbusiness with the rest of the world, we are even allowing Iran to \nexport to the United States. We won't buy their oil, but we will buy \nthe things that we don't need and they couldn't sell anywhere else.\n  The next observation I would like to make is that there are those who \nsay this deal may only work for about 10 years, but the Iranian \nGovernment will get better over the next 10 years. Do not hold your \nbreath. The whole purpose of sanctions is to put pressure on the \ngovernment, which either causes it to change its policy or creates a \nchange in regime. That is what you do when you are trying to force a \nchange in government.\n  Showering this government with economic benefits is not going to lead \nto its destruction or its eclipse. Look at Tehran. What you see is what \nyou get.\n  Another observation is about missiles. It is unfortunate that this \ndeal will allow Iran, in 8 years, to get more missile technology. There \nis only one reason for them to be working on intercontinental ballistic \nmissiles, and that is to deliver a nuclear payload to a different \ncontinent than their own--namely, ours; namely, Europe. There is no \nother reason. Iran is not trying to fly to the Moon. They are trying to \nget a nuclear device to North America or Europe.\n  But let us not be sanguine one way or the other about missiles. A \nnuclear weapon--they vary in size, but they are about the size of a \nperson, and you can smuggle one into the United States inside a bale of \nmarijuana.\n  So while we should be doing everything possible to stop Iran's \nmissile program, the heart of our effort has got to be to stop their \nnuclear weapons program. The heart of my speech is to focus on the deal \nfrom a nuclear weapons perspective.\n  Now, the political pundits outside this Capitol are all trying to \nmake this an ``evaluate the President'': Are you for him or are you \nagainst him? Is this a good deal? Did the President do a good job?\n  Those questions may be relevant to those seeking ratings on this or \nthat cable television channel, but we in Congress have got to deal with \na completely different question: What should Congress do at this time \nunder these circumstances in the real world as it exists today where \nthe President has agreed to sign this deal, not as it existed 2 days \nago, not as it existed a decade ago when we should have been enforcing \nsanctions laws, but what should Congress do today?\n  Now, in order to reach that conclusion, we need to look at the \noverall deal and realize that it has different phases. It is a \ndifferent deal over time. So let us look at the deal from the good, the \nbad, and the ugly.\n  In the first year, the most important good parts occur. Iran must \nship 90 percent of its uranium stockpiles out of country and mothball \ntwo-thirds of the centrifuges. As we craft our policy, we should be \nloathe to give up those two advantages. We must, whenever we focus on \nanything, say, yes, there are some bad parts of this deal, but two-\nthirds of the centrifuges, 90 percent of the stockpiles, that is \nsomething we need to be focused on. So that is the good.\n  The bad also occurs in the first year. Iran will get its hands on \n$120 billion-plus of their own money that we have under the sanctions \nbeen able to freeze in various money centers around the world.\n  What will they use this $120 billion for? Part of it will go to help \ntheir own people because they have raised expectations. A good chunk of \nit will go to graft and corruption in the Iranian regime because it is, \nafter all, the Iranian regime. A large portion of that money will go to \nkill Sunni Muslims. Some of them deserve it, most do not. And what is \nleft over will be used to kill Americans and Israelis.\n  So there is bad in the first year and good in the first year.\n  But what is truly ugly occurs after 10 years. After year 10, Iran can \nhave an unlimited number of centrifuges of unlimited quality. As the \nPresident himself says, at that point, their breakout time, the amount \nof time from the day they kick out the inspectors to the day when they \nhave enough fissile material for a nuclear weapon, shrinks to virtually \nzero days for the first bomb, a few more days for the second bomb.\n  Why is this? Because after 10 years, Iran will be allowed to create a \nhuge industrial facility capable of supporting several electric \ngeneration nuclear plants. It is counterintuitive, but true, that it \ntakes an awful lot more enrichment to power a nuclear plant than to \ncreate a nuclear bomb. In effect, we will be in a situation where it is \nas if Iran has an industrial-sized giant bakery capable of feeding many \nof their cities, and all they need for a nuclear bomb is a bag full of \nbreadcrumbs. Obviously, once they go big, once they go industrial, once \nwe get to the ugly part of this deal, Iran is a nuclear power--perhaps \nnot an admitted nuclear power, but a nuclear power nevertheless.\n\n[[Page H5168]]\n\n  So we are faced with the good, the bad, and the ugly. But the \nquestion is: What should Congress do?\n  One choice before us, and it is, I hope, the choice we will take, is \nto consider a resolution of approval of this deal and to vote it down \nby an overwhelming majority.\n  What will this do?\n  It will demonstrate for the world that the American people, the \nAmerican Congress, and future administrations are not morally or \nlegally bound by this agreement. It will set the stage for a subsequent \nadministration to demand that the limits on uranium centrifuges are \ncontinued well past year 10 of this agreement. So the current \nadministration will take advantage of the good, we will suffer the bad, \nbut in the future we will not have to deal with the ugly.\n  The second approach we can take is to consider a resolution of \ndisapproval. Unlike a resolution of approval, a resolution of \ndisapproval, if adopted, would have immediate legal effects under U.S. \nlaw. It would blow a hole in the deal. But as I will get to it, \npossibly the wrong hole and perhaps no hole at all. Because if we were \nto consider a resolution of disapproval, I think it would pass this \nHouse. I think it might get 60 votes in the other body. The President \nhas already announced he will veto it. And then, as far as I can tell, \nwe would not override the veto.\n  Now, this would have a similar legal effect to us voting down a \nresolution of approval. Overall, the majority of the House and the \nmajority of the Senate would have voted to disapprove. But that last \npicture will be a picture of the proponents of this agreement winning \nby not losing more than two-thirds of the vote. That conveys in the \nmost confused way the fact that this agreement will not be binding on \nfuture administrations and future Congresses.\n  There is, of course, the possibility that we somehow override a \nPresidential veto. That does not put us back where we were yesterday. \nThat does not reinstitute sanctions. That does not create a good \nplatform for creating a better deal, because by then many UN sanctions \nwill be lifted. Our trading partners in Europe will already be doing \nbusiness. The President will have told the world that Iran is acting \nreasonably and Congress is acting unreasonably.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Under such circumstance, Iran would get the lion's share of sanctions \nrelief. They would be denied some sanctions relief because U.S. law \nwould remain in effect.\n  But Iran would have every excuse not to deliver the important good \nparts of this deal, not to ship their uranium stockpiles out of the \ncountry, not to decommission two-thirds of their centrifuges.\n  So if we pass over a Presidential veto, a resolution of disapproval, \nwe have not blown up the deal and taken us back to where we had the \ndeal.\n  Rather, we have created a circumstance where Iran has literally split \nthe U.S. Government, with Congress pushing in one direction, the \nPresident pushing in another direction, and every nation in the world \ntaking its cue from the President.\n  Instead, I suggest that we would be in a stronger position if we \ndemonstrate to the world that Congress does not accept this agreement, \nit is not binding on the American people, the President may not be \nlegally constrained for the remainder of his term in implementing this \ndeal, getting us the good, suffering the bad, but knowing that the ugly \nis something that needs to be confronted by another administration.\n  It is another administration that needs to prevent Iran from claiming \nthat it will have the right to unlimited centrifuges 10 years from now \nbut, instead, demanding a renegotiation of this deal.\n  Finally, the sanctions relief promised in Vienna is relief only from \nthose sanctions due to Iran's nuclear program. It is not a get-out-of-\njail-free card. It is not a protection and a grant of authority to \nTehran to engage in all kinds of evil activity in the Middle East and \nelsewhere.\n  If Iran continues to support Assad, we need to impose additional \nsanctions for that reason. If they continue to destabilize Yemen, we \nneed to impose sanctions for that reason. And we cannot give Iran a \nfree pass just because they have entered into this particular deal. \nThis is not rapprochement with Iran.\n  This is a deal that has, in its first year, the good and the bad and, \nin its 10th year, is so ugly that we have to demand additional \nnegotiations.\n  When we make that demand, we need to make that demand in the voice of \na President in a future administration who is determined to say that \nIran can never have an unlimited number of centrifuges, Iran can never \nhave an unlimited quality of centrifuges, Iran can never be a few days \nfrom a nuclear weapon, and that, in order to prevent that, we have the \nlegal right to put all options on the table.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "14"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/07/14/house-section/article/H5168-1", "month": "07", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5168]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      SENATE ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  The Speaker announced his signature to an enrolled bill of the Senate \nof the following title:\n\n       S. 179.
