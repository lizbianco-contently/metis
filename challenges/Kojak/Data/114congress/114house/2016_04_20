The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Brooks) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BROOKS of Alabama. Mr. Speaker, America has blown through the $19 \ntrillion debt mark and rapidly approaches the $20 trillion debt mark.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office warns Washington that \nAmerica faces an unending string of trillion-dollar-a-year deficits \nbeginning a mere 6 years from now and that America's debt will blow \nthrough the $29 trillion debt mark in a decade. Further, as debt \nprincipal and interest rates surge, America's debt service costs will \nincrease by $600 billion a year within a decade.\n  For perspective, $600 billion is more than America spends on national \ndefense, which begs the question: Where will that $600 billion in \nadditional debt service cost come from?\n  America must learn from financially reckless nations like Greece and \nVenezuela, and from Puerto Rico, an American territory that has had its \ncredit rating cut to junk bond status and is defaulting on its $70 \nbillion in debt. For emphasis, Puerto Rico owes roughly 40 percent of \nall Puerto Rican tax collections, $4.1 billion, in debt payments this \nyear. That is tax revenues not building roads, not educating children, \nand not growing the economy.\n  Puerto Rico, like America, suffers from a bloated central government, \nwelfare programs that undermine the work ethic, decades of financial \nmismanagement by elected leaders, and a resulting anemic economy and \nshrinking job market that causes roughly 7,000 citizens to flee Puerto \nRico each month.\n  Only 40 percent of Puerto Ricans are employed or looking for work. \nWhy bother to get a job when American taxpayers pay Puerto Ricans to \nnot work by doling out free food, free health care, and other welfare \nworth $1,743 per month, almost $600 more than minimum wage take-home \nearnings?\n  Puerto Rico's debt defaults and resulting economic morass have forced \nPuerto Rico to delay tax refunds, fire public sector workers, raise \nsales taxes to a record 11.5 percent, and close over 100 schools.\n  Unfortunately, these austerity measures, and more, are inadequate \nbecause Puerto Rico's self-serving and financially irresponsible \nelected officials waited too long. Puerto Rico still cannot pay its \nbills or creditors.\n  Puerto Rico Governor Alejandro Padilla recently stated that, if \nCongress does not intervene, ``a humanitarian crisis will envelop the \n3.5 million American citizens on the island.''\n  Puerto Rico asks Congress to let Puerto Rico default on its legal \noperations via bankruptcy or force American taxpayers to bail out \nPuerto Rico's decades of financial mismanagement. Never mind that, \naccording to a 2010 Government Accountability Office report, mainland \nAmerican taxpayers already subsidize Puerto Rico to the tune of $16 \nbillion per year, or roughly $4,500 per Puerto Rican.\n  As Puerto Rico desperately seeks an American taxpayer bailout, \nAmericans should ask: Who will bail out America when America defaults \non its debt?\n  Mr. Speaker, America must learn from Puerto Rico, a territory that is \nspiraling into bankruptcy and insolvency because of a $20,000-per-\ncapita debt burden--a debt burden, I might add, that is three times \nbetter than America's $60,000-per-capita debt burden.\n  If America's creditors stop loaning America money, if America is \nforced to go cold turkey on its debt addiction, America could be forced \nto slash military pay or eliminate the volunteer Army altogether and go \nback to a draft, cut Social Security and Medicare benefits, and the \nlike.\n  Mr. Speaker, America's spending binge and accompanying debt and \ndeficits are unsustainable. If voters do not elect financially \nresponsible officials to Washington, America will endure the same \ndebilitating insolvency and bankruptcy that wreaks havoc in Greece and \nPuerto Rico--with one major difference. Unlike Greece, which has been \nbailed out three times by the European community, and unlike Puerto \nRico, which may yet be bailed out by American taxpayers, there is no \none--no one--who can or will bail out America.\n\n[[Page H1856]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1856-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1856]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                AN OPEN LETTER TO PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Speaker, an open letter to President Barack Obama.\n\n       Dear Mr. President:\n       In 2009, less than a year after assuming the Presidency, \n     you accepted the Nobel Peace Prize. You began your acceptance \n     of this honor by acknowledging that it was bestowed at the \n     ``beginning, and not the end of, my labors on the world \n     stage.''\n       You spoke on that day with eloquence and conviction about \n     fundamental human rights, rights that are endowed not by \n     accidents of birth like nationality or ethnicity or gender, \n     but by our common humanity. And the principles that you \n     articulated have indeed guided and defined your Presidency.\n       In your foreign policy, you have emphasized the rights of \n     ethnic and religious minorities worldwide and put these \n     causes closer to the center of our foreign policy. You have \n     extended aid to refugees fleeing horrific violence. You \n     established the Atrocities Prevention Board to coordinate and \n     monitor our efforts to prevent mass atrocities and genocide.\n       In a few days, you will have a chance to add to your \n     legacy. On April 24, the world will mark 101 years since the \n     systemic extermination of 1.5 million Armenians by the \n     Ottoman Empire, from 1915 to 1923. The facts of the slaughter \n     are beyond dispute, and I know that you are well-acquainted \n     with these horrors visited upon the Armenian people, having \n     spoken eloquently about them as a Senator.\n       I have sat with survivors of the genocide, men and women, \n     their numbers dwindling year after year, and heard them \n     recall the destruction of their lives and their families and \n     all they had known. As children, they were forced from their \n     homes and saw their family beaten, raped, and murdered. They \n     fled across continents and oceans to build lives in our \n     Nation.\n       Mr. President, for them and for their descendants, the word \n     ``genocide'' is sacred because it means that the world has \n     not and will not forget. To deny genocide, on the other hand, \n     is profane. It is, in the words of Elie Wiesel, a ``double \n     killing.''\n       This April 24 will be your final opportunity to use the \n     Presidency to speak plainly about the genocide. In past years \n     as President, you have described the campaign of murder and \n     displacement against the Armenian people as a ``mass \n     atrocity,'' which it surely was.\n       But, of course, it was also much more; and you have avoided \n     using the word ``genocide,'' even though it has been \n     universally applied by scholars and historians of the period. \n     In fact, as you know better than most, the Ottoman Empire's \n     campaign to annihilate the Armenian people was a prime \n     example of what Raphael Lemkin was trying to describe when he \n     coined the very term, ``genocide.''\n       I know that, as you consider your words this year, you will \n     hear the same voices as in the past who will tell you to hold \n     your tongue and speak in euphemisms. They will say that the \n     time is not right, or that Turkey is too strategically \n     important, or that we should not risk their ire over \n     something that happened a century ago. Mr. President, \n     regardless of what you say on April 24, there can be little \n     doubt that Turkey will do exactly as it has always done in \n     its relations with the United States, and that is whatever \n     Turkey believes to be in its self-interest.\n       Many of our European allies and world leaders, including \n     Pope Francis, have recognized the genocide, yet they have \n     continued to work closely with Turkey because that has been \n     in Turkey's interest. The same will be true after U.S. \n     recognition of the genocide.\n       I dearly hope, as do millions of Armenians descended from \n     genocide survivors around the world, that you take this final \n     opportunity to call the Armenian genocide what it was--\n     genocide; to say that the Ottoman Empire committed this \n     grotesque crime against the Armenians, but their campaign of \n     extermination failed; and that, above all, we will never \n     forget and we will never again be intimidated into silence. \n     Let this be part of your legacy, and you will see future \n     administrations follow your example.\n       When you spoke in Oslo more than 7 years ago, you closed \n     your remarks by returning to the counsel of Dr. Martin Luther \n     King and said: ``I refuse to accept the idea that the \n     `isness' of man's present condition makes him morally \n     incapable of reaching up for the eternal 'oughtness' that \n     forever confronts him.''\n       Mr. President, confronting painful, difficult but vital \n     questions ``is'' who you are. Help us be the America we \n     ``ought'' to be, that beacon of freedom and dignity that \n     shines its light on the darkness of human history and exposes \n     the vile crime of genocide.\n       Sincerely, Adam Schiff.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair and not to a perceived viewing audience.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1856-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1856-H1857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CELEBRATING SOUTH FLORIDA'S NATIONAL PARKS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to highlight south \nFlorida's wild and wonderful national parks--Biscayne, Dry Tortugas, \nand Everglades--during National Park Week and the National Park Service \nCentennial.\n  American Pulitzer Prize-winning writer and historian Wallace Stegner \nis quoted as having said that our national parks were ``the best idea \nwe have ever had. Absolutely American, absolutely democratic, they \nreflect us at our best rather than our worst.''\n  Indeed, south Florida is supremely fortunate to have Superintendent \nPedro Ramos in charge of Dry Tortugas and Everglades National Parks. \nSuperintendent Ramos understands and appreciates the importance of \npublic access, the importance of the public's experiences, and the \nimportance of continuing to reconnect the people of south Florida with \nthe natural lands and waters that surround and support our community.\n  Ultimately, enhancing public access and recreational opportunities in \nour national parks are vital to conserving America's natural and \ncultural heritage. That is why I am so troubled, Mr. Speaker, by the \nfishing access restrictions included in the 2015 general management \nplan of another iconic south Florida park, Biscayne National Park.\n  The plan's marine reserve zone imposes a permanent moratorium on \nfishing across 10,500 acres of State waters, including 30 percent of \nthe reef tract, denying fishing access to families and professional \nfishermen alike, without adequate scientific evidence to back it up.\n  My Preserving Public Access to Public Waters Act, which passed the \nHouse in February as part of the SHARE Act, and its newly introduced \nSenate counterpart, from Senators Bill Cassidy and Marco Rubio, would \nhelp ensure that Federal bureaucrats and special interest groups do not \noverrule local community needs and concerns in this way anymore.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  If our national parks are to remain absolutely American and \nabsolutely democratic, then it is long since time for the National Park \nService to consistently represent the Federal Government at its best \nrather than at its worst once again.\n  The Park Service's stated mission is to preserve ``unimpaired the \nnatural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System \nfor the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future \ngenerations by cooperating with partners to extend the benefits of \nnatural and cultural resources conservation and outdoor recreation \nthroughout the country and the world.''\n  Everglades National Park Superintendent Ramos has demonstrated that \nhe is a true ambassador for this lofty and worthy mission. He \nrepresents the National Park Service and the Federal Government at its \nbest: open and inclusive, seeking balanced solutions, and guided by a \nprofound sense of service to the American people.\n  Meanwhile, Biscayne's general management plan represents some of the \nworst aspects of the National Park Service and the Federal Government. \nIt is focused so much on a narrow definition of preservation that it \ncontinually and completely fails the National Park Service's mission \nand disregards a whole community of park users.\n  What is worse, with the varied threats facing south Florida's coral \nreefs, from changing ocean conditions to water quality issues, today \nfishing is a relatively minor contributor to coral reef decline in \nBiscayne.\n  The real effect of Biscayne's marine reserve zone plan will be to \ncontinue losing coral at a drastic pace while also undercutting the \npublic support needed to develop and implement real solutions to what \nails our reefs.\n  The National Park Service can, should, and must do better, and they \nshould look to Superintendent Ramos and his leadership over similar \nissues at Everglades National Park for inspiration.\n  Everglades National Park's own recently finalized general management \nplan, lauded by both fishermen and environmentalists, clearly \nrepresents what is possible when guided by a true sense of the Park's \nmission.\n\n[[Page H1857]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1857-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1857]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                         CELEBRATING EARTH DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, as we celebrate our 46th Earth Day, it is \ncritical that we recognize the opportunities that stem from addressing \nsome of our most pressing environmental problems.\n  All too often we hear the argument that environmental policies are \nagents of economic destruction. From the Clean Power Plan to renewable \nenergy development and energy-efficient technologies, every time a new \nenvironmental policy is proposed, we hear the same rhetoric: This will \nkill jobs, drive up costs, destroy trade, and stifle America's ability \nto succeed.\n  But the reality is those claims are simply not true. They have been \ndebunked and proven wrong time and again, but the truth doesn't seem to \nmatter when it comes to protecting our environment.\n  Without a doubt, one of America's greatest assets is the ingenuity of \nits people. Throughout our Nation's history, American innovation has \ntriumphed in the face of great challenges. Unleashing that American \ninnovation can bring big wins for both the environment and the economy.\n  There is no better example of this than when we look at our renewable \nenergy sector. For decades, America has chased the promise of clean, \ndomestic energy.\n  In recent years, costs for numerous critical clean energy \ntechnologies--wind power, solar panels, super-energy-efficient LED \nlights and electric vehicles--have fallen dramatically.\n  The accompanying surge in deployment has been impressive. While these \ntechnologies still represent a small percentage of their respective \nmarkets, that share is expanding at a rapid pace and influencing other \nmarkets.\n  Today the U.S. generates 3 times as much wind power and 20 times as \nmuch solar power as we did in 2008. This kind of thinking will help \nStates meet the EPA's requirements laid out in the Clean Power Plan.\n  Compared with fossil fuel technologies, which are typically \nmechanized and capital-intensive, the renewable energy industry is more \nlabor-intensive.\n  This means that, on the average, more jobs are created for each unit \nof electricity generated from renewable sources than from fossil fuels.\n  In addition to creating new jobs, increasing our use of renewable \nenergy offers more important economic development benefits. Local \ngovernments collect property and income taxes and other payments from \nrenewable energy project owners while owners of the land that wind \nprojects are built on also receive lease payments ranging from $3,000 \nto $6,000 per megawatt of installed capacity.\n  A new study from the U.S. Energy Information Administration suggests \nthat, in the coming year, the booming solar sector will add more new \nelectricity-generating capacity than any other energy sector, including \nnatural gas and wind.\n  The more we support clean energy innovation and new technological \nideas, the better positioned we are to reap the economic rewards.\n  Examples of those wins are all around, leading to States and \ncommunities investing in clean energy innovation and developing smart, \nlow-cost technologies to help reduce energy costs.\n  On this front, my home State of Illinois is moving full steam ahead. \nThe city of Chicago has partnered with utility companies and citizen \ngroups to work on a new initiative to get 1 million smart thermostats \ninto northern Illinois homes by 2020.\n  The innovative partnership offers rebates that will nearly halve the \ncost of thermostats that allow residents to control the temperatures of \ntheir homes via mobile devices. This helps us once again move the \nneedle against climate change.\n  Of course, clean energy technology isn't our only energy innovation \nsuccess story. Energy efficiency is truly our Nation's greatest energy \nachievement.\n  Without the gains in energy efficiency made since 1973, it is \nestimated that today's U.S. economy would require 60 percent more \nenergy than we currently consume.\n  Energy efficiency improvements over the last 40 years have reduced \nour national energy bill by more than $700 billion.\n  Instead of working from the assumption that tighter regulations will \nhurt our government's export share, we should focus on the edge that we \ngain from innovation.\n  This Earth Day, I challenge my colleagues to realize the opportunity \nthat climate change provides us and support solutions that allow us to \nturn what used to be daunting challenges into profitable opportunities.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1857-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1857-H1858]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     MINNESOTA'S SIXTH CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT IS THE LAND OF HOCKEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

That is an amazing 2.74 points \nper game.\n  Nick Althaus of St. Cloud won the Frank Brimsek Award, an annual \naward given to Minnesota's top senior goaltender.\n  In Minnesota, hockey is not just a sport, it is a way of life. Many \nyoung men and women work and train to win and participate in the best \nState hockey tournament in the country.\n  Congratulations to Nick and Riley for their hard work and incredible \nsuccess this year, and best of luck in the future, both on and off the \nrink.\n\n\n                     A Strong Woman--Inside and Out\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nstrength and endurance of St. Cloud native Laura Knoblach, who just, \nlast month, became the youngest woman to finish a double triathlon.\n  Laura finished the Double ANVIL Ultra Triathlon, a rigorous event \nthat consisted of swimming 4.8 miles, biking 224 miles, and running two \nconsecutive marathons. She finished all of this in less than 36 hours.\n  Not only did Laura complete an arduous triathlon, but she did so for \na good cause. She created a GoFundMe page titled ``A Tri to End \nTrafficking,'' which raised money to help educate South African girls \nand prevent them from becoming victims of sex trafficking.\n  Laura Knoblach is currently a junior at the University of Boulder in \nColorado, where she studies secondary education and majors in English \nand Spanish. She hopes to one day teach English as a second language.\n  I have no doubt that Laura will accomplish all of her goals and more, \nas she is the perfect example that anything is possible if you work \nhard enough.\n\n\n                           A Coach Remembered\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remember the \nastounding life and legacy of Coach Dean Taylor, who recently passed \naway.\n  Coach Taylor founded the football program at Sartell High School and \nbuilt it into the powerhouse program it is today.\n  From Sartell, he went on to become an assistant coach at St. John's \nUniversity for eight seasons and then became head coach at St. Cloud \nCathedral from 2009 to 2012. Coach Taylor's impressive football resume \nultimately led to his induction into the Minnesota State Coaches \nAssociation Hall of Fame.\n  However, it is not just the X's and O's of coaching that we will \nremember about Coach Taylor. Coach Taylor will also--and maybe even \nmore importantly--be remembered for the incredible impact he made on \nthe lives of all the student athletes he touched.\n  Condolences to his wife, Kathy; his children, Steve and Kristi; as \nwell as his many friends and loved ones.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, on April 1, thousands of poor Americans \nstarted losing their SNAP, or food stamp, benefits.\n  All told, over the course of this year, as many as 1 million adults \nwill be cut off from SNAP. That is because one of the harshest \nprovisions in the 1996 welfare reform law says that adults working less \nthan 20 hours a week or not enrolled in a job training program can only \nreceive 3 months of SNAP in a 36-month period.\n  The problem is, however, that many areas of the country haven't fully \nrecovered from the recession. There are no open jobs, and worker \ntraining slots are all full.\n  The economic recovery has been uneven across the country, and for \nmany individuals--through no fault of their own--getting back to work \nhas been difficult.\n  At the height of the recession, Governors across this country, both \nDemocratic and Republican, asked the U.S. Department of Agriculture to \nallow them to temporarily waive work requirements and provide SNAP \nbenefits to unemployed, childless adults for longer periods of time.\n  But now some Governors are refusing to extend those work waivers even \nin areas of their States with high unemployment. For 1 million of the \npoorest Americans, to lose food assistance in the midst of this is \nunconscionable.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are talking about the poorest of the poor. These are \nchildless adults whose income averages 29 percent of the poverty line, \nor about $3,400 a year, a year. No one can live on that.\n  Many face multiple barriers to employment, including disability, \nlimited education, and chronic homelessness. Their employment can be \nsporadic, often cycling in and out of low-wage jobs with unpredictable \nhours that do not lift them out of poverty.\n  What is most appalling is that about 60,000 of those who will be cut \noff from SNAP this year are veterans. That is right. These are the \nbrave men and women who stood up to protect our country, and now we \ndon't have the decency to help them put food on the table when they \ncome home. We should be ashamed.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear about something. The 3-month limit on \nchildless adults receiving SNAP is not a work requirement, despite what \nsome of my Republican colleagues say. It is a time limit. There is no \nrequirement that States offer work or job training to those who are \nabout to lose their benefit. There is nothing here that incentivizes \nwork. Rather, it penalizes those who are struggling the most.\n  Work requirements and other Federal assistance programs typically \nrequire people to look for work or accept any job or job training slot \nthat is offered, but do not cut people off who are willing to work and \nare looking for a job simply because they cannot find one.\n  But that is not the case with SNAP. So individuals who have been \nsearching for a job for months, who have applied to every job posting \nthey have seen, and who can't get into a job training program because \nthe wait list is too long are punished.\n  Study after study shows that the longer someone is unemployed, the \nharder it is to get hired. It is baffling to me that the Republicans' \nanswer to them is: Sorry. You are out of luck.\n  The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates that it takes someone who is \nunemployed about 6 months of looking to find a job.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  That is twice as long as the 3-month time limit. For the life of me, \nI can't understand how making someone hungrier helps them find a job \nfaster. We should be making people's lives better, not harder.\n  This notion that some on the Republican side peddle that somehow SNAP \nis this overly generous program that people are just jumping to get \ninto, it is ridiculous. It is false. The average SNAP benefit is $1.40 \nper meal per day. That is meager. It is inadequate.\n  And this idea that SNAP is the root of our budget problems is \noutrageous. New data released from the Department of Treasury just last \nweek shows that SNAP spending is falling. In the first half of the \ncurrent fiscal year, SNAP spending was at its lowest level since 2010. \nNot only that, but SNAP caseloads are falling, too. That is due to the \nimproving economy.\n  SNAP operated like it was supposed to during the recession. It was \nexpanded to meet the needs of the millions who lost their jobs, of \nmiddle class families who never imagined they would need food \nassistance in the first place. And now, as our economy improves, fewer \npeople need the assistance. But we are not there yet.\n  Cutting 1 million of the poorest Americans off from food assistance \nis wrong. Increasing hunger is wrong. And I would say to the Republican \nleadership of this House, the narrative that you have put forward about \nthose in poverty does not reflect the reality. Rather than demonize the \npoor and diminish their struggle, we ought to come together to help, \nnot hurt, people. We ought to end hunger now. This war on the poor has \nto stop.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1858-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1858-H1859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      IMPEACHMENT OF JOHN KOSKINEN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about the subject \nof justice.\n  As we look around the Capitol, there are effigies and paintings. Even \nin this Chamber, there are paintings of George Washington, Thomas \nJefferson, George Mason, the visionaries of this Nation who envisioned \na Nation and a government that was committed to liberty, tempered by \nlaw and justice. Their idea of justice was an equal application of the \nlaw to everyone, that there weren't two sets of laws--one law for the \ncitizen and a different law for the bureaucrat or the elected \nofficial--but all laws were equally applied to every person.\n  I want to tell you the story of two Johns and how the law doesn't \napply equally. The first John is a Mr. John Yates who, in 2007, was \nfishing for grouper in the Gulf of Mexico when a State conservation \nofficer, who had Federal authority, approached his boat and asked to \ninspect his catch. Upon the inspection, he found that there were 72 \ngrouper that were suspected to be under the minimum size. He ordered \nMr. Yates to return to shore.\n  Now, Mr. Yates understood that this was not a serious crime, it was \nactually a civil action, and he could face a fine or he could lose his \nfishing license, a license issued by the government that he made his \nliving with. But Mr. Yates made a mistake. He made a bad decision, \nbecause he ordered those suspect fish to be thrown back into the water. \nIt was a mistake.\n  But after being punished for what he did wrong, catching small fish, \n4 years later, in 2011, Mr. Yates was convicted of a Federal offense of \ndestroying evidence under the Sarbanes-Oxley statutes. He went to jail. \nHe also spent 3 years on a supervised release program for a Federal \noffense of destroying or tampering with evidence.\n  When the government wants to seek justice upon a citizen, there are \nover 4,500 criminal statutes and an endless\n\n[[Page H1859]]\n\nnumber of regulations that can be enforced criminally that they can use \nto find a way to punish you for a deed, regardless of how minor or \nmajor it was. But that doesn't always apply to the government itself.\n  The same year that John Yates was sent to jail for destroying small \nfish, the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform issued a \nsubpoena to another John, who was then, and is still, the Commissioner \nof the IRS, John Koskinen.\n  They demanded that he provide, under subpoena by the force of law, \nall of the documents relating to Lois Lerner and the targeting of \nconservative groups by the IRS. However, instead of responding to that \nsubpoena, the IRS destroyed over 24,000 of those documents. But yet, \ntoday, Mr. Koskinen is still the Commissioner of the IRS.\n  There are two types of enforcement of laws in this Nation--one for \nthe citizen and one for the government official. You see, the Sarbanes-\nOxley catchall that has been used to successfully prosecute for \ndestruction of cars and weapons, even bodies, as well as documents and \nevidence, excludes government agencies.\n  The American people deserve justice. But we do have one tool, and \nthat is the tool of this Congress to impeach those who violate the \ntrust of the American citizens.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have cosponsored, with the chairman of the House \nCommittee on Oversight and Government Reform, House Resolution 494, \nwhich would bring the Commissioner of the IRS before this body on \ncharges of impeachment for violating the trust of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that that resolution be brought forward and be \nbrought forward in this House for a vote so that justice will be served \nand we can once again restore the confidence of the American people \nthat there is one definition of justice in this Nation, and that is \nequal application of the law for everyone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1859-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1859]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           COMMENDING STATE OFFICIALS ON SIGNING THE ABLE ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commend \nlawmakers in Pennsylvania's House and Senate for their work on passing \nthe Commonwealth's new ABLE, or Achieving a Better Life Experience Act, \nwhich was signed into law by the Pennsylvania Governor on Monday.\n  The measure's passage at the State level follows the signing of a \n2014 Federal law, also known as the ABLE Act. I was happy to cosponsor \nthat legislation along with a majority of my colleagues here in the \nHouse of Representatives. The law empowers people with disabilities and \ntheir families to create flexible accounts to help save for medical and \ndental care, education, community-based support, employment training, \nhousing, and transportation.\n  The State law passed easily in the Pennsylvania House and Senate last \nweek, clearing the way for the State to administer the new accounts \ncreated by the Federal law.\n  The State eliminates a $2,000 cap on cash assets for medical \nassistance for those with certain intellectual and developmental \ndisabilities, which acted as a financial roadblock preventing \nindividuals from reaching their full potential.\n  Mr. Speaker, thanks to this new law, parents of children with \ndevelopmental and intellectual disabilities will be able to save up to \n$100,000, with no impact on eligibility for medical assistance.\n  Last week here in Washington, I joined the National Down Syndrome \nSociety, where I was proud to be presented with their Champion of \nChange Award. I also had the chance to connect with people from \nPennsylvania's Fifth Congressional District, including Alek Masters. \nAlek is a wonderful young man who, despite living with Down syndrome, \nis an Eagle Scout, the highest honor earned by the members of the Boy \nScouts of America.\n  I also was with Isabel Ross, a toddler from Centre County who \nattended the event with her parents, Steve and Raquel.\n  There are so many people such as Alek and Isabel across the \nPennsylvania Fifth Congressional District, the Commonwealth of \nPennsylvania, and our great Nation. Alek is already making a difference \nin his community, and this new law ensures that he and Isabel, along \nwith the help of their parents, can work towards achieving their goals.\n  I know that the ABLE Act, on both the State and the Federal level, \nwill play a role in improving the lives of those who are living with \ndevelopmental and intellectual disabilities. I firmly believe that our \ncommunities will be much better because of it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1859-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1859-H1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING BROTHER JAMES GAFFNEY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Lipinski) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. LIPINSKI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor Brother James \nGaffney who, after 28 years, will retire from his storied career as \npresident of Lewis University in Romeoville, Illinois.\n  Born and raised on the west side of Chicago, Brother Gaffney attended \nSt. Mel High School. While at St. Mel, he became involved in outreach \nand youth service programs with the De La Salle Christian Brothers. It \nwas at this time that Brother Gaffney heard his calling to become a \nbrother and elected to attend seminary at St. Mary's University in \nMinnesota.\n  Brother Gaffney went on to receive his BA from St. Mary's University \nand several master's degrees from both St. Mary's and Manhattan College \nin New York. He also holds a doctorate in pastoral theology from the \nUniversity of St. Mary of the Lake in Mundelein, Illinois.\n  Brother Gaffney's teaching career started at the Christian Brothers \nHigh School in St. Joseph, Missouri. He also served for 11 years at the \nprovincial for the De La Salle Christian Brothers in the Chicago \ndistrict.\n  Brother Gaffney was chosen to be president of Lewis University in \n1988. Under his leadership, the school's student body nearly tripled in \nsize, dozens of new programs were added, and several new educational \nsites were built around the Chicago area and the Nation, including one \nin Albuquerque, New Mexico. He guided the university to nationwide \nrecognition and influenced students around the world.\n  In 2015, Lewis University honored Brother Gaffney by naming him an \nhonorary founder of the university because of the tremendous \ncontributions he made to the school's growth.\n  In addition to his service to the school, Brother Gaffney is active \nin numerous other organizations. He chairs the Community Foundation of \nWill County, as well as the Lasallian Association of College and \nUniversity Presidents. He is a member and former chair of the \nFederation of Independent Illinois Colleges and Universities, and a \nboard member and former chair of the South Metropolitan Regional Higher \nEducation Consortium and the Great Lakes Valley Athletic Conference.\n  Brother Gaffney has also been the recipient of countless awards in \nconnection with Lewis University. Most recently, he was awarded with \nthe Brother John Johnston FSC Award, which honors those dedicated to \nthe Lasallian mission of providing education to all youth, as well as \nthe Distinguished Citizen Award from the Rainbow Council Boy Scouts of \nAmerica.\n  I have had a number of opportunities to spend time with Brother \nGaffney since Lewis University was added to my district in 2013. I have \nalways been impressed by his strong commitment to the university and \nits Catholic and Lasallian mission. It is obvious in his interactions \nwith students, faculty, staff, trustees, and everyone who is a part of \nLewis University. He knows his flock and they know him, and the respect \nand love between them is mutual. There could not be a higher dedication \nthat anyone has as an educator and as a Catholic Brother.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask my colleagues to join me in thanking Brother James \nGaffney for all he has done in his 28 years as president of Lewis \nUniversity, and to congratulate him on his retirement. Lewis University \nand its students have greatly benefited from his long tenure leading \nthe school, and we all look forward to his continued service.\n\n[[Page H1860]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1860-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                             WATER AND ESA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on the need to fix \nCalifornia's broken water system, a broken water system that no longer \ncan provide for the needs of the State of California, designed years \nago for a population of 20 million and the agriculture that we had in \nthe sixties. Today we have 41 million people. By the year 2030, it is \nestimated California will have 50 million people.\n  The water system we have today cannot sustain a growing State. As \nsolutions are offered, I believe amending the Endangered Species Act to \nmore effectively protect species while minimizing the harm to \nCalifornia communities should be a part of this conversation.\n  The ESA has an important role in ensuring species protection, but it \nis clear that there are major challenges with its implementation. In \nCalifornia, one of those challenges is the Act's implementation limits \non the ability to move water from north to south when we have an excess \nof water in the system, as we have had over the last 5 months.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  Simply put, California faced 4 record dry years, which was noted \nthroughout the country and throughout the world; and, this year, we had \nEl Nino conditions that gave us average and above average rain and snow \nin northern California.\n  Now, I don't believe anybody thought that 1 year of good rainfall \nwould completely dig us out of the devastating circumstances that \nCalifornia farmers, farmworkers, and farm communities have faced; but, \nlast December, I was hopeful because the rain and snow conditions that \nwere occurring, coupled with the weather forecasting, indicated that \nthere was a high likelihood that there would be enough water in the \nsystem to help recover--but not end--the devastating drought conditions \nthat the San Joaquin Valley faced as well as other parts of California. \nHowever, as a result of what I believe are flawed biological opinions \nthat govern the operations of the water projects that move water from \nnorth to south, we failed to pump over 244,000 acre-feet of water that \nwould have been very helpful today in areas that were most impacted by \nthe drought conditions and still are.\n  Some farmers, this year, are receiving only 5 percent of their total \nallocation. It is made worse because, over the last 2 years, they \nreceived a zero water allocation because of these conditions that I am \nstating. To put it in perspective, this year, 7 million acre-feet of \nwater flowed through the Sacramento-San Joaquin Bay-Delta system out to \nthe ocean, and only 963,000 acre-feet were pumped for human and \nagricultural use. Seven million acre-feet went through the delta out to \nthe ocean, and we pumped less than 1 million acre-feet for human and \nagricultural use.\n  This is unconscionable in a State that has been ravaged by drought \nfor the last 4 years. It also was avoidable. There is a host of \ntechnical reasons as to why this water flowed into the ocean, but the \nsimple fact is that conservative decisionmaking, enabled by inflexible \nprovisions in the biological opinions that were promulgated under the \nEndangered Species Act, led to this avoidable outcome.\n  Therefore, it is time to reform the Endangered Species Act because it \nneeds to be more flexible in order to provide adaptability to changing \nconditions. It is time to reform the Endangered Species Act because it \nmust effectively recover species, which it doesn't do, and not simply \nmaintain an unsustainable status quo like that in California, \nespecially when you have a drought crisis. Finally, it is time to \nreform the Endangered Species Act because both people and our \nenvironment deserve better.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to update the Endangered \nSpecies Act for today's conditions and not for those of the past.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1860-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1860]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

He is one of only six wrestlers who were \nselected.\n  Throughout his career, Daniel has stood out as a rare talent in the \nsport. While he attended Grant Township High School in Fox Lake, \nIllinois, Daniel set the school record for career wins, technical \ndefaults, and most team points.\n  Daniel built upon that success while wrestling at the University of \nIowa, where he was a two-time All-American and placed second at the \nNCAA championships.\n  Congratulations to Daniel on being named to the Olympic Wrestling \nTeam.

She asked Pope \nFrancis to support DAPA, a program which could prevent her family from \nbeing separated.\n  On Monday, DAPA was deliberated in the Supreme Court, and now the \nfate of millions of children like Sophie and their families is in the \nhands of the Justices.\n  Sophie was in D.C. on Monday ready to tell her story. She rallied a \ncrowd of hundreds of people on the Supreme Court steps and asked the \nJustices to think about her family.\n  I could not be more proud of Sophie. But a 6-year-old girl, however \ncourageous she may be, should not have to come all the way to \nWashington, D.C., to advocate for fixing the broken immigration system. \nThat is our job.\n  The Supreme Court should unfreeze DAPA--but we in Congress need to \nfinally pass comprehensive immigration reform--for Sophie and for \nmillions of children she represents.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1861-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      LOUISIANA IS STILL FEELING THE IMPACTS OF DEEPWATER HORIZON\n\n  (Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, 6 years ago on April 20, 2010, \nthe Deepwater Horizon exploded and resulted in the loss of 11 lives, \ndestroying or disrupting many families, businesses, restaurants, and \nlivelihoods of south Louisiana, which is known as the Sportsman's \nParadise, profoundly impacting recreational and commercial fishing and \noiling in my home State of Louisiana, over 600 miles of what is known \nas one of the most productive ecosystems on the North American \ncontinent.\n  Mr. Speaker, since that time, countless hours have been invested by \nState, local, and Federal employees trying to help restore and recover \nthe Gulf. It resulted in one of the largest settlements, in fact, the \nlargest settlement, from a single company in United States history.\n  Mr. Speaker, during the height of that disaster, we heard the \nadministration, the President and others talking about the importance \nof this productive ecosystem. Yet, since that time, we have seen \nnothing but Federal actions to take funds away from restoring and \nprotecting coastal Louisiana.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are asking the administration to remain consistent \nand to honor those lives that were lost and to honor the coast of \nLouisiana.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1861-5", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1861]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               EARTH DAY\n\n  (Mr. CICILLINE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. CICILLINE.

MALONEY of New York asked and was given permission \nto address the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, last week I \nreleased a new report by the Democratic staff of the Joint Economic \nCommittee about the effects of the gender pay gap on women and families \nin America. This report on gender pay inequality is the most \ncomprehensive, up-to-date report on the gender pay gap.\n  A typical woman working full time and year-round is paid only 79 \ncents to the male dollar. This adds up to a loss of roughly $10,800 per \nyear, and it compounds over a lifetime to roughly a half a million \ndollars in less pay than a man because of the pay gap.\n  Over a lifetime, this jeopardizes a woman's retirement because the \nlower pay results in a lower pension, lower Social Security, lower \nsavings, and contributes to the fact that women over 75 years of age \nare twice as likely as their male counterparts to live in poverty. \nMillions of women, children, families, and husbands are hurt by unequal \npay for equal work.\n  Let's finally make equal pay a reality by passing the Paycheck \nFairness Act and finally putting women into the Constitution for \nequality.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1862-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    YOUNG WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP PROGRAM\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, with education and opportunity, women can \ntransform a society. This is true all around the world, but especially \nin America, where women still have untapped potential.\n  As a society, we must do a better job of showing girls they can be \nwhatever they want to be and making sure they have the opportunity to \nachieve their fullest potential.\n  That is why, on June 11, my office will hold southern Arizona's first \never Congressional Young Women's Leadership Program. This one-day event \nprovides young women currently in high school with the opportunity to \nmeet and interact with successful women from southern Arizona who hold \nleadership roles in a variety of fields.\n  Quite simply, this program is about encouraging young women to be \nfearless, dream big, and let nothing stand in their way.\n  The deadline for applications, which can be found on my Web site, \nmcsallyhouse.gov, is May 9.\n  I encourage high school girls throughout the Second Congressional \nDistrict to take advantage of this unique opportunity and apply at my \nWeb site.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1862-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n            FUNDING FOR NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION RESEARCH\n\n  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. McNERNEY. Mr. Speaker, as a mathematician, it is my pleasure to \ndiscuss recent developments in the topic of prime numbers. \nHistorically, it was assumed that prime numbers were randomly \ndistributed in the sense that any large section of consecutive integers \nwould have an equal number of primes ending in 1, 3, 7, and 9.\n  Prime numbers are used in generating pseudo random numbers, found in \nall sorts of applications, and in some methods of encryption. Heck, \neven the lowly cicada insects only emerge after a prime number of years \nto avoid regularly appearing predators.\n  Recently, Dr. Soundararajan and Dr. Lemke Oliver, both of Stanford \nUniversity working under NSF funding, discovered that consecutive prime \nnumbers have preferences for the digits they end in. For example, \nconsecutive primes don't like having the same digit, while primes \nending in 9 prefer to be followed by primes ending in 1. We must \nprovide funding to the National Science Foundation to investigate this \nand other important mathematical questions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1862-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1862]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               CONGRATULATING MID-AMERICA SCIENCE MUSEUM\n\n  (Mr. WESTERMAN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. WESTERMAN.

Mr. Speaker, I just returned from the United Nations \nwhere there is a special session on the drug problems. This is a \nserious and complex issue, but the war on drugs, where we have spent \nover $1 trillion, has been an abject failure.\n  Drugs are still readily plentiful in the United States, the cost is \ndown, and we have caught hundreds of thousands of innocent people in \nLatin American countries in the crossfire. Yet, the United States is on \nthe sidelines here. There are countries that are stepping forward for \nreform, for harm reduction, trying to deal with the death penalty. Yet, \nthe United States is trying to balance out the reformers of seeking a \nmiddle ground between them and Iran and China and Russia.\n  That is not what the United States should be doing. We should be \ninvolved in reform. We should minimize the danger that is a result of \nmisguided practice.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Missouri?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The IRS OWES Act is about protecting the American taxpayer, those who \nelected us to represent them, from an IRS proven incapable of best \nserving their interests.\n  President Thomas Jefferson said: ``When the people fear the \ngovernment, there is tyranny. When the government fears the people, \nthere is liberty.''\n  Right now, the people of Missouri's Eighth District fear the IRS. \nThey fear an unjust audit, political or religious targeting, and, most \nrecently, they fear spending an average of 8 hours to complete their \ntax returns. That is simply not right.\n  This bill is about liberating the folks of Missouri, along with all \nAmericans, from the IRS. It is about making the IRS beholden to them \nand not the other way around. And it is about exerting our Article I \nauthority of the power of the purse of Congress, making sure that \nunelected bureaucrats are not spending taxpayer money improperly and \nunwisely.\n  A Democrat Congressman from the State of Missouri once said: ``I come \nfrom a State that raises corn and cotton, cockleburs, and Democrats. \nAnd frothy eloquence neither convinces, nor satisfies me. I'm from \nMissouri; you've got to show me.''\n  The IRS has not shown this body, they have not proven to the \nMissourians whom I represent, and they have not proven to the American \npeople that they are responsible stewards of user fees. Through user \nfees, the IRS collects almost $500 million. It is nothing but a slush \nfund.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why we filed the IRS OWES Act. It provides \nCongress and the American public with greater oversight in how the IRS \nis spending valuable taxpayer resources.\n  As is, the IRS collects various user fees that sit in an account \nwhere they can spend the money without Congressional approval. In the \npast, the IRS dedicated significant amounts of its collected user fees \nto improving the services provided to taxpayers who need assistance.\n  The IRS in the past few years has turned these fees into a slush \nfund, diverting this money away from serving the taxpayer and, instead, \nputting it towards whatever they want--in particular, the \nimplementation of ObamaCare mandates, something Congress has \nspecifically withheld funding for.\n  In 2014, the IRS allocated $183 million in user fees to serving the \nneeds of taxpayers. That is 44 percent of the entire slush fund. Yet, \nin 2015, the IRS allocated a mere $49 million in user fees to help \ntaxpayers. That is 10 percent. So in one year, they went from 44 \npercent of serving taxpayers to 10 percent in serving taxpayers, at \ntheir own discretion.\n  Just yesterday I asked the IRS Commissioner in a hearing whether it \nwas Congress or the IRS that cut funding for taxpayer customer service. \nHere were my questions and his answers:\n  ``In 2014, you appropriated $183 million for taxpayer assistance; is \nthat correct?''\n  The Commissioner said: ``Yes.''\n  I then followed up: ``In 2015, you appropriated $49 million for \ntaxpayer assistance; is that correct?''\n  The Commissioner said: ``That is correct.''\n  I then followed up: ``So it was your decision to cut taxpayer \nassistance by $130 million; is that correct?''\n  The Commissioner of the IRS said: ``Yes.''\n  Instead of using those resources to grow taxpayer services, reduce \nwait times, and improve the public's interactions with the IRS, they \nare dedicating close to $200 million on technology to help implement \nand track the ObamaCare mandates. It is no wonder that last year the \nCommissioner of the IRS would call the level of taxpayer services \nabysmal. That is simply unacceptable.\n  The pattern here is alarming. When the IRS has discretion, the agency \nuses that discretion in ways that harm Americans. It is the duty of the \nIRS to work for the taxpayers, not against them.\n  I encourage my colleagues to do the citizens they represent a favor \nand support the IRS OWES Act.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Here is the story. Here are the honest facts.\n  Republicans have cut the IRS budget by close to $1 billion over the \npast 5 years. This bill is just another budget cut, further reducing \nthe IRS' budget by as much as $500 million.\n  The consequences of these budget cuts for taxpayers are significant, \nas you can see from this chart. What has happened since 2011 is the \nappropriations have gone down and waiting times have gone up. The \naverage wait is shown by this blue line. The dollars\n\n[[Page H1864]]\n\nare in the yellow. The only improvement was when we appropriated a \ncouple hundred million dollars at the initiative of Democrats, and the \nwaiting times went down as money went up.\n  The Republicans who complain about poor IRS customer service, they \nhave only to look in the mirror to see who is responsible. Here are the \nfacts.\n  Republican cuts to the IRS budget from 2010 to 2015 resulted in--and \neveryone listen to this--13,000 fewer full-time IRS employees; a \nsignificant number of taxpayer phone calls being dropped, as indicated \nby this chart; delays in much-needed upgrades to information technology \nand cybersecurity; and the lowest level of audits in a decade with less \nthan 1 percent of taxpayers being audited last year. This is all \ndespite the fact that the number of tax returns being filed increased \nby $9 million, or 7 percent, since 2010.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  This effort today is motivated entirely by politics instead of good \npolicy. The IRS has had the authority to offset the cost of taxpayer \nservices with user fees since 1995. The Republicans have never tried to \ntamper with that. This is the first time the Republicans have tried to \nprevent the IRS from using these moneys.\n  We heard the Republicans argue that the IRS used some of this funding \nto implement the Affordable Care Act. True, as those are taxpayer \nservices. Taxpayers are applying for help through the Affordable Care \nAct. It is the IRS' responsibility to implement that. The IRS is doing \nexactly what they should be doing: implementing a law passed by \nCongress, a law that has resulted in there being 20 million more \nAmericans with healthcare coverage.\n  This bill is, in essence, another effort--it might be--what?--No. 63, \n64, 65--to undermine healthcare reform. That is really what this is all \nabout, and the gentleman who presented the case made that case. The \nIRS' helping people get access to healthcare reform is a taxpayer \nservice.\n  The White House issued a Statement of Administration Policy, which \nreads, if the President were presented with this bill, his senior \nadvisers would recommend he veto it.\n  The statement reads as follows: ``By further constraining IRS \nresources, H.R. 4885 would have detrimental effects on the IRS' ability \nto provide quality service to taxpayers, administer the Tax Code, and \nenforce tax laws.''\n  That is really what this is all about.\n  The statement continues: ``The IRS needs more resources, not fewer, \nto deter tax cheats, serve honest taxpayers, and protect taxpayer \ndata.''\n  The Republicans are using these IRS bills this week to attack the IRS \nand its employees as a distraction. They don't want hardworking \nAmericans to know what they missed the deadline on: to come up with a \nbudget. They are doing absolutely nothing to help the people of Flint \nor of Puerto Rico, who so desperately need our help.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' for the reasons outlined by this \nchart: for the need of more resources for customer services and to \nthwart a further effort by the Republicans to undermine the ACA, which \nhas meant so much to millions and millions and millions of Americans \nfrom all walks of life. This should be resoundingly voted down, surely \nby us Democrats, who believe in customer service and who want the ACA \nimplemented, not destroyed by the Republican Party of this House or of \nthe Senate.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise).\n  Mr. SCALISE. I thank my colleague from Missouri for bringing this \nbill to the floor and for his leadership in holding the IRS \naccountable.\n  Mr. Speaker, I guess we should start with the question of who is \nattacking whom. When you look at the actions of the IRS, especially in \nthe last few years--and we have exposed this through our oversight here \nin this House majority--we have found it is the IRS that has been \nattacking the hardworking taxpayers of this country.\n  It has not only been documented, but it has come out in hearings that \nthe IRS was actually targeting people--American citizens--based on \ntheir political views. The IRS was. You could expect this, maybe, in a \nThird World country where the government would actually be attacking \npeople based on their political views, but, here in America, this IRS \nwas doing just that, and we exposed it.\n  One is seeing with the bill that Congressman Smith is bringing \nforward that the IRS has created, in essence, a slush fund, using user \nfees for things that weren't even intended and that aren't even in the \npurview of Congress. What are they afraid of? Why are they afraid of \nhaving some real transparency so that we can actually hold the IRS \naccountable for these user fees? Hundreds of millions of dollars of \nuser fees, by the way, are paid by hardworking families out there who \nare struggling to get by. When somebody actually calls the IRS hotline \nright now, estimates are that fewer than 40 percent of Americans who \ncall the IRS hotline to get help are able to get help.\n  The IRS is not helping people they are supposed to be helping. They \nhave these slush funds, and they don't want them to be under the \npurview of Congress? What are they afraid of hiding? Is it, maybe, that \nwe are going to expose more things, like they are using taxpayer money \nto target people? Maybe we are going to expose more things, like they \nwere actually hiring people who were fired from the IRS because they \nwere improperly accessing people's taxpayer data, or the fact that they \nhave given out bonuses to people when they can't even show they have a \ncustomer service plan.\n  When one is looking at so many abuses by the IRS, it is an agency \nthat is out of control. Now we have a bill by the gentleman from \nMissouri to at least bring some of that into the purview of Congress so \nthat it is exposed in the sunshine of transparency. Why be against \ntransparency? Let's pass this bill.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Look, as happened yesterday, I expect the Republicans to try to bring \nup the issue relating to the IRS and how it handled 501(c)(4) \napplications. As I did yesterday, I just want to read an answer given \nby the inspector general on this issue.\n  On May 17, 2013, I asked him as follows: ``Did you find any evidence \nof political motivation in the selection of the tax exemption \napplications?''\n  Inspector George said: ``We did not, sir.''\n  Next, customer service. You have the gall to come forth here and \ncomplain about customer service when you cut the IRS' budget over 5 \nyears by almost $900 million. That really takes gall. It is so \ninconsistent. As I said earlier, look in the mirror, and you will see \nwho is responsible for those problems.\n  I want to finish by saying: Slush fund? Implementing healthcare \nreform that has helped 20 million people, that is a slush fund? No. \nThat is the implementation by the IRS of a necessary function that \naffects the lives and the health care of millions of Americans.\n  So you are really bankrupt to come forth here and support this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Blumenauer) control the remainder of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  I would like to respond to the gentleman's prior comments.\n  As a matter of fact, since fiscal year 2013, in budget sequestration, \nCongress has either maintained or increased funding for taxpayer \nservices each and every year--never cutting it one time. Any cuts to \ntaxpayer services have come at the clear discretion of the IRS \nCommissioner.\n  Yesterday, in committee, the IRS Commissioner said that it was his \ndiscretion to cut taxpayer services. In fact, in the last year, they \ncut $134 million. In the last 4 years, Congress has not cut $1 in \ntaxpayer services; so let's get the record straight while we are on the \nHouse floor.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Kansas (Ms. Jenkins), a \nmember of the Ways and Means Committee and the vice chair of the \nConference.\n  Ms. JENKINS of Kansas. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n\n[[Page H1865]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to come to the House floor in support of \nthe IRS Oversight While Eliminating Spending Act, sponsored by my \ncolleague, Mr. Smith.\n  I spent many years practicing in the tax area as a certified public \naccountant, so I understand firsthand why tax day has become a dreaded \nannual burden to so many Americans. The economy has yet to rebound from \nthe recession, and wage growth is stagnant; but, in 2016, individuals \nwill spend more on their taxes than on clothing, food, and housing \ncombined.\n  While Americans continue to face the threat of increasing taxes--\nthanks to this administration--the tax process has gotten only more \ncomplicated and confusing. On top of that, the IRS has mishandled \ntaxpayer funds, has provided inadequate customer service, and has \nproven to be unwilling or unable to change.\n  This commonsense legislation brings us one step closer to providing \nthe proper oversight over the IRS' activities. At the moment, the IRS \ncurrently charges user fees, and Congress has no say as to how these \nfees are used.\n  I am extremely disappointed this agency is playing politics with \nthese fees. They cut the fees allocated to customer service by 73 \npercent this year, and they reallocated those funds in an effort to try \nto extract additional fees from the American taxpayer. Folks are \nalready paying more than enough in taxes.\n  If the IRS wants taxpayers to pay fees, then they need to account for \nhow they are using every last cent of that money. Oversight from \nCongress will ensure no frivolous use by a wasteful IRS.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. We cannot continue \nto reward inefficient bureaucracies. The American people deserve to \nhave a say in how the IRS spends our hard-earned tax dollars.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It is painful to listen to some of the rhetoric here on the floor \nthat suggests that, somehow, the use of resources by the IRS is not \ndealing with customer service. The gentleman admitted that, under \nRepublican leadership, they have worked to not fund the necessary \nresources for the Affordable Care Act. Now, this is a bill that is law. \nThis is a bill that is impacting 16 million Americans, and 7.3 million \npeople have gotten the tax credits.\n  I would ask the gentleman from Missouri what the impact would be on \n7.3 million taxpayers if we had no money available to implement the \nAffordable Care Act.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, the question that we have before \nus is: Did we appropriate adequate funding for taxpayer services?\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. In reclaiming my time, I am asking the gentleman: \nWhat would be the impact on the 7.3 million people who are claiming the \ntax credit under the Affordable Care Act, which you have not yet \nrepealed and which still is the law of the land? What would the impact \nbe on them if you had your way and there was no money?\n  I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, the law of the land is Article I \nof the Constitution. Congress has the power of the purse to appropriate \nfunds, and Congress appropriated the funds in 2016, but the IRS is not \nfollowing that appropriately. This is wrong.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. In reclaiming my time, if I may reframe the question, \nbecause I am not trying to trick the gentleman. I want to know what the \nimpact would be on 7.3 million people if there were no money available \nto implement the Affordable Care Act.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Missouri.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, what I am talking about is that \nCongress appropriated the necessary resources. The gentleman is talking \nabout there being over $11 billion to the IRS, and they cannot \nappropriate the funds correctly.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, in reclaiming my time, I would \nappreciate the gentleman, on his own time, elaborating on this, and the \ngentleman is not answering.\n  What would be the impact, as the gentleman said in his opening \nstatement, if the money were not allocated to implement the Affordable \nCare Act? It is sort of a backdoor way via the budget process, which \nyou can control, to defund the Affordable Care Act.\n  The fact is, for those 7.3 million people who get the tax credit and \nfor the over 17 million Americans who have received health care under \nthe Affordable Care Act, being able to implement the law is customer \nservice. I would think that my Republican friends would become very \ncranky if the bureaucracy in the IRS just decided that they weren't \ngoing to implement part of the law. So what the IRS has done within \nsome areas that it does have budgetary discretion is to make sure that \nthere are adequate people to try and implement these provisions.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Now, it is true that the Tax Code becomes more and more complex, but \nthat is not the fault of the IRS. Those are the people who are charged \nwith implementing what Congress does.\n  Since I have been in Congress--and my Republican friends have been in \ncharge most of this time--the Tax Code has become longer, more complex, \neven as they have cut back the resources to that critical agency.\n  What business assaults its accounts receivable department?\n  The Internal Revenue Service is the largest customer service agency \nin the world, and they have a very difficult job because Congress in \nthe last 25 years has cut 30,000 people out of the workforce. In the \nlast 10 years, we have seen an additional reduction.\n  I am glad that our Republican friends were embarrassed because of \ntheir continued cuts to the IRS budget and the service got so bad that \nthey restored almost $300 million.\n  But it is not, by any stretch of the imagination, enough to give the \nservice that we want, and it does not make up for the fact that the IRS \nhas a legal obligation to administer the Affordable Care Act, which is \nstill on the books, which is serving millions of Americans and has \nbecome more complex and actually more onerous for individual taxpayers.\n  Remember, they have made changes to make a sharper cliff if people \nmake a mistake in the estimate of their income because it is graduated. \nYou get less help the more money you make.\n  Under the Republican assault on the Affordable Care Act, there is \nmore of a cliff that faces people if they have a change in \ncircumstance. If they misallocate, if they lose a job, if they get a \nbonus, that can have significant consequences.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States Internal Revenue Service has been a \nwhipping boy for everybody. This a service that people love to hate. \nRepublicans have taken their war against taxes to high art by \nassaulting the IRS, making it hard to serve, and attacking it \nrepeatedly.\n  Mr. Speaker, this has significant consequences. The United States \nrelies on voluntary compliance from the taxpayers. Every 1 percent less \nvoluntary compliance costs the taxpayers $30 billion that could be used \nto reduce the deficit or to pay for badly needed services or maybe \nrebuild our fraying infrastructure. This has consequences.\n  Now, I would respectfully suggest that this is a cut of a half \nbillion dollars to a budget that is already stressed and can't deal \nwith the needs of today.\n  People in the IRS are dealing with a computer system that those of \nyou who took computer science in the 1960s--I didn't--but you would \nfeel comfortable with some of the programming language they have.\n  It is hopelessly out of date. The employees are overwhelmed on the \nphone lines. And Congress keeps changing the Tax Code.\n  Taking away a half billion dollars in user fees and throwing it into \nthe general fund makes it very unlikely that it will be available for \nthe priorities that are going to be necessary to administer the IRS.\n  My friend doesn't care if the Affordable Care Act is not \nadministered. In fact, he would rather that it not be administered, but \nthat is not the law. That is not fair to the taxpayers.\n  Taking away these user fees, putting it in the appropriations \nprocess, is going to have sort of a grab bag in Congress for those \nmoneys, and I don't know where those would end up.\n\n[[Page H1866]]\n\n  But given the composition and the attitude of the people who control \nit now, it wouldn't be available to administer the Affordable Care Act, \nsomething the IRS is obligated to do and which we owe to the American \npeople.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Babin).\n  Mr. BABIN. Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up with the IRS \nand rightfully so. With such a troubled and incompetent record, it is \nhard to imagine how anyone could trust this corrupt agency.\n  This week the House will take action, thanks in large part to my \nfriend and colleague from Missouri (Mr. Smith). We will pass a series \nof bills to rein in the IRS and bring much-needed accountability to \nthis broken and dysfunctional agency.\n  We will take steps to end the politicization of the IRS, which has \nillegally and intentionally targeted conservative Americans.\n  We will vote to eliminate the IRS slush fund--and I call it a slush \nfund--that has allowed this agency to skirt congressional authority.\n  We will vote to make sure that IRS employees are held to the same \nstandards as the taxpayers by firing those who are delinquent in their \nown taxes.\n  These are commonsense steps that need to be taken, but we cannot \ntruly solve these problems and bring real change to the Internal \nRevenue Service under the current leadership of Commissioner John \nKoskinen.\n  Mr. Koskinen has blatantly lied under oath and misled congressional \ninvestigators. He has supported Lois Lerner's track record of deceit \nand obstruction. It is time for him to go.\n  As a cosponsor of legislation to impeach Commissioner Koskinen, I \ncall on congressional leaders to bring that bill forward as well.\n  American taxpayers deserve much better than they are getting, and we \nneed to turn the page on Mr. Koskinen's failed leadership.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Doggett), a senior member of the Ways and Means Committee \nand someone who understands the value of protecting the Federal \nGovernment's accounts receivable department.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, Monday, as all Americans know, was, of \ncourse, Tax Day. Today should be officially designated as ``Republican \nTax Distraction Day'' because that is exactly what is going on here.\n  Rather than address the many inequities and complexities in our tax \nsystem, Republicans distract by attacking the tax collector, which is \none of the oldest tactics around that goes back, I guess, many \ncivilizations.\n  I believe it was Mark Twain who suggested the difference between a \ntaxidermist and a tax collector is that the taxidermist only takes your \nskin.\n  The problem we have today is that there are many of our largest and \nmost profitable corporations that don't have any skin in the game.\n  For the patriotic taxpayers that were out there last weekend trying \nto figure out how they would complete their taxes and how they would \nmake the payments or who were lined up on Monday night at the post \noffice to make their payments--those taxpayers have a lot of boxes on \ntheir tax form, but they don't have one that they can check that shifts \ntheir income off to some offshore tax haven. They can't decide that \nthey will just defer paying on some of their income until they feel \nlike it.\n  Yet, some of America's largest and most profitable companies use just \nthese type of tax loopholes to dramatically lower their tax bill. These \nRepublicans, especially on the House Ways and Means Committee, have \nshown no interest in addressing the problem whatsoever.\n  Only last week a major development before this Republican tax \ndevelopment was a report that found that 20 percent of large, \nprofitable corporations paid no Federal income tax in 2012, the last \nyear of the survey.\n  That is no. That is none. That is zero. That is zilch. It is not what \nthose folks that were working last weekend trying to figure out their \ntaxes were faced with, but it is what is occurring.\n  If Republicans were serious about making the Internal Revenue Service \nwork better, they would be addressing injustices like this instead of \nmaking it worse by slashing the IRS budget. Shorting that budget is \nshort-circuiting the collection of taxes from all those people that are \nout there trying to dodge their taxes.\n  Under these Republican budgets, almost one in four of the enforcement \ntax staff at the IRS have been eliminated over the last 7 years. Every \nadditional dollar that we spend on tax enforcement yields an estimated \n$4 in increased revenue.\n  Even a remarkable return on investment like that is modest compared \nto the return that America's largest corporations are getting by \nlobbying this Congress and participating in the political process. \nOxfam America this month reported that tax dodging by multinationals is \ncosting the United States perhaps as much as $111 billion each year.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, recovering that revenue could pay for the \nentire budget of The National Institutes of Health, the Centers for \nDisease Control, and the Department of Education.\n  Tax dodging is not a victimless crime. It is like those seaside \nresorts where you hear: Grandpa went to the Caymans and all I got was \nthis lousy T-shirt.\n  Well, you don't get a T-shirt out of this kind of tax dodging, but \nyou do get a tax bill, because the hardworking American families and \nsmall businesses that are picking up the tab for all of those loopholes \nare having to pay more than their fair share.\n  What we should be doing on this Republican Tax Distraction Day is \ngetting about those loopholes and seeing that the IRS enforces our laws \nfairly and equitably. That is not being done today.\n  This and the rest of this package should be rejected in favor of a \nsystem that is fair to all Americans.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the fine \ngentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Smith).\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I want to point out that most \nfolks in this room today and right now understand that there is an \neffort underway to pursue tax reform, to make our Tax Code simpler, \neasier to enforce, and to actually prevent the need to even pass \nlegislation such as the IRS OWES Act.\n  Until such time, we need legislation like this because it will bring \nmuch-needed transparency to an agency with a proven track record of \npoor management.\n  The IRS' offenses include targeting taxpayers and irresponsibly \ndirecting resources away from its core function of taxpayer services, \nresulting in the abysmal 2015 tax filing system.\n  It has probably been said in this room before, but this simple bill \nwould subject IRS user fees to congressional oversight by directing \nthem to the Treasury's general fund and subjecting them to the \ncongressional appropriations process.\n  In 2014, the IRS only used 44 percent of its user fees account on \ntaxpayer services. Last year this number dropped significantly, with \nthe IRS using only 10 percent of its user fees account on taxpayer \nservices.\n  American taxpayers all over the country felt the pain of that choice \nlast year. Our tax system depends on voluntary compliance. Poor \ntaxpayer assistance like the IRS provided last year would likely \nencourage taxpayers to perhaps cheat and actually make it more \ndifficult for taxpayers to even comply.\n  According to a GAO report, last year only 38 percent of callers \nwanting to speak to an IRS representative were able to reach one. This \nis unacceptable from an agency whose core function is revenue \ncollection.\n  H.R. 4885 will strengthen congressional oversight over the IRS not by \nlimiting funding, but by ensuring the IRS uses its funding for its core \nfunctions of revenue collection and taxpayer assistance and not for \nunrelated purposes, which make it harder for taxpayers to comply with \nan already complicated Tax Code.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Who are the 7.3 million people who get the tax credit\n\n[[Page H1867]]\n\nunder the Affordable Care Act? Does helping them fall within your \ndefinition of taxpayer assistance?\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. I don't want innocent people to be hurt. And \nwith what has taken place at the IRS, I would hope all of us would \nagree it is unacceptable.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Let me rephrase my question:\n  Does assisting the 7.3 million people who get tax credits under the \nAffordable Care Act qualify in your definition of taxpayer assistance?\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Well, I don't have the actual definition at \nthe top of my mind. But, clearly, the IRS has chosen priorities--some \nover others--that I think----\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. If I have more time later, I would be happy to be \ninvolved in a colloquy with you on this.\n  Mr. SMITH of Nebraska. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 20 seconds.\n  It is striking that somehow giving assistance to 7.3 million people \nwho get the tax credits--16 million people who are under the Affordable \nCare Act--to implement that does not fall within the definition of \ntaxpayer assistance. And my friends, Smith, neither one of them, could \nactually answer that, and I think it is telling.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nBecerra), the distinguished leader of the Democratic Caucus and a \nsenior member of the Committee on Ways and Means, who thinks that we \nought to provide service to our taxpayers.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, one of the easiest things you can do to get \npeople to cheer for you is to bash someone or something that everyone \nloves to hate, as you have heard it said before. I don't know if there \nis a better example of this than the IRS. Everyone loves to hate the \nIRS.\n  At the end of the day, though, if you want to have our troops paid, \nif you want to have our security handled at our airports, if you want \nto make sure that our national parks are protected, you need to have \nthe revenues; and so we need the IRS so that all of us who voluntarily \nare supposed to pay our taxes do so and pay our fair share.\n  Again, we could all point to the story of the case where the IRS \nflubbed it, didn't do a good job, and so it is easy to pile on. If we \ncould create a pinata that looked like the IRS, I guarantee you it \nwould be the hottest selling pinata in the history of pinata making. So \nlet's just put that on the table. Let's grant that to everyone. It is \neasy to bash the IRS.\n  Let's go to this bill, though. What will this bill do?\n  First, it does some really strange things, and then it does some \nreally harmful things. But worse than that, it is never going to become \nlaw. So we are spending time talking about something that is never \ngoing to become law.\n  But on what the bill does, let me give you a clear example of why it \nis so unfortunate that we do this IRS bashing. One of these provisions \ntells the IRS that it cannot retain the dollars it collects as user \nfees for having provided services to individuals or corporations that \nseek out special services from the IRS.\n  You have got a big corporation; you just broke it up into pieces; you \nwant to make sure you are filing your taxes correctly. You need a \nspecial advisory opinion from the IRS, which isn't something they \ntypically do for most Americans, so they say: Well, that is extra \nstuff; we are going to have to charge you a user fee for having done \nthat for you.\n  Principally, these user fees come from wealthier companies or \nwealthier individuals who have more complicated tax filings that they \nhave to submit. We charge them that because not every American has to \nrequest that kind of service from the IRS. IRS collects that fee.\n  This bill says: IRS, you don't get to keep the money, even though you \nhad to provide the service and pull your resources and your personnel \nfrom doing the regular taxpayers' filings and examining those to do \nthis special work. You cannot keep that even though you expended \nresources to do that work.\n  The best way I could compare it is to a situation I encountered \nrecently. I participated in a funeral service, and it was a very \ndignified service. At the end of the service in the place of worship in \nthe church, we all caravanned together with the hearse and the family \nof the deceased individual to the cemetery. It was a long line of \nvehicles. It was a great service. A lot of people showed up.\n  We were fortunate to have the assistance of police officers who \ndirected traffic because we went through a whole bunch of \nintersections. We had to make sure that, to the degree possible, we \ndidn't disrupt traffic a whole lot and we didn't have a whole bunch of \naccidents on the way to the cemetery. It all worked out perfectly. At \nthe end, once we reached the cemetery, the officers left.\n  Now, the officers did that job not because that is the usual course \nof business for police officers in our cities and our counties. They \ndid that because the police department offers that service so that we \ndon't disrupt the greater activity around our city when there is a \nfuneral. That way you offer the dignity to that family as well in the \nservices for that deceased individual. You pay for that service to the \npolice department because you pulled police officers off their regular \nbeat to do that work. That is a user fee.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Rothfus). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, this bill's proposal on user fees is \ntantamount to telling the police department: You must provide that \nservice for people to be able to have their funeral service, but you \nwill not get compensated for your police officers being pulled from \ntheir regular duty of protecting our streets to help with that funeral \nservice.\n  It is inane. It is crazy to do that. So rather than do bills that are \ngoing to go nowhere, let's get our job done. We get elected to do some \nvery important things. On the tax side, we certainly could do what Mr. \nDoggett mentioned earlier. Let's go after those Benedict Arnolds who \ndecide they are going to leave the country not because they want to go \nlive somewhere else, it is that they don't want to pay taxes in \nAmerica. So they are going to leave their place of legal residency as \nAmerica. They are still going to have their home here, but they are \njust going to call home somewhere else for legal purposes so they don't \npay taxes. Billions of dollars we are losing, we know, as a result of \ncorporations and all our wealthy individuals incorporating in places \nlike the Cayman Islands.\n  Secondly, all the money that is being spent in campaigns today is \nbeing done by what are called not-for-profit organizations that we used \nto think used to do social welfare.\n  Now guess what they are doing?\n  They are spending their money on campaigns. We need to stop that as \nwell. That is what we should be doing--doing our job, not taking money \nout of an agency that is trying to make sure that we do this the right \nway for everyone who pays their fair share of taxes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I hope that there is an opportunity here for us to take a hard look \nat some of the issues surrounding the Republican assault on the IRS. We \nhave documented that they have dramatically cut not just the resources, \nbut the ability of people to implement it. There has been a refusal to \nhire people in some cases who make for the government $5,000 an hour or \nmore.\n  Now, these are people who would be dealing with audits for the people \nwho, you know, for one reason or another give themselves the benefit of \nthe doubt when it comes to filling out the tax form. So this audit \nfunction makes a significant amount of money for the taxpayers, money \nthat doesn't have to come from increased taxes or reduced services.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is a tax gap. It is well known and well \ndocumented, $400 to $450 billion or more a year. Being able to \nadequately fund the Internal Revenue Service will enable the government \nto deal with an amount of money that is due and payable and owing, and \nit is usually because they have more money to lose track of or to be \nable to have different alternatives for how they characterize it or how\n\n[[Page H1868]]\n\nthey choose to move forward. It tends to be larger, they tend to be \nbusiness enterprises and people who have more money.\n  But it is not just dealing with the audit function. I had a \nfascinating roundtable discussion in my hometown last month where I had \nattorneys and accountants who specialize in the practice dealing with \ntax practices. They were lamenting the problems, not just the fact that \nthere isn't effective audits anymore. They think there are very few. \nBut it is more fundamental than that.\n  They often will look one of their clients in the eye and say: Yes, \nyou are right, there is a problem. The mistake is in your favor, but \nbecause the service level has been allowed to deteriorate so badly, it \nwill cost you more money in my fees to get the $500 or $2,000 error \ncorrected.\n  That just makes one cringe. Now, the notice that somehow putting \nmoney to implement the Affordable Care Act is not customer service is \nludicrous, and I tried to get my friends on the other side of the aisle \nto talk to me about customer service.\n  How is it not customer service to help people with the tax credits \nthat are involved with the Affordable Care Act, which over 7 million \npeople get?\n  How is it not customer service to make sure that it is administered \nfairly for over 16 million people who fall under the Affordable Care \nAct?\n  Absolutely it is. This $500 million cut would further degrade the \nability to provide the service that not only should we require, but our \nemployees in the IRS want. I would strongly urge the rejection of this \nill-guided proposal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Missouri. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  The IRS has not shown this body, they have not shown the Missourians \nthat I represent, and they have not shown all of the American taxpayers \nthat they have been good stewards of user fees. They have a slush fund \nof nearly $500 million. This body, over a course since fiscal year \n2013, has not cut $1; not $1 has this body cut in assistance to \ntaxpayer services to the IRS.\n  The Commissioner yesterday testified before the Committee on Ways and \nMeans and said that he is the one who cut $134 million last year alone \nin taxpayer services. The government is supposed to help serve the \npeople. The people are not supposed to serve the government.\n  Mr. Speaker, there should not be one agency that is independent of \nCongress. Agencies were created by Congress. They should be funded by \nCongress. And no agency should have a $500 million slush fund that they \ncan decide to spend the money any way that they want. This is not an \nuncommon practice for us to require agencies, when they collect user \nfees, to have congressional oversight and to be subject to \nappropriations. We are just trying to make sure that the IRS is held \naccountable, like numerous other agencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask the body to support this great piece of \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 687, I call up \nthe bill (H.R. 1206) to prohibit the hiring of additional Internal \nRevenue Service employees until the Secretary of the Treasury certifies \nthat no employee of the Internal Revenue Service has a seriously \ndelinquent tax debt, and ask for its immediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``No Hires for the Delinquent \n     IRS Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON IRS HIRING OF NEW EMPLOYEES UNTIL \n                   CERTIFICATION THAT NO IRS EMPLOYEE HAS A \n                   SERIOUSLY DELINQUENT TAX DEBT.\n\n       (a) In General.--No officer or employee of the United \n     States may extend an offer of employment in the Internal \n     Revenue Service to any individual until after the Secretary \n     of the Treasury has submitted to Congress either the \n     certification described in subsection (b) or the report \n     described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Certification.--\n       (1) In general.--The certification referred to in \n     subsection (a) is a written certification by the Secretary \n     that the Internal Revenue Service does not employ any \n     individual who has a seriously delinquent tax debt.\n       (2) Seriously delinquent tax debt.--For purposes of this \n     section, the term ``seriously delinquent tax debt'' means an \n     outstanding debt under the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 for \n     which a notice of lien has been filed in public records \n     pursuant to section 6323 of such Code, except that such term \n     does not include--\n       (A) a debt that is being paid in a timely manner pursuant \n     to an agreement under section 6159 or section 7122 of such \n     Code;\n       (B) a debt with respect to which a collection due process \n     hearing under section 6330 of such Code, or relief under \n     subsection (a), (b), or (f) of section 6015 of such Code, is \n     requested or pending;\n       (C) a debt with respect to which a levy has been made under \n     section 6331 of such Code (or a debt with respect to which \n     the individual agrees to be subject to a levy made under such \n     section); and\n       (D) a debt with respect to which relief under section \n     6343(a)(1)(D) of such Code is granted.\n       (c) Report.--The report referred to in subsection (a) is a \n     report that--\n       (1) states that the certification described in subsection \n     (b) cannot be made;\n       (2) provides an explanation of why such certification is \n     not possible;\n       (3) outlines the remedial actions that would be required \n     for the Secretary to be in a position to so certify; and\n       (4) provides an indication of the time that would be \n     required for those actions to be completed.\n       (d) Effective Date.--This section shall apply to offers of \n     employment extended after December 31, 2016.\n\n     SEC. 3.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members\n\n[[Page H1869]]\n\nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 1206, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from North Carolina?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act, prohibits the IRS \nfrom expanding its workforce unless the agency either certifies to \nCongress that IRS employees do not have seriously delinquent tax debts \nor explains why the agency is unable to provide this required \ncertification.\n  I want to commend my friend and colleague from North Carolina (Mr. \nRouzer) for helping bring attention to the fact that some of the IRS' \nown employees, Mr. Speaker, have serious delinquencies on their \npersonal tax obligations.\n  The American public expects IRS employees--the same people, the same \nemployees that audit American taxpayers--to abide by the Federal tax \nlaws they enforce. However, Mr. Speaker, just last year, the Treasury \nInspector General for Tax Administration reviewed the IRS' handling of \nemployees that were found to have willfully violated the tax laws. So, \nthat is how the IRS is handling the matter of their own employees who \nhave willfully violated the tax law.\n  Shockingly, Mr. Speaker, in 61 percent of those cases of IRS \nemployees who have willfully violated the tax law, the IRS decided to \nretain the employees and failed to document why these employees were \nnot fired.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is unacceptable and the American people deserve \nbetter. Allowing IRS employees to continue administering our tax laws \nwhen they, themselves, are in violation of that law undermines the \ntrust of the American taxpayer.\n  My friend Mr. Rouzer's legislation is an important step forward \ntowards creating accountability and restoring the public's trust in the \nIRS.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  This is really a couple of sad days for this institution. Here we are \nfilling in time with bills that are going nowhere and are deeply \nmistaken. No action on the budget, no action on the tragedy in Flint, \nno action on the needs of Puerto Rico, no action on Zika--essentially, \nthe Republicans are about no action. So instead, they bring up this \nseries of bills, and now, H.R. 1206.\n  Let's look at it carefully. What this bill says is that the IRS \ncannot hire a single person until the Secretary of the Treasury issues \na written certification that not a single employee in the entire agency \nhas a serious tax debt. So when an employee quits or is terminated, \nthat position could not be filled until an examination was completed of \nthe tax status of every one of the 80,000 IRS employees.\n  Realistically, to certify that no single employee has a significant \ntax debt, the IRS would need to immediately and continuously terminate \nany employee with a Federal tax lien. The IRS already has the authority \nto terminate an employee for delinquent taxes. This was established in \n1998 in section 1203 of the IRS Restructuring and Reform Act.\n  The White House's Statement of Administration Policy says that the \nbill is ``unworkable in operation, as `seriously delinquent' debts \ncould be as low as $1 and tax liens are recorded on a case-by-case \nbasis.''\n  This bill is yet another politically motivated attack on the IRS and \nits 80,000 employees, who have one of the lowest rates of tax \ndelinquency in the Federal Government at around 1 percent.\n  I wish you would just look at the chart and see where the IRS is \ncompared to the Congress. If you are really worried, ladies and \ngentlemen, about tax delinquency, we would need to look no further than \nhere in the House, where tax delinquency among employees is more than 5 \npercent.\n  The administration opposes this bill, stating further: ``These bills \nwould impose unnecessary constraints on the Internal Revenue Service's \noperations without improving the agency's ability to administer the Tax \nCode and serve taxpayers.''\n  As I said at the beginning, there is a lot of work that should be \nundertaken in this House. Instead, this is essentially an empty Chamber \nwith empty legislation. These bills are nothing more than a distraction \nto cover up the basic failure of the Republican majority to bring on \nlegislation that would truly meet the needs of the American people. I \nurge that we oppose this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that the gentleman from Georgia \n(Mr. Lewis), a most distinguished member of our committee, control the \nremainder of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer), the sponsor of this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROUZER. I thank my colleague and friend from North Carolina (Mr. \nHolding) for yielding time to discuss this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I filed this bill, H.R. 1206, the No Hires for the \nDelinquent IRS Act, in response to reading news reports of more than \n1,500 employees at the IRS who willfully failed to follow their own tax \nguidelines and, in a number of cases, were found to be seriously \ndelinquent on their taxes.\n  For starters, it is the height of hypocrisy for the very agency that \nis charged with collecting taxes to have employees who refuse to adhere \nto the standards and guidelines which the rest of us must follow and \nabide by. Of course, this is in addition to the egregious behavior and \nabuse of power some in the agency displayed when they targeted \norganizations for their political affiliations and beliefs. We all \nremember how the IRS misled taxpayers and the Congress in an effort to \ndeny that such activity ever even occurred. Thankfully, the truth \nalways has a way of being revealed, at least eventually.\n  I think we can all agree that the American people deserve a \ngovernment that works for them, not against them. Certainly, the IRS is \none of the most cumbersome, customer-unfriendly agencies in the Federal \nGovernment, regardless of how much they are funded. Anyone who denies \nthis hasn't been listening to the American people.\n  Now, let me be clear. There are plenty of fine civil servants working \nhard at the IRS and in all other agencies of the Federal Government. It \nis the culture of arrogance and unchecked bureaucratic power that has \ndeveloped within these agencies that is the problem and is the catalyst \nfor the type of disregard and double standard this bill aims to help \naddress. This culture starts with the leadership at the top.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is very simple. It prohibits the IRS from \nhiring any new additional employees until the agency can certify that \nevery one of their employees who are out of step with the tax \nrequirements imposed on the American people have a plan to achieve \ncompliance. Now, who can argue against this?\n  For all the moaning and groaning I have heard from the other side of \nthe aisle the past couple of days, this is not a bill that merits even \none vote of opposition. This is a commonsense bill that will help \nencourage the IRS to clean up its act, and I encourage my colleagues to \nvote for it.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the bill, H.R. 1206, \npreventing the IRS from hiring anyone--not one person, not one \nindividual--until the IRS proves that there is not a single employee in \nthe entire agency with a serious tax debt.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask: How can a hiring freeze possibly help taxpayers? \nEvery person in this body knows that the IRS already has the authority \nto fire anyone--any employee--for serious Federal tax issues. Congress \ngave the IRS this power in section 1203 of the IRS Restructuring and \nReform Act. It was signed into law in 1998, and it is working.\n  Last year, Mr. Speaker, the Department of the Treasury had a lower \ntax delinquency rate than any Federal agency and lower than the \nAmerican public. It was lower than the Congress.\n  This is a mean piece of legislation and it is not right. It is not \nfair. It is\n\n[[Page H1870]]\n\nmean-spirited. So, I ask you: Why do we want to punish these Federal \nemployees? Why do we want to go after the majority of IRS workers who \nare just hardworking, dedicated public servants? More importantly, Mr. \nSpeaker, what good does this bill do?\n  Every year--not one year, but every year--the IRS is expected to do \nmore with less. We cannot get blood from a turnip. This legislation \ndoes nothing to help taxpayers get the service they need and deserve. \nIt does nothing--not one thing--to fight identity theft. This does \nnothing to stop stolen returns. It does nothing to help the taxpayers \nspeak to a live IRS staff person in a timely manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is all about a message. It is a talking point. \nIt is so sad that we have come to this point. As a Congress, we can do \nbetter.\n  Mr. Speaker, some of us here are ready to do the people's work. This \nis purely a waste of time. As Mr. Levin stated, this piece of \nlegislation is not going anywhere.\n  Last week, I introduced the Taxpayer Protection Act. My bill responds \nto the real needs of American taxpayers.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  There are many other good ideas to help taxpayers, but these bills \nare not being considered by this body this week.\n  Instead, Mr. Speaker, we are considering a bill, as I said before, \nthat is mean, downright mean, a bill that is unnecessary, a bill that \nwould do more harm than good.\n  We owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the American people, to the \nAmerican taxpayer, to do better. We can do better.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge each and every one of my colleagues to vote \n``no'' on this pointless and harmful piece of legislation. It is the \nright thing to do, to vote ``no.'' This is not good for the Congress. \nIt is not good for the Ways and Means Committee.\n  Why do we want to point? It is pointless to punish one IRS worker. \nMore than 80,000 employees, and for one person, just one person, one \nindividual, for tax debt, then they cannot hire an employee.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve and expect all \nIRS employees to abide by the Federal tax laws that the IRS is charged \nwith administrating, period, end of story.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California (Mrs. Mimi \nWalters).\n  Mrs. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support \nof the No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act.\n  Between 2004 and 2013, nearly 1,600 IRS employees intentionally \nviolated tax laws, according to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration.\n  Just last year, the same Inspector General reported that the IRS \nrehired 141 former employees who had bungled their own tax returns. \nFive of those rehires had intentionally failed to file their returns at \nall.\n  Think about that for a moment. The Federal bureaucrats who are \nresponsible for ensuring the American people pay their taxes are not \npaying their own taxes, and they face no repercussion for botching \ntheir own returns.\n  This is one more example of how Washington is out of touch with the \npeople it is meant to serve. It is no wonder the American people do not \nhave faith in this Federal agency.\n  This bill will require the IRS to exclusively hire employees who pay \ntheir own taxes. It is essential to protecting American taxpayers and \nensuring the IRS is held accountable. It is just common sense.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 1206.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman.\n  This bill is just the next segment of Republican Tax Distraction Day.\n  Certainly, we should focus on misconduct, on delinquencies, from \nwhatever the source. But here, on Republicans Tax Distraction Day, they \nare about distracting attention from their failure to address the real \nproblem with reference to delinquencies and misconduct, and that is a \nproblem that they have just shown total indifference about.\n  For anyone who was listening even a little bit last week, world news \naround the globe focused on something called the Panama Papers, 11.5 \nmillion files explored over the course of an entire year by the \nInternational Consortium of Investigative Journalists detailing how \nsome people, especially the very wealthy, have used the secrecy of an \noffshore tax haven in Panama to avoid paying their taxes and, in some \ncases, illegal money laundering by organized crime and other forms of \nofficial corruption. This isn't just an American problem, but there is \nno American exceptionalism to it either. It is an international \nproblem.\n  Our European allies have responded to the Panama Papers by initiating \nnew efforts to try to get at this problem of tax abuse. And the truth \nof the matter is, this is just the tip of the iceberg with this 11.5 \nmillion papers because it is only about abuse in one of a number of \nsecret tax havens.\n  But, of course, it did not attract universal attention. If you were \nin Beijing today and you were to search for the Panama Papers on the \nWeb, what you would find is: Sorry, no relevant material.\n  There is another place that you will find nothing about the Panama \nPapers, and that is in the House Ways and Means Committee and the \nRepublican Caucus because they haven't been interested. They have shown \nconstant indifference to problems that are generated from these tax \nhavens, from the dodging, from the avoidance, from the evasion that has \nbeen going on, when that ought to be the focus of our attention. \nInstead of real abuse, they focus on imagined abuse.\n  And keep in mind, by the way, this particular piece of legislation is \ndesigned to cover IRS employees for their delinquencies. They bother to \nexempt the Congress of the United States from that provision.\n  But I think the focus ought to be on these abuses and delinquencies \nthat are occurring in other places that are costing us real dollars. \nThe Panama Papers show the importance of our working together with our \nallies to address lawlessness and money laundering and tax evasion. \nThey show why we need to be participating in the Base Erosion and \nProfit Shifting initiative.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEWIS. I yield the gentleman another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. They show why the Stop Tax Haven Abuse legislation that \nI have introduced and the Corporate EXIT Fairness Act, to deal with \nthose who renounce their citizenship, why they deserve a hearing and \nattention, the attention that they are not getting today or any day \nfrom this Republican Congress.\n  If this Congress will do nothing to address this tax evasion and \navoidance, the least we can do is to do no harm. But today's action \ndoes do harm. Rather than getting at the real problems, they seek to \nlimit an already underfunded agency.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. LEWIS. I yield the gentleman another 30 seconds.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. They seek to limit, impair, and hinder an already \nunderfunded agency in doing its job of tax avoidance so that everyone \ncontributes to the costs of our national security and vital services.\n  We need to be strengthening the law, ensuring fair enforcement, and \nensuring that we have the resources necessary to keep America the \nstrongest country in the world.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, it is pretty straightforward. The IRS needs \nto earn and keep the trust of the American taxpayer. And I say ``earn'' \nwith emphasis because the IRS has lost the trust of the American \ntaxpayer.\n  Allowing IRS employees to continue administering our tax laws when \nthey are in violation of the law undermines the people's trust. It does \nnot earn the people's trust.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nWalberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Speaker, I say thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank \nyou to my colleagues for their hard work on this package of bills to \nrein in the IRS and make it more accountable to taxpayers.\n\n[[Page H1871]]\n\n  Earlier this week, the taxpayers in my home State of Michigan and \nacross the country reflected on another year of a tax burden that is \ntoo high and take-home pay that is too low. But not only is our current \ntax system broken, the agency in charge of enforcing it is, too. Time \nafter time, the IRS has proven that it can't be trusted to clean up its \nact and fails to practice what it preaches.\n  In a report last year, the IRS inspector general found that hundreds \nof employees are violating IRS guidelines and failing to pay their \npersonal tax obligations. Those are obligations, and I tend to think \nthat the good employees of the IRS would be encouraged as well if their \ncolleagues paid their taxes.\n  The No Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act would simply--and this is \nwhat we are talking about--prevent the IRS from any additional hiring \nuntil it verifies that its current employees have paid their own taxes.\n  Now, a good friend and colleague of mine has described this as a \nwaste of time. The single mom in Monroe, Michigan, doesn't think that \nthis is a waste of time. The family farmer in Jackson doesn't think \nthat this is a waste of time. The small-business owner in Charlotte \ndoesn't think that this is a waste of time. Why? Because they all have \nto pay their taxes on time.\n  People who work at the IRS should have to play by the same rules as \neveryone else does. And, in fact, that might assist them in making sure \nthat congressional employees pay their taxes too, and any other \ndepartment of the Federal Government pays their taxes too, because why? \nThey pay their taxes, and now they can do what their job asks them to \ndo.\n  The good colleague and gentleman from Georgia understands, I am \ncertain, the principle that we both know well, where it says: To whom \nmuch is given, much is required. Much responsibility has been given to \nthe IRS, and much is required. Pay your taxes.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I enjoyed listening to my friend from \nMichigan, and I would just say why shouldn't we lead by example here in \nCongress, to whom much has been given? Shouldn't we have the \ncredibility?\n  I would have supported this bill in Ways and Means, with one simple \namendment. I offered an amendment to apply the same provisions to \nCongress.\n  The House of Representatives has a worse record of compliance with \nour employees than the IRS. The IRS has the best record in the Federal \nGovernment. Every single department in the executive branch has a \nbetter record in Congress.\n  Why should we have over 500 people on that chart not paying their \ntaxes?\n  If it is such a great idea that you can implement this smoothly and \nsimply for the IRS, why shouldn't it be easier to implement with \nCongress, which has about 10 percent of the employees but has four \ntimes more delinquency?\n  Well, people on the committee were all aflutter. They did not, on a \ntechnical basis, allow me to offer this amendment, so I went to the \nRules Committee.\n  I think this is a good principle. People ought to pay their taxes. \nBut if you are going to use a sledgehammer like this and it is possible \nto administer, why doesn't it apply to Congress?\n  Congress sets the rules. Congress funds the IRS. Congress passes that \ncrazy Internal Revenue Code that people hate and then blame the IRS for \nadministering what Congress passed.\n  Now, I am mystified. If this is not just a stunt to try and divert \nattention from the fact that Congress and the Republican leadership has \nbeen attacking the IRS, defunding it, making its job a difficult job \nunder the best of circumstances, why not apply it to Congress?\n  Why shouldn't we set the example, particularly when we have more \npeople under our employment who are on that big list? Don't we lead by \nexample? Shouldn't people look to us?\n  The hypocrisy in not allowing my amendment to apply to Congress may \nbe one of the reasons why Congress is the only entity in the Federal \nGovernment that has probably lower ratings than the IRS. It is because \nwe are not willing to be accountable, because we play games, because we \ndo things that we know will never be enacted into law but would be a \ngood sound bite on somebody's Web site or a quick interview.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. I am going to give all of my colleagues an \nopportunity to step up and to cosponsor legislation that would extend \nto Congress the same degree of scrutiny as they want to have for the \nIRS.\n  Even though the IRS problem is much smaller than ours--it is less \nthan one-quarter--what is good for the goose is good for the gander. I \ndon't know if this is sauce, but I would invite my colleagues to step \nup and not play games. Have Congress be accountable.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the American people deserve and expect IRS \nemployees to follow the same tax laws that they administer. It is very \nsimple.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Rouzer), the sponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, there are several things that come to mind \nhere. Number one, each Member of Congress is held accountable every 2 \nyears by the voters of their respective district.\n  The last time I checked, this is referred to as the people's House. \nWe are either here to represent our constituencies and our people back \nhome or we are representing the bureaucracy of the Federal Government.\n  Now, I don't know what side my other colleagues, particularly on the \nother side of the aisle, care to be on as it relates to this, but I \npersonally think it is important to represent our people back home, not \nthe bureaucracies here in Washington, D.C.\n  The other thing I have heard as it relates to this bill is it is \nmean. My goodness. What is mean about this? All it says is, when the \nIRS can certify that their employees who are delinquent have a plan to \nget back into compliance, they are able to hire again. Until then, \nthere is a freeze on hiring.\n  There is nothing mean about that. It is just good common sense. It is \nan encouragement, and it is an incentive for the IRS to clean up its \nact.\n  Then we hear about the funding issue. I have never ever, ever once \nheard the other side say that there was plenty of funding for any \nFederal agency, the IRS or any agency.\n  I will tell you what is mean and what is destructive is an \nobstructive, intrusive Federal Government that does not allow the \nindividual American people and our families to do what they do best, \nand that is grow a business, make a profit, and create jobs.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. ROUZER. I read somewhere not long ago that rules and regulations \nof the IRS and elsewhere have cost this economy $2 trillion in the last \nfiscal year--$2 trillion.\n  If we got rid of the rules and regulations that are harming the \neconomy and that are keeping our economy from growing at a robust pace, \nthen the IRS would end up having a whole lot more money.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. ROUZER. I yield to the gentleman from Oregon.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Why shouldn't we have the same rule apply to the \n10,000 employees of the House of Representatives?\n  Mr. ROUZER. This bill is about accountability. Every Member of this \nCongress is held accountable every 2 years.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has again expired.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my \ncolleague for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to H.R. 1206, which would \nrestrict the IRS' ability to hire qualified personnel until it has \ndocumented that\n\n[[Page H1872]]\n\neach one of its 80,000 employees has not violated an unusual, uncertain \ntax standard. This legislation is totally unnecessary and promises to \nfurther undermine taxpayer service and tax enforcement.\n  First of all, it is totally unnecessary, suggesting that IRS \nemployees are tax delinquent when, in reality, IRS employees \ndemonstrate a tax compliance rate much higher than that of Members of \nCongress or other Federal agencies.\n  Indeed, 99 percent of IRS employees are tax compliant in contrast to \nonly 95 percent of the House of Representatives.\n  Further, IRS employees already are subject to the Federal Payment \nLevy Program that can levy Federal salaries to recover tax debts. \nCertainly, this is a bill in search of a problem.\n  Secondly, this bill would further impede the ability of the IRS to \nserve taxpayers and enforce tax laws. Due to Republican insistence on \ndramatically reducing the IRS funding by over $1 billion in the last 5 \nyears, the IRS has already experienced extraordinary reductions in \npersonnel and service.\n  Seven former IRS Commissioners from both parties have spoken about \nthis unprecedented reduction and its negative impact on our tax system.\n  My constituents, your constituents, and constituents all over the \ncountry have suffered enough. Our national debt has suffered. Every \ntime we collect $1, that yields another $4 in revenue.\n  So I would urge my colleagues to vote against this bill. I certainly \nwill do so.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the gentleman notes the Federal Payment Levy Program. I \nwould like to clarify that this bill would only treat an employee as \nseriously delinquent in the most egregious case where no payments were \nbeing made because wages can be levied under the Federal Payment Levy \nProgram. Most employees would fall within one of the exceptions and \nwould be within the definition of seriously delinquent.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon \n(Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I like the notion of accountability. It is true that we \nare up for election every other year, and I am sure that my friend from \nNorth Carolina has a system in his office to make sure that the 18 \npeople who work for him are not on this list of over 500 people. But \nthat is not a suitable accountability. We are talking about an entire \nagency.\n  I think there is no good reason that we shouldn't have the same sort \nof accountability for almost 10,000 people who work for the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Shouldn't we collectively set an example? After all, there are four \ntimes as many people who have tax delinquency who work for the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  Why shouldn't we set an example? If it can be easily administered and \nwe want to send a message, why don't we send a message that we care \nabout it?\n  We can learn from the gentleman about his system to make sure there \nare no tax delinquencies in his office. I would like to know that, and \nI am sure the leadership of the House of Representatives would like to \nimplement it here.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. DeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to this bill. \nIt would hamstring the IRS and would make no real impact on tax \navoidance in the United States. This bill is shameful.\n  If we are serious about cracking down on tax dodging, we would focus \non ending corporate inversions. Our government must stand up and say to \nthese corporations: Stop cheating the American people.\n  We cannot continue to allow corporations to pretend that they are \nAmerican companies reaping the benefits that this country has to offer \nand all the while claiming to be a foreign corporation when the tax \nbill comes. They don't pay their fair share of taxes in the United \nStates.\n  Corporations are cheating the American people out of revenue that \ncould make such a real difference in the lives of children and families \nso that they can dodge taxes and gouge prices.\n  A quote from an article in The New York Times last week by Nicholas \nKristof says: ``The Real Welfare Cheats. One academic study found that \ntax dodging by major corporations costs the U.S. Treasury up to $111 \nbillion a year. By my math, less than one-fifth of that annually would \nmean more than enough to pay the additional costs of full-day \nprekindergarten for all 4-year-olds''--that is about $15 billion--\n``prevent lead poisoning in tens of thousands of children ($2 billion), \nprovide books and parent coaching for at-risk kids across the country \n($1 billion) and end family homelessness ($2 billion).''\n  The administration has issued new rules to curb inversions, but the \nCongress--the Congress--needs to work to end this abhorrent practice.\n  It is absurd that the U.S. Treasury does not have the authority to \nshare a list of inverted corporations with other government agencies. \nCongress can give them that authority.\n  It is up to us to make sure that Treasury can provide such a list. \nCongress also needs to strengthen the definition of an inverted \ncorporation in the Tax Code. We should also consider inversions a deal \nbreaker when we dole out Federal contracts.\n  Inverted corporations should not receive Federal contracts. They are \nbad actors, and we should not be rewarding them with lucrative \ncontracts for moving their mailboxes to avoid paying their taxes in the \nUnited States.\n  That is why Congressman Doggett and I introduced the No Federal \nContracts for Corporate Deserters Act, so that inverted companies will \nno longer be able to benefit from Federal contracts at the expense of \ncompanies who do pay their fair share.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Instead of pursuing this unnecessary and misguided bill \nthat would punish the IRS, but honestly makes very little impact on tax \navoidance, what we should do is we need to go after those corporations. \nThey game our system at the expense of the American taxpayer of up to \nalmost $11 billion.\n  Wouldn't every American like to have an opportunity to be able to say \nthat they can send their kid to school, that they don't have to risk \nhomelessness, and that they can provide their kid with an education \ninstead of these corporations taking and ripping off the United States?\n  Let's get real on the floor of this House of Representatives. Do you \nwant to do the right thing? Do you want to do what is morally \nresponsible? Then, let us end these inverted corporations. Let them pay \ntheir fair share of taxes or tell them that it is illegal and that we \ncan prosecute them.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me make a point that is being lost in the debate \nhere. Current law actually requires that the IRS fire willfully \nnoncompliant employees unless they have reasonable cause for not paying \ntheir taxes. That is current law.\n  Yet, in most cases--61 percent of cases, Mr. Speaker--the IRS fails \nto even document why delinquent employees were not penalized.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker--and I think the American people would be \nstunned to hear this--there are instances of IRS employees who are \ndelinquent in their taxes who have not only not been fired, but have \nreceived bonuses.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Rouzer).\n  Mr. ROUZER. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to this debate today and the \ndiscussion about inversions. There is a broader point that is missed \nhere.\n  Inversions aren't even an issue if America is the most attractive \nplace to do business. Capital investment goes where it is welcome, not \nwhere it is unwelcome.\n  Why do you hear about inversions today? It is because we have an \noutdated Tax Code that significantly needs reform. It is because we \nhave more rules and regulations than we\n\n[[Page H1873]]\n\nhave ever had before that are stifling the economy to the tune of $2 \ntrillion annually. It is because we have a healthcare law in place that \nis killing the economy and job growth.\n  I can't tell you how many businesses I meet and go and visit all \nacross the district that are sitting right at 49 employees. I wonder \nwhy. It is because of the healthcare law that is unworkable and \ndestroying the American economy.\n  Again, capital and investment goes where it is welcome. How do we \nmake that possible again? We reform our Tax Code so that this is the \nmost attractive place to do business in the world. We get rid of the \nrules and regulations that make it so difficult to do business, all the \nrules and regulations coming out of labor, EPA, and everywhere else.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  It is not just one, it is all of them. It is death by a thousand \ncuts. I can't tell you how many people I have talked to all across my \ndistrict who say: David, do you know what? Business is just no fun \nanymore.\n  And so they are plotting their exit strategy. They are not plotting \nthe strategy of growth. They are plotting a strategy to exit and retire \nwith what they have been able to achieve so far.\n  Here is the fundamental question of this bill. Are we going to be on \nthe side of the American people? Or are we going to be on the side of \nthe bureaucracy? Are we going to defend the EPA? Are we going to defend \nthe IRS? Are we going to defend the Department of Labor? Are we going \nto defend all these rules and regulations that are killing the American \neconomy? Or are we going to stand with the American people? That is the \nquestion before us today.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Pocan)\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week represents another missed opportunity for \nCongress to take action on the challenges facing the American people.\n  I understand that we are at this point because the majority can't \npass a budget, they can't take action to combat the Zika virus, they \ncan't help the people of Flint, Michigan, and they can't address the \nopiate crisis.\n  Unfortunately, your right wing and your extreme right wing can't seem \nto agree with each other. Instead of taking real action, we are going \nto vote today to prohibit the IRS from hiring any new employees until \nthe Treasury certifies that none of the agency's existing employees \nhave unpaid taxes.\n  This legislation is both unworkable and unnecessary. IRS employees \nhave a tax compliance rate of over 99 percent, but a hiring freeze will \nhinder our ability to go after the real tax cheats in this country, and \nthat is something we should all be able to agree on.\n  Instead of arbitrary changes to the IRS, Congress needs to take \naction to make our Tax Code work for the American people instead of \ncorporate interests, something that is conspicuously absent from your \ndebate today.\n  Let's talk about how we can close loopholes that allow multinational \ncorporations to pay nothing in Federal income taxes while working class \nAmericans and small businesses pay their fair share.\n  Let's have a debate about the corporate tax dodgers who are able to \nshift their headquarters out of the country with a stroke of the pen, \nall while continuing to use our American infrastructure resources and \ncustomer base.\n  Let's talk about the thousands and thousands of tax-dodging \ncorporations, including the 18,000 corporations that are registered to \na single building in the Cayman Islands, a building full of post office \nboxes.\n  Today corporate profits are at an all-time high, but the share of \nFederal revenue from corporate taxes continues to shrink, dropping from \n33 percent of the revenue in 1952 to less than 10 percent today.\n  While many corporations complain about the 35 percent statutory tax \nrate, the reality is the effective tax rate is much lower. In fact, a \n2013 GAO report found that U.S. corporations pay an effective tax rate \nof just 12.6 percent. A recent study from Oxfam found that U.S. \ncorporations are currently hiding $1.4 trillion in profits from \ndomestic taxation in tax havens like in Panama and the Cayman Islands.\n  While corporations dodge paying their fair share in taxes, the burden \nfalls to the middle class and the small businesses in all of our \ndistricts, and that is just wrong. That is the reality of why we are \nhere with these useless bills in consideration this week. Once again, \nthe majority can't pass a budget well past the required deadline. Let's \nhave a serious conversation about how we can adjust our Tax Code away \nfrom the corporate interests and in favor of working families.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LEWIS. Mr. Speaker, we owe it to ourselves and we owe it to the \nAmerican taxpayers to do better. As a body, we can do better, much \nbetter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage each and every one of my colleagues to vote \n``no,'' to vote ``no'' on this pointless and harmful piece of \nlegislation. This bill is not worthy of the paper that it is written \non. Vote ``no'' on this mean-spirited bill. It is not the way to go.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Internal Revenue Service, the people who work there, most of \nthem, like most Americans, pay their taxes. The Internal Revenue \nService is charged, obviously, with administering the Tax Code, they \nare charged with collecting taxes.\n  I served a long time in the U.S. Attorney's Office, and I can tell \nyou that the Internal Revenue Service is probably the most intimidating \nFederal agency of the whole panoply of Federal agencies. The American \npeople have a right to expect IRS employees, these IRS employees who \nare auditing taxpayers, collecting taxes, to abide by Federal tax laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why there is a law on the books that says the \nIRS can fire an employee who is delinquent on their taxes. That is why \nI found it so amazing that when the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration went and did an investigation, they found that the IRS, \nthe bureaucrats that run the IRS, in 61 percent of the cases where you \nhad an IRS employee that was delinquent on their taxes, that they were \nnot fired.\n  Further, it was shocking to find that there were cases when these \nemployees who were delinquent on their taxes were not only not fired, \nbut they received a bonus.\n  This is unacceptable and the American people deserve better. Allowing \nIRS employees to continue administering our tax laws when they \nthemselves are in violation of that law undermines the trust of the \nAmerican taxpayer.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yea,'' on my colleague, Mr. Rouzer's \nlegislation, H.R. 1206. It is an important step forward in creating \naccountability and restoring the public's trust in the IRS.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jody B. Hice of Georgia). All time for \ndebate on the bill has expired.\n  The Chair understands that the amendment printed in House Report 114-\n502 will not be offered.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the previous question is ordered on the bill, \nas amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. KILDEE. I am opposed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Kildee moves to recommit the bill H.R. 1206 to the \n     Committee on Ways and Means with instructions to report the \n     same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendments:\n       Page 3, after line 11, insert the following:\n       (d) Special Rule of Applicability.--This section shall not \n     apply for any year if the Federal tax delinquency rate for \n     either chamber of Congress is greater than the Federal \n     delinquency tax rate for the Department of Treasury, as \n     published by the Internal Revenue Service in its Federal \n     Employee/Retiree Delinquency Initiative (FERDI) for the prior \n     year.\n       Page 3, line 12, strike ``(d)'' and Insert ``(e)''.\n\n\n[[Page H1874]]\n\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Michigan is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  This Republican bill is unnecessary because the IRS already, as has \nbeen said, has rules in place to terminate employees that are \ndelinquent on their taxes. But it is important to note that out of the \nentire Federal Government, the employees of the Treasury Department \nhave the lowest tax delinquency rate, a rate of 1.19 percent, one-\nfourth the delinquency rate for the U.S. House of Representatives, \nwhich is over 5 percent, and substantially lower than the delinquency \nrate for the general public, which is about 9 percent.\n  My motion would stop this bill from going into effect in any year \nthat the Federal tax delinquency rate of either the House or the Senate \nis more than that of the Treasury Department. It is that simple.\n  You know what we are doing here. We are taking precious time on the \nfloor of this House of Representatives to deal with a bill that will go \nnowhere, that has no impact, and is simply a talking point to continue \nto beat up the IRS.\n  Meanwhile, we have public health crises taking place. The Zika \ncrisis, which endangers pregnant women, what have we done on the floor \nof the House to deal with that real crisis? What have you brought to \nthe floor for us to vote on? Nothing.\n  And in my own hometown of Flint, Michigan, a city of 100,000 people \nwho now for 2 years have not been able to drink water that comes from \nthe tap because it has been poisoned by the terrible decisions of its \nState government, a community in crisis that has every right to expect \nthat its government, its Federal Government, would come to the aid of \nthese people, 100,000 people poisoned by their own State government in \ncrisis, 9,000 children under the age of 6 who for 2 years have had lead \ngoing into their bodies. Lead is a neurotoxin.\n  Three people today in Michigan have been criminally charged for \ninflicting this terrible tragedy on my hometown, a city in America in \ncrisis, facing a disaster. And what is the response of the United \nStates Congress? What is the response of the Republican leadership?\n  Not 1 minute devoted to coming up with a solution for the people in \nFlint. Nothing. More messaging bills, more talk, no help for people in \ncrisis, no effort to deal with the Zika crisis, and nothing, nothing \nfor this great American city facing an existential threat and facing \ngenerations of impacts, unless the State, that so far has failed to \nstep up, and the Federal Government act.\n  I sat through the hearings that have been held here in the United \nStates Congress and listened to Members, Democrats and Republicans, \noffer concern and offer sympathy. But when I introduced the Families of \nFlint Act, an effort that would share equally the responsibility for \nsolving this terrible crisis between the State and Federal Government, \nrather than arguing about who was at fault--we all have a sense that \nthe State of Michigan is at greatest fault--but rather than litigating \nthat question, we seek to solve the problem.\n  Not only do I not yet have one Republican cosponsor who has been \nwilling to step up, nearly 100 Democrats have, and I am sure there will \nbe more. And I asked for help from my friends on the other side, but no \ntime on this floor has been devoted to what is clearly one of the \nbiggest crises facing this Nation--a great American city facing a \nthreat, a literal threat to its existence, a threat to the health of \nthose people, a threat to the future of those children.\n  One of the first votes I cast when I came here to the House of \nRepresentatives was to cast a vote to provide relief to the victims of \nHurricane Sandy, not my district, not my community, not my region, but \nfellow Americans.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  I was proud of that vote. I was proud that, at that moment, on that \nday, as a Member of the House of Representatives, I was first an \nAmerican, and when other Americans were suffering, we were willing to \nhelp. Why not Flint? Why spend time on these meaningless political \nmessaging bills when there are real problems in this country that need \nto be addressed?\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we put aside this nonsense and get to the \nwork that the American people sent us here to do.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from North Carolina is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, the motion to recommit is an attempt by the \nminority to gloss over the IRS' failure to enforce its rules for IRS \nemployee conduct and over its failure to protect taxpayer dollars.\n  Quite simply, this bill would require the IRS to report to Congress \nas to whether it has employees with seriously delinquent tax debt or to \nreport why it cannot provide that information to Congress.\n  As I have said multiple times, the American people deserve and expect \nIRS employees to follow the same tax laws that they administer. That is \nan expectation of the IRS; so it is not surprising that the IRS would \nhave a low rate of delinquency amongst its employees. IRS employees \nshould know that it is current law. Current law actually requires that \nthe IRS fire willfully tax-noncompliant employees unless they have \nreasonable cause for not paying their taxes. What is shocking is that, \nin most cases, Mr. Speaker, the IRS leadership fails to even document \nwhy delinquent employees are not penalized, and 61 percent were not \npenalized for having delinquent taxes.\n  This legislation, Mr. Speaker, is a critical step forward in \nrestoring accountability and trust in the IRS. It is a trust that has \nbeen broken--a trust, I would argue, that doesn't exist between the \npeople and the IRS.\n  I urge my colleagues to make the IRS accountable to the American \npeople--to vote against the motion to recommit and to vote ``yes'' on \nH.R. 1206.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. KILDEE.

Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX and the \norder of the House of today, further proceedings on this question will \nbe postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1874-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1874]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise in honor of the lifetime of civic \ncontributions and the legacy of one of Arkansas' great leaders, Bobby \nRoberts.\n  Bobby will be greatly missed after his retiring earlier this year \nfrom a 27-year career of service to our library system, particularly in \nhis helping assure the growth of educational libraries and humanities \nthroughout our State.\n  In assuming the role of executive director of the Central Arkansas \nLibrary System in 1989, Bobby helped take the system to new heights--\nexpanding from 6 libraries to a total of 14, including 9 branches in \nthe city of Little Rock.\n  Bobby Roberts has made our central Arkansas community better read, \nbetter networked, and better led. I extend my best regards in this next \nchapter of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1877-3", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  HACK THE PENTAGON BUG BOUNTY PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Speaker, on Monday, the Department of Defense \nkicked off the first bug bounty program in the history of the Federal \nGovernment. Like similar programs used in industry, Hack the Pentagon \nis based on a coordinated vulnerability disclosure process. If a \nsecurity researcher finds a security problem in public-facing Web sites \nthat are operated by the DOD, he or she can submit it for review. \nShould the bug represent a security risk, the Department will then pay \nthe researcher a bounty for his or her work.\n  Coordinated vulnerability programs allow us to crowdsource security, \nencouraging curious minds to share their discoveries responsibly while \nproviding accountability for institutions that operate or develop \nsoftware.\n  I congratulate Secretary Carter for his leadership in creating this \nprogram, and I hope other agencies consider adopting programs like this \nof their own.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage any hackers out there to check out Hack the \nPentagon site and help make the pilot program a success.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1877-4", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1877]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CAMERAS IN THE SUPREME COURT\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Supreme Court of the United States \nheard the historical case of United States v. Texas, on Monday, \nregarding executive overreach.\n  People all over the country are interested in this case, but only a \nhandful of spectators could see the public proceedings. The courtroom \nis small, and seating is limited. If the public has the right to be \npresent in the courtroom of the Supreme Court, the public should be \nallowed to view the proceedings in their entirety on television or \nthrough live streaming.\n  Imagine the benefit to law school students to see actual proceedings \nof the Supreme Court. Also, the public is concerned and wants to know \nwhat happens behind those closed doors. It is time to educate the world \nabout what actually occurs in the most important court in the world--\nthe United States Supreme Court.\n  I was one of the first judges in Texas to allow cameras in the \ncourtroom.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous material on the subject of this Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arkansas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, in today's Special Order, my colleagues and I \nwill focus on the important work being done in all of our communities \nto expand opportunity, alleviate poverty, and promote upward mobility \nfor all Americans.\n  I want to personally acknowledge Speaker Ryan for his focus and \nleadership on this important issue and his efforts to energize local \nleaders to explore new, effective policies for combating poverty in the \nUnited States.\n  In 2014, we marked 50 years since the Great Society program was \ncommenced by President Johnson. Over the past 25 years, Congress has \ntaken numerous steps intended to reduce poverty in the United States, \nbut these have not had the long-term effects that many expected.\n  This is largely because of an undue focus on welfare reform rather \nthan just identifying specifically and focusing on addressing the \nunderlying causes of poverty.\n  Identifying opportunities for self-improvement, addressing the \nincreased growth in poverty and the pernicious effects across the U.S. \nare of keen interest to me, particularly given Arkansas' elevated \npoverty rate of 19.7 percent of our population.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  I believe it is crucial to focus our attention on identifying ways to \nempower individuals to take control of their own livelihoods and \nfutures so that they no longer feel that they must rely on external \nprograms that, at best, only play an ancillary role in improving \neconomic circumstances and, at worst, perpetuate intergenerational \ncycles of poverty.\n  In these important discussions surrounding poverty in America, I also \nbelieve it is critical that we focus on our rural, as well as urban, \npopulations. In my view, the President's policies and proposals have \nlargely ignored the needs of our rural communities that continue to \nstruggle.\n  Arkansas has a significant population of rural, low-income families, \nwhose hardships are often overlooked in the bigger picture of poverty \nreduction. That is because rural poverty occurs in lower population \nconcentrations, and some deem the plight of rural poverty to be less \nacute than that in urban areas. It is important that both faces of \npoverty be recognized and that solutions be applicable and readily \nadaptable to a variety of circumstances and regions.\n  This past year, all of us in the House were graced with a visit by \nthe Holy Father, Pope Francis. The Holy Father has stated that the \nprinciple of subsidiarity affords freedom at every level of society to \nwork and to innovate.\n  The Pope argued passionately that day that attempts to resolve all \nproblems through uniform regulations or technical interventions can \nlead to overlooking the complexities of local problems which demand the \nactive participation of all members of the community.\n  In tackling the social challenges of the globe, the Pope expressed \nthere are no uniform recipes. There is no one path to a solution. \nInstead, the Pope called on the principles of stewardship, \nsubsidiarity, and collaboration to seek solutions.\n  Last year I started the Community Empowerment Initiative in my \nhometown of Little Rock to consider key strategies for tackling poverty \nreduction in Arkansas' Second Congressional District. The CEI also \nseeks to encourage community engagement and help educate communities to \nvalue their strength and identify their assets to foster community \nownership and encourage individuals to be aware and involved in \nrejuvenating our communities and lives.\n  I am grateful for my colleagues who have joined me today to discuss \nthis important topic. I look forward to sharing some of the success \nstories from my own district and highlighting action that Congress can \ntake to support local initiatives.\n  I yield to the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker). I invite \nhim to come to the podium and talk about his experiences. He is a \nfreshman Member of Congress with me. I have very much enjoyed getting \nto know Representative Walker. He brings a unique perspective to this. \nI welcome my friend from North Carolina.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for \ntaking the lead on this and talking about some issues that are very \nimportant to us. I do agree, since President Johnson's War on Poverty \nbegan in 1964, the United States taxpayers have spent over $22 trillion \non anti-poverty programs. Yet, for many places in this country, poverty \nis worse, hunger is worse. Even in our district in the triad, we have \nplaces where there are food deserts and food insecurities.\n  After 50 years, we have to ask ourselves, have we seen any real \nprogress in our communities. Families have been caught up in this \ngenerational cycle of dependence that has depleted the resources in \nmany of our communities.\n  Somewhere along the way, the Federal Government missed the mark. We \nhave created programs that measure success on how many people we put on \nFederal programs, not measured by how many people we are able to move \noff programs for upward mobility.\n  Last week, former Congressman J. C. Watts and I toured North \nCarolina's Sixth District, my home district. We saw passionate \ncommunity members working to combat many aspects of poverty. Some were \nworking with limited Federal Government assistance; some were doing so \nwithout any involvement from the Federal Government. These community \nmembers have found successful ways to feed the hungry in our food \ndeserts and educate former inmates to become employable, contributing \nmembers of our society.\n  One nonprofit that we toured was the Welfare Reform Liaison Project \nin Greensboro, North Carolina. They work with a coalition of community \npartners under Project Re-Entry. Their goal is bringing the inside to \nthe outside by assisting former offenders returning to the community \nafter serving prison sentences.\n  It is not just about the program. We have to love the least of \nthese--as people of faith, we are called to do so--and understanding \nthat sometimes we must\n\n[[Page H1880]]\n\nput the relationship before the policy to achieve maximum success.\n  Another wonderful nonprofit we toured was BackPack Beginnings, 100 \npercent volunteer driven and community run. They directly provide food \nand necessities to children in need to make a positive and lasting \nimpact on their health and their future well-being.\n  One county has no State or federally funded weekend feeding programs. \nThese people have come behind to offer assistance for schoolchildren, \nand BackPack Beginnings works to fill that gap, all without the Federal \nGovernment's involvement, serving 4,000 children in 38 county schools.\n  Members of the people's House are committed to finding ideas that \nwork to address the underlying causes of poverty and empower local \ncommunity. I am proud to be part of that with my dear friend and \ncolleague, the gentleman from Arkansas, French Hill.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Walker for his contributions. I \nappreciate his thoughts.\n  When I think about one of the most challenging things that we face in \nour country, I think about homelessness. When I first became a Member \nof Congress, it was one of particular interest to me to learn what was \nhappening in Little Rock about homelessness because Arkansas has the \nthird highest rate for children and families in homelessness, so it was \na keen issue.\n  One place I found that was a major success story in using private \nmoney and some public money was an entity called Our House. It was \nfounded back in 1987 to address the gap in services for central \nArkansas' working homeless and homeless families. They now have a 7-\nacre campus in downtown Little Rock, and Our House empowers homeless \nand near-homeless families and individuals to succeed in the workplace.\n  Between 110 and 120 men, women, and children call Our House's campus \nhome every night, and it serves about 1,800 people annually, about 75 \npercent of whom are coming to Our House completely homeless. But the \nshelter's goal is not just simply to provide a safe place for a few \nnights. It is to permanently break the cycle of homelessness by \nequipping the working homeless with the skills to be successful in the \nworkforce.\n  In her decade of leadership of Our House as executive director, \nGeorgia Mjartan has done a remarkable job overseeing the expansion and \ngrowth of the shelter into a one-stop shop to address the root causes \nof poverty. She has collected the many stories of hope from the people \nwho have been touched by her work.\n  One that particularly touched me was the story of a young woman who \ndidn't graduate from high school, was unable to pay her rent and \nsupport her children on the very little money that she made from \nworking in the fast food industry.\n  When she got to Our House, she was dejected and without a sense of \npurpose or hope for the future. Within a few months, she was receiving \ntraining that she needed to earn her GED, and she was securing a job \nthat paid a living wage.\n  Two years after leaving Our House, she went back to tell Georgia \nabout the turn her life had taken. As the head teacher for a daycare \ncenter, she had acquired her own place, continued the saving practices \nthat she had learned at Our House, and was putting money away for her \nown kids to go to college.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is the kind of model that we need in this country \nto make a permanent break for our working poor.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot). I ask my friend, \na distinguished member of the Committee on Small Business, to talk \nabout his views on what we can be doing in this area.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank the gentleman from Arkansas (Mr. Hill) for his leadership in this \nvery important area.\n  Mr. Speaker, when families in this country struggle, it is \nappropriate that we take reasonable steps to help them through a rough \npatch. We have several programs designed to do just that, like the Food \nStamp program. It is also known now as the SNAP program, or the \nSupplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, which provides a short-term \nsafety net for those who have fallen on hard times.\n  However, the Food Stamp program, like most welfare programs, was \nnever intended to become a way of life for its recipients. \nUnfortunately, that is exactly what has happened. That is what has \nhappened to far too many people in this country. It is supposed to be \ntemporary help to the truly needy. Unfortunately, to many, it has \nbecome a permanent way of life.\n  To address this growing problem, we need to take steps to help people \nget off public assistance and back on their own feet. One way to do \nthis is to enact strong work and job training requirements for those \nable to work.\n  That is why I introduced legislation, H.R. 4849, a couple weeks ago \nto restore and strengthen work requirements for able-bodied adults \nenrolled in the Food Stamp program, or SNAP program. Under this \nlegislation, in order to continue to receive benefits, those recipients \nable to work must either find employment--which is what we would \ncertainly prefer--or participate in a job training program in order to \nenable them to get work or to volunteer for the community in some \neligible capacity.\n  So real help to other people in need in the community. That seems \nvery reasonable that somebody who is receiving benefits, tax dollars, \nwould actually give something back to the community or be on the path \nto better themselves so that they can get off the need to rely on their \nfellow citizens and on their own two feet, as we said before.\n  The legislation also addresses waste and abuse in the Food Stamp--or \nSNAP--program by expunging unused benefits after a 90-day period. The \nintent of the Food Stamp program is to assist those families in need on \nan as-needed basis. If a recipient hasn't utilized all their benefits \nafter 90 days, which is a reasonable period of time, I think, then the \nrecipient has not really demonstrated the need for those funds. So \nlet's use those unused funds to help some other truly needy people or \nlet's give that money back to the taxpayers, where it came from in the \nfirst place.\n  Ohio did a study and they found that in 25 people, there was $300,000 \nsitting in the SNAP account that they hadn't used, just building up. \nUnfortunately, that is oftentimes funds that are going to end up in \neither fraud or are going to be used for other purposes that was never \nintended for food stamps.\n  Food stamps are supposed to help people, the truly needy, not be \nthere to end up being used for gambling purposes, buying lottery \ntickets, or to buy drugs or alcohol or anything like that. So this \ntakes some of the abuses, I think, out of the system.\n  Mr. Speaker, these are commonsense reforms that will help make sure \nthat food stamps go to those who actually need them while at the same \ntime protecting our tax dollars from those who would take advantage of \nthe system.\n  I want to thank, again, the gentleman from Arkansas, French Hill, for \nhis leadership on this issue. This is a very important issue. There is \na lot of money, unfortunately, that gets wasted in a lot of these \nprograms. Let's make sure that the safety net is really helping people \nand not being abused. I thank him for his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank my distinguished friend from Ohio.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold). A \ndistinguished member of the Committee on Ways and Means and a former \nmember of the Committee on Financial Services, Mr. Dold has been quite \nkeen on ways to improve opportunities for people throughout the \nmetropolitan Chicago area. I welcome the gentleman and look forward to \nhis remarks.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I certainly want to thank my good friend from \nArkansas for leading this Special Order on a topic that, frankly, is \nextremely important. It is a nonpartisan issue from my perspective \nbecause really what we are talking about is how do we enable some of \nthe neediest folks among us in our communities all across our country \nto be able to provide for themselves. I think, obviously, one of those \nkey ingredients is about getting a good job.\n  Ultimately, as we look over the past period of time, since the War on \nPoverty began, our country has spent over $20 trillion--over $20 \ntrillion--to move\n\n[[Page H1881]]\n\nthe needle from about 15 percent in poverty to what it is today at \nabout 14.6 percent in poverty. I submit to you that that is criminal, \nthat so many today, after spending so many resources, are still in \npoverty.\n  Whether it be housing needs, whether it be nutrition needs, \nultimately what this really boils down to, I would argue, is that we \nneed to be focusing on how do we get evidence-based reforms. How do we \nfocus on outcomes? How do we know that the assistance that is out \nthere--because there isn't a community member out there who doesn't \nwant to help a neighbor.\n  I would submit to you, the stories that I see when I go up into north \nChicago, into Waukegan, into Des Plaines and into Round Lake, these are \nareas around my district where, honestly, we have people who are \nstruggling to make ends meet, those who require assistance.\n  Frankly, we need to be able to have a springboard and, frankly, we \nneed to think outside of the box about programs that are enabling \nindividuals to be able to have better outcomes so that we don't have a \ncycle of poverty, but yet we are able to break that cycle and actually \ntalk about TANF reforms, talk about how do we get some education \nreforms.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Just last week I spent some time over at the Lake County Jail talking \nto inmates who oftentimes come out of prison with little hope of being \nable to find a job. And we know the statistics right off the bat. If \nthey don't find a job within 6 months, they have a 66 percent chance of \ngoing right back into prison. That doesn't help them, that doesn't help \nour community. That is at a huge cost. We need to focus on our \noutcomes.\n  So one of the things that certainly I think that we ought to be \nlooking at, one of the things that the Committee on Ways and Means has \nbeen looking at, and a piece of legislation that I have offered, is \ntalking about how we get people into a job, accelerating individuals, \naccelerating those hardworking Americans that want to be able to stand \non their own two feet in a job.\n  And this would be a pilot program. Because the one thing that we do \nknow, Mr. Hill, is that a one-size-fits-all mentality is not going to \nwork. We know a one-size-fits-all mentality doesn't work with \neducation, a one-size-fits-all mentality doesn't work with pick your \nprogram.\n  We need to allow innovators in our country that know what works well \nin Arkansas, what works well in New York. We are going to hear from our \ngood friend, Mr. Reed, if he ever decides to get up and get to a \nmicrophone. We are going to hear from all those folks that, again, a \none-size-fits-all mentality does not work.\n  This would be a pilot program that would enable these institutions, \nthat would enable different States to run a pilot program to enable \nemployers to be able to pick up, let's say, half the cost of a person's \nsalary for the first 12 months. So the government would pick up half, \nthe employer would pick up half. The idea there is that we would be \nable to offset some of that on-the-job training that is so very, very \ncritical.\n  The other thing that I think we ought to be looking at is social \nimpact partnerships, another interesting idea. Representative Todd \nYoung, also a member of the Committee on Ways and Means, introduced a \nbill that I am a cosponsor of. It is a bipartisan piece of legislation \nthat will allow private investment in local communities for new public-\nprivate partnerships.\n  I think this is enormously important. If the programs are successful, \nthen the government will have reimbursed the investors, which is a \npractical way of doing it. We are going to reward success, and it will \nbreed more success.\n  The unemployment rate today, if we were to go and pick up the paper, \nwill say it is around 5 percent. And yet I know if you go into \nWaukegan, Illinois, today, for African American males, the unemployment \nrate is 43 percent. That is criminal. Frankly, we can and must do \nbetter. So it is about coming up with ideas about rewarding outcomes, \nabout focusing on job training, about focusing on education.\n  At the Lake County Jail last week, I went in and they were actually \ndoing GED classes. I am thrilled that we are actually trying to empower \npeople with education and some of the skills necessary to empower them \nwhen they get out, but we have so much more work to do, so much more \nwork to be able to allow them to be able to have a chance at getting \nthat job to be able to provide food for their families, be able to put \na roof over their head.\n  The Lake County Housing Authority, run by David Northern, again, is \nan organization that is working hard and is actually doing some \ninnovative things. They are actually putting people into work, giving \nthem a roof over their head, and actually having some forced savings. \nThey are putting them through a program so that when they graduate from \nthis program, they actually are graduating not only with a good job, \nthey are graduating with a roof over their head. They are also \ngraduating with the savings account full of about anywhere between \n$4,000, $6,000, and $8,000--savings that they didn't know that they \ncould have, putting them on a completely different path.\n  This weekend I was at the Eddie Washington Center up in Waukegan. \nThey just had their graduation. These are grown men that have hit rock \nbottom. They have gone in for help. And the Eddie Washington Center is \nan agency that will provide a roof over their head for these men. They \nwill get them jobs and tasks to do in order to help run the facility. \nThey will get them put into a job, and then they work through this \nprocess. It is a program that lasts anywhere between 6 and 9 months. \nBut at the end of that 6 to 9 months, they have a graduation.\n  Again, these are individuals that have a job. They have built up that \nability, that discipline. They have got a roof over their head, they \nhave had a change in their life, and they have been put on a different \npath. They, too, also are required to save and have a bank account.\n  It is about trying to do things differently. Again, I think that is \nwhat we are trying to do. We are trying to do things differently and \nhave an outcome, because the one thing that we know is that poverty \ndoesn't discriminate, in the sense that it can be in Arkansas, \nIllinois, New York, and Nevada. It can be all over the place. Frankly, \nwe need to find a way that we minimize the amount of poverty in our \nNation.\n  So I am delighted to be here today. And I want to thank my good \nfriend from Arkansas for not only organizing this time here on the \nfloor, but for shining a light on things that, frankly, we have so much \nmore work to do on. So much more work to do. Frankly, we need to make \nsure that they know that we want better outcomes. We want better \noutcomes for these individuals that are struggling day in and day out.\n  So, again, I am honored to be up here again today. I want to thank my \ngood friend for yielding to me. I look forward to working with you and, \nfrankly, all the Members of this body because in the 114th Congress, we \nneed to make it our mission to end poverty as we know it. I look \nforward to working with you all.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank the gentleman from Illinois. I appreciate his \npassion for this issue and his hands-on approach about finding things \nin his community and district that work. I believe that we all can \nshare that information and learn from each other, which is a key \npurpose for this hour.\n  Mr. Speaker, last week, Representative Tipton and I were up in \nManhattan. We went to The Doe Fund. What an impressive operation that \nis. I came away so renewed in faith. What is going on there in New \nYork, where they face an enormous avalanche of challenges, is so well \ntackled by the men and women of The Doe Fund. I look forward to talking \nabout that, but it is a nice segue for me to yield to the gentleman \nfrom western New York, (Mr. Reed), my good friend and a distinguished \nmember of the Committee on Ways and Means, for his views on how we can \ntackle poverty.\n  Mr. REED. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for yielding and for \ntaking the leadership in putting this Special Order together to discuss \npoverty in America.\n  Before I get into some of the substance, I want to talk about this \nfrom a personal perspective. I have 11 older brothers and sisters. My \nfather passed when I was 2. I was raised by a single\n\n[[Page H1882]]\n\nmom. It was tough. But she always taught me the lessons of life that \nhave carried me through, and that is to have a good attitude, a \npositive, optimistic attitude, a commitment to hard work, a commitment \nto discipline, and a commitment to respect our fellow man.\n\n  So I come here to this floor this evening as a Republican to say to \nall of America: We care. We care about our fellow American citizens \nthat are stuck in poverty for generations.\n  As my colleague from Illinois had indicated, we have spent over $20 \ntrillion out of the Federal coffers of hardworking American taxpayer \ndollars on the war on poverty. And the harsh reality is that war has \nbeen lost.\n  The policies and the visions of old must change. We must attack this \nissue in a new model by, first, demonstrating to our fellow citizens \nthat we do care, that we are not here to penalize, to judge, but what \nwe are here to do is offer a new vision.\n  I know my colleagues on the other side of the aisle often chastise us \nRepublicans as people who want to take things away and that we don't \nreally care about those people that are suffering in America. That \nfrustrates me, that angers me, because we do care.\n  And what we are saying to those fellow American citizens is that we \nare offering a new way of dealing with this issue. We want to empower \nyou. We want to provide an opportunity for you and your family to \nflourish.\n  How do we do that?\n  How we do that is what we are talking about here tonight, as my good \nfriend from Arkansas has opened his remarks with. We empower people to \nhave an opportunity to have the tools that really will combat and cure \npoverty in America, and that is a good-paying job, a good education.\n  Before my father passed, my mom and dad had a promise to each other. \nThey recognized and they talked to me and now I am passing it on to my \nkids in my household that education is key to the success that you will \nexperience in life in America.\n  So what we need to do is make sure that education is provided to this \ngeneration in a way that empowers them with the tools to pull \nthemselves out of poverty. We also have to recognize that the work \nethic in America is what makes us strong, that provide these \nopportunities, and that we should not have policies out of Washington, \nD.C., on this war on poverty that have penalized work as people try to \nrebuild themselves and pull themselves out of poverty.\n  We should have a reform of what they call the welfare cliff. What \nthat essentially is, if you are going back to work, you are essentially \npenalized because your benefits are pulled away from you.\n  What we need is a commonsense system that says: We are going to stand \nwith you. Life is going to throw you curve balls. We will give you a \nhelping hand and stand with you so long as we stand together and you \nmove yourself and stand on your own two feet as you go forward.\n  That is what this welfare cliff reform is all about. It is about \nmaking sure that the programs have resources that encourage and promote \neducation and technical training and skills that people can then put to \ntheir own uses so that they can have a job for themselves and their \nfamily.\n  I will end with this. We have a system, too, that essentially says: \nIn this war on poverty, we are going to gauge success by how much money \nyou spend on this program. We are going to gauge success by how many \npeople come to the government office and see you on a day-to-day basis.\n  What we need is a system that changes that whole metric and that \nessentially says to the system: You know what we are going to gauge \nsuccess on? How many people you move out of poverty and into that \nposition where they stand on their own two feet. It is not just the \nmoney that is spent, but the lives that you fundamentally have changed \nbecause you stood with them through that difficult time.\n  So as we go forward, I applaud my colleague from Arkansas. I applaud \nmy colleagues that have come here tonight to demonstrate that, as \nRepublicans on this side of the aisle, we are not going to continue the \nstatus quo of decades of failure on the war on poverty.\n  We need to do better. We have an obligation. I will roll up my \nsleeves with any colleague on the other side of the aisle and say: This \nis the time we come together. Because it is not a Democrat or \nRepublican issue. That is an American issue. And enough is enough.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank the gentleman from New York. I appreciate his \ncomments and I appreciate his personal testimony today about the \nimportance of this issue. It is a bipartisan issue. It requires all of \nus working together.\n  The concept behind our discussion is new ideas, new directions, \nbecause what we have done for the last 50 years is not working. And \nsomebody who has been a leader on the Committee on Financial Services \nfor seeking out the best ideas, particularly in how we can tackle a \nhousing solution for so many people in need of quality housing, is the \ndistinguished gentleman from Missouri (Mr. Luetkemeyer), chairman of \nour Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance.\n  Mr. LUETKEMEYER. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas. We certainly \nare appreciative of all the remarks of my colleagues who are here this \nevening--and Mr. Hardy, who is following--with regard to this important \nissue and something that the Speaker is focusing on, which is poverty \nand upward mobility.\n  Mr. Hill took time out of his schedule last year to invite me to his \ndistrict. We were able to go down and visit with some of the residents \nin public housing units, and we had some great conversations with them.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  We also met with some community leaders there in Little Rock and \ndiscussed the underlying causes of poverty and those charged with \nidentifying opportunities for people in their communities.\n  I certainly appreciate the gentleman's commitment to this \nconversation. I know that he is patient about it. He has spent lots of \ntime with it and is again, this evening, spending more time, so I \ncongratulate him on that.\n  This past fall, I had the honor of joining several of my colleagues \nin New Orleans, and we were examining the state of housing in New \nOrleans 10 years after Hurricane Katrina. We wanted to find out what \nthe local housing authority had done right, what they had done wrong, \nwhat their problems, what their pitfalls, and what their barriers have \nbeen in trying to get things done because, basically, they had to start \nfrom scratch.\n  Everybody saw the devastation of the hurricane, people living in \nhouses that were devastated, if they were still standing at all, and so \nit was very interesting to visit that. We visited not just the sites, \nbut the residents themselves.\n  I will never forget the story of one of the ladies who lived in \npublic housing there. She lived there all her life, lived in public \nhousing all her life, and she was raising her children in public \nhousing; but she had a goal that she was going to escape this public \nhousing, and she was going to have her children escape public housing \nand someday own her own home.\n  To her credit, that particular day, she was so tickled, I will never \nforget, the smile was from ear to ear. Her son had just received \nnotification that he was approved for a loan to be able to go buy his \nfirst house. He had escaped public housing and had fulfilled her dream \nfor not only herself, but her children as well. It was very \nencouraging, rewarding, and you could see the pride in her.\n  I think that is the thing that we need to be looking for for all of \nthe folks who don't want handouts, they want hands up. They want to be \nable to provide for themselves and lift themselves out of this. All we \nneed to do is enable that to happen.\n  So we must replicate that story, and I think that we can do that.\n  I am proud to say that the House Republicans are leading the charge \nby doing this with this Speaker's Task Force on Poverty, Opportunity, \nand Upward Mobility, and with the hard work of Mr. Hill this evening \nputting this together to explain to people our positions, to identify \nnew ways to promote independence and dignity.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, we are a \npart of that task force. We are a part of this discussion that we are \nhaving, and I am glad to be a part of it as well.\n  We must develop 21st century solutions for housing assistance with a\n\n[[Page H1883]]\n\nhigher purpose than simply perpetuating programs that marginalize \nAmerican families.\n  Over the past 16 months, as part of my duties as chairman, I have \nspent time meeting with public housing authorities from not just across \nmy own State, but around the United States as well. One thing is clear: \nthe status quo is not good enough.\n  In our committee, we have also commemorated the 50th anniversary of \nthe Department of Housing and Urban Development by holding a series of \nhearings to examine whether or not HUD has fulfilled its mission of \nproviding housing opportunities for those in need.\n  Since fiscal year 2002, the Federal Government has given more than \n$550 billion to HUD, 60 percent of which, the annual funding goes to \nthe Office of Public and Indian Housing. The Section 8 budget alone \nincreased 71 percent between fiscal years 2002 and 2013.\n  Unfortunately, for HUD, success isn't measured in the number of \nFederal programs or in dollars spent. I have had no indication from \nanyone that the growing need is anywhere close to being met. The \nreality is that the funding situation isn't getting better, so asking \nfor more Federal dollars isn't the solution. It is time to roll up our \nsleeves and work together to build a stronger housing safety net.\n  I am proud to work with my colleague and my friend, Mr. Cleaver from \nMissouri--two guys from the ``Show-Me'' State to show them how to get \nit done--and we passed H.R. 3700. I am the first to point out this \nlegislation wouldn't necessarily change the world, and it won't end \nhomelessness overnight or meet overwhelming need for affordable \nhousing, but it does reform the outdated and duplicative housing \npolicies and programs that haven't been touched in decades and \nrepresents a first step in a long journey to reforming our housing \nsystem. The bill passed the House by a vote of 427-0, and I encourage \nthe Senate to pass it without further delay.\n  Let me close by throwing a few more statistics and a couple of other \nlittle thoughts I have here as well out very quickly.\n  I had the opportunity to visit with some folks from Great Britain; \nand when we talk about a housing problem or discuss housing in this \ncountry, we don't really know the size of the problem because, in Great \nBritain, they have 17 percent of their people living in public housing, \nwhere here it is about 4. The average age of the child living in Great \nBritain with their parents is 35. Holy Cow. This is not acceptable, but \nthat is where they are with their housing programs in their country.\n  In our country, 60 percent of the people that live in public housing \nare seniors and disabled. So a lot of times, let's remember, we are \ntalking about the 40 percent whom we need to find ways to move them \nout, to empower them, to encourage them to be able to get out on their \nown, but the other 60 percent are folks that probably need to be in \nthis particular subsidized situation where they can have an opportunity \nto live in their own home.\n  I mentioned a while ago I was in New Orleans, and it was interesting \nto see that the part that they had rebuilt was interesting from the \nstandpoint that it wasn't just building these tenements where people \nwould be stacked on top of each other, but they were building \ncommunities. They would build mixed-use buildings, where you have not \njust people who would rent and be subsidized, but people who would rent \nand be able to afford to rent themselves, as well as people who owned \nthe property. These mixed-use properties, by doing this, they were able \nto actually form communities.\n  So I think there is a model there for us to look at and to begin to \nconsider how to get these things done.\n  Another thing, the PHA Administrator came by my office last week. He \nwas in town, and we discussed, again, how to work with this 40 percent \nto get them to find ways to get out on their own and to enable them. \nWork requirements are something. He said: Hey, they work.\n  If you give people the opportunity to work and perhaps transition \nfrom what they have, as Mr. Reed talked about a while ago, I believe it \nwas, this welfare cliff, if you can find a way to sort of feather that \nthing so that they can slowly transition off, there are lots of folks \nwho want to be able to move from subsidized apartments to their own \nhome, to owning their own home.\n  I think, at the end of the day, we in Congress need to find a way to \nget our economy going because the best way to solve this whole problem \nis with a job. If people have a job, a good-paying job, they can afford \nto go out and begin to rent on their own and then, hopefully, be able \nto, at some point, own on their own.\n\n  That should be the dream for everyone, like this lady, a while ago, I \nwas talking about from New Orleans. That was her dream. That is the \ndream of most people in this country. If that is the case, we need to \nfind a way to do that, and the best way is to improve our economy so \nthey have jobs to be able to pay that.\n  At the end of the day, I think we need to remember that we want \npeople to have not just a place where they can live, but where they can \nhave a life. I think if that is our goal, we will keep our priorities \nin perspective, and we will be able to do the job of helping our \ncitizens, our constituents, and the folks of this great country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank, again, the gentleman from Arkansas for his \ngreat work on this and having me be a part of it this evening.\n  Mr. HILL. I thank my colleague from Missouri. I enjoy so much our \nservice together on the Financial Services Committee, and I appreciate \nhis leadership in tackling the puzzle of how to create a housing \nmission that helps people that need it the most.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Hardy), my \ngood friend, who is a fellow member of the freshman class in this \nCongress.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend from Arkansas for coming \nand hosting this serious discussion on the serious issues in this \ncountry.\n  According to the Census Bureau, 15 percent of the population is \nliving below the poverty level. For States that were hit hardest in the \n2008 economic downturn, like Nevada, the recession is not just a memory \nfor too many, it is still a reality.\n  At the lowest point, Nevada's unemployment rate was an astronomical \n13.7 percent, and the poverty rate was at 16.2 percent. The only thing \nthat is more stark than that number is the fact that, despite the \nimprovement of the national unemployment rate, the national poverty \nrate has not budged in the last 4 years.\n  But there is a silver lining here, and it is in the Silver State. \nUnlike national figures on poverty, Nevada has seen poverty rates drop \nas the unemployment rate has dropped also.\n  One of the most effective ways that my State has been able to improve \nthe lives of the most impoverished is through smart community \ninvolvement on the local level. Unlike so many Federal approaches that \noperate on a one-size-fits-all solution, local, community-based \nsolutions are tailored and are specific to community and, in many \ncases, conditions of each individual's needs.\n  These approaches work best because they are closest to the situation \nand usually have the best understanding of the factors on the ground. \nThe impoverished aren't always just a statistic to their community. \nThey are neighbors; they are friends; they are loved ones.\n  In my community, there is an organization that not only has ideas, \nbut it is actually acting on them and putting them to work in the \ncommunity to improve the situation. The Hope for Prisoners program, \nwhose mission is to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society and find \ngainful employment, is a model for success. Jon Ponder, the Hope for \nPrisoner leader, brings together families, religious leaders, business \nleaders, and law enforcement to break this vicious cycle that plagues \nmany communities and ours, also.\n  The various community members act in a selfless service, often using \ntheir own time and their own money to make a difference. That is \nsomething that we need to get back in this country is that selfless \nservice.\n  And remember: Who is your neighbor? Folks, where I grew up, everybody \nwas your neighbor, even if you had never met them. We have a \nresponsibility to reach out and give of ourselves.\n  These are things that Jon Ponder has done. Various community members \nlike Jon Ponder have graduated individuals out of this program. One of\n\n[[Page H1884]]\n\nthose graduates has started a successful small business, Love's \nBarbershop. Not only is Love's owner a contributing member of the \ncommunity, Love's Barbershop lifts the entire community by creating \njobs for other Nevada families.\n  In the case of Hope for Prisoners, the participants join the program \non a voluntary basis. If an individual is not ready and willing to \nbreak the cycle of incarceration and poverty, no solution will find \nsuccess.\n  Investment does not end with those going through the program, \nhowever. The success of local, community-based solutions has shown \neveryone involved to be fully invested. The local businesses employing \nthe participants have bought in completely to working with the program \nand are willing to give ex-offenders a shot, a shot at working hard, \nearning a wage, and contributing to society.\n  Local law enforcement have also been invested. Rather than simply \npolicing the streets as crime stoppers, they are active partners in the \ncommunity. They work in tandem with the entire community.\n  The idea of mentoring individuals is such a powerful tool that we all \nhave, and it is available to us. Are you using that tool that is \navailable to you?\n  Remember: Who is your neighbor? We can make a difference.\n  Jon and Hope for Prisoners have taken this idea of mentoring and \nturned it into a job creator and, more importantly, a lifesaver. While \nHope has been operating for only 5 years, they have been able to help \nmore than 1,000 people in southern Nevada, with only a 6 percent re-\nincarceration rate.\n  Too often, individuals released from incarceration face the \nuncertainty of a future plagued by limited employment opportunities \navailable to them. Without employment, these individuals become at risk \nfor re-incarceration or poverty and homelessness.\n  Programs like Hope for Prisoners work. The numbers and the survivors \nspeak for themselves.\n  While there is still much to do to address poverty in our country, we \nshould all be looking to our States for examples. States are not only \nthe national laboratories of industry, they can also be the \nlaboratories for hope.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Nevada. I am so \ninspired by the success that he talks about in Nevada on a local level \nthat is working and how powerful mentoring is.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I mentioned a few minutes ago that our colleague, Representative \nTipton from Colorado, and I were up in New York last week. We visited \nThe Doe Fund, which just recently celebrated 30 years of fighting \nhomelessness and hopelessness in the boroughs of New York. They provide \naffordable and supportive housing for individuals and families \nstruggling with chronic homelessness.\n  They are famous because of their Ready, Willing & Able program, the \nbright, colorful uniforms all across the boroughs of New York that \nprovides homeless and formerly incarcerated individuals with \ntransitional work, housing, case management, life skills, education \nassistance, occupational training, job readiness, and graduate \nservices.\n  About 2,000 individuals per year are helped through The Doe Fund's \nextensive network of training and jobs. It is exactly the kind of \nthing, Mr. Speaker, that we want in all of our cities where citizens \ncome together and help the least of these, those coming off parole and \nthose trapped in alcohol or drug abuse.\n  My hats are off to Harriet McDonald, the executive vice president and \ncofounder, and her husband of The Doe Fund and all that they are doing \ngood and the success they have by the number of former Doe Fund \nbeneficiaries, like Don Pridgen, who now is a caseworker helping his \nfellow citizens as an alumnus of The Doe Fund.\n  Arthur Brooks said recently at the American Enterprise Institute: \n``The Doe Fund is an extraordinary success not just because of its \nnumbers (it has lower criminal recidivism and higher work attachment \nthan virtually any other program for the homeless in New York City) but \nbecause it specializes in taking care of some of the most difficult \nmembers of society--the hardest cases.''\n  That is what impressed Representative Tipton and me on our visit last \nweek. My friend from Nevada was talking about mentoring, and that is so \nessential, in my view, to the idea of educational attainment because, \ntruly, if the best program to end poverty is a good job, we have got to \nstop the horrendous dropout rates that we have.\n  We have to have people that have the kind of mentoring they are not \ngetting, potentially, from their family or in their school system only \nto be able to stay in school and think ahead about their future, to \nhave aspirations for their future. If we can close that gap of staying \nin school, we can close that learning gap as well.\n  Some programs in my district that have impressed me in this regard \nare, first, Greenbrier High School. Greenbrier High School is a public \nschool in a rural part of my district that is doing both skill \nworkforce training while students are in high school as well as getting \nthem up to 2 years--2 years, Mr. Speaker--of college credit by \npartnering with the University of Arkansas at Little Rock to have a \ndual enrollment system.\n  This saves families money and gets people the kind of educational \nattainment that we want. This is all done in the confines of a \nsuccessful, locally controlled local public school.\n  Representative Brooks of Indiana stopped me this week and said that \nshe couldn't be with us for this important hour of discussion about the \nways and means of beating poverty in our society, and she wanted me to \nsay--and I think it is illustrated by Greenbrier High School, Mr. \nSpeaker--that, if we could lower dropout rates, we, in turn, could \nchange the direction of family success and family income.\n  My friend from Nevada was talking about mentoring programs, and we \nhave a bright story there in Little Rock with Donald Northcross, \nfounder of the OK Program. OK stands for ``our kids.''\n  Donald is a former deputy sheriff in Sacramento, California, who \nmoved to Little Rock, inspired by the work, vision, and leadership of \nFitz Hill, president of Arkansas Baptist College in Little Rock.\n  Donald was troubled by the violence and despair that he found in \nBlack communities in California and the growing incarceration rates of \nyoung Black men.\n  Determined to make a difference, Donald founded the OK Program back \nin 1990 and is now spreading it across the United States with a goal of \nusing it as a way to mentor young African American males while they are \nin their middle school years and through high school years to make sure \nthat they are on the right track.\n  These are just a few examples of what you are hearing around all of \nour districts whenever I travel in the U.S. about how people are \nbanding together as citizens in our great country to tackle poverty \nusing local resources and local ingenuity.\n  I hope, Mr. Speaker, that we can come back in a few months and talk \nabout this issue again and give more Members an opportunity.\n  I want to thank those that joined me today on the floor to discuss \nthis important issue about how we alleviate poverty in our States and \nour local communities and how we overcome barriers of our existing \nFederal programs or other program barriers that are preventing success. \nThere is no doubt that we have unique, successful opportunities \nthroughout this country to beat this challenge.\n  I look forward to continuing to work with my colleagues in the House \nand the Speaker's Task Force on Poverty, Opportunity, and Upward \nMobility. I thank Speaker Ryan for his personal dedication and \nleadership to this topic across our country.\n  I want to thank our team in Arkansas and in Washington, D.C., and my \nstaff for their commitment to this issue and how we are coming together \nto find solutions in the Second Congressional District to both urban \nand rural challenges.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1884-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1884-H1888]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  DEMOCRACY SPRING: MONEY IN POLITICS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Mooney of West Virginia). Under the \nSpeaker's announced policy of January\n\n[[Page H1885]]\n\n6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, in a 10-day march that started on \nApril 11, thousands of Americans came to Washington, D.C., from all \nover the country to fight for one thing: our democracy.\n  In peaceful protests right outside this building, Capitol Police \narrested more than 1,300 of them as they called on this body to make \nbasic changes to reinforce the institution that makes the United States \nso special.\n  The reason they marched is simple, Mr. Speaker. In a Nation founded \non the will of the people, States have systematically disenfranchised \nthose same people and it is the will of well-funded special interests \nthat now run our elections.\n  We have found ourselves in this predicament primarily through \ninaction, the same kind of inaction poised to give the Supreme Court \nthe longest vacancy in nearly 100 years.\n  These folks came to the Capitol to ask our leaders to do something, \nand their requests are pretty simple.\n  For starters, they want to see the restoration of the Voting Rights \nAct to prevent voter discrimination in the 21st century because voting \ndiscrimination does still exist, something Chief Justice Roberts \nacknowledged even as he struck down parts of the original Voting Rights \nAct.\n  It is targeted against voters of color, those with language barriers, \nand those with disabilities. And Congress should be doing something \nabout it.\n  That is not the only call that came out of last week's rallies, \nthough. They also want updates to our election day procedures, updates \nthat are sorely needed.\n  In a world as technologically advanced as ours where you can pay for \nyour lunch with your phone and use a fingerprint to unlock your \ncomputer, we have hours-long wait times at some voting polls. We have \nprovisional ballots and ineffective, if not outright confusing, \nnotification systems for how, when, and where to register to vote. It \nis another issue Congress should be doing something about.\n  But perhaps the most important issue that these rallies brought to \nthe table is the need to make sure that the voices of real people, not \nthose of corporations or special interests, are what are heard in our \nelections. For that, we need to create a path back from Citizens United \nthat allows us to regulate how money is raised and spent in elections.\n  Because of that ruling, we need a constitutional amendment that makes \nclear what common sense already dictates: corporations are not people \nand shouldn't get a say in who governs our Nation.\n  What is really interesting here is that the work has already been \ndone. The call of these protesters wasn't for Congress to investigate \nor draft or identify solutions to these problems.\n  The solutions already exist. They asked that we pass a few pieces of \nlegislation that will put our democracy back where it belongs: with the \npeople.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I stand in solidarity with the individuals who came \nto Washington last week for Democracy Spring. I stand in strong support \nof reforms to how we run elections and how we ensure the right to vote.\n  I urge my colleagues to follow suit in saving our democracy.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield to the gentlewoman from \nIllinois, Jan Schakowsky, a U.S. Representative.\n  Ms. SCHAKOWSKY. I thank my colleague so much for taking the \nleadership this evening on such an important and central issue. It is \nreally about our democracy.\n  Our country has long been known and respected around the world as a \nbeacon of democracy. We aspire to let every person participate in our \nsystem of government and give each person's views and votes equal \nweight. But today our democracy itself is in jeopardy.\n  Instead of promoting voter participation, States are erecting \nbarriers to keep Americans from voting. Instead of giving people an \nequal voice in our elections, corporations and the wealthy are claiming \noutsized influence. The Supreme Court, tasked with protecting our \nrights, is being crippled by congressional inaction.\n  Over the past days, thousands of Americans have come to Washington to \ndemand that we restore American democracy. I join them in their call \nfor action: Pass the Voting Rights Amendment Act, stop the outsized \nrole that money plays in politics, and fill the vacancy on our Supreme \nCourt.\n  Last year marked the 50th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act. The \nVoting Rights Act broadened access to democracy and fulfilled the \npromise of the 15th Amendment. It ensured that every American had the \nopportunity to take part in the democratic process.\n  But in recent years, courts and State legislatures have torn away at \nthese rights. In 2013, the Supreme Court rolled back voter protections \nwith its misguided Shelby County decision, striking down key provisions \nof the Voting Rights Act.\n  Before the Shelby County decision, the Voting Rights Act required \nStates with a history of voter discrimination to clear any changes that \nthey wanted to make to their voting laws in advance.\n  What happened when this provision got struck down? No surprise. \nCertain States rushed to pass new voting restrictions.\n  On the very day of the ruling, Texas officials announced they would \nimplement a photo ID law that had previously been blocked.\n  North Carolina went even further, imposing a strict photo ID law as \nwell as cutting back early voting and reducing the time period for \nvoter registration. This law disproportionately affects communities of \ncolor.\n  This November is the first Presidential election since the weakening \nof the Voting Rights Act. Sixteen States now have new voting \nrestrictions in place.\n  The Voting Rights Amendment Act, introduced by my Republican \ncolleague, Mr. Sensenbrenner, would restore key protections of the \nVoting Rights Act.\n  Despite bipartisan support for this bill, House leadership has simply \nfailed to take action. The inaction is unforgivable.\n  But voting rights are not the only part of our democratic process \nthat is under attack. Citizens United, another misguided Supreme Court \ndecision, has unleashed a flood of money from rich donors and powerful \ncorporations that is now drowning out the voice of the American people.\n  In the 2014 elections, the top 100 donors to super-PACs gave nearly \nas much as 4.75 million small donors combined. This election cycle, the \nKoch brothers alone have pledged to spend almost $900 million.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Just in the early phase of the 2016 Presidential race, 158 families \nwere responsible for more than half of all the money raised in \nPresidential campaigns.\n  The American people want action. They are demanding that we get money \nout of politics--the big money. Congress continues to ignore the will \nof the American people. Republican leadership has failed to take \nlegislative action to address the egregious spending allowed by the \nCitizens United Supreme Court decision. For example, they haven't \nbrought up H.R. 20, the Government By the People Act, which would \nprovide matching funds for candidates who agree to rely on small donors \nto fund their campaigns. This would empower individuals to support \ncandidates and balance the influence of big money.\n  This is the sort of legislation the House ought to be considering. We \ndon't just need legislative fixes, though. Repairing our democracy also \nrequires confirming justices who understand that corporations are not \npeople and money is not speech. But here, too, Republicans are refusing \nto do their job.\n  On March 16, President Obama fulfilled his constitutional duty--you \ncan read it in the Constitution--by nominating D.C. Circuit Court Judge\n\n[[Page H1886]]\n\nMerrick Garland to fill the vacancy on the Supreme Court. But even \nbefore Garland's nomination was announced--in fact, just about an hour \nafter Judge Antonin Scalia passed away--Senator Majority Leader Mitch \nMcConnell promised nothing but obstruction. He said he would not hold a \nhearing, he would not have a vote, and that this was going to wait \nuntil the next election.\n  Republican Senators have refused to hold hearings, they have refused \nto have an up-or-down vote, and many of them have refused to even meet \nwith the nominee at all. Even those Senate Republicans who haven't \npublicly endorsed this obstruction are doing the bare minimum. They may \nhave courtesy meetings, they may even say they would support hearings, \nor maybe even a vote, but words are not enough. We need action, not \nphoto ops.\n  The Constitution makes clear that the President--the sitting \nPresident, this President, Barack Obama--nominates judges to the \nSupreme Court. Then the Senate's job is to advise and consent on the \nPresident's nominee. It doesn't say: and you only do it in the first 7 \nyears of a President's term, and you don't do anything in the last year \nof a President's term. There is simply no excuse for the Senate to \nresist taking any action.\n  I find it really disrespectful to the American people and I find it \ndisrespectful to this President that they are saying that he cannot \nhave the right; as every other President in history, even in the last \nyear of his term, has had to nominate and have considered, and, in \nfact, all of those nominated in the last year were actually approved. \nSo there is no excuse for the Senate to resist taking any action.\n  Senate Republicans are putting politics ahead of the Constitution. \nThat is not democracy. Big donors are not democracy. Taking away voting \nrights is not democracy.\n  It is time for this House of Representatives to really represent the \nAmerican people, listen to their calls for change, and take action to \nstrengthen our democracy.\n  Again, I thank my colleague for yielding.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from \nIllinois for her very eloquent and very important remarks.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, let me thank the gentlewoman from New \nJersey, who has led these Special Orders for communicating to the \nAmerican people, and the gentlewoman from Chicago, Illinois, who has a \nhistory and record of reform. I thank the Congresswoman for her very \nwell-stated challenge in a message and effort.\n  Let me also thank those hundreds who have seen the inside of a \nWashington, D.C., jail. They have done so in the name of those who \ncannot speak for themselves--the millions of Americans who sit \nlanguishing because decisions are made against them and not for them. \nUnfortunately, big money, inertia, and the Congress not doing its job \nhas taken the dominant place in American history.\n  Hundreds of Democracy Spring protestors were arrested on Capitol \nHill. We heard them repeatedly over the last week. Having had the \nexperience of standing before the Sudanese embassy, standing in a fight \nfor immigration reform myself, as well participating by way of fight \nand registering people to vote in the deep South in the aftermath of \nthe 1965 Voting Rights Act, I think that protest and petition is a \nright of the American people--peaceful protest and petition--and I want \nto applaud those who sacrificed or stood their ground protesting the \ninertia of this Congress and the help that is needed by millions of \nAmericans.\n  Democracy Spring should be an agenda that all of us can support. It \nis, in fact, one that speaks to the question of how we are going to \ntreat the least of those and how we are going to do what is right for \nthe American people.\n  There is no doubt, I think, if you were to ask one of our leading \nfighters in one of the States with the most draconian voter right laws, \nReverend William Barber, who will be on the Hill tomorrow, he will know \nfirsthand what voter suppression is all about. Clearly, it is an \nindictment of the undermining of the Bill of Rights, due process under \nthe Fifth Amendment, and equal protection under the law.\n  There are examples of voter ID laws where thousands are barred from \nvoting. Maybe mistakenly the States did not realize that they did not \nhave the offices, like Texas in over 80 counties, where individuals \nwere supposed to get their voter ID; or in Alabama, where the Governor \nclosed offices where people were to get their voter ID; or in other \nStates, of course, where other reasons have been put forth--the \nstopping of early vote or the lessening of early vote by North \nCarolina, and, of course, the voter ID law.\n  After section 5 of the Voting Rights Act was eviscerated, destroyed, \nin the Shelby case by the United States Supreme Court, despite having \nthe right to have a disagreement with me--they are the Supreme Court--\nthey were absolutely wrong. As Justice Ginsburg said: For you would not \nstop using polio vaccine because you have not seen polio in the United \nStates in any large way for a very long time.\n  That is what we stand here on the floor today to talk about. That \nthere is a need for a reckoning in this country that those who are part \nof Democracy Spring are standing up for. That is to ensure the \nrestoration of the Voting Rights Act that is fair.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe the Voting Rights Act protects all of our \nrights to vote, irrespective of color. It does not respect color. It \nonly indicates that if you have been barred from voting unfairly, then \nwe have the right--the Federal Government, the Department of Justice--\nto review that.\n  Lo and behold, section 5 saved money, millions of dollars, in fact. \nMy own State has used millions of dollars, millions of tax dollars, to \npursue and fight the Voting Rights Act, when in actuality the Voting \nRights Act saves money.\n  If a jurisdiction like, for example, Pasadena, Texas, which redid \ntheir city council structure that eliminated Hispanics from being able \nto even win in that city--if they had been able to have their \nparticular process reviewed and found that it is in violation of the \nVoting Rights Act and unconstitutional to one vote, one person, then \nthey may not have foolishly constructed that scheme and done one that \nmaybe all parties could work together on. I believe in that.\n\n  I have done some wonderful things with bipartisan friends, \nRepublicans and Democrats, working on important issues. Criminal \njustice happens to be one of them. But that did not happen. So now \nsection 2 becomes the arm of the way of trying to solve these problems, \nand, of course, in doing so, we have lost our way.\n  Let me say that I was here when President Bush signed into law the \n1965 reauthorization, the 1965 Voting Rights Act, worked on it \nextensively and submitted amendments. Happily, it was voted for with a \nlarge margin by a bipartisan Congress 98-0 in the United States Senate, \nand a big celebration in the White House celebrating the signing of the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act with section 5 after 15,000 \npages of testimony.\n  Why can't we do that?\n  The American people deserve that kind of response. Democracy Spring, \nyou are right, let us reauthorize the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n  That draws me as well to the issue of the Supreme Court Justice and \nto recognize that constitutionally we are in a no man's land. No man's \nland is that we have taken the Constitution and, unfortunately, we \nburned it. The Senate has the responsibility of advice and consent, and \nit has a responsibility to address the question of the missing Supreme \nCourt Justice.\n  Justice Scalia was grounded in conservatism. All of us respected \nthat. We disagreed on many occasions, but Justice Scalia wrote opinions \nthat everybody agreed with. When it was a majority court, when there \nwere others who had previously disagreed on other matters, they agreed.\n  That is the way the Supreme Court works, but if you block from even a \nconsideration or a meeting or a hearing, then you are literally tearing \nup the Constitution, ripping it up, and burning it up. Democracy Spring \nwere willing to go to jail because they believe that is wrong, and I \njoin them and stand with them in their protests and their petition.\n  Now, let me step away for just a moment--my colleague and I will get\n\n[[Page H1887]]\n\nback--but I must say that I am, again, mourning the loss of those in my \ndistrict who lost their lives through this terrible storm over these \nlast couple of days. We expect rain to continue. I wanted to just make \nsure that, as I indicated yesterday when I was in my district, we are \npraying for their families.\n  As Members of the United States Congress, I am hoping that we will \nfind a way to work with places like New Orleans and Houston, Texas, who \nare 50 feet below sea level, that we are not just getting a hurricane. \nPeople understand hurricanes, they understand tornados, and they \nunderstand earthquakes. They don't understand just plain rain that \ncomes up to 20 inches or more and you are literally under water, as we \nwere in the spring of 2015 and now we are again. Homes destroyed of the \nmost vulnerable of my constituents, those who are most impoverished.\n  I cite this because I am in the midst of discussing that we should be \ndoing our job. One of those issues is to look at the cost and the \nrelationship to lives lost, to doing an infrastructure system, a \nretention system, and other systems that have been represented as being \nhelpful, trying to work with various constituencies so they don't have \nto go through that again.\n  Dying in one's car in an underpass, dying in one's car, can't get \nout, we had at least four people. We are up to eight. As I said, no one \nwould understand it. It is not a flaring hurricane: Oh, you had a \nterrible hurricane, we understand it. Tornado. Oh, you had an \nearthquake, like the tragedy in Ecuador and Japan. We offer our \nsympathy to them.\n  They don't understand just rain that causes loss of life--truck \ndrivers, a young mother, a mechanical engineer. What are the horrors of \ndying in your car, drowning, and you are thinking someone is coming? \nYou are using your cell phone, you think you see lights, and no one is \nshowing up.\n  I am burdened by this. I wanted to acknowledge them and offer my \nsympathy, and hope that tomorrow I will again come to the floor for a \nmoment of silence.\n  Let me step back to this because it ties in that we have to do our \njob here in Congress. All of us in our districts have had instances \nwhere the Congress' failure or the Federal Government's failure \nprobably has impacted in some way some terrible loss of life.\n  As I continue, we need a Supreme Court Justice, we need the \nreauthorization of the Voting Rights Act, and, as I just indicated, we \nneed an infrastructure bill. We passed one, but we need one that gets \ninto the weeds of these questions dealing with flooding and the loss of \nlife and the loss of property that we have.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Finally, let me say this since I was here during this, and I use the \nConstitution in a way that, I think, is very, very important.\n  I had a bill that I introduced that said a corporation is not a \nperson. Citizens United is premised on that fact. The decision came \ndown from the United States Supreme Court 5 years ago. That decision \nwas the opening of the door of the dominance of big money over \npolitics, and politics and policy has grown, seemingly without \nrestraint and with dire consequences for representative self-\ngovernment.\n  ``A functioning democracy requires a government responsive to the \npeople--`` we call ourselves the ``people's House'' ``--considered as \npolitical equals, where we each have a say in the public policy \ndecisions that affect our lives. It is profoundly antidemocratic for \nanyone to be able to purchase political power and when a small elite \nmakes up a donor class that is able to shape our government and our \npublic policy.''\n  I offer that as an article written by Liz Kennedy on January 15, \n2015: ``Top Five Ways Citizens United Harms Democracy and Top Five Ways \nWe're Fighting to Take Democracy Back.''\n  She goes on to talk about how big money allows the wealthy elite few \nto overpower other voices. That sounds very familiar in the fight \nagainst gun violence and in the inability to get any gun legislation \npassed whether it has to do with gun storage bills that I have, whether \nit has to do with protecting our children, whether it has to do with \nbackground checks or with immunity that has been given to gun \nmanufacturers and keeping away people like the Sandy Hook families or, \nmaybe, families out of Chicago, where my colleague has been working so \nhard, Congresswoman Kelly.\n  ``Secret political spending exploded after Citizens United because \nthe disclosure requirements relied on by the Court do not yet exist.''\n  No. 3: ``The purported `independence' of outside spending is often a \nfarce, allowing for evasion of contribution limits and disclosure \nrequirements.''\n  She goes on to cite that big money in politics distorts \nrepresentation and makes one group bigger than the other group.\n  Then No. 5: ``The Supreme Court's decisions have distorted the \nConstitution by preventing commonsense rules to protect representative \nself-government.'' Might I say that that deals with the gun legislation \nas well.\n  I think I will close with the simple words that we must do our jobs. \nWe need to do our jobs. One of the reasons that we are in Court on the \nDACA and DAPA is that Congress did not do its job, and the President \nhas the constitutional authority that says to take care, which means \nthat that President, whoever he is, does have prosecutorial authority \nand discretion on how laws should be enforced, i.e., the immigration \nlaws.\n  The President is absolutely right. I do not know how the Supreme \nCourt is going to rule. I would ask that they be very attentive to \ndoing this in a constitutional manner, which means they have the \nability to look at the Take Care Clause. That may not work, but they \nhave the ability to look at standing; and I would make the argument \nthat none of the States have been injured, because, as for all of the \nthings that they are arguing about--driver's licenses and otherwise--\nthey don't have to do anything.\n  The President is saying that these individuals will not be deported \nbecause they are not dangerous. He is not saying that States need to \nprovide them with benefits, and they should not, by interpretation, \nsuggest that he is dictating to them unfunded mandates of items that he \nhas not asked. That is not in his executive order. It does not say what \nbenefits they are supposed to get. In essence, in the President's doing \nhis work, unfortunately, he is now being penalized for helping and \nfollowing the Constitution.\n  We have a Presidential campaign going on, and the one thing that I \ncan be proud of is that the candidates who are now running in the \nDemocratic primary have made it very clear of their opposition to big \nmoney in politics, of their opposition to Citizens United, and of their \nwillingness to fight against it.\n  In particular, I want to quote from the Boston Globe on then-\nSecretary Clinton: ``She took a mostly hands-off approach to Wall \nStreet regulation.'' She stayed away from it. She is not immersed in \nbig money, which is a plus for all of us. She understands the people's \nvoice must be heard and realizes that we must do something with \nCitizens United.\n  I have joined in cosponsoring a constitutional amendment to change \nit, but in whatever way that we can move forward to change it, the \nvoices of the people must speak. Public finance is a reputable and \nreasonable way to run Presidential campaigns and to run all of our \ncampaigns, but until it is done, it is important for us to listen to \nthe voices of the people and to make sure that, however big money comes \nin, it does not carry this House--this body and the other body--on its \nback, marching towards legislation that will not help the American \npeople.\n  Democracy Spring was a movement of quality and dignity, and I am here \ntoday to thank them for their willingness to peacefully petition and \nprotest. Over the years and decades, America has seen those protests \npeacefully leading to, as Dr. King might say, a promised land in which \nall of us can enjoy the benefits of what America truly stands for.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I am always grateful for the gentlewoman from \nTexas who comes and shares her wisdom and her passion and her concern.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we close out this Special Order hour, I just want to \nshare a few more comments.\n  We should be doing whatever we can to ensure that every American is \nable to participate in the democratic process and ensure that elected \nofficials\n\n[[Page H1888]]\n\ntruly represent the voices of their constituents. The right to vote and \nthe elections in which we cast our ballots are the foundations of our \ndemocracy, and policymakers should be strengthening those systems and \nexpanding that right whenever and wherever possible. Instead, for the \npast few years, we have been restricting it.\n  In a Nation whose founding documents begin with ``we the people of \nthe United States,'' the local, State, and Federal Government should \nchampion the cause of ensuring that every single American can make his \nvoice heard with as little difficulty as possible. I support every \neffort to do so, and I urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1888-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1888-H1891]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              RESTORING RESPECT FOR AMERICA'S RULE OF LAW\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Moolenaar). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Iowa (Mr. King) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, it is my privilege to have the \nopportunity to address you here on the floor of the United States House \nof Representatives.\n  I listened to a lot of discussion here with which I disagree, of \ncourse; but I keep hearing this term ``do your job'' that seems to echo \nout of the left constantly. ``Do your job.''\n  One of the arguments is that the President of the United States has a \nconstitutional right to nominate to the Supreme Court. He does. That is \npretty clear in the Constitution. However, the Senate determines what \nadvice is, and the Senate determines that which is consent, and no \nnomination to the Federal court can move forward without the Senate's \nadvice and consent. It is the Senate's job then to evaluate the \nPresident's nominations, and they can do so with or without hearings, \nwith or without interviews. The Senate writes its own rules just like \nthe House writes its own rules, Mr. Speaker. I would like to put this \nback in perspective here.\n  We have a lameduck President who has made appointments to the Supreme \nCourt, which seems to believe that the Constitution means what they \nwant it to mean, and they want to read it to say what they want it to \nsay rather than what it actually says and rather than what it actually \nwas understood to mean at the time of its ratification.\n  When you have Justices on the Supreme Court who embody that belief, \nwho act on that belief, then we here who take an oath to support and \ndefend the Constitution--and that is, actually, all of us here in the \nHouse of Representatives, Mr. Speaker, and everyone in the United \nStates Senate for that matter--recognize that, if we are going to \nsupport and defend the Constitution and encourage the nomination and \nthe advice and the consent and the confirmation of the Senate and \nencourage then a Presidential appointment to the Supreme Court of \nsomeone, we know the President is incapable of nominating anyone to the \nSupreme Court who actually believes what the Constitution says and what \nit was understood to mean at the time of its ratification. He has \ndemonstrated that in the past with his appointments to the Court. He \nwill demonstrate that again.\n  We have a Constitution to preserve, protect, defend, and support and \ndefend, so our obligation then is to say: Mr. President, you are a \nlameduck. Let's stick with the tradition; let's stick with the \npractice; let's stick with the statements that have been made by a \nnumber of Democrats in the past when the shoe was on the other foot. \nPeople like Joe Biden and Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer all would agree \nwith Senator Chuck Grassley: no hearing, no confirmation in the Senate, \nno vote in the Judiciary Committee, and no vote on the floor of the \nSenate for this lameduck President's appointments because we have a \nConstitution that has got to be restored, and instead of being \nrestored, it would be destroyed by another Presidential appointment.\n  We were sitting with a deadlocked Court that sat 4\\1/2\\ to 4\\1/2\\ out \nof a 9-member Court, and you could kind of toss a coin on whether you \nwould get a decision that came down on what the Constitution said and \nwhat the law said or what they preferred the policy was. There are a \ncouple of bad examples of that. This is even with the stellar Justice \nScalia's sitting on the bench not even a year ago on June 24 and June \n25.\n  On the 24th of June, the Court came down with a decision in King v. \nBurwell, in which the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court decided that \nhe could write words into ObamaCare that didn't exist. They were not \npassed by this Congress--not by either Chamber of this Congress, as a \nmatter of fact. It wasn't a phrase that was conferenced out or was \nsomething that was contested. It was never in the bill. It was the \nphrase that read, ``or Federal Government.'' Had that component been in \nObamaCare, then the Federal Government could have gone into the States \nand established the exchanges in the States that refused to establish \nexchanges to comply with the suggestion that came from this Congress, \nby the way, by hook, by crook, by legislative shenanigans, just to \nquote some Democrats who lamented at the methodology they had to go \nthrough to push ObamaCare down the throats of the American people.\n  In any case, the law never enabled the Federal Government to \nestablish exchanges in the States, and the Constitution doesn't allow \nthat authority. In my opinion, there is no enumerated power for the \nFederal Government to create exchanges for health insurance policies \nwithin the States; but the Supreme Court ruled with the majority \nopinion, which was written by the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, \nthat they could add words into ObamaCare. Where it reads that the \nStates may establish exchanges, they added that the States or Federal \nGovernment may establish exchanges. They made it up, and they wrapped \nthemselves in the cloak of constitutional authority in Marbury v. \nMadison and in a whole series of, presumably, precedent cases along the \nline. That was June 24, on Thursday.\n  That would kick the breath out of your gut to hear that, if you are a \nconstitutionalist, and it would bring you to a sad state of mourning. \nYou would lay your head down on the pillow at night, having trouble \nsleeping, thinking: What am I going to do tomorrow? I couldn't react \ntoday. What am I going to do tomorrow? Lord, wake me up with an idea on \nhow to preserve our Constitution.\n  The Supreme Court of the United States believes that they can write \nlaw when here, in Article I of our Constitution, Mr. Speaker, it reads: \n``All legislative powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress \nof the United States.'' That is here, in the House and the Senate. \nArticle I, which are the first words of our Constitution, reads: ``all \nlegislative powers''; but the Supreme Court, wrapped in the cloak of \nMarbury v. Madison and their imagination of what ``precedence'' and \n``stare decisis'' might mean to them decides that they can write words \ninto the law. A Supreme Court writing law.\n  Then the next morning--that morning that I was hopeful that I would \nwake up with an idea on how to address a Supreme Court that has \noverreached--there came the next decision at 9 my time, 10 D.C. time. \nIt was the decision of Obergefell, in which the Supreme Court created a \nnew command in the Constitution. Not just discovered a right that never \nexisted--they manufactured a command.\n  There is no right in the Constitution for a same-sex marriage. There \nis no reference in there at all. There is not one single Founding \nFather who would have ever accepted an idea that they had founded a \nnation that embodied within our Declaration or our ratified \nConstitution or the subsequent amendments that there was some right, \nlet alone a command, to a same-sex marriage. That is a completely \nmanufactured--not just a right but a command--by the Supreme Court of \nthe United States.\n  I have some history with this. The Supreme Court of the State of Iowa \ndid the same thing to Iowans in 2009. I sat in the legislature and was \nan author of the Defense of Marriage Act in about 1998.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  One of the pieces of debate was why do we need to bother to do this. \nYes, it would make sense if marriage were threatened. But it was so far \nbeyond the pale that why would we bother to do this. We saw litigation \ncoming in\n\n[[Page H1889]]\n\nHawaii at that period of time that was trying to force same-sex \nmarriage on America.\n  We wrote--and I was one of the authors of it--the Defense of Marriage \nAct and put it into Iowa law. And from 1998, 11 years later, the \nSupreme Court of the State of Iowa created a command for same-sex \nmarriage in Iowa.\n  Iowans rose up and threw three of them off the bench the following \nelection in November of 2010 not because of the policy decision, but \nbecause they had not kept their oath of office to support and defend \nthe Constitution.\n  They are obligated to read and understand and believe the \nConstitution and then issue their judgments based upon the law, the \ntext of the law, and, as an ancillary component of this, the intent of \nthe legislature itself.\n  Because, after all, the legislature is the voice of the people. The \njudges are not. They are unelected. They are appointed for life. They \nare unaccountable.\n  So there it was on June 25, 2015, on Friday, that the Supreme Court \nmanufactured a command for same-sex marriage. Now, this is appalling to \nme, Mr. Speaker, because I can read this Constitution and understand \nwhat it means. I could read the precedent cases along the way that have \nflowed from Marbury on down to today.\n  It is no longer possible to look at this Supreme Court and discern \nwhat a likely decision of the Court might be by studying the text of \nthe Constitution and the text of the law because we have a Court that \nwill make it up as they go along, write law as they go, and discover \nwhat they would call a new right in the 14th Amendment to the \nConstitution, equal protection under the law. There is equal protection \nalready. There has long been equal protection.\n  That amendment was about making sure that babies who were born to the \nnewly freed slaves post-Civil war would be American citizens and they \nwould enjoy all of the rights and all of the privileges of being a \ncitizen of the United States. A person that enjoyed personhood in good \nstanding, that is what the--the 13th Amendment ended slavery, and the \n14th Amendment guaranteed equal rights.\n  Now this Court has twisted it into a command that there is not a \ndifference between a man and a woman when it comes to joining them \ntogether in matrimony. Well, there is a difference. It has been husband \nand wife in every one of these States until such time as the activists \ngot busy.\n  Those are the kinds of things that, if the States want to establish \nsame-sex marriage, so be it. That is the voice of the people. It is \nconstitutional, and it fits the structure of our United States \nConstitution, along with the various State constitutions and the \nstructure of the rule of law.\n  But if a court wants to manufacture a new right, let alone a new \ncommand, that is wrong. And this Congress ought to speak up. We need a \nPresident that will appoint Justices to the Supreme Court that will \nrule on the text of the Constitution, its original meaning, and on the \nunderstanding of what the text of that Constitution says.\n  So I would back up to the King v. Burwell decision, Mr. Speaker, and \nadd this for the benefit of those folks that are listening in. And \nmaybe there are some staff at the Supreme Court that are listening.\n  If you discover a law, if it is a law like ObamaCare that comes \nbefore the Supreme Court and you the read the text of that and it \ndoesn't include ``or Federal Government'' and you believe that Congress \nwanted the Federal Government to be able to establish the exchanges or \nintended to write that into the law, you don't get to just write it in \nand say that is what they really meant. You have to remand it back to \nCongress and tell us: This is what the law says.\n  So, therefore, if Congress wants the law to say something different, \nwe have to amend it here in the House and the Senate and get a \nPresidential signature on it. That is the constitutional structure of \nthis government that we have, Mr. Speaker.\n  It is a bit frustrating for me to listen to the dialogue otherwise \nthat the Senate is not doing their job because they withhold a \nPresidential appointment when you have a President that has proven that \nhe is not going to put up an appointment that will protect our \nConstitution.\n  This is the time we must defend our Constitution. We must nominate \nand elect a President of the United States who will make those \nappointments to the Supreme Court, who believe the Constitution means \nwhat it says.\n  Mr. Speaker, I didn't actually come here to talk about that. That is \nmy rebuttal to what I have listened to for the last 40 minutes or so.\n\n\n                              Immigration\n\n  Mr. KING of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I came here to talk about the rule of \nlaw, for sure. Part of this is stimulated by an immigration hearing \nthat we had yesterday in the House Judiciary's Immigration and Border \nSecurity Subcommittee.\n  This is the type of hearing that I have listened to too many times. \nIt was one of the hardest hearings I have sat through in my time here \nin this Congress, Mr. Speaker.\n  This was a hearing that had witnesses, such as Sheriff Jenkins from \nFrederick County, Maryland, who has been enforcing immigration law and \nstanding up for the rule of law.\n  He has been prudently using the legal and justifiable evidence that \nhe had before him, and he has been criticized for his effectiveness by \nthe people that don't want to enforce the law. He is a good witness, \nSheriff Jenkins.\n  Additionally, we had witnesses from two families that were suffering \ntragically. One of them was the mother of Joshua Wilkerson. Her name is \nLaura Wilkerson. She has testified before the Judiciary Committee in \nthe past at least once.\n  I have met her at an immigration event in Richmond, Virginia, on \nanother occasion and listened to the tragic, tragic story of her son, \nJoshua, who was essentially abducted from his school--he was about a \nsophomore in high school or so--and hauled outside of town where he was \nbeaten mercilessly and bludgeoned and finally murdered.\n  The perpetrator, an illegal alien who law enforcement had encountered \nand released onto the streets of America, who had no business being in \nAmerica in the first place and who law enforcement already had picked \nup at least once--this illegal alien beat this boy to death.\n  Then he went and bought gasoline and burned his body. He hauled his \nbody out and poured gasoline on it and burned Joshua Wilkerson's body. \nThen he went and took a shower and went to a movie, as if it was just \nanother day in the life of.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, it was another day in the life of America and \nAmericans. It was another life lost to an illegal criminal alien who \nwas unlawfully present in America and who had no business to be here, \none who had been encountered by law enforcement officers in the past, \none whom I believe ICE declined to pick up and place into removal \nproceedings. This happens every day in this country. It happens \nhundreds of times in this country each year.\n  These incidents of illegal aliens that are arrested and turned loose \non the street because the President has this idea of prioritization or \nprosecutorial discretion are costing lives in America. They are \ncosting, in the end, thousands of lives in America.\n  It was a sad, sad story told by Laura Wilkerson yesterday. She had \nthe courage and the heart to come here and share her story with us and \nto place that awful, brutal, ghastly memory again into her mind's eye \nand pour that forth into the Congressional Record so that some of us \nwill soak that up and be mobilized to do something more, to do \nsomething more to resist the President's policy of amnesty, de facto \namnesty, amnesty by executive edict, that has been part and parcel of \nthe Obama policy since the beginning of his time here in office, and it \nhas been getting worse and worse every month.\n  I thank God for Laura Wilkerson. I ask God to bless the life and the \nmemory and the soul of Joshua Wilkerson, who has paid a tremendously \nhigh price because we have an ideological President who, I would say to \nthe other side of the aisle, is not doing his job. In fact, he is \nordering law enforcement officers not to do their job.\n  Federal law requires that, when immigration law enforcement officers \nencounter an individual who is unlawfully present in the United States, \n``he\n\n[[Page H1890]]\n\nshall be placed in removal proceedings.'' That is the law.\n  Our Border Patrol officers are told that, if you are here to enforce \nthe law and you are determined to do so, you better get yourself \nanother job. They have become the welcome wagon on the southern border.\n  Now, most anybody that crosses that border and makes it across the \nRio Grande River or across the land border that stretches from Texas \nall the way across through New Mexico, Arizona, California, to the \nPacific Ocean knows, if you just claim asylum, you can be a refugee and \nthis Federal Government will roll out the welcome wagon.\n  Former Member of Congress Michele Bachmann and I stood on the banks \nof the Rio Grande River at Roma, Texas, here a summer and a half or so \nago and watched as they inflated a raft on the other side of the river, \ntwo coyotes.\n  It was a fairly good size raft. They helped a lady into that raft on \na Sunday afternoon in broad daylight exactly at the shift change for \nthe Border Patrol.\n  They helped a pregnant lady into the raft. She had two little bags of \nher property. They brought that raft across the river, brought it up to \nthe shoreline under the eyes of the city police and the Border Patrol, \nbut it was shift change.\n  One of the coyotes got out of the raft while the other one stabilized \nit. They helped the pregnant lady out of the raft and onto U.S. shores \nand then handed her two little ditty bags. He then got back into the \nraft.\n  The two coyotes went back across the river, deflated the raft, folded \nit up, put it in the trunk of their car. It was a car that we had \nwatched go around and around over there, knowing that it was a coyote \ncar because they recognized it from the U.S. side of the river.\n  The lady stood there. She and her unborn baby and her two ditty bags \nwere waiting for the Border Patrol to show up. It takes a little longer \nduring the shift change, but they show up, no doubt. I didn't follow \nthis case any further, and they would have preferred that I didn't.\n  Here is what I will predict happened: She applied for asylum, the \nbaby is now born, and the baby is an American citizen. She is the \nparent of an anchor baby.\n  Well, that is the kind of person that Barack Obama has granted a de \nfacto, at least a temporary, amnesty to for the Deferred Action for \nParents of--I keep wanting to tell you what that word means to me, but \nthe parents of Americans is what the President would like to call it--\nDeferred Action for Parents of Americans, DAPA.\n  Well, I watched one of those parents of Americans--a parent now--come \nacross the border in an inflatable raft with two coyotes. They got paid \nsomething to do that. I don't know how much.\n  Now the President has issued the edict that we grant this de facto \npermit, this amnesty, for the parents of anchor babies to be staying \nfree in the United States.\n  That suspends the rule of law. It defies the rule of law. It defies \nthe very law, the specified law, itself.\n  That case was heard before the Supreme Court this week, Mr. Speaker. \nThe question is: Does the President have prosecutorial authority, \nprosecutorial discretion?\n  Well, the precedents along prosecutorial discretion--and I don't know \nthat the Supreme Court has ever heard and ruled on a case of \nprosecutorial discretion. I believe they have not.\n  But the precedents that are out there in the lower courts and the \npractice has been that, if a chief executive officer can project his \npolicy through his subordinates, they have to pick and choose which \ncases they will prosecute.\n  Well, when they do that, that is called prosecutorial discretion. It \nhas to be on an individual basis only, and that is by the words of the \nformer Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano, who testified \nbefore the Judiciary Committee to that extent.\n  In the first Morton memo that brought out this prosecutorial \ndiscretion, it creates four different categories or groups of people.\n  So they are utilizing categories or groups of people, declaring it to \nbe prosecutorial discretion, when, in fact, it is not prosecutorial \ndiscretion because it applies to groups of people. It created four \ndifferent groups of people.\n  That is the story of Joshua Wilkerson.\n  The witness sitting next to Laura Wilkerson is Michelle Root of \nModale, Iowa. Michelle Root is the grieving mother of a 21-year-old \ndaughter who was a 4.0 student at Bellevue University.\n  She wanted to become a law enforcement investigator. She had the best \ngrades that you could possibly have, living and loving life. She had \ngraduated and enjoyed the graduation ceremonies the day before when an \nillegal, criminal alien, drunk-driving perpetrator, ran her down and \nrear-ended her in the street and killed Sarah Root.\n  Sarah Root was a 4.0 student with the world ahead of her, wanting to \ncontribute to this country, to life, to society, living and loving \nlife. Her life was abruptly ended by a criminal alien who had been \nencountered by law enforcement before whose immigration attorneys knew \nhim.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Two of them have been quoted in the newspaper at this point. He had \nbeen released. He had been released onto the streets where he now had \nthree times the blood alcohol content allowable by law, drag racing in \nthe streets, killed Sarah Root. Her mother, Michelle, told the story \nyesterday of her daughter, whom she loved so deeply, and all through \nthe rest of her life and her family's life, they will carry this hole, \nthis ache in their heart that didn't need to be.\n  Sarah Root would be alive today if the President had done his job, if \nlaw enforcement had been allowed to do their job, if ICE had responded \nwhen local law enforcement called them, and if ICE--and on top of that, \nsometimes ICE issues a detainer, and local law enforcement releases \nthem from a sanctuary city.\n  This is mixed up both ways. We have ICE, who is prohibited from doing \nits job, who sometimes won't when they want to; local law enforcement \nwho won't cooperate with ICE because ICE sent out a letter a year-and-\na-half ago or so that said ICE detainers are a recommendation, they are \nno longer mandatory.\n  Congress passed a law and directed the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to establish the rule that would have the force and effect of \nlaw that ICE detainers are mandatory. They wrote the rule that ICE \ndetainers are mandatory, and Dan Ragsdale, the interim director of ICE, \nissued a letter that said to all local law enforcement: no, it is a \nrecommendation, it is not mandatory.\n  Now we have in this confused, jumbled-up mess of the refusal to \nenforce the law, to take care that the laws are faithfully executed--we \nhave the deaths of our children--our children--Joshua Wilkerson, Sarah \nRoot.\n  And while Sarah Root's mother is in transit to come here to testify--\nby the way, this drunk driving, illegal alien, homicidal accident that \nkilled Sarah Root, the 4.0 student happened--I keep hearing about the \nvaledictorians that come across the river. Sarah was very close to \nbeing the valedictorian of her college class. She didn't get a chance \nto live and love life beyond 1 day after her graduation.\n  While her mother is here with tears in her eyes, flying from Omaha \nwhere this tragedy took place, to testify before the United States \nCongress, there is another incident in Omaha, this time a very similar \nincident, another illegal alien who had been incarcerated before or \npicked up before and released again.\n  This illegal alien killed Margarito Nava-Luna, a 34- or 35-year-old \nman who was walking down the streets of Omaha. This driver, this \nillegal, had three times the blood alcohol content as well, as was the \ndriver who killed Sarah Root.\n  Now, every one of these are preventable. They are preventable. \nWhether they are a willful homicide or whether they are preventable, \nbut these are the cities, Mr. Speaker, where the Obama administration \nhas released these criminals into. They have released over 30,000 of \nthem. These are where their reoffenses have taken place, in multiple \ncities around, obviously, California and on up along the Pacific Coast. \nWhere there is a lot of illegal immigration, that is where you see a \nlot of the recidivism crime. Here is Arizona. Here is Texas. You have \ngot it in the heart of the heartland, though. That is Colorado. Over \nalong the East Coast, something has happened in most\n\n[[Page H1891]]\n\nof the States, and this is because of the prosecutorial discretion.\n  This President, his administration has released over 30,000 \ncriminals, criminal aliens onto the streets of America. And of those \nthat they released, there have been at least 124 of them who have been \ncharged with homicide for 135 murders. That is 135 dead Americans who \nwould be alive today if the President didn't have the policy of \nreleasing criminal aliens onto the streets. Those are the ones we know \nof, those are the ones that are the recidivism within a 5-year window \nof time whose names we know, whose incidents we know, but that doesn't \ninclude anywhere near all of them, Mr. Speaker.\n  This is the locale. This is the face of one of these perpetrators, \nMauricio Hernandez.\n  What did he do?\n  Mauricio Hernandez, a sexual predator who impregnated the 13-year-old \ndaughter of his live-in girlfriend and repeatedly had sexual relations \nwith her in ways that I won't repeat here on the floor, took her off to \nsoccer games where he also gave her an abortion-inducing drug, and she \nwent into a porta-potty and had a baby who was alive. He went in and \nsaw that baby, and this girl was then hauled home. The baby was left to \ndie. That baby died.\n  Mauricio Hernandez was the perpetrator. He is another illegal alien, \nanother one who had been encountered by law, another one who had been \ngranted this de facto amnesty because of the President's policy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can stand here every night. I could come here and give \nyou these stories, and I can give you the data on the thousands of \nAmericans who are dead at the hands of the criminal aliens who have \nbeen incarcerated for a temporary period of time and released by \nmultiple jurisdictions across this country, and every American who dies \nat their hands is a life that could be saved if we just followed our \nlaws. That is what is at stake here.\n  But we are going to have to personalize it because people over on \nthis side of the aisle have their fingers in their ears on data, but \nwhen they see the faces, when they hear the anguish in the voices, \nespecially of the mothers--I will conclude with this, Mr. Speaker--or \nthe voice of the father, Scott Root, who said when they arrested this \nperpetrator who killed his daughter, he was out before they could bury \nhis daughter, he was out on $5,000 bail, which was less than it cost \nhim to bury his daughter, and that individual absconded back out of the \nUnited States now, not to be reached again by the arm of the law, which \nis not long enough because they put him out on bail.\n  I don't want to see any more bail to criminal aliens. I want to see \nlaw enforcement. I want an expectation that when the law is broken in \nthe United States, that there is going to be an enforcement, that it be \napplied equally without regard to any of these categories that the \nPresident encourages us to be members of, that being one of God's \nchildren is good enough to be protected by the law, but everybody \ntreated equally.\n  Secure our borders. Restore the respect for the rule of law. Save \nthese lives. Send these people into prison, and when they are done, \nsend them back to the country that they can live in legally for the \nrest of their lives if they don't stay in our prisons for the rest of \ntheir lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is an infuriating topic that America needs to know \na lot more about. I would ask, Mr. Speaker, that this country keep the \nfamilies of these victims in their prayers every day until such time as \nwe restore the respect for the rule of law again in America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1891-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1891-H1894]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  WHAT MEXICO REPRESENTS TO ALL OF US\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nO'Rourke) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, to listen to some in this country, and \ncertainly some of my colleagues, Mexico represents nothing more than a \nthreat to the well-being, the safety of this country, and to every son \nand daughter in every community within the United States.\n  It is also a threat, some will tell you, to our economy, to our \nfinancial well-being in our homes, in our cities, in our States. This \nvision of Mexico and our relationship with that country and where the \ntwo join at the U.S.-Mexico border is dominated by this kind of \nanxiety, this scare-mongering, and an attitude of fear that neglects \nthe truth, the facts, and the opportunities that our relationship with \nour closest partner on the world stage truly presents.\n  It is my hope tonight to share with my colleagues the facts, the \npositive truth about what Mexico represents to all of us, certainly in \nthe communities along the U.S.-Mexico border, El Paso, Texas, the city \nthat I have the honor of representing and serving in Congress, the \nState of Texas, where I will be joined by colleagues who represent \ndistricts deeper into the interior of Texas, but really to everyone \neverywhere in the United States.\n  When I listen to some of my colleagues, who can be forgiven much like \nthose in ancient history who, not having traveled to distant lands or \nacross the oceans, could only envision monsters or frightening things \nthat were going to come and get them should they venture past what they \nknew and what was safe and what was home to them, those who do not know \nMexico, who do not live on the U.S.-Mexico border may understandably \nhave their thoughts and their concerns dominated by this anxiety and \nfear.\n  It is my hope, as someone who lives in and represents part of the \nU.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border, to shed some light using facts and \nusing real people, real U.S. citizens, real Mexican citizens, and real \npeople from El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, which together form the largest \nbinational community in the Western Hemisphere and one of the largest \nbinational communities anywhere in the world.\n  When you hear people who are concerned about Mexico and what it \nrepresents to the United States, that fear is often dominated by two \ndifferent areas. One is economic and the other is fear about our \nsecurity in this country. Let me lay some of those fears to rest. Let \nme address some of those concerns at face value using the facts and \nfigures from the United States-Mexico relationship and, again, from the \ndistrict that I represent in El Paso, Texas.\n  Let me start with some of the economic concerns and address them with \nthe economic facts and the economic argument. Some of my colleagues may \nnot know this, but Mexico is our third largest trading partner. And for \nsome States--like the State of Texas, like the State of New Mexico, \nlike the State of Arizona, like the State of California--Mexico \nrepresents our number one trading partner. For many other States deeper \ninto the interior, Mexico represents our second largest trading \npartner.\n  But the volume of trade between our two countries is unlike any \nother, even among our top trading partner, China, for with Mexico, for \nevery dollar of import value that we bring into this country from \nMexico, 40 cents of that dollar was value that originated here in the \nUnited States, components, manufactured goods that were built here in \nAmerica by Americans, by U.S. citizens that were exported to Mexico for \nfinal assembly and manufacture before reimportation into the United \nStates.\n  It is why when we export to Mexico, we win; when we import from \nMexico, we win. That volume of trade between our two countries is \nresponsible for one out of every four jobs in the community that I \nrepresent, El Paso, Texas. It is responsible for more than 400,000 jobs \nin the State of Texas, more than 6 million jobs throughout the United \nStates.\n  I want to make clear that our relationship with Mexico does not just \nbenefit border communities like mine or border States like Texas. You \nlook at New York, 381,000 people depend on our relationship with Mexico \nfor the jobs they go to each and every morning. In Ohio, the number is \n224,000. In the State of Washington, 128,000. In fact, every single one \nof our 50 States has a significant trading and jobs-based dependent \nrelationship with Mexico.\n  Were we to jeopardize that with harmful rhetoric or wrong-headed \npolicies, we would not just jeopardize this historic relationship with \nour partner to the south, we would jeopardize the\n\n[[Page H1892]]\n\nvery well-being and lifeblood for 6 million American families spread \nthroughout this country.\n  In fact, if we don't do a better job of facilitating the trade we \nhave with Mexico right now, we run the risk of losing the jobs we \nalready have. The Department of Commerce estimates that for every \nminute of delay on our international ports of entry that connect the \nUnited States and Mexico, because we are not getting more trade into \nthe United States from Mexico and out of the United States into Mexico, \nwe lose about $166 million. For every minute of delay, $166 million \nlost to the United States economy.\n  Now, let me talk about the security argument. I just heard from my \ncolleague from Iowa that Mexico and Mexican immigrants, whether they \nare undocumented, whether they are pursuing a better life in this \ncountry, whether they are--as almost all of them are--net contributors \nto our economy, to our communities, to the safety of our cities, that \nsomehow they represent this terrible threat, the primary threat for our \ncountry, and the sky and everything with it is falling should we not be \nable to deport these 11 million undocumented immigrants from \ncommunities like Washington, D.C., from El Paso, Texas, from Fort \nWorth, from throughout the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  I would like to share something with my colleagues and with you, Mr. \nSpeaker, about the effect that immigrants have on the safety of our \ncommunities. As I mentioned, I represent El Paso, Texas, which, with \nCiudad Juarez, forms one-half of the largest binational community \nanywhere in the world. Twenty-four percent of the people that I \nrepresent were born in another country, most of them, the country of \nMexico. And I will tell you, it is not in spite of that fact that we \nhave so many migrants in our community but, in large part, because of \nit that El Paso is this country's safest city of over 500,000.\n  So of all large cities in this country, from Los Angeles on the West \nCoast to New York on the East Coast, El Paso is this country's safest \ncity. And it has been not just in the past year, but for years before \nthis last one; and for the last 10 or 15 years, it has been rated one \nof the top five safest cities in the United States. And that is because \nthe relationship that we have with Mexico.\n  The migrants who come from that country are coming to this one to \nbuild a better life for themselves, certainly; but more importantly and \nconnected to our relative safety, they are building a better life for \ntheir kids. They are keeping them focused on their studies, on \ncontributing to their communities, on staying out of trouble and \ngetting ahead and doing better. That is what I want you to know when we \ntalk about security connected to immigration and when we talk about \nsecurity relative to Mexico.\n  I also want my colleagues, who themselves are taxpayers, and the \ntaxpayers they represent to know that today we spend $18 billion a year \nto secure the U.S.-Mexico border. In the last 10 years, we have doubled \nthe size of the Border Patrol force, from 10,000 agents to 20,000 \nagents, and we are reaching, if not already past, a point of \ndiminishing returns where we can do no more good by spending more \ndollars and by adding more agents to already swollen ranks of the \nBorder Patrol. Let me give you some facts that bear that out.\n  In the year 2000, we had 1.6 million apprehensions at our border with \nMexico. This last year, in 2015, we had 330,000 apprehensions.\n  Another way to look at this is that, in 2005, the average Border \nPatrol agents on the southern border, our border with Mexico, made 106 \napprehensions a year. Ten years later, 2015, last year, the average \nagent made 17 apprehensions the entire year; and in El Paso, again, one \nof the most critical sectors for our connection with Mexico, the \naverage agent made 6 apprehensions all year--not in a week, not in a \nmonth, but 6 apprehensions for the entire year.\n  So El Paso is the safest city. Other border cities on our side of the \nU.S.-Mexico border are much safer than the interior of the United \nStates. We are spending record sums, and we are seeing record-low \nlevels of apprehensions. We are literally seeing less than zero \nmigration from Mexico now, and we have been for a number of years.\n  When I hear my colleagues about securing the border before we proceed \nwith immigration reform or any other sensible, realistic, logical \npolicy with regard to Mexico, it begs the question when they ask if we \nsecure the border: How much more secure can we get? How many more \nbillions of dollars do you want to spend? How many more miles of walls \ndo you want to construct? How many more thousands of agents do you want \nto hire? How many fewer apprehensions can we have? How far below zero \ncan our immigration from Mexico reach?\n  The last point on the security issue that I want to stress for my \ncolleagues is this one. Despite the rhetoric, despite the anxiety, \ndespite the fear that is often provoked on cable TV or even in this \nChamber, there has never been nor is there now any credible terrorist \norganization, terrorist threat, or terrorist who is using the southern \nborder--our border with Mexico--to infiltrate the United States. And I \nhave that on public record from the Director of the FBI, the Director \nfor the National Counterterrorism Center, and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  The danger of continuing to surge more resources where we don't have \na problem is that we take our eye and our money and our men and women \noff those places where we know we have had threats in the past, like \nour international airports. In fact, even at our northern border with \nCanada, attempts have been made in the past, and certainly with \nhomegrown, home-radicalized terrorists or potential terrorists in our \ncommunities.\n  That is where we know we have a threat. That is where we need to \npursue that threat. It doesn't mean that we do not remain vigilant \nagainst the potential for a terrorist threat coming along our border \nwith Mexico; but I would argue that, with 20,000 agents, $18 billion \nspent a year, drones flying overhead, 600 miles of wall, we are very \nvigilant against the potential for any terrorist incursion from Mexico.\n  Before I yield to my good friend from Dallas-Fort Worth, I want to \ntalk a little bit about the people who actually live in this binational \ncommunity that I have been talking about, El Paso and Ciudad Juarez, \nwhere, between the two communities last year, there were 32 million \ncrossings. Thirty-two million times someone crossed from El Paso into \nCiudad Juarez or Juarez into El Paso. I thought I would share with you, \nthrough these pictures to my right, some of the remarkable people that \nI live with in the El Paso-Juarez community and some of the amazing \npeople that I represent.\n  The first person that we are looking at is Armando. I started with \nArmando at the end his day as he closed up the plant that he manages in \nCiudad Juarez. Even though he and his children live in the United \nStates, are U.S. citizens, and attend U.S. public schools in El Paso, \nTexas, he crosses over the border into Mexico every morning. He works a \nhard day managing a plant there; and then he comes back over into the \nUnited States, where he pays his U.S. property taxes, his U.S. income \ntaxes, where he contributes by going and helping to coach his son's \nsoccer game, which is where we took this picture with Armando and his \nwife. He is one of these 32 million people that is crossing the border. \nHe is somebody that has come from Mexico that is contributing to this \ncountry, whose children are growing up here. He is someone that I am \nvery proud to have in my community.\n\n  This next slide shows a picture of Israel. Israel lives in Ciudad \nJuarez but attends school at the University of Texas in El Paso.\n  In its infinite wisdom, the State of Texas granted instate coverage \nfor citizens of Mexico to attend schools in our communities in the \nState of Texas because we know that Texas will be the net beneficiary \nof their talent and their human capital.\n  So Israel gets up very early every morning, sometimes before 5 \no'clock, so that he can make it over the international bridge in time \nto get to the University of Texas at El Paso, where he is an all-star \nstudent and also works at the Keck Lab, which is one of the premier \nadditive manufacturing facilities at any academic community in the \nUnited States. These are 3-D printing jobs that are the future of \nmanufacturing technology. And if we do right\n\n[[Page H1893]]\n\nby Israel, Israel is going to want to spend his life and his career and \nadd value and add tax base and add tax income and create jobs in our \ncountry, in the community that I represent. That is why I crossed the \nbridge with Israel to learn a little bit about him and his experience.\n  This slide shows a picture of Vicky, whom I joined in downtown Ciudad \nJuarez. She is walking up Avenida Juarez. Another block or two and we \nwill pass the Kentucky Club, which I want everyone to know we did not \ngo into. It was before 5 o'clock. But Vicky, who is a Mexican national, \nis carrying her shopping bags because at least once a month she comes \nover to the United States, to my community, to spend her hard-earned \nmoney in our local retail establishments and other stores to do the \nshopping for her and her family.\n  In fact, Mexican nationals like Vicky spend about $1.4 billion in the \nEl Paso community annually. That supports tens of thousands of retail \njobs and small-business owners that I represent here in the House.\n  This is the face of the border, the face of Mexico, the face of our \nconnection. This was Vicky, with whom I crossed the border a couple of \nweeks ago.\n  This next slide shows Manuel, who is driving a load of Werner \nladders.\n  Werner is the largest ladder manufacturer in the world. They \nmanufacture about 70 percent of those ladders in Ciudad Juarez. The \ninputs for those ladders come from all over the United States. They are \nconnected to jobs in this country that go over to Mexico. They are \nconnected to jobs there and then reimported here for export for benefit \nof the United States and Mexico.\n  Here he is crossing his load--his part of the $90 billion in U.S.-\nMexico trade that crosses our ports of entry that are connected to \nthose 6 million jobs spread throughout the United States.\n  If we could get those bridges moving a little faster, get more CBP \nofficers to facilitate that trade, we can get more loads of ladders \nmoving across, more jobs connected in the United States to trade and \nmanufacture in Mexico. It is good for my community, good for each of \nthe communities represented by the Members here in the Chamber tonight.\n  And the last slide I will show you is Lisa, and you can see that I \njumped into the backseat of her car as she left the plant that she \nworks in in Ciudad Juarez.\n  She moved down to El Paso from Michigan about 20 years ago. She has \nbeen working in Ciudad Juarez every day with other U.S. and Mexican \ncitizens, creating value in both countries, economic growth in both \ncountries.\n  And so here we are in her car, about to cross back into El Paso, \nTexas, where, again, she pays her taxes, where she contributes to her \ncommunity, and where she is the face of the U.S.-Mexico relationship \nand why it is so important not just to preserve it, not just to respect \nit, but to grow it and to capitalize on it and create more jobs, more \nopportunities, more growth in both of our countries.\n  I thought these five El Pasoans and Juarenses, whom I have the \npleasure of living with in El Paso, the honor of representing here in \nthe House, might tell you a little bit of a different story than the \none that has prevailed and dominated from people who do not live on \nand, frankly, do not understand the border or our relationship with \nMexico.\n  But someone who does and who is here with me tonight, represents a \ncongressional district in Fort Worth and Dallas, who understands the \nimportance of our relationship with Mexico better than almost any other \nperson that I have worked with, is Marc Veasey. I yield to the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Veasey).\n  Mr. VEASEY. Thank you very much, Representative O'Rourke. I really \nappreciate your work on this issue. You have been doing a great job of \nreally kind of setting the facts straight about this issue.\n  There has been a lot of rhetoric out there about what immigration \nmeans. And the fact that you have worked so hard to bring recognition \nabout the economic benefits that the border has, particularly to our \nState of Texas, and you have been very tremendous in your efforts, I \nreally, really do appreciate that.\n  I wanted to just talk about the fact how important the relationship \nis--the economic impact that you talk about all the time--how important \nit is to Texas and the United States.\n  According to the United States Trade Representative, U.S. goods and \nservices traded with Mexico totaled an estimated $500-plus billion in \n2015. Mexico was the United States' second largest goods export market \nin 2015. In 2013, Texas, our home State of Texas exported over $109 \nbillion in goods with Mexico, and that was a 63 percent increase since \n2008.\n  It is really hard to argue with those numbers. It just shows how \nhealthy the relationship is with Mexico and about how incredibly \nfoolish it would be to try to create barriers between our two countries \nthat would cause economic harm to both Mexico and the United States and \nour border State of Texas.\n  The United States' relationship with Mexico, again, when you look at \nthe economic picture, agriculture is something that people oftentimes \ntake for granted--how they get their milk, how they get their fruit, \nhow they get their vegetables.\n  Agriculture is how we eat in this country. I have met with different \norganizations that represent agriculture. I just had some cattle \nraisers from the Fort Worth area here. They talked about the fact that \nwe don't have a comprehensive immigration reform bill and how we need \nto improve our guest worker program and how it is really hurting their \nindustry.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  And these are conservative Republicans that are telling me this, \nRepresentative O'Rourke. These aren't liberal Democrats or advocacy \ngroups. These are people that are concerned about economic growth and \nprosperity in the United States and in border States that are saying \nthat, hey, we have a huge problem here in agriculture.\n  One of our conservative institutes in the State of Texas, Texas A \nUniversity down in College Station, did a study back in 2012 that \nlooked at dairy farms and found that the dairy farms are very heavily \ndependent upon migrant labor. Three-fifths of the milk in this country \nis dependent upon migrant labor.\n  I think that that speaks in and of itself.\n  Without these employees, the study predicts economic output would \ndecline by $22 billion, and 133,000 workers would lose their jobs. And \nwhat are we going to do if that happens? Like, what are we really going \nto do? What are Republicans going to do if that happens, if they were \nable to create borders and barriers between our southwest border?\n  They are certainly not going to make it up with any sort of social \nservices to help people because they are always hollering about how \nthey don't want to expand government. So what are they going to do if \nwe lose all of that money? They are going to do absolutely nothing, and \nit would be very detrimental.\n  Then there is also immigrant entrepreneurship. In addition to \nproviding a reliable workforce, immigrants are also a boost to local \neconomies when they open up businesses in their communities. More than \n40 percent of the Fortune 500 companies here were founded by immigrants \nor by their children according to the Partnership for a New American \nEconomy.\n  I want to highlight one of my friends that has a business in my \ndistrict, Gloria Fuentes. She was actually my guest, Representative \nO'Rourke, at the State of the Union earlier this year. She was someone, \nback in the 1970s, that was fleeing her home country of El Salvador. \nShe immigrated to the United States, and her visa expired. Later, she \nbecame a permanent resident in 1986. And because of her hard work, \nworking extra jobs, going to nightclubs at night to sell tamales and \ntacos, now she has a restaurant chain of 15, all across the State of \nTexas. That was done by someone that came here as an immigrant.\n  Why wouldn't we want to make it easier for people like Gloria to \nmigrate to this country? Why wouldn't we want to make it easier for us \nto be able to exchange and trade ideas with people from countries that \nare south of our border?\n  We are really moving too slowly on the immigration issue. And again, \nthe rhetoric about the southwest border is\n\n[[Page H1894]]\n\nreally hurting our country, particularly when you look at the net \nmigration and how many people have decided that--you know what?--they \ndon't want to live in the United States anymore just because of all of \nthe rhetoric, the hateful rhetoric that is out there, mainly coming \nfrom the Republican side. I think that it is time that it stop because \nI think that our country--I know that our country--is better than that.\n  I just want to thank you for getting this conversation started. I \nwant to thank you for your expertise and depth on this issue. \nParticularly with you coming from El Paso, it is certainly great to \nhave you talking about this so much and reminding people about the \nfacts, because there are a lot of things out there that are floating \naround the Congress--again, coming from the Republican side--that are \ncompletely untrue and deliberately false and meant to spread fear \nacross our country. But the fact that you are here and you are \neducating the country on this very important issue means a lot to our \nState and to the United States. So thank you very much, Representative \nO'Rourke, and thank you for letting me share this time with you.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. I thank my friend from Texas, amidst all this heat and \nthe rhetoric around Mexico, our relationship with that country, the \ncost or benefit of immigration, that he is able to shed some light \nusing the facts, sharing the truth, so that we understand our shared \ninterdependence, shared benefit, and the value of the relationship \nbetween the United States and Mexico.\n  Mr. Speaker, may I ask how much time remains?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman has about 3 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Speaker, I invite my colleagues who have used the \nexcuse--because they believe it--that we must first secure the border \nbefore we can do anything else, before we can improve our relationship \nwith Mexico, before we can capitalize on the shared production platform \nthat is the United States and Mexico today, where 40 percent of the \nvalue of everything that we import from Mexico originated in this \ncountry, is connected to jobs in this country; I invite my friends who \nuse securing the border as an excuse not to move forward on immigration \nreform, despite the fact that we have 11 million people here who are \nliving in the shadows, who, despite that, do their best to contribute \nto this country each and every day in service to this country and \ncreating jobs in this country, in serving those in this country; I \ninvite you to see the truth, to look at the facts, and to understand \nthat our relationship with Mexico has never been more important, our \nborder with Mexico has never been more secure, by any metric we want to \nlook at.\n  Whether it is apprehension, whether it is the total spent on the \nsecurity of that border, whether it is the number of men and women, \n20,000, who are patrolling that border with our closest partner--\ncertainly the closest trading partner in the State of Texas, I would \nargue the most important country for the United States--whether you \nlook at it economically, demographically, historically, or culturally, \nI hope these facts, this truth, this light that we are working to shed \non the issue, will help my colleagues to make better decisions, better \npolicies, and move forward in the self-interest of this country, every \ndistrict, and every person we represent, to do the right thing when it \ncomes to Mexico, to do the right thing when it comes to immigration \nreform, and to do the right thing in the interest of the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1894-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H1894-H1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CHICAGO STATE UNIVERSITY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nRush) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. RUSH. Mr. Speaker, I come here to the House floor today to \nexpress my deep concern and disappointment regarding the grave \nfinancial challenges facing the Chicago State University, which is \nlocated in my district on the south side of Chicago.\n  Mr. Speaker, due to the enormous budget crisis currently taking place \nin my home State of Illinois, the university has not received the State \nfunding that is essential to maintaining its multifaceted operations. \nUnfortunately, Mr. Speaker, after 7 months of utilizing its financial \nreserves, Chicago State University is now in a dire position. Chicago \nState University must confront the real possibility of closing its \ndoors in the immediate future.\n  Mr. Speaker, the impact of this pending reality is far reaching in \nits scope, and it would adversely affect thousands of students and \nhundreds of faculty and staff, many of whom reside in my district, the \nFirst District of Illinois. The entire Chicagoland region would be \nseverely adversely affected by the closing of the Chicago State \nUniversity. Mr. Speaker, my district is home to 4,300 students who are \nenrolled at Chicago State. Fifty-eight percent of these students are my \nconstituents.\n  The great need for this institution is demonstrated by the fact that \nalmost 88 percent of enrolled students receive financial aid. Of those \nstudents on financial aid, 44 percent are first-generation college \nstudents, and 54 percent of these students are low-income individuals. \nIn fact, Mr. Speaker, Chicago State University is renowned for \nrecruiting and graduating nontraditional minority students who, due to \na variety of reasons, have been denied many of the economic, social, \nand educational benefits enjoyed by the greater American society.\n  As U.S. News and World Report notes, Chicago State University ranks \nfirst in Illinois in awarding bachelor's degrees to African Americans \nin the physical sciences, health professions, and other related \nsciences. Additionally, the school also ranks fourth in Illinois in \nawarding baccalaureate degrees to Latino students in the education \nsector.\n  Mr. Speaker, closing Chicago State University, even on a temporary \nbasis, would have a profound impact on the lives of all these students \nwho have worked so hard to beat the odds and who desperately seek to \nprovide a better life for themselves and for their families.\n  Additionally, as one of my district's largest employers, if the \nuniversity were to close, it would have a devastating rippling effect \non the economics of Chicago's greater south side and also in the lives \nof the 850 faculty and staff who are employed by Chicago State \nUniversity. Undoubtedly, the school's closing would also stifle any \nopportunity for economic recovery in communities on Chicago's south \nside and in the nearby suburban area of the city of Chicago.\n  To help address this pending dire situation, in the coming days I \nwill be introducing a bill in the House to provide Federal assistance \nto the university until this budget impasse in the State of Illinois \ncan be resolved.\n  Mr. Speaker, Chicago State University is far too important to the \nfamilies, to the communities that I represent, to simply leave its fate \nto chance or to the political gamesmanship and indifference of its \ngovernmental leaders.\n  Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner should not allow this historically \ncrucial, minority-serving institution of higher education that so \nfaithfully serves the needs of African Americans and Latino American \nstudents to shut down on his watch. Legislative leaders in the State of \nIllinois must not allow this legendary institution to close its doors \non current and future generations of upward-bound students.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Mr. Speaker, April 29 will be forever be known as the Day of \nEducational Infamy in my State of Illinois. It will be regarded as the \nday that Illinois lawmakers let the students of Chicago State \nUniversity down. It will be regarded as the day that Illinois lawmakers \nlet the citizens of the State of Illinois down.\n  It will be regarded as the day that Illinois lawmakers stood in the \nschoolhouse door to deny access to the universally acknowledged \nbenefits of higher education to predominantly minority students who \nstudy and matriculate at the Chicago State University.\n  Mr. Speaker, we cannot afford to not afford to fund the Chicago State \nUniversity. We must do everything in our power to address this ominous \nsituation and provide help to this critical institution that has proven \nto be so vital to the needs of my constituents,\n\n[[Page H1895]]\n\nto the needs of the citizens of the State of Illinois, and to our \nNation as a whole.\n  We must act, and we must act now. Save Chicago State. Save Chicago \nState. Save Chicago State University.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1895-1", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Ms. Maxine Waters of California (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for \nApril 19 on account of unforeseen circumstances.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "20"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/04/20/house-section/article/H1895-2", "month": "04", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H1895]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENROLLED BILL SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
