Members of Congress, I have the high privilege and the \ndistinct honor of presenting to you Pope Francis of the Holy See.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  POPE FRANCIS. Mr. Vice President, Mr. Speaker, Honorable Members of \nCongress, dear friends, I am most grateful for your invitation to \naddress this joint session of Congress in ``the land of the free and \nthe home of the brave.'' I would like to think that the reason for this \nis that I, too, am a son of this great continent from which we have all \nreceived so much and toward which we share a common responsibility.\n  Each son or daughter of a given country has a mission, a personal and \nsocial responsibility. Your own responsibility as Members of Congress \nis to enable this country, by your legislative activity, to grow as a \nnation. You are the face of its people, their representatives. You are \ncalled to defend and preserve the dignity of your fellow citizens in \nthe tireless and demanding pursuit of the common good, for this is the \nchief aim of all politics.\n  A political society endures when it seeks, as a vocation, to satisfy \ncommon needs by stimulating the growth of all its members, especially \nthose in situations of greater vulnerability or risk. Legislative \nactivity is always based on care for the people. To this you have been \ninvited, called, and convened by those who elected you.\n  Yours is a work which makes me reflect in two ways on the figure of \nMoses. On the one hand, the patriarch and lawgiver of the people of \nIsrael symbolizes the need of peoples to keep alive their sense of \nunity by means of just legislation. On the other, the figure of Moses \nleads us directly to God and thus to the transcendent dignity of the \nhuman being. Moses provides us with a good synthesis of your work: you \nare asked to protect, by means of the law, the image and likeness \nfashioned by God on every human life.\n  Today I would like not only to address you, but, through you, the \nentire people of the United States. Here, together with their \nrepresentatives, I would like to take this opportunity to dialogue with \nthe many thousands of men and women who strive each day to do an honest \nday's work, to bring home their daily bread, to save money, and--one \nstep at a time--to build a better life for their families.\n  These are men and women who are not concerned simply with paying \ntheir taxes but, in their own quiet way, sustain the life of society. \nThey generate solidarity by their actions, and they create \norganizations which offer a helping hand to those most in need.\n  I would also like to enter into a dialogue with the many elderly \npersons who are a storehouse of wisdom forged by experience and who \nseek in many ways, especially through volunteer work, to share their \nstories and their insights. I know that many of them are retired but \nstill active; they keep working to build up this land.\n  I also want to dialogue with all those young people who are working \nto realize their great and noble aspirations, who are not led astray by \nfacile proposals, and who face difficult situations, often as a result \nof immaturity on the part of many adults. I wish to dialogue with all \nof you, and I would like to do so through the historical memory of your \npeople.\n  My visit takes place at a time when men and women of goodwill are \nmarking the anniversaries of several great Americans. The complexities \nof history and the reality of human weakness notwithstanding, these men \nand women, for all their many differences and limitations, were able by \nhard work and self-sacrifice--some at the cost of their lives--to build \na better future. They shaped fundamental values which will endure \nforever in the spirit of the American people.\n  A people with this spirit can live through many crises, tensions, and \nconflicts while always finding the resources to move forward and to do \nso with dignity. These men and women offer us a way of seeing and \ninterpreting reality. In honoring their memory, we are inspired, even \namid conflicts and in the here and now of each day, to draw upon our \ndeepest cultural reserves.\n  I would like to mention four of these Americans: Abraham Lincoln, \nMartin Luther King, Dorothy Day, and Thomas Merton.\n  This year marks the 150th anniversary of the assassination of \nPresident Abraham Lincoln, the guardian of liberty, who labored \ntirelessly that ``this Nation, under God, might have a new birth of \nfreedom.'' Building a future of freedom requires love of the common \ngood and cooperation in a spirit of subsidiarity and solidarity.\n  All of us are quite aware of and deeply worried by the disturbing \nsocial and political situation of the world today. Our world is \nincreasingly a place of violent conflict, hatred, and brutal atrocities \ncommitted even in the name of God and of religion. We know that no \nreligion is immune from forms of individual delusion or ideological \nextremism.\n  This means that we must be especially attentive to every type of \nfundamentalism, whether religious or of any other kind. A delicate \nbalance is required to combat violence perpetrated in the name of a \nreligion, an ideology, or an economic system, while also safeguarding \nreligious freedom, intellectual freedom, and individual freedoms.\n  But there is another temptation which we must especially guard \nagainst: the simplistic reductionism which sees only good or evil; or, \nif you will, the righteous and sinners. The contemporary world, with \nits open wounds which affect so many of our brothers and sisters, \ndemands that we confront every form of polarization which would divide \nit into these two camps.\n  We know that, in the attempt to be freed of the enemy without, we can \nbe tempted to feed the enemy within. To\n\n[[Page H6193]]\n\nimitate the hatred and violence of tyrants and murderers is the best \nway to take their place. That is something which you, as a people, \nreject.\n  Our response must, instead, be one of hope and healing, of peace and \njustice. We are asked to summon the courage and the intelligence to \nresolve today's many geopolitical and economic crises. Even in the \ndeveloped world, the effects of unjust structures and actions are all \ntoo apparent.\n  Our efforts must aim at restoring hope, righting wrongs, maintaining \ncommitments, and thus promoting the well-being of individuals and of \npeoples. We must move forward together, as one, in a renewed spirit of \nfraternity and solidarity, cooperating generously for the common good.\n  The challenges facing us today call for a renewal of that spirit of \ncooperation, which has accomplished so much good throughout the history \nof the United States. The complexity, the gravity, and the urgency of \nthese challenges demand that we pool our resources and talents and \nresolve to support one another with respect for our differences and our \nconvictions of conscience.\n  In this land, the various religious denominations have greatly \ncontributed to building and strengthening society. It is important that \ntoday, as in the past, the voice of faith continue to be heard, for it \nis a voice of fraternity and love, which tries to bring out the best in \neach person and in each society. Such cooperation is a powerful \nresource in the battle to eliminate new global forms of slavery, born \nof grave injustices which can be overcome only through new policies and \nnew forms of social consensus.\n  Politics is, instead, an expression of our compelling need to live as \none, in order to build as one the greatest common good: that of a \ncommunity which sacrifices particular interests in order to share, in \njustice and peace, its goods, its interests, its social life. I do not \nunderestimate the difficulty that this involves, but I encourage you in \nthis effort.\n  Here, too, I think of the march which Martin Luther King led from \nSelma to Montgomery 50 years ago as part of the campaign to fulfill his \n``dream'' of full civil and political rights for African Americans. \nThat dream continues to inspire us all. I am happy that America \ncontinues to be, for many, a land of dreams: dreams which lead to \naction, to participation, to commitment; dreams which awaken what is \ndeepest and truest in the life of the people.\n  In recent centuries, millions of people came to this land to pursue \ntheir dream of building a future in freedom. We, the people of this \ncontinent, are not fearful of foreigners because most of us were once \nforeigners. I say this to you as the son of immigrants, knowing that so \nmany of you are also descendants of immigrants.\n  Tragically, the rights of those who were here long before us were not \nalways respected. For those peoples and their nations, from the heart \nof American democracy, I wish to reaffirm my highest esteem and \nappreciation. Those first contacts were often turbulent and violent, \nbut we know that it is very difficult to judge the past by the criteria \nof the present.\n  Nonetheless, when the stranger in our midst appeals to us, we must \nnot repeat the sins and the errors of the past. We must resolve now to \nlive as nobly and as justly as possible, as we educate new generations \nnot to turn their back on our neighbors and everything around us. \nBuilding a nation calls us to recognize that we must constantly relate \nto others, rejecting a mindset of hostility in order to adopt one of \nreciprocal subsidiarity, in a constant effort to do our best. I am \nconfident that we can do this.\n  Our world is facing a refugee crisis of a magnitude not seen since \nthe Second World War. This presents us with great challenges and many \nhard decisions. On this continent, too, thousands of persons are led to \ntravel north in search of a better life for themselves and for their \nloved ones, in search of greater opportunities. Is this not what we \nwant for our own children? We must not be taken aback by their numbers, \nbut rather view them as persons, seeing their faces and listening to \ntheir stories, trying to respond as best we can to their situation, to \nrespond in a way which is always humane, just, and fraternal. We need \nto avoid a common temptation nowadays: to discard whatever proves \ntroublesome. Let us remember the Golden Rule: ``Do unto others as you \nwould have them do unto you.''\n\n  This rule points us in a clear direction. Let us treat others with \nthe same passion and compassion with which we want to be treated. Let \nus seek for others the same possibilities which we seek for ourselves. \nLet us help others to grow, as we would like to be helped ourselves.\n  In a word, if we want security, let us give security. If we want \nlife, let us give life. If we want opportunities, let us provide \nopportunities. The yardstick we use for others will be the yardstick \nwhich time will use for us.\n  The Golden Rule also reminds us of our responsibility to protect and \ndefend human life at every stage of its development. This conviction \nhas led me, from the beginning of my ministry, to advocate at different \nlevels for the global abolition of the death penalty. I am convinced \nthat this way is the best, since every life is sacred, every human \nperson is endowed with an inalienable dignity, and society can only \nbenefit from the rehabilitation of those convicted of crimes.\n  Recently, my brother bishops here in the United States renewed their \ncall for the abolition of the death penalty. Not only do I support \nthem, but I also offer encouragement to all those who are convinced \nthat a just and necessary punishment must never exclude the dimension \nof hope and the goal of rehabilitation.\n  In these times when social concerns are so important, I cannot fail \nto mention the servant of God, Dorothy Day, who founded the Catholic \nWorker Movement. Her social activism, her passion for justice and for \nthe cause of the oppressed were inspired by the Gospel, her faith, and \nthe example of the saints.\n  How much progress has been made in this area in so many parts of the \nworld. How much has been done in these first years of the third \nmillennium to raise people out of extreme poverty. I know that you \nshare my conviction that much more still needs to be done, and in times \nof crisis and economic hardship, a spirit of global solidarity must not \nbe lost.\n  At the same time, I would encourage you to keep in mind all those \npeople around us who are trapped in a cycle of poverty. They too need \nto be given hope. The fight against poverty and hunger must be fought \nconstantly and on many fronts, especially in its causes. I know that \nmany Americans today, as in the past, are working to deal with this \nproblem.\n  It goes without saying that part of this great effort is the creation \nand distribution of wealth. The right use of natural resources, the \nproper application of technology, and the harnessing of the spirit of \nenterprise are essential elements of an economy which seeks to be \nmodern, inclusive, and sustainable.\n  ``Business is a noble vocation, directed to producing wealth and \nimproving the world. It can be a fruitful source of prosperity for the \narea in which it operates, especially if it sees the creation of jobs \nas an essential part of its service to the common good.''\n  This common good also includes the Earth, a central theme of the \nencyclical which I recently wrote in order to ``enter into dialogue \nwith all people about our common home.'' ``We need a conversation which \nincludes everyone, since the environmental challenge we are undergoing, \nand its human roots, concern and affect us all.''\n  In Laudato Si', I call for a courageous and responsible effort to \n``redirect our steps'' and to avert the most serious effects of the \nenvironmental deterioration caused by human activity. I am convinced \nthat we can make a difference. I am sure and I have no doubt that the \nUnited States and this Congress have an important role to play.\n  Now is the time for courageous actions and strategies aimed at \nimplementing a ``culture of care'' and ``an integrated approach to \ncombating poverty, restoring dignity to the excluded, and at the same \ntime protecting nature.'' ``We have the freedom needed to limit and \ndirect technology, to devise intelligent ways of . . . developing and \nlimiting our power,'' and to put technology ``at the service of another \ntype of progress, one which is healthier, more human, more social, more \nintegral.'' In this regard, I am confident\n\n[[Page H6194]]\n\nthat America's outstanding academic and research institutions can make \na vital contribution in the years ahead.\n  A century ago, at the beginning of the Great War, which Pope Benedict \nXV termed a ``pointless slaughter,'' another notable American was born: \nthe Cistercian monk Thomas Merton. He remains a source of spiritual \ninspiration and a guide for many people.\n  In his autobiography, Merton wrote: ``I came into the world. Free by \nnature, in the image of God, I was nevertheless the prisoner of my own \nviolence and my own selfishness, in the image of the world into which I \nwas born. That world was the picture of Hell, full of men like myself, \nloving God, and yet hating him; born to love him, living instead in \nfear of hopeless self-contradictory hungers.''\n  Merton was, above all, a man of prayer, a thinker who challenged the \ncertitudes of his time and opened new horizons for souls and for the \nChurch. He was also a man of dialogue, a promoter of peace between \npeoples and religions.\n  From this perspective of dialogue, I would like to recognize the \nefforts made in recent months to help overcome historic differences \nlinked to painful episodes of the past.\n  It is my duty to build bridges and to help all men and women, in any \nway possible, to do the same. When countries which have been at odds \nresume the path of dialogue--a dialogue which may have been interrupted \nfor the most legitimate of reasons--new opportunities open up for all.\n  This has required, and requires, courage and daring, which is not the \nsame as irresponsibility. A good political leader is one who, with the \ninterests of all in mind, seizes the moment in a spirit of openness and \npragmatism. A good political leader always opts to initiate processes \nrather than possessing spaces.\n  Being at the service of dialogue and peace also means being truly \ndetermined to minimize and, in the long term, to end the many armed \nconflicts throughout our world. Here we have to ask ourselves: Why are \ndeadly weapons being sold to those who plan to inflict untold suffering \non individuals and society?\n  Sadly, the answer, as we all know, is simply for money, money that is \ndrenched in blood, often innocent blood. In the face of this shameful \nand culpable silence, it is our duty to confront the problem and to \nstop the arms trade.\n  Three sons and one daughter of this land, four individuals and four \ndreams: Lincoln, liberty; Martin Luther King, liberty in plurality and \nnon-exclusion; Dorothy Day, social justice and the rights of persons; \nand Thomas Merton, the capacity for dialogue and openness to God. Four \nrepresentatives of the American people.\n  I will end my visit to your country in Philadelphia, where I will \ntake part in the World Meeting of Families. It is my wish that \nthroughout my visit the family should be a recurrent theme. How \nessential the family has been to the building of this country, and how \nworthy it remains for our support and encouragement.\n  Yet I cannot hide my concern for the family, which is threatened, \nperhaps as never before, from within and without. Fundamental \nrelationships are being called into question, as is the very basis of \nmarriage and the family. I can only reiterate the importance and, above \nall, the richness and the beauty of family life.\n  In particular, I would like to call attention to those family members \nwho are the most vulnerable: the young. For many of them, a future \nfilled with countless possibilities beckons, yet so many others seem \ndisoriented and aimless, trapped in a hopeless maze of violence, abuse, \nand despair.\n  Their problems are our problems. We cannot avoid them. We need to \nface them together, to talk about them, and to seek effective solutions \nrather than getting bogged down in discussions. At the risk of \noversimplifying, we might say that we live in a culture which pressures \nyoung people not to start a family, because they lack possibilities for \nthe future. Yet this same culture presents others with so many options \nthat they, too, are dissuaded from starting a family.\n  A nation can be considered great when it defends liberty, as Lincoln \ndid; when it fosters a culture which enables people to ``dream'' of \nfull rights for all brothers and sisters, as Martin Luther King sought \nto do; when it strives for justice and the cause of the oppressed, as \nDorothy Day did by her tireless work; the fruit of a faith, which \nbecomes dialogue and sows peace in the contemplative style of Thomas \nMerton.\n  In these remarks, I have sought to present some of the richness of \nyour cultural heritage, of the spirit of the American people. It is my \ndesire that this spirit continue to develop and grow, so that as many \nyoung people as possible can inherit and dwell in a land which has \ninspired so many people to dream.\n  God bless America.\n  (Applause, the Members rising.)\n  At 10 o'clock and 55 minutes a.m., Pope Francis of the Holy See, \naccompanied by the Speaker and the Vice President, retired from the \nHall of the House of Representatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6194-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        JOINT MEETING DISSOLVED\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Tiberi).

Res. 434\n\n       Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution the \n     bill, H.R. 719, entitled ``TSA Office of Inspection \n     Accountability Act of 2015'', with the Senate amendment \n     thereto, shall be considered to have been taken from the \n     Speaker's table to the end that the Senate amendment thereto \n     be, and the same is hereby, agreed to with the following \n     amendment:\n        In lieu of the matter proposed to be inserted by the \n     amendment of the Senate, insert the following:\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``TSA Office of Inspection \n     Accountability Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) Consistent with Federal law and regulations, for law \n     enforcement officers to qualify for premium pay as criminal \n     investigators, the officers must, in general, spend on \n     average at least 50 percent of their time investigating, \n     apprehending, or detaining individuals suspected or convicted \n     of offenses against the criminal laws of the United States.\n       (2) According to the Inspector General of the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS IG), the Transportation Security \n     Administration (TSA) does not ensure that its cadre of \n     criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection are \n     meeting this requirement, even though they are considered law \n     enforcement officers under TSA policy and receive premium \n     pay.\n       (3) Instead, TSA criminal investigators in the Office of \n     Inspection primarily monitor the results of criminal \n     investigations conducted by other agencies, investigate \n     administrative cases of TSA employee misconduct, and carry \n     out inspections, covert tests, and internal reviews, which \n     the DHS IG asserts could be performed by employees other than \n     criminal investigators at a lower cost.\n       (4) The premium pay and other benefits afforded to TSA \n     criminal investigators in the Office of Inspection who are \n     incorrectly classified as such will cost the taxpayer as much \n     as $17 million over 5 years if TSA fails to make any changes \n     to the number of criminal investigators in the Office of \n     Inspection, according to the DHS IG.\n       (5) This may be a conservative estimate, as it accounts for \n     the cost of Law Enforcement Availability Pay, but not the \n     costs of law enforcement training, statutory early retirement \n     benefits, police vehicles, and weapons.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act:\n       (1) Administration.--The term ``Administration'' means the \n     Transportation Security Administration.\n       (2) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' \n     means the Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security \n     (Transportation Security) of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n       (3) Inspector general.--The term ``Inspector General'' \n     means the Inspector General of the Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n     SEC. 4. INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT.\n\n       (a) Audit.--Not later than 60 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Inspector General shall analyze \n     the data and methods that the Assistant Secretary uses to \n     identify Office of Inspection employees of the Administration \n     who meet the requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and \n     5545a of title 5, United States Code, and provide the \n     relevant findings to the Assistant Secretary, including a \n     finding on whether the data and methods are adequate and \n     valid.\n       (b) Prohibition on Hiring.--If the Inspector General finds \n     that such data and methods are inadequate or invalid, the \n     Administration shall not hire any new employee to work in the \n     Office of Inspection of the Administration until--\n       (1) the Assistant Secretary makes a certification described \n     in section 5 to the Committee on Homeland Security of the \n     House of Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, \n     Science, and Transportation of the Senate; and\n       (2) the Inspector General submits to such Committees a \n     finding, not later than 30 days after the Assistant Secretary \n     makes such certification, that the Assistant Secretary \n     utilized adequate and valid data and methods to make such \n     certification.\n\n     SEC. 5. TSA OFFICE OF INSPECTION WORKFORCE CERTIFICATION.\n\n       (a) Certification to Congress.--The Assistant Secretary \n     shall, by not later than 90 days after the date the Inspector \n     General provides its findings to the Assistant Secretary \n     under section 4(a), document and certify in writing to the \n     Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Commerce, Science, and \n     Transportation of the Senate that only those Office of \n     Inspection employees of the Administration who meet the \n     requirements of sections 8331(20), 8401(17), and 5545a of \n     title 5, United States Code, are classified as criminal \n     investigators and are receiving premium pay and other \n     benefits associated with such classification.\n       (b) Employee Reclassification.--The Assistant Secretary \n     shall reclassify criminal investigator positions in the \n     Office of Inspection as noncriminal investigator positions or \n     non-law enforcement positions if the individuals in those \n     positions do not, or are not expected to, spend an average of \n     at least 50 percent of their time performing criminal \n     investigative duties.\n       (c) Projected Cost Savings.--\n\n[[Page H6196]]\n\n       (1) In general.--The Assistant Secretary shall estimate the \n     total long-term cost savings to the Federal Government \n     resulting from the implementation of subsection (b), and \n     provide such estimate to the Committee on Homeland Security \n     of the House of Representatives and the Committee on \n     Commerce, Science, and Transportation of the Senate by not \n     later than 180 days after the date of enactment of this Act.\n       (2) Contents.--Such estimate shall identify savings \n     associated with the positions reclassified under subsection \n     (b) and include, among other factors the Assistant Secretary \n     considers appropriate, savings from--\n       (A) law enforcement training;\n       (B) early retirement benefits;\n       (C) law enforcement availability and other premium pay; and\n       (D) weapons, vehicles, and communications devices.\n\n     SEC. 6.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA \nOffice of Inspection Accountability Act of 2015.\n  This bipartisan legislation will increase operational efficiency \nwithin TSA's Office of Inspection and will translate into cost savings \nfor the American taxpayer, as articulated in a report by the Department \nof Homeland Security inspector general.\n  I am here today because I have amended this legislation to build on \nthe good work conducted by our colleagues in the Senate and provide \nincreased oversight of the Federal Air Marshal Service in light of \nongoing issues of sexual misconduct within the agency.\n  The amended bill requires the DHS inspector general to report to \nCongress on a review of TSA's existing policies for identifying misuse \nof government resources within the Federal Air Marshal Service as well \nas TSA's strategy for addressing instances of misconduct within the \nFederal Air Marshal Service.\n  This provision has, unfortunately, become necessary, as we have \nlearned of recent egregious examples of both alleged sexual misconduct \nand misuse of government resources by air marshals.\n  In early September of this year, I was made aware of alleged sexual \nmisconduct by three Federal air marshals in Chicago, Illinois, which \ncame to light through an examination of a government-issued cellular \ntelephone due to a workman's compensation claim investigation.\n  The Federal Air Marshal Service self-reported that the involved \nemployees not only utilized government-issued cellular telephones for \nunauthorized purposes, but hotel rooms paid for with government funds \nwere used to engage in sexual misconduct.\n  I understand that managing a workforce that operates worldwide is a \nmonumental task. But, as leaders, it is imperative that we maintain \ndiscipline in order to accomplish the overall mission of keeping our \nskies safe.\n  These and other allegations of misconduct have plagued the agency and \nare devastating to the public trust, employee morale, and the high \ndegree of integrity that must be maintained by Federal law enforcement \nofficers charged with securing aviation and protecting acts of \nterrorism.\n  Earlier this year my subcommittee held a hearing to examine the \nFederal Air Marshal Service, and we plan to continue to provide \nrigorous oversight as TSA works to address these disturbing examples of \nflagrant abuse of government resources and deplorable behavior.\n  I wish to thank the original sponsor of this legislation, the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Sanford), for his leadership on this \nissue as well as Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson, and Ranking \nMember Rice for their support.\n  Also, I would like to thank my colleagues in the Senate, particularly \nChairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, for their work in \ncontributing to the bill and passing it through that Chamber. I look \nforward to working with them and working towards final passage of this \nbill, as amended.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 719, the TSA Office of Inspection \nAccountability Act of 2015.\n  In September 2013, the Department of Homeland Security inspector \ngeneral released a report detailing the Transportation Security \nAdministration's misclassification of certain employees in its Office \nof Inspection as criminal investigators.\n  Specifically, the inspector general found that the workload of these \ncriminal investigators did not fit the Federal workload requirement to \njustify their title.\n  Because of this misclassification, these employees received enhanced \nbenefits, such as premium pay, early retirement, and other benefits \ncommensurate with the position, despite the fact that they perform \nlittle to no investigative duties.\n  Whereas the workload for a properly classified criminal investigator \npredominantly involves investigating criminal cases, the inspector \ngeneral found that the workload for these employees consisted largely \nof investigating noncriminal cases, carrying out inspections, covert \ntesting, and internal reviews, all tasks that could be performed by \nemployees who do not receive the enhanced benefits.\n  As the ranking member of the Homeland Security Subcommittee on \nOversight and Management Efficiency, I believe that it is important \nthat agencies utilize their resources in a manner that is both \neffective and efficient.\n  According to the inspector general, the Office of Inspection did not \nuse its resources in a manner that would efficiently conduct internal \nreviews, inspections, and covert testing.\n\n[[Page H6197]]\n\n  If no changes are made to these positions, the inspector general \nestimated that it would result in the wasting of as much as $17.5 \nmillion over 5 years.\n  H.R. 719 directs TSA to certify that all persons designated as \ncriminal investigators are working on criminal investigations at least \n50 percent of their time.\n  This threshold is consistent with the Federal standard for the \nposition and ensures that the TSA is providing enhanced pay and \nbenefits to those who actually perform the duties of a criminal \ninvestigator.\n  This measure will not affect those with the proper classification of \ncriminal investigator and will not impede efforts to thwart terror \nplots and other criminal enterprises that threaten our national \nsecurity.\n  This legislation also incorporates changes meant to address instances \nin which Federal Air Marshal Service officials have used their official \ncapacities to obtain benefits from private vendors and to also address \nrecent allegations of misconduct involving the misuse of government \nresources and solicitation by reviewing existing personnel and code of \nconduct policies.\n  This legislation is common sense and reflects a commitment to good \ngovernment.\n  Mr. Speaker, if enacted, H.R. 719 will bring greater accountability \nto TSA's Office of Inspection. This measure will also ensure that \ntaxpayer dollars are being used efficiently and that past abuses are \nnot repeated.\n  I urge Members to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 719.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  It is critical that we in Congress assert our oversight priorities to \nensure that taxpayer dollars and government resources are being used in \na responsible manner. We must make certain that our Federal employees, \nespecially those in positions of law enforcement and significant public \ntrust, are not misusing government resources to engage in sexual \nmisconduct and are exhibiting the highest degree of moral fortitude.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand agree to the resolution, H.R. 434.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the resolution was agreed to.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6197-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6197-H6198]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n JACOB TRIEBER FEDERAL BUILDING, UNITED STATES POST OFFICE, AND UNITED \n                           STATES COURT HOUSE\n\n  Mr. CRAWFORD.

I ask unanimous consent that all Members may have 5 \nlegislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on S. 1707.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Arkansas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 1707 would designate the Federal building located at \n617 Walnut Street in Helena, Arkansas, as the Jacob Trieber Federal \nBuilding, United States Post Office, and United States Court House.\n  Judge Trieber, a Prussian immigrant, eventually became the first \nJewish Federal judge in our Nation's history. Settling in Helena, \nArkansas, Judge Trieber issued rulings to protect against racial \ndiscrimination more than six decades before the Supreme Court would. \nFor his unmatched dedication to justice, a lifetime of service, and his \nmany landmark rulings, we seek support in renaming the Federal building \nin his honor.\n  Appointed to the United States District Court for the Eastern \nDistrict of Arkansas by President McKinley in 1900, he served for 27 \nyears and became one of the country's most distinguished jurists and \nrenowned constitutional scholars. Working simultaneously on more than \n1,000 cases each year, Judge Trieber issued nationally important \nrulings on controversies that included antitrust cases, railroad \nlitigation, prohibition cases, and mail fraud. Several of his rulings, \nespecially the ones regarding civil rights and wildlife conservation, \nstill have implications today.\n  Judge Trieber took an early interest in civil rights, especially \nafter seeing how discrimination against Jews consumed his home country \nof Prussia. After the move to his new home in the United States, \nArkansas became very dear to him, but the blatant racism he saw \nfirsthand affected his outlook on life and his work even more than what \nhe had encountered in Prussia. Judge Trieber ``sought to communicate--\nthrough his own life and deeds and his commitment to equal justice--\nthat racism was detrimental to the people of Arkansas'' and that only \nuntil the State's race relations problem was solved could the ``State's \ngreat potential be achieved.''\n  Since Arkansas' judicial system alone could not prevent the \ncommonplace violence and racism, Judge Trieber took it upon himself to \nfight against injustice through several landmark rulings, two of which \ndealt with employment discrimination. He also fought against unfair \nelection laws, which he correctly believed were unfair to women and \nBlacks.\n  Going against conventional thought and even at risk to himself, Judge \nTrieber ruled against local hate groups, writing that ``the rights to \nlease lands and to accept employment for hire are fundamental rights, \ninherent in every free citizen.''\n  Although he was overruled in 1906 by the Supreme Court, the Civil \nRights Act of 1964 had finally granted the comprehensive protection \nagainst racial discrimination that Judge Trieber had long sought. In \n1968, the Supreme Court overturned their original ruling against Judge \nTrieber's interpretation, saying that his interpretation of the law was \nat last vindicated.\n  In 1927, Judge Trieber departed this life and was buried in Little \nRock at Oakland Cemetery. He would never live to see the changes he \nfought so hard for, but by renaming the Federal building in the town he \nloved, we preserve his memory and acknowledge his very early role in \nthe most important civil rights movement our Nation has ever seen.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. BROWN of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with my colleague's endorsement of Judge \nTrieber's legacy as a trailblazer and champion of civil rights for all \nAmericans.\n  Judge Jacob Trieber was a highly respected Federal judge in the \nEastern District of Arkansas who served with distinction for 27 years. \nJudge Trieber\n\n[[Page H6198]]\n\nwas one of the first Federal judges to embrace international treaties \nas a basis for Federal policy to trump State regulation with respect to \npollution control, endangered species preservation, and wetlands \nconservation.\n  Judge Trieber also famously ruled that a local group of White \ncitizens could not compel a sawmill to fire its Black workers. Judge \nTrieber's original decision was later cited as a foresighted ruling \nthat had correctly interpreted the 13th Amendment.\n  Because of Judge Trieber's long history of public service and \noutstanding judicial service, it is appropriate to name the U.S. \nFederal building in Helena, Arkansas, as the Jacob Trieber Federal \nBuilding, United States Post Office, and United States Court House.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no additional speakers. I support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CRAWFORD.

Judge Holloway was nominated by the Tenth Circuit Court \nof Appeals by President Johnson in 1968. He served as chief judge from \n1984 to 1991 and assumed senior status in 1992 until his death in 2014.\n  During his 45 years on the bench, he authored over 900 opinions and \nbecame the longest serving tenth circuit judge.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation.\n  Judge Holloway was well-respected and served for over 45 years as an \nappellate judge in the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals. During his \ntenure, Judge Holloway wrote more than 900 appellate opinions and \ncontinued to serve as a judge until his death in 2014.\n  Judge Holloway received many awards, including the President's Award \nfrom the Oklahoma Bar Association and the Humanitarian Award from the \nNational Conference of Christians and Jews, and had a prestigious \nlecture series named after him.\n  Because of Judge Holloway's long Federal service and his universally \nrevered work ethic, I support naming the U.S. Courthouse located in \nOklahoma City, Oklahoma, as the William J.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 3116, the Quarterly \nFinancial Report Reauthorization Act, sponsored by my colleague from \nthe Oversight and Government Reform Committee, Congressman Ted Lieu.\n  Mr. Speaker, since 1947, Quarterly Financial Report, often referred \nto as the QFR program, has collected and published key data on American \ncorporate financial results. It is the primary source of data for GDP \nestimates and other top-line economic estimates. Ever since its first \ndevelopment, the QFR program has been one of our Nation's most \nimportant economic indicators.\n  Quite simply, this survey allows us to measure how large sectors of \nour economy are doing. Without the QFR, we would lose a seven-decade \neconomic trendline. The QFR's loss would also have significant negative \nimpacts on a wide variety of economic indicators.\n\n[[Page H6199]]\n\n  Authorization for this important program expires next week at the end \nof the fiscal year. Today we consider a bill introduced by Congressman \nTed Lieu that will reauthorize this key program for an additional 15 \nyears.\n  The Oversight and Government Reform Committee approved this bill \nwithout objection on July 22. It is a good bill, and I would like to \nthank Congressman Ted Lieu for his good work on this and his leadership \non this issue, and I would urge my colleagues to support and pass this \nbill.\n  Further, I would also urge my colleagues in the Senate to take quick \naction on the legislation as well. The QFR program is vital for \nunderstanding our economy, and we cannot and should not let it expire.\n  Again, I urge passage of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, earlier this year, I introduced the Quarterly Financial \nReport Reauthorization Act, a bill that would reauthorize a vital and \ncommonsense program for 15 years. The Committee on Oversight and \nGovernment Reform ordered the bill reported by voice vote in July of \n2015.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz and Ranking Member Cummings for \nworking to quickly move this bill forward prior to the program's \nexpiration this year.\n  Since the end of World War II, the QFR has been a closely watched \nprincipal economic indicator used to determine our Nation's gross \ndomestic product, the Federal Reserve's Flow of Funds account, and \nother vital economic estimates.\n  It is conducted by the U.S. Census Bureau based on a sample size of \n12,500 companies across a variety of industry sectors, from mining, to \nmanufacturing, to information and professional services. The end result \nis timely, accurate data on business financial conditions for over one-\nthird of our economy that is widely used by both government and private \nsector actors.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  The program plans to further expand coverage to over 60 percent of \nour economy, tracking additional sectors and industries, such as health \ncare and real estate.\n  The Department of Commerce has called the reauthorization of this \nprogram a top priority, and the U.S. Census Bureau has received letters \nof validation from both the public and private sectors.\n  The Small Business Administration supports it as do companies such as \nProQuest, a Michigan-based global information content and technology \ncompany, and companies such as Wells Fargo, whose chief economist wrote \nin support of this QFR and said: Good decisions require good \ninformation.\n  At a time when our country is not that far removed from the wake of \nthe global financial crisis, we need all the tools at our disposal to \nmeasure the state of our economy and to chart our progress.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I appreciate the work of Mr. \nLieu. This is a good example of our working together on both sides of \nthe aisle.

I thank the chairman for helping us to usher this \nlegislation through today. I very much appreciate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I stand before the House to honor the life and the \nlegacy of one of New Jersey's sons, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine \nof Waldwick, New Jersey.\n  Staff Sergeant D'Augustine was killed more than 3 years ago--that was \nback on March 27, 2012--while conducting combat operations in \nAfghanistan. In the greatest possible act of self-sacrifice, he gave \nhis life while protecting the lives of men and women in uniform. He was \njust 29 years old.\n  Today it is fitting that this House will honor him by passing \nlegislation to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService, located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, New Jersey, as \nthe Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office Building.\n  While nothing will ever heal the loss left by Staff Sergeant \nD'Augustine to his family, to his friends, and to his community, \ntoday's vote will ensure that all of the residents of this town will \nhave a permanent reminder of the ultimate sacrifice made by one of \ntheir native sons.\n  To protect our freedom, to protect our liberty, to protect our way of \nlife, a few brave men and women have answered that call of duty. They \nstand--and have stood--between us here in the United States and those \nwho would do us harm. So I am privileged to come here and stand before \nthis House to honor one of those men today.\n  You see, it was just one day after graduating from Waldwick High \nSchool in 2001 that Staff Sergeant D'Augustine enlisted in the United \nStates Marine Corps.\n  He was assigned then to the 8th Engineer Support Battalion, 2nd \nMarine Logistics Group, 2nd Marine Expeditionary Force. He had served \ntwo full tours of duty in Iraq and was just 2 weeks away from \ncompleting his second tour of duty in Afghanistan.\n  He worked as something called an explosive ordnance disposal tech, \nand he was going ahead of his fellow marines, soldiers, sailors, and \nairmen. He was the one clearing the way for them. Although we will \nnever know the number of lives that he saved, I think his numerous \nawards speak for his selfless heroism.\n  He was awarded the Bronze Star with Valor, the Purple Heart, the Navy \nand Marine Commendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement \nMedal, the Combat Action Ribbon, the Good Conduct Medal, the National \nDefense Service Medal, the Afghanistan Campaign Medal, the Iraq \nCampaign\n\n[[Page H6200]]\n\nMedal, the Global War on Terrorism Medal, the Global War on Terrorism \nService Medal, the Korean Defense Service Medal, the Humanitarian \nService Medal, and the NATO-ISAF Medal. I think all of these speak of \nhis selfless heroism.\n  Even now, after his passing, Staff Sergeant D'Augustine's legacy \ncontinues in his community. The Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine \nMemorial Fund offers a scholarship to one male graduating senior and to \none female graduating senior who exemplify the highest standards of \ncitizenship through strong character and dedication to community \nservice. Since October of 2012, the fund has donated more than $94,000 \nto numerous charities as well as direct donations to veterans in need.\n  The tremendous outpouring of love and support for his family since \nhis death has provided a glimpse into the numbers of lives that he has \ntouched and to the number of lives his love continues to touch.\n  To those who knew him best--his parents, Anthony and Patricia; his \nthree sisters, Nicole, Jennifer, Michele; and his brother-in-law, Len--\nhe will be remembered as a loving son and brother.\n  To his fellow marines, he will be remembered as a faithful brother in \narms. To this Nation, he will be remembered as a patriot who loved this \ncountry, who loved the Marine Corps, and who gave his life in defense \nof freedom.\n  The Marine Corps' motto is Semper Fidelis, always faithful. Staff \nSergeant D'Augustine lived this motto, and his legacy embodies it. He \nwas faithful to his country; he was faithful to the mission; he was \nfaithful to the Corps; and he was faithful to his fellow marines.\n  In times such as this, words do fail to provide adequate comfort to \nhis family and to his friends; but it is my hope, as I think it is the \nhope of us all, to know that the prayers and gratitude of this Nation \nare with them.\n  I want to thank my colleagues for supporting this legislation. Again, \nI thank the chairman for moving this legislation, for ensuring that the \nStaff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office becomes an everlasting \nhonor to his legacy and service to our Nation.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of S. 994, a \nbill to designate the Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine Post Office.\n  A native of New Jersey, Joseph D'Augustine attended Waldwick High \nSchool, where he wrestled and played football.\n  Following his graduation, Joseph joined the Marine Corps, serving two \ntours of duty as an infantryman in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  On March 27, 2012, while serving his second tour in Afghanistan, \nJoseph was tragically killed while working to diffuse a bomb.\n  Having served on Active Duty myself--and still in the Reserves--I \nwant to honor Joseph for his service and also his family for their \nsacrifice and their loss.\n  Joseph received a number of awards for his dedicated service, \nincluding the Bronze Star, the Purple Heart, the Navy and Marine Corps \nCommendation Medal, the Navy and Marine Corps Achievement Medal, and \nthe Humanitarian Service Medal.\n  In addition to Joseph's courageous military service, he is remembered \nfor giving back to his hometown through a youth wrestling program that \nhe cofounded with his father.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor the years that Staff \nSergeant D'Augustine dedicated to this country and the ultimate \nsacrifice he made on our behalf.\n  I urge the passage of S. 994.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in closing, you have heard today of the \npassionate, deep-felt belief of our colleague, Congressman Garrett. It \nis very appropriate to pass this bill and name this post office after \nStaff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine.\n  I didn't know his family, but I hope his family will know today, \ntomorrow, and forever how grateful this Nation is. People like him step \nup; they serve; they answer the call of their country.\n  I hope we always remember that and give pause and thanks to those men \nand women who do sacrifice. So I find it very appropriate that we would \nname this post office after this young man, Staff Sergeant Joseph \nD'Augustine.\n  I urge the passage of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We are honored that he is championing this bill through the \nHouse.\n  I think he has the best perspective from which to give an overview of \nwhy it is appropriate that we honor Staff Sergeant Robert Dietz for his \nsacrifice to this country and honor him.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Gibson).\n  Mr. GIBSON. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor a member of the Greatest \nGeneration from my district in upstate New York. H.R. 1442 renames the \npost office in Kingston, New York, after Staff Sergeant Robert Dietz, \nwho was awarded the Medal of Honor for his courageous actions during \nWorld War II.\n  Sergeant Dietz hailed from Kingston, New York, a proud and historical \ncity in New York's 19th Congressional District.\n  In March of 1945, Sergeant Dietz led his squad on an attack of a \nheavily fortified German position while protecting a key bridge.\n  Under heavy machine gun fire, Sergeant Dietz advanced forward, \nclearing enemy obstacles, providing a path for the men of his squad and \nplatoon.\n  This selfless act enabled the success of this attack, but in the \nprocess, Sergeant Dietz made the supreme sacrifice and was killed while \nvaliantly leading his men.\n  Last year I had several local veterans' service organizations reach \nout to me to rename the post office in Kingston for Sergeant Dietz. I \nthank these organizations, including the Kingston Veterans Association, \nWilliam Forte, and Dan Joyce, for their leadership and for their \nsupport of this bill.\n  I want to thank Chairman Chaffetz, Ranking Member Cummings, and the \nentire Oversight and Government Reform Committee for passing this bill \nearlier this year.\n\n[[Page H6201]]\n\n  I also want to thank the entire New York State delegation for its \nstrong support of this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we pause to remember Sergeant Dietz and all of \nthose men and women who have lost their lives in defense of our \nfreedoms.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1442.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 1442, \na bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service as \nthe ``Staff Sergeant Robert H. Dietz Post Office Building.''\n  A Kingston native, Sergeant Dietz served in the Army's 38th Armored \nInfantry Battalion, 7th Armored Division, during World War II. He was \nposthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for his valor, and this is some \nof what he did.\n  He was leading a squad as they advanced, and a minefield and two \nwell-defended bridges blocked their path. Despite heavy fire, Sergeant \nDietz led his men through the minefield and forged on.\n  In a show of unmatched courage, Sergeant Dietz dodged bullets to \nindependently advance to the first bridge, where he killed the bazooka \nteam that was defending the structure.\n  He continued to advance, killing another bazooka team as well as \nother German soldiers who fired at him. In his final act of bravery, \nSergeant Dietz dove into waist-deep water to disconnect the demolition \ncharges on the second bridge, and he was struck and killed by German \nsniper fire when he stood to alert his men that their route was then \nclear.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill in order to honor Sergeant \nDietz' valiant actions and to remember a man who truly put his country \nbefore himself.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 1442.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, Staff Sergeant Dietz, this is what made \nAmerica great. People like this stepped up and answered the call. They \nfind themselves in a most impossible situation, but they are fighting \nfor their country. It embodies the American spirit.\n  I would urge the passage today of H.R. 1442.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Zachary M. Fisher \nPost Office.\n  I find this very appropriate. This is a young person who went to \nserve their country, and we honor that person.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Wagner), the Congresswoman who has championed this through the \nHouse of Representatives.\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to honor a brave American \nhero, Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, from my hometown of Ballwin, \nMissouri.\n  On July 14, 2010, Missouri's Second District lost a brave young man \nwhen United States Army Sergeant Zach Fisher was killed by an IED while \nserving during Operation Enduring Freedom. Sergeant Fisher was assigned \nto the 27th Engineer Battalion of the 20th Engineer Brigade based out \nof Fort Bragg, North Carolina. He was 24 years old when he died at \nForward Operating Base Lagman in Afghanistan.\n  Zach graduated in 2004 from Marquette High School in St. Louis, where \nhis history teacher remembered him as a patriotic student with an \ninterest in how the United States developed as a country.\n  Zach met his beautiful and loving wife, Jessica, just before his \nearlier deployment in Iraq. At the time of his death, they had been \nmarried for just 2 years.\n  Sergeant Fisher is survived by his parents, Sue and Jim Jacobs and \nBob and Alicia Fisher; and three brothers, Andrew, Clayton, and \nAlexander; along with two sisters, Emily and Zoe.\n  Zach initially enlisted in the United States Army Reserves. When he \ntold his parents that he wanted to report for Active Duty, they asked \nhim to give them two good reasons why he would choose to put himself in \nharm's way in the service of his country. His reply said a lot about \nthe character of the man Zach Fisher. He wanted to join the Army \nbecause he wanted the discipline that it would provide, and he wanted \nto be part of something bigger than himself.\n  Although the United States of America can never fully repay the \npriceless debt we owe to Sergeant Fisher, we can do our part to ensure \nthat his memory lives on. Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. \n322, a bill that names the Chesterfield main post office after such a \ncourageous young man, memorializing a hero who gave up his life in \nservice to the Nation that he loved.\n  All of Zachary's friends would say that Zach was their best friend. \nHe was a dedicated warrior whose commitment to family, friends, and \ncountry will be long remembered.\n  I am proud that this legislation will serve as a testament to the \ndedication and sacrifice of Sergeant Zachary Fisher, standing as a \nphysical reminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second \nDistrict who chose to serve a cause greater than himself.\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 322, \na bill to designate the Sgt. Zachary M. Fisher Post Office.\n  Zachary Fisher was born in Missouri in 1986. A 2004 graduate of \nMarquette High School, Zachary was known for his passion for American \nhistory, patriotism, and academic excellence.\n  To those who knew him, it was no surprise that Zachary decided to \nserve his country by enlisting in the Army Reserves in 2006. In 2007, \nhe was deployed to Iraq in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom, and \nlater, in December 2009, to Afghanistan.\n  Tragically, on July 14, 2010, Sergeant Fisher and seven of his fellow \nsoldiers were killed in Afghanistan after insurgents attacked their \nvehicle with an improvised explosive device. For his honorable service, \nSergeant Fisher received numerous military awards, including the NATO \nMedal, Bronze Star, and Purple Heart. Sergeant Fisher is survived by \nhis wife, Jessica, his parents and five siblings.\n\n[[Page H6202]]\n\n  Having myself served in Active Duty and still in the Reserves, I \nhonor Sergeant Fisher's outstanding service and sacrifice to our \nNation, and also the sacrifice of his family.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill and remember the brave \nleadership of Sergeant Zachary Fisher and honor the ultimate sacrifice \nhe made for our Nation. I urge the passage of H.R. 322.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, it is my deep honor to support something \nthat would honor the life, the sacrifice, and the commitment of the \npatriotism of Sergeant Fisher.\n  I hope his family knows and internalizes how grateful his country is, \nhow men and women across the country thank the young people who step up \nand serve their Nation.\n  So we recognize Army Sergeant Zachary M. Fisher, and I urge the \npassage of this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 322.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

We \nare so grateful to be able to remember the great sacrifices that they \nhave made. The person who is in the best position to discuss this is \nCongresswoman Ann Wagner.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of an American hero. \nOn March 16, 2006, Missouri's Second Congressional District lost a \nbrave young soldier when United States Army Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson \nwas killed in a mortar attack while serving during Operation Iraqi \nFreedom. I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of this \ncourageous young woman.\n  Army Sergeant Amanda Pinson was a signals intelligence analyst \nassigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment of the 101st \nAirborne Division, based in Fort Campbell, Kentucky. The Screaming \nEagles are personal to me. My oldest son, Raymond, is presently serving \nas a captain in the 101st Airborne.\n  Growing up in Lemay, Missouri, Amanda enlisted in the Army after \ngraduating from Hancock Place High School, where she won several \nscholarships and was on the basketball and softball teams.\n  Amanda was always concerned with helping others. In high school, she \nstarted her own group called the Hancock Environmental Leadership \nProgram, and she enlisted all of her friends to join her in making a \ndifference.\n  Amanda and her group of dedicated volunteers planted trees at local \nparks and volunteered with local seniors. The group also planted and \nmaintained flowers at the entrance of Jefferson Barracks Park. The park \nwhere she used to plant flowers is adjoined to Jefferson Barracks \nNational Cemetery, where Amanda was laid to rest. A pink willow tree \nwas also planted in her honor at her alma mater, Hancock High School, \nin 2006.\n  Amanda clearly had the respect and the admiration of her fellow \nsoldiers. She was described as a ``model soldier'' and ``a breath of \nfresh air'' by Lieutenant Colonel Lucinda Lane, who spoke at her \nservice.\n  Following her death, Sergeant Pinson was awarded a Bronze Star, a \nGood Conduct Medal, a Global War on Terrorism Medal, and a Purple \nHeart. Her impact on the people privileged to know her is evidenced by \nthe several memorials that honor her life.\n  In 2006, the U.S. Army honored Amanda by dedicating the building \nwhere she worked in Tikrit, Iraq, naming it Pinson Hall.\n  Amanda is survived by her mother, Chris; her father, Tony; and her \nyounger brother, Bryan.\n  The Sgt. Amanda M. Pinson Post Office will join the other memorials \nin her honor as a testament to the bravery, valor, and kindness of this \nAmerican hero who made the ultimate sacrifice for her country.\n  It is my honor to sponsor H.R. 323, a bill that names the Affton \nBranch, Grasso Plaza Post Office after such a courageous young woman, \nimmortalizing a hero who gave up her life in service to the Nation that \nshe loved. May it bring comfort to her family and their friends and \ngive witness to Sergeant Pinson's bravery and sacrifice. To quote the \nface that adorns so many tributes and memorials to Amanda: ``If love \ncould have saved you, you would have lived forever.''\n  So today on behalf of a grateful nation, I say: Thank you, Amanda. \nYou are indeed loved.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration of H.R. 323, \na bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal Service in \nSt. Louis, Missouri, as the Sergeant Amanda N. Pinson Post Office.\n  As has been stated, she was a native of St. Louis, Missouri, and \nattended the high school there. Not only was Amanda one of the top \nstudents in her class, she enjoyed the opportunity to participate in \nsports and excelled in them, all while earning numerous academic \nscholarships.\n  She enlisted in the military, and she served her country. She was \nassigned to the 101st Military Intelligence Detachment out of Fort \nCampbell, Kentucky, where she served as a signals intelligence analyst.\n  It has been stated that, while she was deployed to Iraq in 2006, \nSergeant Pinson was tragically killed by a mortar round on March 16. \nShe was the first female signals intelligence analyst to ever be killed \nin combat.\n  Sergeant Pinson was honored by having the Army's new cryptology \ncenter named in her honor and her memory. Additionally, Sergeant \nPinson's parents accepted a Bronze Star, a Good Conduct Medal, a Global \nWar on Terrorism Medal and a Purple Heart for their daughter's \ncommendable military service.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember Sergeant Amanda \nPinson's unselfish dedication to bettering the lives of those around \nher\n\n[[Page H6203]]\n\nand for her ultimate sacrifice she so bravely made.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 323.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill. It is \nappropriate that the United States Congress honor Sergeant Pinson.\n  I hope that her family will always know how much this Nation is \ngrateful for this young woman's service and sacrifice to her country.\n  She was only 21 years old--21 years old. She answered the call, \nstepped up, served her Nation. While her life was taken, I think the \ninspiration and dedication that she gave her Nation should always be \nremembered.\n  I thank Congresswoman Ann Wagner for bringing this to the attention \nof the Congress and championing it through.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 323.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 323.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6203-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6203-H6204]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   LT.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are here today to honor Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan with a post \noffice naming in St. Louis, Missouri. This has been brought to our \nattention by Congresswoman Ann Wagner.\n  I appreciate her championing this through the Congress. She is in the \nbest position to give the background and the reasoning for the naming \nof this post office.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Missouri \n(Mrs. Wagner).\n  Mrs. WAGNER. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman very, very much for \nhis indulgence in these three post office namings.\n  I thank the ranking member, also.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in honor of a brave young man from \nMissouri's Second Congressional District. On June 23, 2007, Missouri's \nSecond Congressional District lost a true American hero when United \nStates Army First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan made the ultimate sacrifice \nfor his country while serving in Operation Iraqi Freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to reflect on the life of \nthis young patriot. Daniel Patrick Riordan was born to Rick and Jeanine \nRiordan on February 17, 1983.\n  He had a twin brother, Nick, and an older sister, Suzanne. After \ngraduating from Vianney High School in Kirkwood, Missouri, Dan attended \nSoutheast Missouri State, where he was in the Air Force's ROTC program.\n  After graduation, Dan decided to follow his father into the military \nand joined the U.S. Army, quickly becoming known as Lieutenant Dan.\n  Lieutenant Dan became a tank commander, and in 2006 he was deployed \nto Iraq as part of Operation Iraqi Freedom. As a member of Demon \nCompany in the 1st Cavalry Division, Dan served with courage and \ndetermination.\n  Despite frequently being outnumbered in enemy territory, Dan was \nalways out on point, leading his platoon into battle. Dan took his \nleadership responsibilities literally. As he put it: How can I order my \nmen forward if I am not willing to go first?\n  To those who knew Dan, his devotion to his country through service \nand sacrifice came as no surprise. He was both a fierce and dedicated \nwarrior in the service of our country and a caring and loving gentleman \nwho felt a duty to help those in need.\n  From a very young age, Dan showed sensitivity beyond his years. At \nthe age of 5 or 6, while attending a funeral, Dan's mom found him \nsitting with an elderly woman.\n  When she asked him why he was sitting with her, he said she looked \nsad and lonely. It was this kind of compassion that drew him to the \nUnited States military: his desire to serve, help, and protect those in \nneed.\n  While at home on leave from Operation Iraqi Freedom, Dan consistently \nreassured his family that our country's military efforts were truly \nbringing empowerment and freedom to the people of Iraq. He believed in \na cause greater than himself, that of freedom, democracy, and the \ndignity of all people.\n  While in the Army, Dan wrote his mother a letter in case he didn't \nreturn. One thing that he said was: Don't mourn for me, Mom. Celebrate \nmy life.\n  Today we celebrate First Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan's life by \ndesignating the Sappington Branch Post Office in St. Louis, Missouri, \nas the Lieutenant Daniel P. Riordan Post Office.\n  The United States of America owes Dan a priceless debt that we will \nnever be able to fully repay, but we can do our part to ensure that his \nmemory lives on.\n  Therefore, it is my honor to sponsor H.R. 324, a bill that names the \nSappington Branch Post Office after such a courageous young man, \nimmortalizing a hero who gave up his life in the service to the Nation \nthat he loved.\n  This legislation will serve as a testament to the dedication and \nsacrifice of First Lieutenant Daniel Riordan, standing as a physical \nreminder of the bravery of one American from Missouri's Second \nCongressional District.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in consideration of \nH.R. 324, a bill to designate the facility of the United States Postal \nService in St. Louis, Missouri, as Lieutenant Daniel Riordan Post \nOffice.\n  Daniel Riordan was born in Fort Worth, Texas, and then later at the \nage of 5 moved to St. Louis, Missouri. There he attended the high \nschool of St. John Vianney.\n  While attending college at Southeast Missouri State University, \nDaniel worked for the Department of Public Safety and the Jackson \nSheriff's Department.\n  In pursuit of his childhood dream of becoming a fighter pilot, Daniel \nalso joined the university's Air Force ROTC program.\n  Upon graduation, Daniel was commissioned in the U.S. Army, beginning \nhis career in the infantry at Fort Benning, Georgia.\n  By 2006, he had become a tank commander of the Blue Platoon. In \nOctober of that year, his unit deployed for a 15-month tour to Iraq.\n  Lieutenant Riordan survived many attacks from explosive devices with \nonly minor wounds, and he was proud of his unit's brave actions on \nbehalf of the Iraqi citizens.\n  Sadly, in June of 2007, a massive IED explosion instantly took the \nlives of Lieutenant Riordan and four others in his unit. He was \nposthumously awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 324 to remember the brave \nleadership of\n\n[[Page H6204]]\n\nLieutenant Daniel Riordan and to honor the sacrifices he made for the \nlove of our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I urge the passage of H.R. \n324. Lieutenant Riordan served with great courage and sacrifice for his \nNation.\n  I hope his family, friends, and colleagues, those around him will \nlook to him for inspiration, somebody who steps up and answers the call \nof their country.\n  I only hope and pray that his family knows how much we all care \nacross the country for people like Lieutenant Riordan. I appreciate the \nhelp on both sides of the aisle to get this passed.\n  I really appreciate Congresswoman Wagner, who brought this to \neverybody's attention and really pushed to get it done. I hope we find \nit in our hearts to pass this appropriate bill today.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 324.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6204-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6204-H6205]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             RICHARD ``DICK'' CHENAULT POST OFFICE BUILDING\n\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 558, introduced by Mr. \nChabot. It is a very appropriate bill, recognizing someone in the \ncommunity.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nChabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. I thank the gentleman from Utah for yielding.\n  I rise today to speak on behalf of H.R. 558, which names the post \noffice in Springboro, Ohio, after Richard Chenault.\n  Mr. Chenault was born in Xenia, Ohio, on December 26, 1925. He was \nmarried to his wife, Phyllis, for 63 years. They have four children, \nfour grandchildren, and four great-grandchildren. He was a lifelong \nresident of Springboro and Clearcreek Township before passing away in \nNovember 2010.\n  Throughout his life, Richard Chenault dedicated himself to serving \nhis community and his Nation. A World War II veteran, Mr. Chenault \nserved in the United States Army's First Cavalry Division from 1944 to \n1946, including a year in occupied Japan. Upon returning to Ohio after \nthe war, he sought a career in which he could continue to serve, this \ntime in his local community. He found that opportunity with the U.S. \nPostal Service, where he was one of the first letter carriers for the \nSpringboro Post Office. He served his community as an employee of the \npost office for 22 years.\n  But Richard Chenault's dedication to his community and his neighbors \ndidn't stop there. He was a member of the Clearcreek Township Volunteer \nFire Department for 45 years, and he served as chief of the department \nfor 23 of those years. Additionally, he was a part-time police officer \nduring the fifties, sixties, and early 1970s, and was a charter member \nof the Springboro Lions Club, which was founded in 1953. He didn't miss \na meeting for 57 years. Somehow he even found time to frequently mow \nlawns, shovel snow, and check on his elderly neighbors.\n  Not surprisingly, Mr. Chenault was adored and revered by the \nSpringboro community. When he passed, his obituary in the Dayton Daily \nNews was headlined, ``Springboro Icon Dies,'' and he had one of the \nlargest funerals in Springboro history.\n  Since his passing, members of the community have sought the best way \nto honor a man who did so much for so many. Fittingly, the community \nhas rallied to remember him by naming their local post office the \nRichard Chenault Post Office, as it was the post office that allowed \nMr. Chenault to do what he loved best: serve his neighbors.\n  I ask for your support in honoring this extraordinary public servant \nby supporting this bill.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration \nof H.R. 558, a bill to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service in Springboro, Ohio, as the Richard ``Dick'' Chenault \nPost Office Building.\n  We have heard the amazing career and service of Mr. Chenault. It \nincludes service to his country in many ways. Serving during World War \nII, he returned back to his community and continued to serve. He was \nwell-known as a friendly face in Springboro. He became the first letter \ncarrier when the postal delivery started in 1965, and he continued to \ndo so until his retirement in 1988.\n  I want to take the time to note that postal service employment is a \nform of service to our country and to our citizens. That is included in \nhis resume of service, and it is deserving of recognition.\n  He served in the volunteer fire department as their chief. He served \nas a deputy policeman. He also was involved in community groups, such \nas being a charter member of the Lions Club. He had an unwavering \ncommitment to service in his community. One thing that is notable is \nthat Mr. Chenault had perfect attendance at the Lions Club for 57 \nyears.\n  Mr. Chenault is survived by his family, but also by the community \nthat he served. Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to recognize Dick \nChenault's devotion to public service and the impact that he made on \nhis community and those fortunate enough to know him.\n  I would also note that this is an example of an individual who, at \nevery level he was given an opportunity to serve, he did. It is with \nsuch honor that we should give him, his family, and those who knew him \nthis recognition by naming the post office after him. I urge passage of \nthe bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  From what I know about Mr. Chenault, he was a great American. I am \nproud that Congressman Steve Chabot brought this up and moved this \nbill, because he did everything as an American. He served his country. \nHe served his community. He served his family. He was a volunteer \nfirefighter, fire chief, part-time police officer, and a charter member \nand president of the Lions Club. For more than 50 years, he had a \nperfect attendance at the Lions Club. My goodness.\n  He was somebody who gave back to his community and somebody who I \nwould hope young people will learn more about when they see the \ndesignation of this post office. We thank his family. We thank him for \nhis service to his country, his family, and his community.\n\n[[Page H6205]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Utah?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We are preparing and supporting the designation of a post office for \na great American. This is brought to our attention and introduced by \nCongresswoman Louise Slaughter. It is probably most appropriate that \nshe be the one to tell us more about this person's background, this \nperson's life, and why we should name this post office after him. It is \na great American story.\n  I yield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from New York \n(Ms. Slaughter).\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come before the House today to honor a great young man \nwhom the Rochester, New York, community continues to mourn and seeks to \nmemorialize.\n  On September 3 of last year, Rochester Police Officer Daryl R. \nPierson was killed in the line of duty. His job with the Rochester \nPolice Department's tactical unit was important to all of us. He was \nrecognized for working to remove illegal guns from the streets.\n  While securing our neighborhoods and ensuring that our children were \nsafe, Officer Pierson paid the ultimate price at the young age of 32. \nHe was the first Rochester Police Department officer killed by gunfire \nin the line of duty since 1959, and our community will not forget him.\n  He left behind a wife, Amy Pierson--a young widow now--and two young \nchildren, Christian and Charity. It brings me great sadness to know \nthat he will not be able to see them grow up and that they will only \nknow him now from memory.\n  Officer Pierson's death traumatized the entire community, which came \ntogether in mourning. Over a thousand police officers and citizens of \nour area attended his funeral at the War Memorial Building.\n  But he served far more than what he did in the police department. He \nserved as a member of the National Guard. He was also an Army veteran \nof the war in Afghanistan. After all that, he came home to try to make \nhis community safer. He died trying to do that. He was a devoted police \nofficer who did his best every single day of his life.\n  The bill before us would rename the United States Post Office in his \nhometown community of East Rochester, New York, after him. It would be \na wonderful tribute to his service. The most important thing is that \nevery citizen of East Rochester and anyone else who uses that post \noffice will never go into that door without remembering Daryl Pierson \nand who he was and what he did.\n  I think Daryl's mother summed it up better than anyone could. She \nsaid: ``Daryl lived as a hero; he didn't have to die to be a hero.''\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration \nof H.R. 1884, a bill to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service located in East Rochester, New York, as the Officer \nDaryl R. Pierson Memorial Post Office Building.\n  A native of East Rochester, New York, Daryl Pierson graduated from \nEast Rochester High School and attended Monroe Community College. He \nserved our country in Afghanistan before he began his service in the \nRochester Police Force.\n  It is said his calming demeanor and ability to deal with chaotic \nsituations made him a perfect fit for the department's tactical unit. \nAs a member of that unit, Officer Pierson received numerous awards, \nincluding the 2013 Good Conduct Award, and 11 letters of recognition \nfrom the police chief. In addition to his service in Afghanistan and \nhis service as a police officer, he continued to serve as a member of \nthe National Guard.\n  It was a sad night on September 3 when Officer Pierson was shot and \nkilled in the line of duty while pursuing a suspect after a traffic \nstop. He leaves behind a family and a community and country that he \nserved.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to remember Officer Pierson and \nhonor his years of dedicated public service and his ultimate sacrifice \nin order to protect his community. I urge the passage of H.R. 1884.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a great American. He was serving his country. He \nserved his community. As Congresswoman Slaughter brought up, this was a \nwell-supported person within the community.\n  My heart goes out to his wife, Amy, and their two children, Christian \nand Charity. They are very young children, but I hope that they \nremember their father served this country nobly in the United States \nArmy in Afghanistan and in the Army National Guard, putting his life on \nthe line so that other young families could be safe and protected.\n  I hope that his legacy continues on and that, truly, this post office \nnaming will serve as a reminder to all those in the community and our \ncountry that these great people step up, serve their country, serve \ntheir community, and they are loved by families and they do tough, \ndifficult things that, quite frankly, a lot of other Americans wouldn't \ndo. We honor him this day. We encourage the passage of Congresswoman \nSlaughter's bill, H.R. 1884.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support today of H.R. 3059. Congressman Steve Russell, who \nhas served this country in a very noble way, has brought this to our \nattention, introduced this bill, and shepherded it through the \nOversight and Government Reform Committee. We would be honored, I \nthink, all of us, to name this post office after such a great American.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Oklahoma (Mr. Russell) to tell us more about this amazing person.\n  Mr. RUSSELL. Mr. Speaker, this measure is to memorialize the service \nof Bob Kalsu by designating the post office in Del City, Oklahoma, to \ncarry his name.\n  Bob was born as James Robert Kalsu and attended Del City High School \nin Del City, Oklahoma, my alma mater and my hometown.\n  At 6'3\" and 235 pounds, he was an All-American offensive tackle in \n1967, playing for the University of Oklahoma as they won the Big Eight \nConference Title.\n  The Buffalo Bills of New York selected him in the eighth round of the \n1968 college draft, but he quickly proved himself by earning the team's \nRookie of the Year award in his first American football league season \nas guard. It would also be his final season of professional football.\n  Bob had made an ROTC commitment, earning a commission in the field \nartillery in college. In late 1969, he was called to duty in the \nRepublic of Vietnam.\n  He was told that, as a pro football player, arrangements could be \nmade where he wouldn't have to serve, but Bob would have none of it.\n  He said: I gave my word to my country. Just because I play \nprofessional football doesn't make me any better of a man or any \ndifferent of a man then the men already serving our country. I'm going \nto live up to that commitment and the word I gave.\n  Bob deployed to the 101st Airborne Division, leaving behind his \nbeloved wife, Jan, who was pregnant, and a 10-month-old daughter named \nJill.\n  On July 21, 1970, only 8 months into his tour of duty, First \nLieutenant Bob Kalsu was killed in action at Fire Support Base Ripcord \non an isolated jungle mountaintop near the Ashau Valley, Thua Thien, \nSouth Vietnam. He was awarded the Bronze Star and Purple Heart.\n  Bob was survived by his wife, Jan, his daughter, Jill, and son, James \nRobert Kalsu, Jr., born 2 days after he was killed in action.\n  Bob Kalsu was the only active professional football player killed in \nthe Vietnam War.\n  He has been further memorialized as the namesake of FOB or Camp Kalsu \nin Iraq, a base where thousands of Americans served from 2003 to 2011.\n  As long as we have breath we will remember him. This act allows \nothers who live after us to do so as well.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in honoring the service of this fallen \nAmerican hero.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to join my colleagues in the consideration \nof H.R. 3059, a bill to designate the facility of the United States \nPostal Service in Del City, Oklahoma, as the James Robert Kalsu Post \nOffice Building.\n  We have heard about this amazing individual who was blessed with such \namazing athletic skills, who was selected to play football at the \nUniversity of Oklahoma and received All-American honors in 1967, \nleading his team to a 10-1 record and an Orange Bowl win.\n  The following year, after being drafted into the NFL, the Buffalo \nBills, and starting in 9 of his 14 appearances, he was again recognized \nas Rookie of the Year.\n  It was more than his efforts on the football field that made Robert \nor Bob Kalsu a standout. He always put others first and chose to lead \nby example. He joined the ROTC at the University of Oklahoma and took \nto heart the pledge he made to serve his country in the Army.\n  While many athletes elected to serve in the Reserves, he insisted \nthat he was no better than anyone else and choose to serve on Active \nDuty.\n  We know that, after 8 months of being stationed in Lawton, Oklahoma, \nLieutenant Bob Kalsu received orders to go to Vietnam, and less than 1 \nyear later, in 1970, he was killed by enemy fire.\n  It is significant to note he is the only active NFL player to give \nhis life in Vietnam and one of only a handful of professional athletes \nto serve in Active Duty, Lieutenant Kalsu is survived by a family and, \namazingly, a son, who was born just 2 days after his tragic death.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should pass this bill to honor this individual, \nLieutenant Bob Kalsu, and recognize the last full measure of devotion \nhe made on behalf of our great country.\n  I urge the passage of H.R. 3059.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to say, as this is our last post office \nnaming that we have on the floor tonight, that so many of us go to \npostal facilities across the country.\n  I was a postal employee for 30 years, and I know the service that is \ngiven in a Postal Service.\n  But the ability to name a building in a community where so many of us \ngo, I would like Americans to pause and recognize the names that are \ngiven to these facilities.\n  Do take the time to learn about these individuals. This is done so \nthat their service will never be forgotten and that, as we go about our \nday, it is one of the things that we can do to give tribute to make \nsure that their service is not forgotten and to give some comfort to \nthe families who lost someone in service to our country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I first want to thank Congressman Steve Russell for \nhighlighting this person and his life because he truly was an All-\nAmerican in every sense of the word.\n  He serves as an inspiration to a lot of people, and I do hope that \nhis loved ones will remember him fondly for the great sacrifice that he \ngave and commitment that he gave to his country, as did millions of \nother Americans. It is appropriate that we recognize them.\n  And, as was said, I do hope that, as Americans, when we go into these \npost offices, we recognize people like Mr. Kalsu, who put everything on \nthe line to serve and sacrifice for their country to give us the \nfreedoms that we have here today, that we don't take them for granted, \nthat there are men and women who serve who step up and answer the call \nof their county. And certainly Mr. Kalsu did that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this bill, and I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Utah (Mr. Chaffetz) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 3059.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n[[Page H6207]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6207-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6207]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                   SGT.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  America's voters sent the 114th Congress to Washington to help turn \naround this Nation's struggling economy.\n  For more than 6\\1/2\\ long years, America's families and workers have \nbeen waiting for the Obama administration to join with Congress to pass \nmeasures that will adequately restore jobs and growth to our land. The \njob clearly has not been finished.\n  Throughout the Obama administration, America's growth rate has been \nhistorically anemic. The truest measure of unemployment--the rate that \nincludes both discouraged workers and those who cannot find a full-time \njob--remains over 10 percent. Our labor force participation rate \nremains mired among historic lows.\n  Median real household income, meanwhile, is 5 percent lower than in \nJune 2009, when the recession officially ended. Median incomes are \nsupposed to rise during economic recoveries, not fall. The Obama \nadministration has managed to buck the historical trend.\n  However, the President at least pays lip service to the need to \nunleash construction projects. If one thinks back\n\n[[Page H6208]]\n\nto the start of the Obama administration, one can remember President \nObama's plan to solve the Great Recession with the nearly $1 trillion \nstimulus bill.\n  The stimulus was supposed to work, according to the President, \nbecause America had shovel-ready projects from which new, good-paying \njobs would be created once the stimulus was enacted and the money was \ndoled out.\n  While many, including myself, disagreed with the fundamental premise \nof the stimulus bill, the President blamed his stimulus bill's failure \non the lack of shovel-ready projects. As he put it, ``Shovel-ready was \nnot as shovel-ready as we expected.''\n  Mr. Chairman, that is the problem that today's legislation--the RAPID \nAct--is intended to solve.\n  This legislation fulfills post-stimulus bill calls of leaders in \nCongress, the White House, the President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness, and the private sector to streamline the review of \nFederal construction permit applications. It contains well-thought-out, \nbalanced reforms that provide for more efficient and effective \ndecision-making.\n  Stated succinctly, the RAPID Act gives lead Federal agencies more \nresponsibility to conduct and conclude efficient interagency reviews of \npermit requests, demands that any entity challenging a final permitting \ndecision in court first have presented the substance of its claims \nduring the agency review process, and requires that lawsuits \nchallenging permitting decisions be filed within 6 months of the \ndecisions, not 6 years, as the law currently allows.\n  These are simple, but powerful, reforms that will allow good projects \nto move forward more quickly, delivering high-quality jobs and \nimprovements to Americans' daily lives.\n  Prior iterations of the RAPID Act passed the House three times during \nthe 112th and 113th Congresses, each time with bipartisan support.\n  Once enacted, this legislation will help to create millions of high-\npaying jobs and make government decision-making more efficient and \neffective.\n  Importantly, it will also continue to ensure that the impacts of new \nprojects on the environment can be considered responsibly before \npermitting decisions are made.\n  I thank Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law Subcommittee \nChairman Marino of Pennsylvania for introducing this legislation.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to vote for the RAPID Act.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My colleagues, I rise in rather strong opposition to the measure \nbefore us, H.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating \nDevelopment Act of 2015, or its nickname, the RAPID Act.\n  H.R. 348 has a number of flaws. I won't try to go into each and every \none of them. Most critically, this measure would jeopardize public \nsafety and health by prioritizing project approval over meaningful \nanalysis that is currently required under the National Environmental \nPolicy Act.\n  By giving the proponents of construction projects greater control \nover the environmental approval process, this bill is the equivalent of \ngiving Wall Street the authority to write its own regulations for \nfinancial responsibility. The bill accomplishes this result in several \nrespects.\n  To begin with, under the guise of streamlining the approval process, \nH.R. 348 forecloses potentially critical input from Federal, State, and \nlocal agencies, as well as from members of the public, to comment on \nenvironmentally sensitive construction projects that are federally \nfunded or that require Federal approval.\n  The bill also imposes hard and fast deadlines that may be unrealistic \nunder certain circumstances. Moreover, if an agency fails to meet these \nunrealistic deadlines, the bill simply declares that a project must be \ndeemed approved regardless of whether the agency has thoroughly \nassessed the task. This is an embarrassment, my friends.\n  As a result, H.R. 348 could allow projects that put public health and \nsafety at risk to be approved before the safety review is completed.\n  This failing of the bill, along with some others, explains why the \nadministration and the President's Council on Environmental Quality, \nalong with more than 40 respected environmental groups, vigorously \noppose this legislation before us today.\n  These organizations include Public Citizen, the League of \nConservation Voters, the Natural Resources Defense Council, the Sierra \nClub, and The Wilderness Society. Likewise, the administration has \nappropriately issued a veto threat.\n  Stating that the bill will increase litigation, regulatory delays, \nand potentially force agencies to approve a project if the review and \nanalysis cannot be completed before the proposed arbitrary deadlines, \nthe administration warns that, if H.R. 348 ever became law, it would \nlead to more confusion and delay, limit public participation in the \npermitting process, and, ultimately, hamper economic growth.\n  Another concern, among many, that I have with this measure is that it \nis a flawed solution in search of an imaginary problem, and that is not \njust my opinion.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service, for instance, states \nthat highway construction project delays based on environmental \nrequirements stem not from the National Environmental Policy Act, but \nfrom laws other than the National Environmental Policy Act.\n  In fact, the Congressional Research Service found that the primary \nsource of approval delays for these projects are more often tied to \nlocal or State and project-specific factors, primarily local or State \nagency priorities, project funding levels, local opposition to a \nproject, project complexity, or late changes in project scope.\n  Undoubtedly, the so-called RAPID Act will make the process less clear \nand less protective of public health and safety.\n  My final major concern with this bill is that, rather than \nstreamlining the environmental review process, which we need to do, it \nwill sow utter confusion.\n  H.R. 348 does this by creating a separate, but only partly parallel, \nenvironmental review process for construction projects, which will \ncause confusion, delay, and litigation.\n  As I have noted, the changes to the National Environmental Policy \nAct's review process, as contemplated by the measure before us today, \napply only to certain construction projects.\n  The National Environmental Policy Act, on the other hand, applies to \na broad panoply of Federal actions, including fishing, hunting, and \ngrazing permits, land management plans, Base Realignment and Closure \nactivities, and treaties.\n  As a result of the bill, there could potentially be two different \nenvironmental review processes for the same project.\n  For instance, the bill's requirements would apply to the construction \nof a nuclear reactor, but not to its decommissioning or to the \ntransportation and storage of its spent fuel.\n  Rather than improving the environmental review process, the measure \nbefore us will complicate it and generate more litigation. More \nimportantly, this bill is yet another effort by my colleagues on the \nother side of the aisle to undermine regulatory protections.\n  As with all of the other regulatory bills, this measure is a thinly \ndisguised effort to hobble the ability of Federal agencies to do the \nwork the Congress requires that it does.\n  For those reasons, I urge my colleagues to strenuously oppose this \nseriously flawed bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Marino), the chief sponsor of this legislation and \nthe chairman of the Regulatory Reform, Commercial and Antitrust Law \nSubcommittee of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Mr. MARINO. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chairman, once again, my good friends on the other side think we \nneed more government, more EPA overreach, more regulation, to continue \nthe $19 trillion of debt that we have and to continue the flawed job \nopportunities of this administration's over the past 6 years.\n  Once again, today we consider the RAPID Act. As the gentleman from \nVirginia stated, during the 112th and\n\n[[Page H6209]]\n\n113th Congresses, the House passed this bill on three separate \noccasions in a bipartisan fashion.\n  Once again, we are considering a number of important regulatory \nreforms that present the potential for immediately impactful economic \ngrowth across our Nation.\n  Our Federal permitting process is undeniably broken. Duplicative \nenvironmental reviews have clogged decision-making for years.\n  Although recent studies have shown that, on average, an environmental \nimpact study will take 3 to 4 years, the permitting process for many \nprojects takes years more or, sadly, even decades.\n  Even more disappointing are indications that average environmental \nreview times are increasing by over a month per year.\n  Furthermore, final decision-making has been driven by political whims \nrather than by the merits of any particular project that would be borne \nthrough economic growth and job creation.\n  Political pressure should never impede projects of worth that would \nget Americans back to work. One recent study found that 7 years of \ndelay on the Keystone pipeline have kept us from realizing nearly $175 \nbillion in potential economic activity. At a time when true economic \nrecovery lags and more Americans become disheartened and leave the \nworkforce, such delays are unacceptable.\n  The RAPID Act reforms remove government obstructions from the \nequation by implementing hard deadlines for environmental review, and \nthey shorten the window for judicial review. It doesn't take review \naway. It shortens it to a reasonable period of time.\n  We cannot delay while our infrastructure--from highways and bridges \nto transmission lines and waterways--crumbles around us in America's \ncounties, towns, and cities.\n  I look forward to working with our colleagues in the Senate to bring \nthis bill to the President's desk, and I hope that we can get this \ncountry working again.\n  Federal agencies and departments and employees have to be held \naccountable just like we are in private industry. They cannot sit back \nand let these permits and these issues stack up on their desks while \nthey play games on their computers.\n  I have hope that we can get this bill through and the country working \nagain. Please support the RAPID Act.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 8 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson), the ranking subcommittee member.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong opposition to \nH.R. 348, the Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Development \nAct, or the RAPID Act. But if I had my druthers, I would change it to \nthe ``Responsibly and Professionally Invigorating Diversion Act,'' or \nRAPID Act.\n  I would say that it is a diversion because we have got important work \nto do in this Chamber, Mr. Chair. Everybody knows that we are \napproaching the end of the fiscal year. It will be here in 6 short \ndays.\n  During this whole month of September--we are at September 24 today--\nwe have had a total of 8 legislative days during this month, knowing \nthat we are coming up to the end of the fiscal year and we need to pass \na spending bill to keep the government open and operating. We have been \nknowing this.\n  We spent 6 weeks in August, from July to September, a total of about \n6 weeks at home lounging while the Nation's business in Washington, \nD.C., went undone. We have spent a total of 8 legislative days out of \nthe 24 days in September doing everything other than addressing the \nlooming issue, which is the coming, or impending, government shutdown.\n  Now, we are here today. We just took one vote. This is the first \nlegislative day of this week. We have got one business day left. The \nfirst legislative day, after hearing from the Pope, we have just had \nour last vote for the day. It was our one and only vote for the day, \nand it was to rename a post office.\n  We are coming up on the government shutdown, and what are we dealing \nwith? Instead of dealing with the Nation's finances, we are dealing \nwith this RAPID Act, which, as I said, is a diversion from the real \nduty that we need to be taking care of today.\n  H.R. 348, the RAPID Act, is a misguided attempt to sow widespread \nconfusion and delay in the review and permitting process under the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, or NEPA.\n  For over 40 years, the approval process for projects under NEPA has \nsaved time, money, and protected the environment, which the Pope spoke \nof our need to protect today. In fact, since NEPA was enacted, the U.S. \neconomy has not contracted. It has actually tripled in size from just \nover $5 trillion to more than $16 trillion.\n  Among other things, NEPA requires agencies to prepare a detailed \nenvironmental review for proposals relating to ``major Federal actions \nsignificantly affecting the quality of the human environment.'' NEPA's \npurpose is to provide a framework for wide-ranging input from all \naffected interests when a Federal agency conducts an environmental \nreview of a proposed project.\n  H.R. 348, the so-called RAPID Act, upends this review process in \nthree ways:\n  First, H.R. 348 carves out a separate environmental review process \nfor construction projects. Currently, NEPA applies to a broad range of \nFederal projects, including hunting permits, land management plans, \nmilitary base realignment and closure activities, and treaties. In \ncontrast, H.R. 348 only applies to a subset of these Federal projects, \ncreating more regulatory complexity in the permitting system, not less.\n  Second, section (c) of the RAPID Act allows any project sponsor to \nprepare an environmental document in lieu of such analysis by the lead \nagency. It is not difficult to imagine the shortcomings of allowing \ncorporations, which seek to maximize shareholder value, to sit in the \ndriver's seat on environmental policy. In fact, that is why we have \nsuch environmental degradation today.\n  During a legislative hearing on H.R. 348, Amit Narang, a regulatory \npolicy advocate for Public Citizen, compared section (c) to ``asking \nbig banks to determine the costs and benefits of new Wall Street reform \nrules, or big energy companies to determine the costs and benefits of \nnew climate change or air pollution measures.''\n  The inherent conflict of interest built into this section reveals the \nbill's clear design to allow project sponsors to manipulate the NEPA \npermit approval process to the greatest extent possible. It is clear \nthat not only does this Republican bill task the fox with guarding the \nhenhouse, it would also have him install the chicken wire as well.\n  Finally, under section (i) of H.R. 348, if an agency fails to meet \nthe unrealistic deadlines mandated by H.R. 348, the bill would \nautomatically green-light a Federal construction project, regardless of \nwhether or not the agency has thoroughly reviewed the project's risks.\n  Even if I were to set aside these concerns, it is difficult for me to \nlook past the complete lack of empirical data supporting the premise of \nthe RAPID Act, which is that agency compliance with NEPA is the cause \nof delays in approving permits.\n  The nonpartisan Congressional Research Service reported in 2012 that \nproject approval delays based on environmental requirements are not \ncaused by NEPA, but ``are more often tied to local/State and project-\nspecific factors, primarily local/State agency priorities, project \nfunding levels, local opposition to a project, project complexity, or \nlate changes in project scope.''\n  Similarly, Dinah Bear, who served as the general counsel for the \nWhite House Council on Environmental Quality which oversees NEPA's \nimplementation, for over 20 years under both Republican and Democratic \nadministrations, testified in the 112th Congress that most delays in \nthe environmental review process are not the result of NEPA, but due to \nother factors entirely unrelated to NEPA.\n  In other words, the RAPID Act does nothing to address the lack of \nadequate funds allocated to Federal construction projects or State-\nbased barriers to the timely completion of construction projects, which \nare two of the most common delays and have nothing to do with \nregulatory permits under NEPA.\n  So, therefore, I urge my colleagues to oppose this misguided \nlegislation.\n\n[[Page H6210]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I thank Chairman Goodlatte, Mr. Marino, \nand Mr. Smith for working on this important bill and bringing it to the \nHouse floor.\n  Speeding up the regulatory process in the United States is an \nimportant issue in keeping America competitive. The methodical, slow, \nsnail-paced decision or lack of decision process of the EPA to make a \ndecision on whether or not to approve a project is absurd.\n  The RAPID Act addresses the problem of extensive requirements and \ngrowing delays in Federal permitting and approvals for construction \nprojects stemming from multiple agencies, excessive requirements, and \nunnecessary lawsuits.\n  According to an April 2014 report issued by the GAO, the average \npreparation time for the required environmental impact statement \nfinalized in 2012 was over 4\\1/2\\ years. Now, the environmental impact \nstatement is just the first requirement in getting a permit.\n  Four-and-a-half years--World War II took less time than it takes the \nEPA to make a decision on whether or not to approve a project. They \njust continue to study and study and study. Mr. Chair, it is about time \nfor the EPA to pick a horse and ride it, make a decision about these \nprojects.\n  I am not going to talk in theory. I am going to talk about an actual \nproject down in my congressional district.\n  The Sabine-Neches Waterway, most Americans have never heard of it. \nThe Sabine-Neches waterway is what some of us call ``the other Texas \ninternational border.'' It is the waterway between Louisiana and Texas. \nWe have been wanting, since 1997, to deepen that 40-foot waterway to 48 \nfeet. That is just 8 feet. We just want to make it a little deeper so \nships can come in and off-load their cargo and off-load their fuel.\n  What they are doing now, they can't come in with a full load of fuel \non those tankers. They have to off-load it, sometimes 20 percent, in \nthe Gulf of Mexico and then bring in the rest. That costs money. We \njust want 8 feet.\n  So in 1997, my predecessors asked the EPA for an environmental impact \nstatement and finally got that impact statement. It took 20 years to \nget an impact statement. I have had 11 grandkids since I have been in \nCongress, and that impact statement has been pending all that time.\n  We just want 8 feet. Is it okay? The EPA finally made a decision, but \nyet we still haven't started moving dirt.\n  The original project was about $600 million. Now, it is about $1.3 \nbillion, and we still don't have that extra 8 feet. Why? Because the \nbureaucrats can't make a decision. Delay, delay, delay.\n  That is the name of the EPA: Delay, Delay, Delay. All this bill does, \nit says to this bureaucracy, study the information, reach a conclusion, \nand approve the project if it ought to be approved so America can be \ncompetitive worldwide. But, no, the other side says: Well, we need more \nstudies; we need more information.\n  Mr. Chair, if Teddy Roosevelt would have had to deal with the EPA in \nbuilding the Panama Canal, it would have never been built because of \nall the regulatory requirements--some unnecessary, in my opinion.\n  So let's approve the RAPID Act. Let's get America working again. The \nSabine-Neches Waterway has numerous refineries on it. It is the energy \nhub of the United States. We just want 8 feet, Mr. Chair. That is all \nwe want. Pick a horse and ride it. The EPA needs to get their act \ntogether.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Chair, I rise to oppose H.R. 348, \nalso known as the RAPID Act. This bill will rapidly cause environmental \ndegradation.\n  Under this bill, if it became law, you could have projects that harm \nthe environment that are deemed approved, even if the review process \nwas not yet completed. That is crazy. Keep in mind, we have had over 60 \nstraight months of job creation under the Obama administration. Those \nare the facts.\n  This bill is written in such a way that it will cause confusion. It \nwill cause increased delays and limit public involvement in this \nimportant process. It is also unscientific.\n  There is a provision in this bill that says we cannot count the \nsocial cost of carbon. Now, I believe in a free market, and I believe \nthat that has made America strong, but we can't have government \nartificially come in and say we are going to say things are costs and \nthings are not costs when it is not scientifically based.\n  We know that carbon has done a lot to increase climate change and \ncaused global warming. That is why I, along with Representatives \nPeters, Polis, and Lowenthal, have introduced an amendment to put that \nlanguage back in. We can't just say stop talking and ignore carbon.\n  Keep in mind, just a few hours ago, Pope Francis came in to a joint \nsession of Congress and told us to really revert and look at what we \nhave done in terms of causing environmental degradation.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Now, just a few hours later, we are back to attacking the \nenvironment. This is not right.\n  I urge that we not support the RAPID Act.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to myself to say to the \ngentleman from California that we may have 60 straight months of \nincreased job creation, but the average American worker is making 5 \npercent less than they were before those 60 months began. The reason is \nthat we are overregulating our economy.\n  If we are really going to create jobs, we have got to have the \ninfrastructure to do it. We have got to have the projects like were \njust described by Congressman Poe of Texas.\n  Just 8 more feet of depth would bring a lot more jobs to east Texas \nand to Louisiana by being able to bring that product further up inland.\n  These kind of projects require careful environmental assessment, but \nit doesn't require assessment that takes 20 years to take place. It \nshould take place in a much more limited period of time.\n  This bill helps to encourage focusing the mind on what needs to get \ndone. That includes taking careful consideration of the environment, \nbut it doesn't include delay, delay, delay.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Nevada (Mr. \nHardy), a member of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \nand the Committee on Natural Resources, both of which understand the \nimportance of these projects.\n  Mr. HARDY. Mr. Chairman, before I had the privilege of being elected \nto the 114th Congress, I spent more than four decades in the \nconstruction industry.\n  After growing up as a fifth-generation son of a farmer and rancher, I \nset out to learn the trades and acquire the skills that would one day \nallow me to support myself and my family.\n  Over the course of those four decades in construction, I learned what \nit takes to start and run a successful business and how to create \nquality, good-paying jobs.\n  I also learned the satisfaction of seeing the fruits of our labor in \nthe roads, bridges, and dams we built and how they define the \ncommunities we serve.\n  Mr. Chairman, small construction businesses like the one I used to \nown are struggling all across America from Federal bureaucracy that is \nrife with delays, duplication, and uncertainty.\n  I can speak from firsthand experience about construction projects \nthat have ground to a halt as resources are redirected to navigate the \nonerous NEPA process.\n  On projects like the ones I used to manage, NEPA delays meant idled \nequipment, mass layoffs, and millions of dollars going towards \ncompliance. These are sunk costs on the macro level and will continue \nto hold our economy back.\n  We need to get smart about environment protection and to ensure that \nwe do it in ways that allow businesses to thrive. H.R. 348, the RAPID \nAct, will go a long way toward achieving that goal.\n  Mr. Chairman, at a time when our Nation's infrastructure is crumbling\n\n[[Page H6211]]\n\nand far too many are in search of quality employment, we have the \nresponsibility to give manufacturers, construction workers, and other \nengines of economic growth the certainty they desperately need to \ncreate high-paying jobs.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on the RAPID Act.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson), a distinguished member of our \ncommittee.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, my friend, Chairman Goodlatte, \nbemoaned the fact that, over the last 64 straight months of job growth \nunder the Obama administration, wages have remained stagnant.\n  That is true except for the wages of the top 10 percent, and \nspecifically the top 1 percent, which have gone through the roof \ndespite what he calls overregulation.\n  We continue to have the problem of income disparity that Pope Francis \nmentioned today. It is unrelated to this issue of regulations which are \nthere to protect people. They, in fact, protect people and they protect \nour environment.\n  We have had a speaker today come in and talk about a dredging project \nthat was delayed because of NEPA, but, actually, the truth of the \nmatter is that that project was delayed due to lack of funding. Funding \nfor the project was only authorized last year.\n  While the Republicans in Congress sit around and talk about how much \nthe regulatory agencies study and study and study, what we do in \nCongress is simply ignore the funding needs for infrastructure in this \ncountry, which is what that dredging project was all about.\n  I have got a project down in Georgia, the Savannah Harbor Expansion \nProject, which was estimated to cost $652 million to complete.\n  But prior to the passage of the Water Resources Reform and \nDevelopment Act last year, the Federal Government had only provided \n$1.28 million--$1.28 million--less than 1 percent.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. LaMalfa). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield an additional 1 minute to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, let's take it back to the year \n2011 with the Ryan Budget Control Act, which imposed sequestration on \nthe Federal Government, cutting both defense and nondefense spending 10 \npercent across the board.\n  We can't have it both ways. If we are not going to fund, we have to \nadmit that that is the reason these projects are not getting done. \nDon't blame it on NEPA.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to close. I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Members of the committee, do not be misled by the title of this bill. \nRather than effectuating real reforms to the process by which Federal \nagencies undertake environmental impact reviews, as required by the \nNational Environmental Policy Act, this measure before us will actually \nresult in making the process less responsible, less professional, and \nless accountable.\n  These kinds of attempts are not new to this session of Congress. \nAccordingly, I urge that my colleagues carefully consider the \ndiscussion on this measure and oppose H.R. 348.\n\n\n           ORGANIZATIONS THAT OPPOSE H.R. 348, the RAPID ACT\n\n       Alaska Wilderness League, American Rivers, Center for \n     Biological Diversity, Citizens for Global Solutions, Clean \n     Air Task Force, Clean Air Council, Clean Water Action, \n     Conservation Colorado, Conservatives for Responsible \n     Stewardship, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, EDF Action, \n     Environmental Law and Policy Center, Epic--Environmental \n     Protection Information Center, Energy Action Coalition, \n     Friends of the Earth, Gulf Coast Center for Law & Policy, \n     Green Latinos, Kentucky Heartwood.\n       Klamath Forest Alliance, Klamath Siskiyou Wildlands Center, \n     KyotoUSA, League of Conservation Voters, Los Padres \n     ForestWatch, Marine Conservation Institute, Montana \n     Environmental Information Center, National Parks Conservation \n     Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, New Energy \n     Economy, New Jersey Sierra Club, Oceana, Ocean Conservation \n     Research, Public Citizen, Rachel Carson Council, Safe Climate \n     Campaign, Sierra Club, Southern Environmental Law Center, \n     Southern Oregon Climate Action Now, SustainUS.\n       Union of Concerned Scientists, Western Environmental Law \n     Center, The Wilderness Society.\n                                  ____\n\n                                               September 17, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of our millions of members \n     and activists, we are writing to urge you to oppose H.R. 348 \n     the misleadingly named ``Responsibly and Professionally \n     Invigorating Development Act of 2015.'' Instead of improving \n     the permitting process, the bill will severely undermine the \n     National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) and, consequently, \n     the quality and integrity of federal agency decisions.\n       The National Environmental Policy Act plays a critical role \n     in ensuring that projects are carried out in a transparent, \n     collaborative, and responsible manner. NEPA simply requires \n     federal agencies to assess the environmental, economic, and \n     public health impacts of proposals, solicit the input of all \n     affected stakeholders, and disclose their findings publicly \n     before undertaking projects that may significantly affect the \n     environment. Critically, NEPA recognizes that the public--\n     which includes industry, citizens, local and state \n     governments, and business owners--can make important \n     contributions by providing unique expertise. NEPA also gives \n     a voice to the most impacted and underrepresented, especially \n     to the most vulnerable communities who usually have to bear \n     the most burden of where federal projects are proposed in the \n     first place. However, H.R. 348 strikes at these core purposes \n     of NEPA by systematically prioritizing speed of decisions and \n     project approval over the public interest.\n       Studies on the causes of delay in the permitting process \n     reveal that the primary cause of delay is not the NEPA \n     process. Rather, as multiple studies by the Government \n     Accountability Office and the Congressional Research Service \n     have pointed out, the principal causes of delay in permitting \n     rest outside the NEPA process entirely and are attributable \n     to other factors such as lack of funding, project complexity, \n     and local opposition to the project. The RAPID Act ignores \n     the true causes of delay, and instead, focuses on \n     institutionalizing dangerous ``reforms'' that restrict public \n     input, limit review of the environmental and economic impacts \n     of projects, and that create more, not less, bureaucracy. \n     Provisions in the RAPID Act, such as the following, will \n     create more delays in permitting, result in less flexibility \n     in the process, and tilt the entire permitting process \n     towards shareholder interest, not the public interest. For \n     example, the bill:\n       Places Arbitrary Limitations on Environmental Reviews--\n     Section 560(i) of the bill threatens to undermine NEPA's goal \n     of informed decision-making and the agency's role of acting \n     in the public interest. It sets arbitrary deadlines on \n     environmental reviews of permits, licenses, or other \n     applications--regardless of the possible economic, health, or \n     environmental impacts. Consequently, it puts communities at \n     risk by promoting rushed and faulty decisions.\n       Limits Consideration of Alternatives--Section 560(g) \n     strikes at what CEQ regulations describe as ``the heart of \n     the NEPA process'' by restricting the range of reasonable \n     alternatives to be considered by an agency.\n       Creates Serious Conflicts of Interests--Section 560(c) \n     blurs the distinct roles of private entities and agencies in \n     agency decisions by allowing private project sponsors with \n     stakes in the decision to prepare environmental review \n     documents which creates inherent conflicts of interest and \n     thus jeopardizes the integrity of the decision-making \n     process.\n       Leading to Unanticipated Delays--The bill forces \n     stakeholders into court preemptively simply to preserve their \n     right to judicial review. The bill also limits the public's \n     judicial access to challenge and address faulty environmental \n     reviews which in turn is likely to increase the controversy \n     and the amount of litigation derived from the permitting \n     process which in turn could add to project delays.\n       Denies the Impacts of Climate Change--Section 560(k) of the \n     bill prohibits any considerations of the Social Cost of \n     Carbon (SCC), which the EPA and other federal agencies use to \n     estimate the economic damages associated with specific \n     projects and their related carbon dioxide emissions. The tool \n     is critical for the public to understand the true benefits \n     and costs of a project. Ignoring climate change puts critical \n     infrastructure, tax payer dollars, and local communities at \n     risk.\n       Provisions such as these and many more in the RAPID Act \n     will only serve to increase delay and confusion around the \n     environmental review process. We believe compromising the \n     quality of environmental review and limiting the role of the \n     public is the wrong approach.\n       Far from being broken, the National Environmental Policy \n     Act has proven its worth as an invaluable tool. It ensures \n     that the public, developers, and agencies have a reliable \n     template for consistent and fair proposal assessment for \n     major projects that may impact federal resources. The RAPID \n     Act contradicts and jeopardizes decades of experience gained \n     from enacting this critical environmental law. Further, it \n     tips the balance away from informed decisions and public \n     oversight, jeopardizing the public's ability to participate \n     in how public resources will be managed. Please oppose this \n     unnecessary and overreaching piece of legislation and vote \n     ``no'' on the RAPID Act.\n\n[[Page H6212]]\n\n       Although no amendment would remedy the problems with the \n     underlying bill, we make the following vote recommendations \n     on amendments offered to the RAPID Act.\n       Vote no on Goodlatte (R-VA) #1--This amendment would prompt \n     ill-informed decisions by limiting the role of cooperating \n     agencies in the environmental review process. It would also \n     severely limit the public's ability to use the courts their \n     rights by requiring eventual plaintiffs to participate in \n     drastically shortened comment periods and administrative \n     proceedings that, in many cases, agencies do not provide.\n       Vote yes on Peters (D-CA) #2--This amendment ensures that \n     the true impacts of climate change are considered by allowing \n     agencies to consider the social costs of carbon when \n     conducting environmental reviews. Agencies should be free to \n     incorporate the social cost of carbon into the agency \n     decision making process, which will result in better informed \n     and responsible decisions that safely invest taxpayer dollars \n     by taking into account climate change, the fundamental \n     environmental issue of our time.\n       Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #3--This amendment will undo \n     one of the more pernicious provisions in the H.R. 348 which, \n     in cases where an agency fails to meet arbitrary deadlines \n     prescribed by the bill, projects are simply deemed approved \n     regardless of their economic, health, or environmental \n     impacts. The bill, without this amendment, puts communities \n     at risk by green-lighting projects without fully considering \n     environmental impacts or the opinions of those who will be \n     impacted the most.\n       Vote yes on Jackson Lee (D-TX) #4--This amendment maintains \n     national security by undoing hasty shortcuts in the \n     permitting process and rightly ensuring a full review for \n     projects that could be potential targets for terrorist \n     attacks. This amendment wisely ensures that shortcutting \n     critical federal review of projects does not apply those \n     projects that most need informed decisions because of the \n     tremendous impacts they may have on our national security.\n       Vote yes on Johnson (D-GA) #5--This amendment rightly \n     ensures that nothing in the bill will limit input of affected \n     stakeholders, local governments, private property owners, or \n     business owners.\n       Vote yes on Dingell (D-MI) #6--This amendment would prevent \n     project approvals under the arbitrary timelines set forth in \n     the bill if the project under consideration would limit \n     access to or opportunities for hunting or fishing or would \n     impact threatened or endangered species. According to the \n     U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service, wildlife related \n     recreation contributes more than $140 billion dollars to \n     the U.S. economy and supports thousands of jobs connected \n     to fishing, hunting, and the observance of wildlife.\n       Vote yes on Gallego (D-AZ) #8--This amendment preserves \n     meaningful input by local governments and tribal officials on \n     projects affecting their communities by allowing them to \n     request extensions of the arbitrary deadlines in the bill.\n       Vote yes on Grijalva (D-AZ) #9--The shortcutting of \n     meaningful public input and review of a project's impacts \n     under the RAPID Act could potentially lead to \n     disproportionate impacts on low-income communities and \n     communities of color. This amendment ensures such impacts are \n     carefully addressed during the review of project \n     alternatives.\n       Vote yes on Lowenthal (D-CA) #10--The truncated review \n     procedures under the RAPID Act would potentially apply to \n     construction projects of enormous size, scope, and \n     complexity. Climate change poses severe threats to the \n     health, safety, and economies of local communities through \n     the increased risks of floods, fire and severe weather. This \n     amendment ensures federal agencies consider these impacts and \n     construct projects that are resilient to the impacts of \n     climate change.\n       Vote no on Gosar (R-AZ) #11--This amendment would broaden \n     one of the most damaging provisions of the bill which \n     prevents Federal agencies from considering the true costs of \n     climate change, putting communities and tax-payer dollars at \n     risk.\n       Whatever the outcome of these amendments, we urge a no vote \n     on final passage.\n           Sincerely,\n         Leah Donahey, Senior Campaign Director, Alaska Wilderness \n           League; Jim Bradley, Vice President, Policy and \n           Government Relations, American Rivers; Bill Snape, \n           Senior Counsel, Center for Biological Diversity; Tony \n           Fleming, Campaigns Director, Citizens for Global \n           Solutions; Joseph Otis Minott, Executive Director & \n           Chief Counsel, Clean Air Council; Conrad Schneider, \n           Advocacy Director, Clean Air Task Force; Lynn Thorp, \n           National Campaigns Director, Clean Water Action; Luke \n           Schafer, West Slope Advocacy Director, Conservation \n           Colorado; David Jenkins, President, Conservatives for \n           Responsible Stewardship; Raul Garcia, Associate \n           Legislative Counsel, Earthjustice; Elizabeth B. \n           Thompson, President, EDF Action; Lydia Avila, Executive \n           Director, Energy Action Coalition; Karen E.

Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, first, to the gentleman from Georgia, let me just say \nthat the Water Resources Development Act, which passed this House, has \nin it the same streamlining provisions of the permitting processes for \nthe projects that it would fund that are based on the ideas in this \nbill.\n  Why? Because we know that, just because we come up with the funds for \nsomething, those funds can be churned and churned and churned year \nafter year after year in the permitting process and never ever get to a \npermit so the underlying construction can take place in Texas or \nSavannah, Georgia, or Virginia, or all of the other places where \ninfrastructure projects are needed.\n  Part of the enormous cost of it is the enormous process that we go \nthrough and the length of that process and the review and review and \nreview that never gets to a decision.\n  During the debate over this bill this term and last, we have heard \nseveral false alarms from my friends on the other side of the aisle. \nFor example, we have heard that the bill does not allow enough time for \nenvironmental reviews to be completed.\n  But, with all due respect, the bill, when necessary, allows as much \ntime for the completion of an environmental impact statement as it took \nour Nation to win World War II. Surely that is time enough.\n  We have heard that the bill will generate more litigation because \nthere may be litigation over what its new terms mean, but that argument \ncan be made against any reform legislation. If it were a valid and \nsufficient reason to defeat legislation, we would never pass another \nreform bill.\n  Furthermore, the bill for the first time requires litigants to \npresent their claims to permit agencies before they sue in court and to \nfile lawsuits no later than 180 days after the agency's final \ndecisions. That will reduce litigation, not increase it.\n  We have also heard that the White House has threatened to veto the \nbill. Mr. Chairman, that is what is truly alarming. This legislation \nfulfills the calls of the President's Council on Jobs and \nCompetitiveness to streamline the review of Federal permit \napplications. We are doing that in this legislation.\n  It creates shovel-ready projects, which even President Obama claims \nwould create jobs. In fact, it would generate millions of high-paying, \ngood jobs for our Nation's workers and families, who so desperately \nneed them. It would raise the standard of living of Americans.\n  The White House should not be issuing threats to veto the \nlegislation. The White House should be running to lend its support to \nthis bill.\n\n[[Page H6213]]\n\n  Ignore the false alarms and embrace the commonsense reforms in this \nbill. Pass the RAPID Act, call the President's bluff, give the Nation \nshovel-ready projects.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHardy), having assumed the chair, Mr. LaMalfa, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 348) to \nprovide for improved coordination of agency actions in the preparation \nand adoption of environmental documents for permitting determinations, \nand for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6213-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SEPTEMBER IS NATIONAL RICE MONTH\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, this month marks the 25th year of September \nbeing National Rice Month. Today I want to pay special tribute to the \nhard-working American farmers, millers, merchants, suppliers, and the \nconsumers who make rice not only such a wholesome food, but an \nimportant part of our economy.\n  Rice farming in America actually predates our Nation's founding, \nbeginning some 300 years ago in the Deep South. Today, America's rice \nindustry creates 125,000 good-paying jobs and contributes an estimated \n$34 billion to our Nation's economy.\n  America's rice farmers have also a longstanding commitment to protect \nand preserve natural resources. Today, U.S. rice farmers produce more \nrice, using less land, energy, and water, using cutting-edge technology \nin land-leveling, in yield, and in technology for using less chemicals.\n  The process is much more efficient than it was 20 years ago, while \nproviding critical waterfowl habitat for hundreds of species. I know \npersonally because I have leveled many of these fields myself.\n  America's rice farmers continue to serve as leaders in the farming \ncommunity by producing a healthy, conservation-friendly rice crop that \ngenerates jobs and economic opportunity.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in recognizing September as National \nRice Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6213-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6213]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1600\n           CONGRESSIONAL PROGRESSIVE CAUCUS: FEDERAL SHUTDOWN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, it is truly an honor to serve here \nin the United States Congress, but we sully that honor when we waste \nthe American people's time with misplaced priorities and manufactured \ncrises.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has one fundamental responsibility: funding the \nFederal Government. But unfortunately, Republicans in Congress insist \non undermining these responsibilities at virtually every turn.\n  Mr. Speaker, Republicans already insist on maintaining reckless \nsequester funding that chokes services for working and middle class \nAmericans, seniors, veterans, and children. Instead of passing \nRepublican budgets that meet the ever-changing needs of our Nation, \nRepublicans choose to kick the can down the road through continuing \nresolutions that waste precious time and shortchange the American \npeople.\n  But if sequestration and continuing resolutions weren't already bad \nenough, now we are facing a complete Federal shutdown because \nRepublicans insist on holding Federal funds for women's health care \nhostage. Congress has just 4 legislative days remaining to pass a \nfunding bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, the American people are fed up with this brinksmanship. \nIt is time for us to run the country like adults.\n  Let's remember why this is happening: Republicans have pledged to \nshut down the entire Federal Government because of objections to \nabortion services by Planned Parenthood. Never mind that not a single \ncent of Federal money funds abortions by Planned Parenthood. Never mind \nthat Planned Parenthood provides health care and education to more than \n2.6 million Americans--both men and women--each year. Never mind that \n97 percent of Planned Parenthood's health services are unrelated to \nabortions. Republicans would rather ignore these truths and instead \nrely on a series of distorted videos secretly filmed by discredited and \nshady antiabortion activists.\n  So instead of using this time to talk about creating jobs, building \ninfrastructure, reducing college debt, and reauthorizing the Voting \nRights Act, I am forced to stand here on the House floor to remind the \nAmerican people about the dangers we face with yet another Republican \nshutdown.\n  Here are a few ways that this shutdown would harm the American \npeople:\n  A shutdown would close more than 400 national parks and monuments. It \nwould increase backlogs for veterans' pensions, compensation, and \ndisability claims. It would delay tax refunds and Federal home loan \napplications; prohibit the National Institutes of Health from accepting \nnew patients; shut down E-Verify screening for businesses to limit \nhiring undocumented workers; shutter Head Start programs for low-income \nfamilies and children; and close Federal courts.\n  The impact of a 2015 shutdown is hard to quantify, but we don't have \nto look too far back to estimate the potential impact. In 2013, \nRepublicans shut the government down for 16 days in a failed attempt to \ndefund the Affordable Care Act. That shutdown furloughed 850,000 \nFederal workers for a total of 6.6 million days. The 2013 shutdown cost \n$2 billion in lost productivity. Standard & Poor's estimated that the \nshutdown cost the U.S. economy $24 billion and stalled the creation of \nmore than 100,000 private sector jobs, and $4.4 billion in tax returns \nwere delayed. Small businesses and private lenders had to delay loans \ndue to lack of access to Federal Social Security number and income \nverification tools.\n  Knowing what we know, Mr. Speaker, it is inconceivable that we could \nwalk into this type of catastrophe by choice. That must be why the \nSpeaker of the House, in 2013, called that shutdown a ``very \npredictable disaster.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I would much rather be predicting solutions than \ndisasters. That is why I look forward to working with my colleagues in \nthe Congressional Progressive Caucus to stave off this irresponsible \nand dangerous shutdown. Again, this is the one thing our constituents \nsent us to Washington for: to fund the government. This is our job.\n  I implore my anti-women's health colleagues to set aside their \npartisan bickering and work with us to keep this government open.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6213-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6213-H6214]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    HISTORIC BROOKVILLE TOWN SQUARE\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on the topic of preventing veteran \nsuicide.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as \nSuicide Prevention Month. I want to thank my colleague, Kyrsten Sinema, \nfor joining me and putting together this Special Order hour. For the \nnext hour, we will discuss an issue that is very important to me and \nshould be unacceptable in a nation of our resources: veteran suicide.\n  A veteran in this country commits suicide every 65 minutes. That is \n22 lives extinguished every day.\n  As the father of a veteran, a doctor who worked at a VA hospital in \nnorthern Michigan, and the chairman of the Health Subcommittee on \nVeterans' Affairs, I know that the challenges of military life do not \nend once our servicemembers retire from Active Duty. The mental wounds \nof war may be invisible, but they are no less real to the young men and \nwomen suffering from them.\n  Facing high unemployment rates, the stigma of post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, and a loss of military fellowship, returning veterans often \nface a crisis of confidence at the very moment they should feel nothing \nbut relief and rest.\n  Congress did make a real impact early this year when we passed the \nClay Hunt SAV Act, which is helping the VA put the very best mental \nhealthcare professionals to work for our veterans and creating peer \nsupport groups to help catch those transitioning servicemembers who may \notherwise fall through the cracks. However, so much more needs to be \ndone.\n  I am grateful to my colleagues for standing with me today for our \nmost vulnerable veterans and their families. I look forward to hearing \nwhat they have to say and to working with them to end veteran suicide.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Abraham).\n  Mr. ABRAHAM. Thank you, Dr. Benishek, for having this.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today with my colleagues to raise awareness of \nveteran suicide prevention. Let me underscore the word ``prevention''--\nprevention because veteran suicide is a public health tragedy. As a \ndoctor, I know it is a preventable tragedy. For far too long, PTSD has \nbeen stigmatized, and it is time to remove that stigma.\n  Twenty-two percent of Americans who commit suicide are veterans. That \nstatistic is unacceptable to me, and it should be unacceptable to the \nAmerican people. Our Nation's heroes should come home to readily \navailable mental health care. They should not have to wait days, weeks, \nor even months to receive treatment. Veterans should not have to wait \nat all.\n  The Clay Hunt SAV Act, which was signed into law earlier this year, \nwas an excellent first step in giving veterans options, but there is \nmore work to be done.\n  As a member of the Veterans' Affairs Committee and a veteran myself, \nI will continue to fight for a more streamlined system to treat our \nveterans suffering from PTSD and continue to work to reform the VA \nsystem to be a system that puts the veteran first, not the bureaucrat.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Benishek, for joining me today as \na cohost of tonight's Special Order.\n  September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time for our Nation to raise \nawareness about the persistent scourge of suicide. Tens of thousands of \nAmericans each year purposefully die by their own actions. They are our \nneighbors and our friends, our sons and our daughters; and too often, \nthey are the men and women who have served our country honorably in the \nUnited States military.\n  An estimated 22 veterans lose their lives to suicide every single day \nin our country. That is one life lost every 65 minutes.\n  Typically, time in the House Chamber is split. Republicans have 1 \nhour and Democrats have another hour, but Congressman Benishek and I \nbelieve that this issue is too important to be overshadowed by partisan \npolitics. That is why we have joined together today, with our \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle, to show our commitment to \nsolving this problem together and to finding real solutions for our \ncountry's veterans.\n  This is the third year we have assembled in this Chamber to raise \nawareness and to send a clear message that the epidemic of veteran \nsuicide must end. We have so much work left to do. So today, we \ndemonstrate our ongoing support for the individuals, organizations, and \nagencies devoted to preventing the epidemic of veteran suicide. Today, \nwe challenge the VA, the Department of Defense, and our fellow \nlawmakers to do more. We are failing in our obligation to do right by \nthose who have served so honorably.\n  Finally, we send a message to military families who have experienced \nthis tragedy in their own families: Your family's loss is not \nforgotten. We work for the memory of your loved ones. We will not rest \nuntil every veteran in this country has access to the care that he or \nshe needs.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  I have often shared the story of a young veteran in my district, \nSergeant Daniel Somers. Sergeant Somers was an Army veteran of two \ntours in Iraq.\n  Diagnosed with a traumatic brain injury and suffering from post-\ntraumatic stress disorder, Sergeant Somers took his own life after \nstruggling with the VA bureaucracy and not getting the help he needed \nin time.\n  Together with the Somers family, we worked to develop the Classified \nVeterans Access to Care Act to ensure that all veterans, including \nthose who served with classified experiences, can get immediate access \nto the mental health care that they need in the appropriate care \nsetting.\n  I recently testified before the House Veterans Affairs Committee on \nthe need for this important legislation, and I am grateful for the \ncommittee's support for this legislation. I am grateful for my \ncosponsor, Congressman Dan Benishek.\n  I will continue working with the committee to ensure that no veteran \nfeels trapped, like Sergeant Somers did, and that all of our veterans \nhave access to appropriate mental health care.\n  My State, Arizona, is ground zero for the VA's failure to take care \nof our veterans. It has been over a year since we learned about the \nveterans at the Phoenix VA Hospital who were kept on secret waiting \nlists, forced to wait months, even years, before seeing a doctor, \nunable to access the care they needed.\n  These revelations were shocking and sickening. Arizona veterans died \nwhile waiting for care. That is absolutely unacceptable and, frankly, \nit is un-American.\n  So in Arizona, we took immediate action when we learned from brave \nwhistleblowers about this tragedy. Not waiting for the Phoenix VA to \nfix their problems, we came together as a community to make sure that \nArizona veterans get the access to the care they needed.\n  Mr. Speaker, since last summer, we have held six veterans clinic, \nhelping nearly 1,000 veterans and military families get access to the \nbenefits they have earned. Our team helps veterans in getting access to \nbenefits, to housing, to job placement, to education.\n  We established a Veterans Mental Health Working Group for community\n\n[[Page H6215]]\n\nproviders, veterans service organizations, and the local VA, to bring \nthem all together to work to improve access to services. Our group \nmeets bimonthly and has made important progress.\n  These are some examples of the good that can come when people set \naside partisanship and put veterans first. That is what is needed from \nall of us in this Chamber and the agencies we work with: to put aside \npartisanship and solve the problem we face to end the scourge of \nveteran suicide in this country.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I thank the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema). I \nreally appreciate your comments and your concern for this significant \nproblem.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to outline something that \nI have become aware of in my time here in office.\n  While this problem is very monumental, there are many small things \nthat the VA can do right now to make a difference. One of these changes \ncan be made by the VA immediately.\n  I would like to read a letter I received recently from an American \nLegion representative in my district that illustrates the problem \nbetter than I could.\n\n       Dear Dr. Benishek:\n       Here is the situation. Recently I encountered a suicidal \n     veteran from the Sault area who had severe PTSD, 100 percent \n     VA disabled. He called me on a Wednesday hysterical and said \n     that he was contemplating suicide. He was traveling around \n     with his wife in the car at the time. I thought this was a \n     very dangerous situation.\n       After several back-and-forth conversations with him, I \n     found out he was not taking any medicines and had not seen \n     his VA psychiatrist in a long time because, as he put it, the \n     psychiatrist was not helping him and it seemed that he didn't \n     really care.\n       He insisted that he stay at Wilwin, the American Legion \n     veterans facility, but I told him we needed his \n     psychiatrist's okay.\n       As a veteran myself, I thought I should try to help him the \n     best that I could. So I called the VA Suicide Hotline to get \n     answers on how I should handle the situation.\n       Here's the problem. I called the Iron Mountain VA. The call \n     started out saying, if you are having a medical or mental \n     health emergency, please hang up and dial 911.\n       If you are having thoughts of hurting yourself and want to \n     talk to a mental health professional, please hang up and dial \n     1-800-273-8255.\n       If you are thinking of committing suicide, you are already \n     frustrated to the point that you would be glad to talk to \n     anyone, even if it is someone at the VA.\n       Can you imagine a veteran in this position even having a \n     paper and pencil in hand to write the number down?\n       If he is unable to get the correct number the first time, \n     he must redial the VA, go through the whole spiel again and, \n     hopefully, write the number on a paper the second or third \n     time before he can try dialing. Once dialed, the voice comes \n     on the phone and says, if you are a veteran push 1 and so on.\n       When I called the hotline after I pushed 1, listened to \n     music for several minutes before a voice came on the phone, \n     she told me that she was not a veteran, nor did she know much \n     about PTSD veterans. What I needed was advice on how to \n     handle the veteran I was working with, which she did give me.\n       How many veterans have committed suicide because of the \n     VA's red tape?\n       Here's a solution. When the VA is called and the veteran is \n     contemplating suicide or hurting himself, you should be able \n     to push 1 to get a direct line to the suicide hotline. It \n     should automatically register that the call is coming through \n     the VA system and, yes, it is a veteran calling.\n\n  This constituent was able to get the veteran he referred to the help \nthat he needed, but he raised an incredibly good point that I brought \nup repeatedly with the VA.\n  The VA told me it would take 6 months to change from an 800 number to \nsimply dial 1. This is unacceptable. I call on the VA again today to \nmake this change immediately.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford).\n  Mr. ASHFORD. I thank the gentleman for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss a subject many of our veterans \nand their families understandably find great difficulty in discussing.\n  Veteran suicide, as we have already heard, is a major problem in our \ncountry. We have all heard the numbers. An estimated 22 veterans commit \nsuicide every day. That is one life every hour.\n  Please keep in mind those horrific numbers have names, the names of \nmen and women who put themselves in harm's way in order to keep each \nand every one of us safe.\n  Earlier this year we passed the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention of \nAmerican Veterans Act. It addresses the need for more mental healthcare \nexperts inside the VA along with expanding the time available to \nveterans to seek mental health care through the VA.\n  The new law also calls for an evaluation of all VA mental health care \nand suicide prevention practices to determine what is working and make \nrecommendations on what is not. This is a major step in the right \ndirection, but we must continue to do more.\n  I am proud to say, Mr. Speaker, that, in Omaha, we are currently \nworking with the Department of Veterans Affairs to create a center of \nexcellence, a national model for veterans' care that will include top-\nflight mental health care and other services so much needed by our \nveterans in our community. That treatment would cover post-traumatic \nstress disorder, depression, anxiety and problems relating to other \npeople.\n  The debt we owe the men and women who serve this country is a debt \nthat can never be repaid. But we must continue to ensure that we keep \nour promises to our veterans and support their very unique healthcare \nissues.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the \ngentleman from Michigan for hosting this Special Order to raise \nawareness for an issue that impacts constituents in all of our \ncongressional districts.\n  We can all agree that, as Members of Congress, we need to prioritize \nour veterans. We also need to raise awareness about the invisible \nwounds many of them face. I am speaking about post-traumatic stress \ndisorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, which can and often does \nlead to thoughts of suicide.\n  Mr. Speaker, we also need to make sure that the loved ones of these \nveterans have the support they need so that they may best help those \nwho are suffering from these invisible wounds.\n  I have been here 9 months. The House has taken some very positive \nsteps to help veterans since I have been here and improving suicide \nprevention programs.\n  It has been said by several Members already here on the floor today, \nthe Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention Act, a commonsense bill that is going \nto increase access to mental health by creating a peer support and \ncommunity outreach pilot program.\n  It is going to boost accountability with mental health care by \nrequiring an annual evaluation of VA mental health and suicide \nprevention programs.\n  It is proof that, when we put party politics aside around here, we \ncan get good things done. We should all be proud of that.\n  I would like to direct Members' attention to H.R. 2915, the Female \nVeteran Suicide Prevention Act, which has been just passed out of the \nVeterans' Affairs Committee. It is time to bring this bill to the \nfloor.\n  It will direct the VA to identify mental healthcare prevention \nprograms and metrics that are effective in treating female veterans as \npart of the evaluative process required by the Clay Hunt Act, and it \nwould require the VA to accommodate a veteran's obligation to not \nproperly disclose classified information.\n  Mr. Speaker, suicide prevention programs are key to maintaining \ncontinual engagement with veterans and communities, as well as to raise \nawareness and to help intervene, when necessary.\n  I would also add, let's keep in mind the Economic Opportunity \nSubcommittee on Veterans' Affairs, which I serve on, with many other \nhardworking Members who are working in a consensus-oriented fashion.\n  We need to make sure that the Transition Assistance Program is \nworking for our veterans. We need to make sure that, from a veterans' \nhiring preference program, that that is working.\n  We need to make sure that we are utilizing the best that the private \nsector has to offer for workforce development training for veterans \nreturning to civilian life.\n  We know that there is an unfair stigma associated with those who may \nneed to seek assistance with mental health.\n  Part of the value of why we are here today is to raise awareness and \nhelp reduce that stigma and say that we understand that there are \nchallenges for veterans returning to civilian life and we are here to \nhelp.\n\n[[Page H6216]]\n\n  We want to raise awareness. We want to make sure that the programs \nthat we have in place are working. We are going to continue to do that.\n  I applaud those who helped organize this Special Order here today, \nand I am honored to participate in it.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Illinois \n(Mrs. Bustos).\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. Sinema) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Benishek) for \nconvening this important discussion this afternoon.\n  As I am sure we agree, we need to continue shining a light on the \nepidemic of veteran suicide so we can push to improve the resources \navailable to the brave men and women who have served our Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come from a region of Illinois called the Quad Cities. \nFor more than two decades, my seat was held by one of the strongest \nadvocates for veterans who has ever worked in these Chambers. I am \ntalking about the late and the great Congressman Lane Evans.\n  Congressman Evans was a veteran of the Marine Corps who served this \nbody from 1983 all the way to 2007. I was proud to call him my friend.\n  As a veteran, he understood the challenges that many of our returning \nheroes confront after they come home. Congressman Evans was a tireless \nadvocate for expanding resources to our veterans and providing the \nmental health services that many of them need to make a successful \ntransition back to civilian life.\n  Today, after more than a decade of war, this generation of veterans \nfaces a new set of challenges. We have an obligation to those who have \nserved our Nation.\n  As my friend, the gentlewoman from Arizona highlighted earlier in her \nremarks that an estimated 22 veterans commit suicide every single day. \nThat is nearly one every hour.\n  And we all know the statistics driving this epidemic. Military \nsuicides are at their highest rate in 10 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, veterans make up 20 percent of our suicides, despite \nmaking up only 10 percent of our population. Thirty percent of veterans \nhave considered suicide. 37 percent of Iraq and Afghanistan veterans \nhave been diagnosed with PTSD.\n  And of the approximately 22 veterans who take their lives every day, \nroughly five actually get care through the VA health system.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  It is easy to get lost in all those statistics. They are numbers. But \nbehind each and every one of those is a real human being, a veteran \nwith a real story that we must tell. We have a duty to help them.\n  We all know how hard the Department of Veterans Affairs is working to \nkeep up with this ongoing and persistent challenge, but we have to do \nmore. That is why I proudly supported the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention \nfor American Veterans Act, which was signed into law earlier this year. \nOnce this legislation is fully implemented, it will take critical steps \ntoward curbing the epidemic of veteran suicide by improving the VA \nresources and increasing oversight of programs designed to help our \nveterans get the care that they deserve.\n  This is an important step toward stemming the ongoing crisis of \nveteran suicide, but it is not enough. This is why I have called on the \nAppropriations Committee to increase funding for veteran suicide \nprevention programs and outreach services. I hope all of you will join \nme in demanding more action for our veterans.\n  If Congressman Evans were alive today, he would not rest until all of \nour veterans get the care and the support they have earned for \nprotecting our Nation, and neither should we.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Virginia \n(Mr. Goodlatte).\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize an epidemic \nthat is plaguing our servicemembers and our veterans, and that epidemic \nis suicide. Each day it is estimated, on average, 22 veterans commit \nsuicide in the United States. That is more than double the rate for the \ncivilian population, and it is an extremely tragic statistic.\n  Earlier this year, the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American \nVeterans Act was signed into law to help combat this very serious \nproblem. I applaud this step forward, but our work is far from over. We \nmust continue to ensure that those veterans who are suffering know that \nthey are not alone; they have family, friends, and resources readily \navailable to help them heal and move forward.\n  These men and women have given so much to this great Nation. It is \nour duty to walk with them during and after their service.\n  I remain committed to providing the highest quality medical care and \nresources for these brave men and women who were wounded in the course \nof defending our freedom.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues to improve timely access \nto mental healthcare services to ensure our veterans in crisis receive \nthe help that they need.\n  I thank Mr. Benishek and Ms. Sinema for organizing this Special Order \nhour.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to my colleague from Michigan (Mrs. Dingell).\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I thank my friend from Michigan for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank my friends Congressman Benishek, \nCongresswoman Sinema, and Congresswoman Bustos for their leadership and \nfor hosting this Special Order this evening on an issue that we all \ncare very deeply about: the high rate of suicide among our veteran \npopulation.\n  September is Suicide Prevention Month, and it is important that we \ndraw attention to this critical issue. The facts are stark. My other \ncolleagues have already mentioned them. A veteran commits suicide every \n65 minutes. That means that 22 veterans a day are dying.\n  Today we honor those that we have lost already and the families who \nhave suffered so much and are left behind. These veterans were true \nAmerican heroes who served their country and came home tormented. We \ncan never forget the sacrifices that they have made.\n  It is great, on this evening, to see my colleagues from both sides of \nthe aisle here to talk about this issue, because it is my sincere hope \nthat we can come together and rededicate ourselves to doing what is \nright for our veterans and making sure that we are dedicating \nsufficient resources to veterans' care.\n  On Sunday night, in Michigan, I will gather with the family and \nfriends of those veterans who have committed suicide in Michigan. They \nhave built a cross for each of those lives to try to raise awareness in \nour community.\n  In addition, at a meeting that I hold with my mayors, where normally \nwe are talking about infrastructure or roads, two-thirds of that \nmeeting was spent talking about veterans and the emotional issues we \nare dealing with in our communities as we see these veterans \nstruggling.\n  The mayors and I have started a task force to address these issues. \nWe have started a veterans' court that has been following the model of \nother places, trying to raise awareness so that in the community, we \nsee when someone is struggling and are able to put out a helping hand.\n  My next-door neighbor's young son, when tormented, needed help; and \nwhen he called, he couldn't get it.\n  We all have got to come together. These brave young men and women \nhave served our country. When they came home from World War II and \nKorea, we celebrated them. We thanked them for their service. We formed \na community around them.\n  These young men and women are fighting for us. They are fighting for \nfreedom. They are fighting for world security. We have an obligation to \nhelp them when they come home, to help get them the resources that they \nneed. They have memories that haunt them. They have memories that \ntorment them.\n  This Suicide Prevention Month, we have to take the stigma away from \nmental illness. We have to recognize that young people need help \nsometimes, and we have to be there for them.\n  Tonight I thank my colleagues for organizing this Special Order so \nthat we remind people that those who have served us sometimes need that \nhelping hand. If we can prevent it, we must, any young person from \ntaking their\n\n[[Page H6217]]\n\nlife because of the service that they gave this country.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, nearly 10 million Americans have serious \nmental illness, and millions go without proper treatment or care \nbecause our Nation's mental health system is broken not only for our \nveterans, but for our nonveterans as well.\n  My next speaker is Dr. Tim Murphy from Pennsylvania, the author of \nthe Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act, H.R. 2646. This will \noverhaul our Nation's mental healthcare system, adding grants for more \npsychiatrists, authorizing intervention programs, and fixing current \nnationwide shortages of crisis mental health beds.\n  I yield to my colleague from Pennsylvania (Mr. Murphy).\n  Mr. MURPHY of Pennsylvania. I thank the gentleman for organizing this \nvery important Special Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will tell the stories of three servicemembers that I \nhave known in my time in the Navy, in my work at Walter Reed Hospital:\n  One is of a soldier who tried to kill himself. He put a gun to his \nhead, pulled the trigger. The gun fired, but it didn't kill him. It \nleft him partially blind and with a significant head injury. He \nstruggles through life. He continues to live, but the things that \ncaused him to do that have not left.\n  The second is of a marine that I knew, the son of a friend, who died \nrecently. I went to his funeral and saw him lying there, looking so \npeaceful.\n  The third, a soldier, I was called upon by the family to go visit him \nbecause he had been in his room for months. He covered the windows with \ncamouflage. Bottles and bottles of medication littered his room, holes \nwere punched in the walls, and he felt abandoned.\n  There was nothing more we could do for the soldier who had killed \nhimself; there were some things we could do for the soldier who harmed \nhimself; but there was a lot we could do for the soldier who hid \nhimself.\n  When soldiers, sailors, airmen, marines, and coastguardsmen look down \nthe road to suicide, there are multiple reasons. Very often it is \nbecause they have faced those unspeakable horrors of war. Perhaps they \nhave had multiple deployments, strain within the family, the lost \nsocial relationships, divorce, job complications, which whittled and \nchipped away at their strength. Perhaps they lost that sense of \nbelonging that they had with their platoon or their company, that \nfriendship with those who faced battles with them that somehow helped \nprop them back up.\n  In many cases, it is dealing with the traumatic brain injury, of the \nmultiple blasts, explosions, the primary, secondary, or tertiary wounds \nthat they had which affected their brain functioning and leaves them \nwith symptoms oftentimes of psychological disorders. Sometimes that \npsychological disorder is that path to depression, that feeling of \nhopelessness, helplessness, and worthlessness that comes with clinical \ndepression, when the person sometimes says: There is no treatment that \ncan help me; I might as well give up.\n  First let me say to veterans, Mr. Speaker, that there is treatment \nthat can help. There is reason to hope. It is important that veterans \nseek out a therapist; and if that therapist doesn't seem like a good \nmix, seek another one. If that one doesn't seem like a good mix, seek \nanother one. Keep going until you find the right person.\n  It is important veterans understand their life is worth living. Yes, \nyou are suffering in the moment, but you can't stop pursuing treatment. \nDon't seek the permanent solution to the temporary problem. There is \nalways another way out besides suicide.\n  Now, we make this more complicated for veterans, as we do with the \nrest of the community of people who are suffering from mental illness, \nby we simply don't have enough professionals out there to help. We have \nfamily members who don't see the signs of isolation and anger and \ndrinking and drug abuse and irritability. But just because there is a \nhealthcare provider out there, the family should not ever feel that \nthey can't talk to that person.\n  The healthcare provider, even without permission of the soldier, can \nlisten; and it is important that family members contact someone even \nwhen that soldier says, ``I don't want to talk to anybody,'' because, \nvery often, that is the disease speaking, that is the brain illness \nspeaking. That is the part of the illness that says ``I either want to \ngive up'' or ``I don't recognize I have a problem.''\n  Loved ones can call for help, but we need other things taking place \nhere as well. We have to have families who can help that person get out \nof a crisis. We have to help the family understand they need to remove \nthe means of a suicide--if it is a firearm, if it is weapons, if is \ndrugs.\n  But what we need to do and what my bill (H.R. 2646), the Helping \nFamilies in Mental Health Crisis Act, does is it changes the dynamics \nof what our country is doing, that has abusive policies and antifamily \npolicies which actually prevent people from getting help.\n  What we have to do is make sure we have more access to treatment. We \nneed more psychiatrists and psychologists--it is as plain as that--by \nthe thousands and tens of thousands. We do not have enough. So even \nwhen someone tries to seek help, it is difficult.\n  We need more psychiatric hospital beds for those moments when a \nperson needs a respite, someplace to go away from the crisis of \neveryday life. We don't have enough. We had 550,000 psychiatric \nhospital beds in the 1950s. We have less than 40,000 now. Part of that \nis because we have Medicaid rules out there and other rules that say, \nyou know, we don't want hospital beds anymore.\n  Look, I don't want to see people go back to the old asylums, but \nsometimes a person with that sense of helplessness and worthlessness \nneeds a place to go to recover, to get better.\n  We also have a VA system which has said: You are not going to \ncontinue some of these drugs. Your drug isn't on our formulary list. \nYou are not going to take it anymore.\n  I have other legislation in which says that, if a Department of \nDefense doctor prescribes a person medication and it is working, the VA \nshould automatically, without question, carry that medication and \nprovide ease of access for it. One of the reasons we even have the Clay \nHunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans bill is because he \ncouldn't get the medication that worked.\n  It is our fault. We have met the enemy, and he is us, as one \ncharacter famously said.\n  The General Accounting Office also tells us we have a disorganized \nsystem, 112 Federal agencies--112--that are supposed to deal with \nmental illness. The GAO tells us they don't keep track of data. There \nis not accountability. They don't meet. Many of these agencies haven't \neven gotten together since 2009 to coordinate services. Twenty homeless \nprograms, programs scattered throughout the Federal Government--we make \nit the most difficult for those who have the most difficulty.\n  Sometimes what we do, though, is we reauthorize programs that work. \nBut make no mistake, it is not enough. Anyone who thinks that Congress \nhas been adequately addressing the needs of the mentally ill, the \nseriously mentally ill veterans, is naive. We are disillusioning \nourselves into thinking that, because we did something, we did the \nright thing.\n  So let me speak honestly: Congress' lack of comprehensive action and \nits snail pace in dealing with this shares the blame. We are not \npassive in this. We are active and codependent in this crisis that is \ninflicted upon Americans.\n  When we are in this Chamber and we hear another tragic story of \nsomeone who has perhaps killed many people in the community and then \nkilled themselves or they did suicide by cop, we have a moment of \nsilence--and so we should--as we grieve over the loss of innocent life. \nBut that moment of silence should not be accompanied with silent \nbehavior. What we need are moments of action, and strong action at \nthat.\n  Not only do we have the soldier suicides, we had 41,000 suicides in \nthis country in this last year; 43,000 drug overdose deaths; homicides \nby those with serious mental illness; people with mental illness who \nare the victims of crime and homicide.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Then we have that slow-motion death of the homeless and the seriously \nmentally ill who, themselves, have come to so many other chronic \nillnesses that--do you know what? They are not even a statistic. We \ndon't count them.\n\n[[Page H6218]]\n\n  If people want to help, if Members want to do something, here is an \naction plan: become cosponsors of the Helping Families in Mental Health \nCrisis Act, H.R. 2646. Don't sit idly by. Don't say, ``Some other \nMember can do this; let it be someone else's problem.'' It is not. It \nis ours.\n  As a nation, wouldn't we do better to act instead of grieve, to turn \na blind eye and to hope that someone else takes care of it, or, worse \nyet, to be caught up in the politics, the partisan politics and the \ngames that plague this Chamber that says: ``I am not going to let this \nparty have a win or this party have a win''? In the meantime, people \nare dying, and we sit idly by.\n  Mr. Speaker, suicide is a plague on our Nation, on our veterans. It \nis a plague on, as was said in Samuel 16, the last, the least, and the \nlonely. We must change this system that makes it difficult for those \nwho have the most difficulty. We must remove abusive Federal policies \nthat say that you can't see two doctors in the same day; you can't have \nmore than 16 hospital beds; that say it is okay to have Federal \nprograms and grants going out there for absurd concepts like making \ncollages, making masks; telling people to get off their medication; a \nWeb site to help people in Boston, when it is cold, deal with the \nanxiety of snow; a $425,000 Web site for 3-year-olds with sing-along \nsongs; and a $22,000 painting which sits in the Office of Substance \nAbuse and Mental Health Services Administration to give them awareness. \nThe only thing I am aware of, Mr. Speaker, is that it is a waste of \nmoney--a waste of taxpayers' money--and a waste of lives.\n  If this Congress gets its act together and admits it, and if our \nleadership says that we can run lots of bills--and we can run lots of \nbills real quick--and we can suspend the bills and bring bills to the \nfloor in a moment's notice, I have had this bill sitting around 3 \nyears. We revise it and revise it again. We have the support of \nmultiple organizations across the country, whether they represent \nparents or consumers or professionals, and another day goes by; and \nevery few seconds another person commits suicide or has a drug overdose \ndeath, and we go home at night and sleep snugly in our beds.\n  It doesn't have to be this way if we have more providers and if we \nhave a Federal Government in Congress that says that we must be guided \nby wisdom, compassion, and faith, that says we will not wait anymore \nand that we will take the collective voice of every Member of Congress \nto do that.\n  A few hours ago, we had the Holy Father, Pope Francis, speak in this \nvery Chamber. His words still echo in this community. But he called us \nto do things together, to be motivated by love, to be engaged in a \ndialogue and conversation, and that is a conversation we must be having \nabout mental illness as well, to say that we can no longer put this \noff.\n  I hope Members, if they really are concerned about veteran suicide--\nas I believe we are--if they are really concerned about the problems of \nserious mental illness--as I know we are--if Members are tired of \nmoments of silence in those times when we come together for a few \nminutes of compassion, we recognize that is not enough--and I know we \nare--then I hope every Member, every Democrat and Republican, talks to \ntheir leadership, talks to their committee members, talks to each other \nand says, ``Move this bill. Make something happen.''\n  By the way, Mr. Speaker, let me close with this. The story I told you \nhas a good ending.\n  The soldier that I visited in his home with the windows covered with \ncamouflage, with medications scattered throughout the house, and with \nholes punched in the wall because of his anger, we did get him help. He \ngot stabilized. He took those barriers off the windows. He let the \nbright light of the world shine in again, and he engaged with people \nagain. He has hope again.\n  That is a story that comes because people stepped forward and helped \nhim. The people at hospitals and military hospitals can do that. Let's \nmake sure that the others like him whom we have not discovered yet, who \nare still hiding in their rooms, we get to them before their lives are \ntaken. This is what we should be doing as a nation. Failing to do this \nmeans we are culpable as this tragedy continues.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I would like to thank my colleague for his passion on \nthis issue.\n  I would now like to yield to my colleague from California (Mr. \nPeters).\n  Mr. PETERS. I want to thank the gentleman for yielding, and I want to \nthank Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek for their \nleadership on this issue, which is also of prime interest to me, this \nepidemic of suicide in our veteran community.\n  Mr. Speaker, San Diego has the third largest population of veterans \nin the country, more than 235,000. One of the most important jobs we \nhave here in Congress is to honor their service by keeping our promises \nto them.\n  September is Suicide Prevention Month, a time to focus on ending the \nscourge of veteran suicide that has hurt families and communities \nacross the country. Combating suicide takes the full spectrum of \nservices, including deployment, education, drug and alcohol abuse \ntreatment, and ending the stigma around mental health.\n  In San Diego, I am pleased to say, the nonprofit sector has really \nstepped up. We have been at the forefront of finding innovative ways to \napproach veteran suicide by providing services and developing cohesion \nin the local veteran community that came together after the Vietnam war \nto increase collaboration among government, private groups, and \ncommunity partners.\n  San Diego is the home of, in my district, 0800, which is an \norganization doing innovative work to assist easing the transition \nbetween Active Duty and civilian life. It is a community-based \nnonprofit that takes the existing service structure, works with the \nservicemembers before they leave the military to get them set, and \nprovides the case management after they return to the civilian world to \nensure that the benefits and services that veterans have earned are \nprovided to them.\n  Another organization, the Three Wise Men Foundation, founded by \ncombat veteran Nathan Fletcher, utilizes community engagement and \nworkout trainings to help veterans who were in combat and have \nstruggled to reintegrate after coming home.\n  There is a powerful article by Dave Phillips that The New York Times \nhighlighted this weekend about how many veterans are turning to each \nother to survive. To quote that article: ``Feeling abandoned, members \nof the battalion have turned to a survival strategy they learned at \nwar: depending on one another.''\n  We have all heard the devastating statistics of veteran suicides in \nthe country, but thus far, the response has failed to properly address \nthe dire situation, and we have a responsibility here in Congress to do \nmuch more than we have. The statistics don't tell the heart-wrenching \nstories that so many of us have heard from parents, spouses, and the \nloved ones of the veteran who has taken his or her own life.\n  One such couple that Congresswoman Sinema and I know, and I have been \nhonored to work with, is Dr. Howard and Jean Somers, who, after losing \ntheir son, Daniel, to suicide, have become tireless advocates to fix \nand reform the broken healthcare system at the Department of Veterans \nAffairs.\n  We know that bipartisan reforms to the VA can make a difference. The \nClay Hunt Act showed us that and garnered a new generation of mental \nhealth and suicide prevention services at the VA, and the Veterans \nChoice Act will bring accountability to a system wrought with oversight \nand leadership challenges, allowing for faster service closer to the \nveteran in need.\n  But fixing an inefficient VA requires more than just increased \nfunding. It requires real changes to get veterans care in new and \nflexible ways. We need to allow the VA to better use innovative \ntechnologies, like wireless medicine, that allow veterans access to \ncare from the comfort of their homes, which can save lives and decrease \ncosts to taxpayers.\n  We need to break the stigma around mental health, particularly post-\ntraumatic stress. The service-connected injury needs to be treated with \nthe same gravity and respect as the physical injury that so many of our \nvaliant warfighters have battled.\n  So thank you again, Congresswoman Sinema and Congressman Benishek, \nfor your consistent advocacy on reforming the VA and on ending the \ntragedy of veteran suicide. We have much more\n\n[[Page H6219]]\n\nwork to do, and I appreciate the opportunity to be here today to work \nwith you on it.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Abraham). The gentleman has 8 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Yoho).\n  Mr. YOHO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to take a moment to thank my \ncolleagues, Representatives Sinema and Dr. Benishek, for their \nleadership in arranging such a Special Order on such an important topic \nand for the invitation to speak this afternoon on suicide prevention \nawareness.\n  September is Suicide Prevention Awareness Month. It is so important \nthat we have an open and honest dialogue about the issue of suicide. \nThe more we talk about it, we increase people's awareness, and they are \nthere to help the people in need.\n  There are alternatives, and they do not have to suffer in silence. \nFrom comedian Robin Williams, to bullied young kids, to the brave men \nand women from our Nation's military returning from the battlefield, \nsuicide does not discriminate. Emotional pain and despair can set in \nand take root in the minds and bodies of all ages across all \ndemographics. Often, the signs of suicide go undetected, which leave \nthose left behind asking: Why did this happen, and what could I have \ndone to prevent this tragedy?\n  Today a disproportionate amount of our Nation's veterans are falling \nvictim to suicide. After all they have given to this country, it is \ntragic and unacceptable that our Nation's veterans often suffer in \nsilence until it is too late for those around them to help.\n  By shining a light on veteran suicide and all suicides, we as a \nnation can start to understand the urgency with which we need to solve \nand prevent this epidemic that our veterans, their families, and their \nfriends struggle with. Not recognizing the signs early enough all too \noften leads to a loss of life. This is an important thing that we as a \nnation need to come together and have a strong support system in place \nso that those in need will reach out and not be stigmatized.\n  Again, I want to thank our colleagues.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and \nI want to thank, particularly, Representatives Sinema and Benishek for \nbringing up this Special Order hour.\n  For my own part, I speak for the northeastern part of Pennsylvania. \nPennsylvania is home to nearly 1 million veterans. These are brave men \nand women who serve this Nation, a Nation that has, regrettably, not \nalways served them.\n  Many of the veterans suffer from mental illness. A study, as you all \nknow, has been released that found that 22 veterans commit suicide \nevery day. This is unacceptable.\n  As someone who deeply cares about veterans' issues, I was proud to \nintroduce legislation in the last Congress that would fast-track the \nhiring of psychiatrists who have completed a residency at a VA \nfacility, and I was gratified that the President has incorporated many \nof those ideas in his policy.\n  Initially, in this Congress, I plan to reintroduce the Veterans \nMental Health Accessibility Act, an important piece of legislation that \naims to provide for our brave servicemen and -women when they return \nfrom combat with both easily visible and difficult-to-detect wounds. \nWhile the physical wounds are evident immediately, the mental health \nones may take longer to manifest themselves.\n  Here is the problem: as many as 30 percent of Operation Iraqi and \nEnduring Freedom veterans face the possible diagnosis of a mental \nhealth disorder. But after 5 postservice years, if a condition is not \ndiagnosed, veterans would go to the back of the line. They have missed \ntheir statute of limitations in 5 years and then experience an average \nwait time to receive benefits of more than 1 year. This could mean the \ndifference between life and death.\n  Unfortunately, mental health disorders are harder to diagnose, may \ntake much longer to manifest, and many veterans might delay seeking \ntreatment. We are putting it on them to self-diagnose and report within \nthat 5-year span.\n  We should not hold mental health disorders to the same timeline as a \nbroken leg. The Veterans Mental Health Accessibility Act would ensure \nthat no veteran would be denied mental health treatment no matter when \ncombat-related mental health disorders first appear.\n  I believe we owe a great debt to those warfighters who serve our \ncountry through military service, including those who stood ready at a \nmoment's notice to fight for our freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, as long as I am a Member of Congress, I will be working \nto increase knowledge on this subject, to correct the shortcomings of \nthe VA system, and to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Forces \nwho bravely serve this country receive all the benefits to which they \nare entitled.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Nice comments, Mr. Cartwright. I appreciate it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), \nmy colleague on the Veterans' Affairs Committee.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Thank you, Mr. Benishek.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the distinguished gentleman from \nMichigan and the distinguished gentlewoman from Arizona for yielding.\n  In honor of Suicide Prevention Month, I rise today to increase \nawareness about some of our bravest and most at risk: our veterans. \nMany of our Nation's troops, both past and present, face struggles many \nof us can never imagine. Every day 22 veterans take their own lives.\n  I have experienced this same tragedy in my own district. In 2013, a \nconstituent in my district, a former marine who served in Vietnam, \nbegan experiencing severe pain over his entire body. After visiting \nfour VA clinics and facilities, doctors could not diagnose his \ncondition and instead prescribed morphine for ongoing and oftentimes \nexcruciating pain.\n  To help manage his undiagnosed condition, doctors recommended he \nenter a nursing home. Unfortunately, he discovered he did not meet the \neligibility requirements. Later that day, his wife was told that she \nhad 1 hour to pick him up or they, the VA, would send him home in a cab \nwithout clothes since he did not have any at the hospital to wear. Two \ndays later, just a week before Christmas, the pain proved too great for \nhim to bear and he took his own life.\n  His story details the urgency our Nation's heroes deserve. Instead of \nending in heartbreak, veterans and their families need to know their \nlives count, which is why we must improve veterans' access to physical \nand mental health care. Together, we can change this system to prevent \ntragedies like this from ever happening again.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Thank you very much, Mrs. Walorski. I really appreciate \nyour comments.\n  I think Dr. Murphy brought up a good point when he was speaking. We \njust recently in this House passed the 21st Century Cures Act, H.R. 6.\n  That has been endorsed by a wide variety of professional and medical \norganizations, such as the American Association for Cancer Research and \nThe Cure Alliance. We passed this bill by an overwhelmingly bipartisan \nvote of 344-77.\n  This is a piece of legislation that is going to change the way we do \nresearch at the NIH, that is going to change health care for all \nAmericans. There is no reason that we shouldn't be able to pass a \nmental health care bill similar to that with a wide bipartisan effort.\n  Today Ms. Sinema and I are leading a bipartisan group of Members of \nCongress to make mental health care an issue on which to move forward, \nand it has really been a great way to get this started.\n  I yield to Ms. Sinema if she would like to add a few more thoughts in \nthat regard.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Thank you very much, Congressman Benishek.\n  I know we will be continuing this in the next Special Order so as to \nallow more of our colleagues to speak, and I am really looking forward \nto that time.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H6220]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6220-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6220-H6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       VETERAN SUICIDE PREVENTION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. \nSinema) for 30 minutes.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker, I am very happy to open the Special Order \nthis evening with my colleague and friend, Congressman Dan Benishek of \nMichigan.\n  We have some colleagues who are joining us here this evening to \ncontinue the discussion we have been enjoying for the last hour of \ntalking about the scourge of veteran suicides and how to stop this \nscourge.\n  We know that there are brave whistleblowers around this country who \nhave told us and the Nation about the problems at the VA.\n  If it weren't for brave whistleblowers, we may not have learned about \nthe tragedies at my VA, the Phoenix VA, and we could have lost even \nmore lives than we have lost already.\n  In order for the VA to change, it has to put its veterans first and \nchange the culture. We believe that VA employees must continue to speak \nup and speak out.\n  Brandon Coleman, a Marine Corps veteran, has seen firsthand the \nimportant role the VA can play in helping veterans. A decade ago he \nreceived help from a dedicated VA counselor, who helped him overcome \nsubstance abuse issues and get his life back on track.\n  Wanting to help his fellow veterans, Brandon began working as an \naddiction counselor with the Phoenix VA in 2009.\n  In January of this year, Brandon approached his supervisor after, \nover the course of a single week, five suicidal veterans walked out of \nthe Phoenix VA hospital without getting the help they needed from the \nemergency room.\n  After coming forward with his concerns about how the VA handled \nsuicidal patients, Brandon was placed on administrative leave for \nadverse behavior and his program was shut down.\n  Mr. Speaker, no one should fear the risk of losing his or her job for \nspeaking out. That is why we introduced the VA Accountability Act, a \nbipartisan bill to hold poor-performing employees accountable and to \nincrease protections for whistleblowers.\n  Empowering whistleblowers helps our veterans and their families get \nthe answers they deserve. The VA must respond to this challenge with a \nculture of accountability that protects veterans, not its own \nbureaucracy.\n  Brandon testified before the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee earlier this week on improving \naccountability within the VA. He is committed to fixing the VA to \nensure that all veterans get the same help that he got.\n  I would like to take some time now to turn the podium over to the \ngentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Russell).\n  Mr. RUSSELL. I thank the Congresswoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a serious issue that our Nation faces when we \nimagine the sacrifice that our veterans make only to see them become \ncasualties in a battle with the mind.\n  Those of us who have borne the burden of battle carry the weight of \nthat burden the rest of our lives. As a warrior, I have seen the worst \nthings that human beings can do to one another. I have had to take \nhuman life. I have had to watch fellow warriors lose theirs. I have \ncaressed wounded brothers as they have been bleeding.\n  We recall these things and carry these things, and, as warriors, we \nattempt to process it all when we come home. When we do come home, \nothers attempt to interact with us not quite knowing how that \ninteraction should play out or how to treat the Americans we really \nare.\n  So, as we address this issue of veteran suicide and as we stand here \nto speak in support of the many good measures that we have heard today, \nMr. Speaker, I would also like to provide a couple of things worth \nnoting with which we could reach out to the community at large, to our \nStates, to all of America.\n  For the population that deals with returning battle veterans, purpose \nmatters. We don't want to come home as victims. We don't want to be put \nin some special class.\n  We have maintained the stresses of battle, and we have fought our \nNation's wars, but purpose matters as we come home.\n  If that purpose is somehow denied us because of fear of capacity or \nfear of being able to interact with other Americans in employment or in \nwhatever it is that we put our hand to, then we will miss a great \nopportunity early on to engage returning veterans in things that will \nhelp them heal.\n  Secondly, we should treat our returning veterans as the Americans \nthey really are. We somehow unintendedly imagine them as damaged goods, \nor maybe they have had something happen to them that does not make them \nquite like we are. That is a mistake.\n  Thirdly, when we look at the stresses of battle and how they shape \nour lives, we must remember this, that post-traumatic stress is \ntreatable. As we deal with those who have faced battle as they struggle \nthrough this, it is important to note that the returning warrior has \nnot lost his mind or her mind. It is treatable.\n  Mr. Speaker, one can easily relate when you think about, in my home \nState, maybe surviving a tornado or maybe, across America, being in a \nhorrific car accident or losing a loved one in some capacity.\n  It creates stress on the human being, yet no one in that scenario \nwould say, ``Well, they have been through quite a lot, so I am not sure \nthat they can engage with the public anymore and be employed'' or, ``I \nam not sure they will be able to handle the daily stresses.''\n  Instead, we look at them, and we realize that these are life-altering \nexperiences, whether it be through a car accident or a tornado, and we \nsay, ``Wow, that is terrible, but they have really bounced back, and \nthey have done a good job of recovering.'' We need to look at it in the \nsame capacity.\n  I am no physician, but I am a warrior who has come home. For the \nwarrior, as he or she does come home, Mr. Speaker, we must urge all of \nour warriors, especially as they face insurmountable pressure about \n``Does life have a purpose?'' to not live in isolation, and we must \nunderstand that the adrenalin of survival at our peak in battle, which \nis all around us--every sense alive to protect us as we survive--\nphysiologically doesn't instantly change when we come home.\n  Those levels of adrenalin stay, and we crave them. That is why your \nreturning veteran may ride his motorcycle at 120 miles an hour or \npursue a dangerous activity. As the warrior processes it, he must \nunderstand as well that it takes time to abate that and to adjust.\n  I also want to point out, Mr. Speaker, that our returning veterans \nshould band together with their fellow warriors. Above all, don't quit. \nOnly we can take ourselves out of that fight.\n  To all of us, I think it is best to recall what Solomon tells us in \nEcclesiastes in that two are better than one because they have good \nreward for their labor, for, if they fall, the one will lift up his \nfellow; but woe to him that is alone when he falls, for he does not \nhave another to help him up.\n  Again, if two lie together, then they have heat. But how can one be \nwarm alone? And if one prevails against him, two shall withstand him, \nand a threefold cord is not quickly broken.\n\n  As we attempt here in government to bind up the wounds, we must also \nrealize it is not the government's sole responsibility. As an American \ncommunity, we need to bind together as those wounds are bound up to \nheal.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Representative Russell, for your \nthoughts and your participation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn).\n  Thank you for being here this evening.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. I want to thank my colleagues Representative Sinema and \nRepresentative Benishek for their leadership on this issue today and \nfor organizing this time together.\n  I also want to thank Representative Russell for his hard-earned \ninsights that he has shared with us.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is critical that we raise awareness for veteran \nsuicide prevention. Unfortunately, this much-needed awareness comes too \nlate for one of my Colorado Springs families.\n  I would like to tell you the story of Noah, a former marine, who \nserved with honor in Iraq in 2009 and in Afghanistan in 2011. I will \nnot use his last name, but his parents have offered the use of his \npicture.\n  After leaving the Marine Corps, Noah began working on a business \ndegree at\n\n[[Page H6221]]\n\nthe University of Colorado, Colorado Springs, and started his own \nonline business.\n  Now, Noah comes from a military family, his dad having honorably \nserved for 23 years. He chose to put off college so that he could serve \nthis great Nation.\n  Unfortunately, his parents are appalled by the care their son did not \nreceive from the VA. They believe their son would still be alive had he \nreceived better care. Noah was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and received a 50 percent disability rating due to PTSD.\n  On April 2 of this year, he went to the Colorado Springs VA clinic, \nwhere medical notes from his visit state that he had had suicidal \nthoughts.\n  Noah was prescribed a psychotropic drug and was sent on his way. He \nwas not referred for suicide prevention; he was not offered counseling; \nand there was no follow-up from the VA.\n  He went missing on May 4 and was found dead from an apparent suicide \non May 12 of this year. As you can imagine, his family is devastated. \nThey are asking a lot of serious questions.\n  I had the opportunity to ask some of their questions on their behalf \nduring a June 10 hearing by the Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee on \nOversight & Investigations.\n  During the hearing, two top-level VA officials stated that they would \npersonally look into the case and ``make sure this family had been \nreached out to directly.''\n  However, a month after the hearing, no contact had been made, and my \noffice had to once again engage the VA on behalf of this grieving \nfamily.\n  The VA has since stated that Noah should have been seen within 2 \nweeks of his medical appointment and that they are modifying their \nprocedures to, hopefully, make sure this doesn't happen in the future.\n  It should not take the death of a marine to get procedures right in \nregards to suicide prevention. We owe it to our veterans to get it \nright the first time.\n  Hopefully, this Special Order and the added awareness of veteran \nsuicide will help prevent another tragedy like Noah's.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Thank you, Congressman Lamborn, for your contribution \nthis evening.\n  Mr. Speaker, before we close this evening, I yield to the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Benishek), my friend, who has been gracious to \ncohost our Special Orders this evening.\n  Mr. BENISHEK. Yes. It was great. It was a wonderful Special Order \nthis evening.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues who took the time to come down \nand talk about this serious issue that faces our country.\n  Mr. Lamborn discusses a case of suicide that he is very familiar with \nin his district. That story moves each and every one of us, and it is \nemblematic of the 22 suicides that occur every day amongst our \nveterans.\n  There are stories as moving as this one and as tragic as this one as \nMr. Lamborn brings up the fact that this patient was seen at the VA and \nwas not helped at the VA.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  We need to make sure that the Veterans Administration and this \nadministration puts our veterans not on the back burner as something \nthat is ongoing, but make this a crisis. This is an emergency.\n  This needs to be dealt with now not with reassurances from \nbureaucrats that it is all going to be better or ``We are changing our \npolicies.'' They have been changing their policies for a long time and \nnothing has happened. This needs to be an emergency response.\n  As friends and family members of our veterans and those serving our \ncountry, there are some things that we can do. We can work to recognize \nthe symptoms that could indicate serious problems and identify where \nand how to get assistance when we may need it.\n  To all veterans struggling with whether to take your own life, know \nthat there is no shame in asking for help. You are not broken, and God \nhas not forgotten you.\n  You have volunteered to go to war for us, and we have failed to \nprovide you adequate support when you have returned home. That is \nchanging. I beg you to reach out to your local VA, your veterans \ncenter, your veterans service organization, or your Congressman to ask \nfor help.\n  I mean, I had two calls today on my cell phone, which I give my \nnumber out freely, from veterans that did not get appropriate help at \nthe VA, and I refer them to my staff to get the ball rolling, get \nmoving.\n  Together we can begin to turn the tide on veterans' suicide. \nEveryone, though, can help fight this epidemic and be there for those \nthat were there for us.\n  I thank my colleague from Arizona (Ms. Sinema) for closing this \nSpecial Order hour for us.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Thank you so much, Congressman Benishek.\n  Before we close, we have one more person who has joined us.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman).\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to voice my unrelenting \nsupport for our Nation's veterans who are suffering, often silently, \nwith depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and profound emotional \npain. It is absolutely vital that we, as a Nation, address the crisis \nof veteran suicide.\n  As a Marine Corps combat veteran, I can tell you firsthand that \nreturning home to civilian life can be a difficult transition. Many \ntroops used to the constant daily support of their comrades come home \nfeeling isolated and alone. Many find themselves needing help that too \noften isn't there.\n  Some units are hit particularly hard, like the 2nd Battalion, 7th \nMarine Regiment, a group that saw intense combat in Afghanistan and has \ncontinued to suffer casualties to suicide years after they have \nreturned. 2nd Battalion, 7th Marines, has seen a suicide rate 14 times \nhigher than that of all other Americans.\n  It is essential that, when our men and women in uniform return to the \ncivilian world and need to reach out for help, somebody reaches back.\n  We need to ensure that veterans get the mental health care they need, \nwhen they need it, not after waiting weeks or months for an \nappointment.\n  We need to ensure that veterans who need medication get it and \nveterans who don't need medication aren't unnecessarily prescribed \ndrugs with volatile side effects.\n  We need to ensure that, when a veteran calls the VA's Veterans Crisis \nLine, somebody is available on the other end to listen.\n  But I don't believe this is a problem that begins and ends with the \nDepartment of Defense or the Department of Veterans Affairs. Veterans \nare in all of our communities, our schools, our places of worship, and \nour social clubs. All Americans should be willing to lend a hand when a \nveteran may be suffering silently.\n  I share the sentiment expressed by VA Secretary McDonald earlier this \nyear, and I know it is a statement in which my colleagues on both sides \nof the aisle would uniformly agree: ``Losing just one veteran to \nsuicide is one veteran too many.''\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Speaker and Members, before I close with the closing \nstatements, I want to take a moment and honor and thank Congressman \nBenishek not just for the work he has done tonight or the work he has \ndone on the Veterans Committee, but for the great work he has done in \nCongress for the last three terms.\n  We are sad that you are retiring. We will miss you. But we have one \nmore chance to do this Special Order again next year, and I look \nforward to that time. So thank you for your help and for your service.\n  Congressman Benishek has not just been a partner to me in the work \nthat we have been doing to help and support veterans, he has been a \nleader in the Veterans Committee and in his conference and in this \nHouse of Representatives.\n  I know, when he leaves this body, he will continue to be a shining \nlight for veterans around this country. Thank you, Congressman.\n  I want to close with a story about a veteran in my district. We \nrecently received a call from David, a constituent of mine who is an \nArmy veteran and a survivor of two suicide attempts.\n  David told us: My mind was plagued with feelings that my parents and \nsiblings would be better off without me because of who I had become as \na person. I felt savage and inhuman. No matter what good I did, I \ncouldn't face going back to a normal existence. I had never felt more \nalone in my life.\n\n[[Page H6222]]\n\n  Through much time and assistance from organizations like the Wounded \nWarrior Project and mental and physical rehabilitation programs, David \ngained a new mission in life. He is helping his fellow veterans \nnavigate a daunting system and reintegrate back into civilian life.\n  David wants his fellow warriors to understand that suicide is a \npermanent solution to a temporary problem.\n  His mission of supporting veterans led David to Rally Point, a \nPhoenix nonprofit veteran service organization working to assist \nveterans in crisis.\n  Rally Point employs veterans like David who understand the unique \nneeds of fellow veterans, servicemembers, and their families. These are \nthe kinds of solutions we need to ensure that no veteran ever feels \nlike he or she has nowhere to turn.\n  We have made some progress. In February of this year, the President \nsigned the Clay Hunt SAV Act into law, an important step toward \nimproving mental health services for veterans and their families.\n  This bipartisan legislation requires annual third-party evaluations \nof the VA's mental healthcare and suicide prevention programs to \ndetermine which programs are successful and to recommend improvements.\n  It also requires collaboration on suicide prevention efforts between \nthe VA and nonprofit mental health organizations, and it establishes a \npilot program using peer support and community outreach to assist \nveterans transitions from Active Duty.\n  We cannot leave our heroes to fight their toughest battles alone.\n  Thank you again to all of our colleagues who joined us this evening. \nOur thoughts are with all the families who have lost a loved one to \nsuicide. Each of us can do something to raise awareness, to be that \nlight for a struggling veteran in our community.\n  Businesses can display signs to let veterans know that help is always \navailable. Mental health professionals can volunteer with organizations \nlike Give an Hour to provide free counseling to veterans and their \nfamilies. We can all learn to recognize the signs of crisis by visiting \nveteranscrisisline.net and reaching out to the vets in our life.\n  Here in Congress, we can do more. We need a VA that provides real and \nmeaningful help to veterans in need that puts veterans first and works \naggressively with community providers to improve the quality and \naccessibility of care.\n  We need a VA that is transparent and open to restore the trust and \ncredibility it has lost. We, who enjoy freedom every day thanks to the \nsacrifices of our military servicemembers, must all step up to end the \nepidemic of veteran suicide.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6222-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6222]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Jones (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and the balance \nof the week on account of personal reasons.\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today on account of \nfamily reasons.\n  Ms. McCollum (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today and the balance \nof the week on account of a family event.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "24"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/24/house-section/article/H6222-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6222-H6225]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     PUBLICATION OF COMMITTEE RULES\n\n\n    RULES OF THE COMMITTEE ON SMALL BUSINESS FOR THE 114TH CONGRESS\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Small Business,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 24, 2015.\n     Hon.

Each Subcommittee of the \n     Committee on Small Business (``the Committee'') is a part of \n     the Committee and is subject to the authority and direction \n     of the Committee, and to the rules of the House and the rules \n     adopted herein to the extent applicable.\n\n\n                   2. REFERRAL OF BILLS BY THE CHAIR\n\n       The Chair will retain consideration of all legislation \n     referred to the Committee by the Speaker.

Subcommittee chairs, pursuant to \n     the rules set out herein, may hold hearings on any bill \n     referred to the Committee.\n\n\n                           3. DATE OF MEETING\n\n       The regular meeting date of the Committee shall be the \n     second Wednesday of every month when the House is in session. \n     The Chair may dispense with the meeting of the Committee, if \n     in the sole discretion of the Chair, there is no need for \n     such meeting. Additional meetings may be called as deemed \n     necessary by the Chair or at the request of the majority \n     Members of the Committee pursuant to Rule XI, cl. 2(c) of the \n     rules of the House.\n       At least 3 days notice of such an additional meeting shall \n     be given unless the Chair, with the concurrence of the \n     Ranking Minority Member, determines that there is good cause \n     to call the meeting on less notice or upon a vote by a \n     majority of the Committee (a quorum being present). To the \n     extent possible, the three days shall be counted from the 72 \n     hours before the time of the meeting. Announcements of the \n     meeting shall be published promptly in the Daily Digest and \n     made publicly available in electronic form.\n       The determination of the business to be considered at each \n     meeting shall be made by the Chair subject to limitations set \n     forth in House Rule XI, cl. 2(c).\n       The Chair shall provide to each Member of the Committee, to \n     the extent practicable, at least 48 hours in advance of a \n     meeting, a copy of the bill, resolution, report or other item \n     to be considered at the meeting, but no later than 24 hours \n     before the meeting. Such material also shall be made \n     available to the public at least 24 hours in advance in \n     electronic form.\n       The rules for notice and meetings as set forth in Rule 3 of \n     these Rules shall not apply to special and emergency \n     meetings. Clause 2(c)(2) of Rule XI and clause 2(g)(3)(A) of \n     Rule XI of the Rules of the House, as applicable, shall apply \n     to such meetings.\n       A record vote of the Committee shall be provided on any \n     question before the Committee upon the request of any Member \n     of the Committee. A record of the vote of each Member of the \n     Committee on a matter before the Committee shall be available \n     in electronic form within 48 hours of such record vote, and, \n     with respect to any roll call vote on any motion to amend or \n     report, shall be included in the report of the Committee \n     showing the total number of votes cast for and against and \n     the names of those Members voting for and against.\n       The Chair of the Committee shall, not later than 24 hours \n     after consideration of a bill, resolution, report or other \n     item cause the text of the reported item and any amendment \n     adopted thereto to be made publicly available in electronic \n     form.\n\n\n                      4. Announcement of Hearings\n\n       Public announcement of the date, place, and subject matter \n     of any hearing to be conducted by the Committee shall be made \n     no later than 7 calendar days before the commencement of the \n     hearing. To the extent possible, the seven days shall be \n     counted from 168 hours before the time of the Committee's \n     hearing.\n       The Chair, with the concurrence of the Ranking Minority \n     Member, or upon a vote by the majority of the Committee (a \n     quorum being present), may authorize a hearing to commence on \n     less than 7 calendar days notice.\n     A. Witness Lists\n       Unless the Chair determines it is impracticable to do so, \n     the Committee shall make a tentative witness list available \n     at the time it makes the public announcement of the hearing. \n     If a tentative witness list is not made available at the time \n     of the announcement of the hearing, such witness list shall \n     be made available as soon as practicable after such \n     announcement is made. A final witness list shall be issued by \n     the Committee no later than 48 hours prior to the \n     commencement of the hearing.\n     B. Material for the Hearing\n       The Chair shall provide to all Members of the Committee, as \n     soon as practicable after the announcement of the hearing, a \n     memorandum explaining the subject matter of the hearing and \n     any official reports from departments and agencies on the \n     subject matter of the hearing. Such material shall be made \n     available to all Members of the Committee no later than 48 \n     hours before the commencement of the hearing unless the \n     Chair, after consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, \n     determines that certain reports from departments or agencies \n     should not be made available prior to the commencement of the \n     hearing. Material provided by the Chair to all Members, \n     whether provided prior to or at the hearing, shall be placed \n     on the Committee website no later than 48 hours after the \n     commencement of the hearing unless such material contains \n     sensitive or classified information in which case such \n     material shall be handled pursuant to Rule 15 of the \n     Committee's Rules.\n\n\n              5. Meetings and Hearings Open to the Public\n\n     A. Meetings\n       Each meeting of the Committee or its Subcommittees for the \n     transaction of business,\n\n[[Page H6223]]\n\n     including the markup of legislation, shall be open to the \n     public, including to radio, television, and still photography \n     coverage, except as provided by House Rule XI, cl. 4. If the \n     majority of Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present \n     at the meeting, determine by a recorded vote in open session \n     that all or part of the remainder of the meeting on that day \n     shall be closed to the public because the disclosure of \n     matters to be considered would endanger national security, \n     would compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or \n     would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or \n     otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; \n     provided however, that no person other than Members of the \n     Committee, and such congressional staff and such executive \n     branch representatives they may authorize, shall be present \n     in any meeting which has been closed to the public.\n       The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio \n     Members of all Subcommittees for the purpose of any meeting \n     conducted by a Subcommittee.\n     B. Hearings\n       Each hearing conducted by the Committee or its \n     Subcommittees shall be open to the public, including radio, \n     television and still photography coverage. If the majority of \n     Members of the Committee or Subcommittee present at the \n     hearing, determine by a recorded vote in open session, that \n     all or part of the remainder of the hearing on that day shall \n     be closed to the public because the disclosure of matters to \n     be considered would endanger national security, would \n     compromise sensitive law enforcement information, or would \n     tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person or \n     otherwise would violate any law or rule of the House; \n     provided however, that the Committee or Subcommittee may by \n     the same procedure also vote to close one subsequent day of \n     hearings. Notwithstanding the requirements of the preceding \n     sentence, a majority of those present (if the requisite \n     number of Members are present under Committee rules for the \n     purpose of taking testimony) may vote: (i) to close the \n     hearing for the sole purpose of discussing whether the \n     testimony or evidence to be received would endanger the \n     national security, would compromise sensitive law enforcement \n     information, or violate Rule XI, cl. 2(k)(5) of the House or \n     (ii) to close the hearing, as provided clause 2(k)(5) of Rule \n     XI of the House.\n       The Chair and Ranking Minority Member are ex officio \n     Members of all Subcommittees for any hearing conducted by a \n     Subcommittee. Members of the Committee who wish to \n     participate in a hearing of the Subcommittee to which they \n     are not Members shall make such request to the Chair and the \n     Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee at the \n     commencement of the hearing. The Chair, after consultation \n     with the Ranking Minority Member of the Subcommittee, shall \n     grant such request.\n       No Member of the House may be excluded from non-\n     participatory attendance at any hearing of the Committee or \n     any Subcommittee, unless the House of Representatives shall \n     by majority vote authorize the Committee or Subcommittees, \n     for purposes of a particular subject of investigation, to \n     close its hearing to Members by the same procedures \n     designated to close hearings to the public.\n       Members of Congress who are not Members of the Committee \n     but would like to participate in a hearing shall notify the \n     Chair and the Ranking Minority Member and submit a formal \n     request no later than 24 hours before the commencement of the \n     meeting or hearing.\n       To the maximum extent practicable, the Committee shall \n     provide audio and video coverage of each hearing or meeting \n     for the transaction of business in a manner that allows the \n     public to easily listen and view the proceedings and shall \n     maintain the recordings of such coverage in a manner easily \n     accessible to the public.\n\n\n                              6. Witnesses\n\n     A. Statement of Witnesses\n       Each witness who is to appear before the Committee or \n     Subcommittee shall file an electronic copy of the testimony \n     with the Committee and the Ranking Minority Member no later \n     than 48 hours before the commencement of the hearing. In \n     addition, the witness shall provide 25 copies of the \n     testimony by the commencement of the hearing. The Chair may \n     waive the requirement by the witness providing 25 copies in \n     which case the Committee or Subcommittee shall provide the 25 \n     copies.\n       Each non-governmental witness shall provide to the \n     Committee and the Ranking Minority Member, no later than 48 \n     hours before the commencement of the hearing, a curriculum \n     vitae or other statement describing their education, \n     employment, professional affiliation or other background \n     information pertinent to their testimony.\n       As required by Rule XI, cl. 2(g) of the Rules of the House, \n     each non-governmental witness before the commencement of the \n     hearing shall file with the Chair a disclosure form detailing \n     any contracts or grants that the witness has with the federal \n     government. Such information shall be posted on the Committee \n     website within 24 hours after the witness appeared at the \n     hearing.\n       The failure to provide the materials set forth by the \n     deadlines set forth in these rules may be grounds for \n     excluding both the oral and written testimony of the witness \n     unless waived by the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee.\n       The Committee will provide public access to printed \n     materials, including the testimony of witnesses in electronic \n     form on the Committee's website no later than 24 hours after \n     the hearing is adjourned. Supplemental material provided \n     after the hearing adjourns, shall be placed on the Committee \n     website no later than 24 hours after receipt of such \n     material.\n     B. Number of Witnesses and Witnesses Selected by the Minority\n       For any hearing conducted by the Committee or Subcommittee \n     there shall be no more than four non-governmental witnesses \n     of which the Ranking Minority Member of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee (as appropriate) is entitled to select one \n     witness for the hearing. Witnesses selected by the Ranking \n     Minority Member of the Committee or Subcommittee shall be \n     invited to testify by the Chair of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee (as appropriate). Rule 6(A) shall apply with \n     equal force to witnesses selected by the Ranking Minority \n     Member of the Committee or Subcommittee.\n       The limitations set forth in the preceding paragraph shall \n     not apply if the Committee holds a hearing to honor the work \n     of the small business community in conjunction with the \n     annual celebration of Small Business Week. Witness \n     limitations for such a hearing shall be determined by the \n     Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member.\n     C. Interrogation of Witnesses\n       Except when the Committee adopts a motion pursuant to \n     subdivisions (B) and (C) of clause 2(i)(2) of Rule XI of the \n     Rules of the House, Committee Members may question witnesses \n     only when they have been recognized by the Chair for that \n     purpose. Members shall have the opportunity, as set forth in \n     Rule XI, cl. 2(j) of the Rules of the House, to question each \n     witness on the panel for a period not to exceed five minutes. \n     For any hearing, the Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     may offer a motion to extend the questioning of a witness or \n     witnesses by the Member identified in the motion for more \n     than five minutes as set forth in Rule XI, cl. 2(j)(B).\n       The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee shall commence \n     questioning followed by the Ranking Minority Member. \n     Thereafter, questioning shall alternate between the majority \n     and minority Members in order of their arrival at the hearing \n     after the gavel has been struck to commence the hearing with \n     the first arriving having priority over Members of his or her \n     party. If Members arrive simultaneously or are there prior to \n     the gavel being struck to commence the hearing, order of \n     questioning shall be based on seniority.\n       In recognizing Members to question witnesses, the Chair may \n     take into consideration the ratio of majority and minority \n     Members present in such a manner as to not disadvantage the \n     Members of either party.\n\n\n                              7. Subpoenas\n\n       A subpoena may be authorized and issued by the Committee in \n     the conduct of any investigation or series of investigations \n     or activities to require the attendance and testimony of such \n     witness and the production of such books, records, \n     correspondence, memoranda, papers and document, as deemed \n     necessary. Such subpoena shall be authorized by a majority of \n     the full Committee. The requirement that the authorization of \n     a subpoena require a majority vote may be waived by the \n     Ranking Member of the Committee. The Chair may issue a \n     subpoena, in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member, \n     when the House is out for session for more than three \n     legislative days.\n\n\n                               8. Quorum\n\n       A quorum, for purposes of reporting a measure or \n     recommendation, shall be a majority of the Committee Members. \n     For purposes of taking testimony or receiving evidence, a \n     quorum shall be one Member from the Majority and one Member \n     from the Minority. The Chair of the Committee or Subcommittee \n     shall exercise reasonable comity by waiting for the Ranking \n     Minority Member even if a quorum is present before striking \n     the gavel to commence the hearing. For hearings held by the \n     Committee or a Subcommittee in a location other than the \n     Committee's hearing room in Washington, DC, a quorum shall be \n     deemed to present if the Chair of the Committee or \n     Subcommittee is present.\n\n\n                      9. Amendments During Mark-Up\n\n       Any amendment offered to any pending legislation before the \n     Committee must be made available in written form by any \n     Member of the Committee. If such amendment is not available \n     in written form when requested, the Chair shall allow an \n     appropriate period for the provision thereof and may adjourn \n     the markup to provide sufficient time for the provision of \n     such written amendment. Such period or adjournment shall not \n     prejudice the offering of such amendment.\n       For amendments to be accepted during mark-up, there is no \n     requirement that the amendments be filed prior to \n     commencement of the mark-up or prepared with the assistance \n     of the Office of Legislative Counsel. Even though it is not \n     necessary, Members seeking to amend legislation during mark-\n     up should draft amendments with the assistance of the Office \n     of Legislative Counsel and consult with the Chair or Ranking \n     Member's staff (as appropriate) in the preparation of such \n     amendments.\n\n\n                    10. Postponement of Proceedings\n\n       The Chair in consultation with the Ranking Minority Member \n     may postpone further\n\n[[Page H6224]]\n\n     proceedings when a record vote is ordered on the question of \n     approving any measure or matter or adopting an amendment. The \n     Chair may resume postponed proceedings, but no later than 24 \n     hours after such postponement, unless the House is not in \n     session or there are conflicts with Member schedules that \n     make it unlikely a quorum will be present to conduct business \n     on the postponed proceeding. In such cases, the Chair will \n     consult with Members to set a time as early as possible to \n     resume proceedings but in no event later than the next \n     meeting date as set forth in Rule 3 of these Rules. When \n     proceedings resume on a postponed question, notwithstanding \n     any intervening order for the previous question, an \n     underlying proposition shall remain subject to further debate \n     or amendment to the same extent as when the question was \n     postponed.\n\n\n              11.
