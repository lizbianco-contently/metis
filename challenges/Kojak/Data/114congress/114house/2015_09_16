The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, soon Pope Francis will deliver a \nhistorical address to this Congress. During this year, he has addressed \na form of genocide happening in the world.\n  Globally, Christians are being imprisoned, tortured, and killed \nbecause they are Christians. In 2013, Christians faced persecution in \n102 out of 190-plus countries. In Iran, American Christian pastor Saeed \nAbedini has been languishing in jail for the last 2\\1/2\\ years because \nhe is a Christian.\n  According to the 2015 Open Doors' World Watch List, North Korea is \nthe worst persecutor of Christians in the whole world. There, \nChristians are often sent to prison camps for possession of Bibles, \nsometimes even executed because they are Christians. The State \nDepartment estimates that 80,000 to 120,000 North Koreans are \nimprisoned in labor camps because of their religious beliefs. In \nNovember of 2013, 80 North Korean Christians were reportedly executed \nfor possession of Bibles and possessing South Korean religious films.\n  In Pakistan, in one city, Christian churches have been bombed. A 14-\nyear-old Christian boy was beaten and set on fire because he was a \nChristian. Burns now cover more than 55 percent of his body.\n  In Egypt, over a 3-day period in 2013, Coptic Christians experienced \nthe worst single attack against their churches in 700 years, with 40 \nChristian churches destroyed and over 100 others severely damaged. \nThousands of Coptic Christians have fled Egypt to other countries.\n  In Libya, ISIS captured and beheaded 21 people because they were \nChristians. When the victims' families tried to build a church in their \nhonor, they were attacked by a Muslim mob and beaten.\n  It is not just Assad's thugs in Syria killing Christians; religious \ncleansing takes place in other places. In Syria, militants expelled 90 \npercent of the Christians in the city of Homs. Patriarch Gregorios III \nof Antioch says, out of a population of 1.75 million, 450,000 Syrian \nChristians have fled in fear.\n  Mr. Speaker, no Christian anywhere on Earth should have to leave \ntheir homeland because of their faith.\n  In Iraq, where Christians have been calling home since the time of \nChrist, the story is just as dark. Its Christian population has almost \nentirely disappeared--dropping 90 percent since the first gulf war. The \nnumber of churches has declined from 300 in 2003 to 57.\n  In Africa, the terrorist group al Shabaab attacked a university in \nKenya, going door-to-door to find and execute Christians. Al Shabaab \nattacked a shopping mall in Kenya in 2013 and took shoppers captive. \nOne of them was Joshua Hakim. When Joshua got close to his attackers, \nhe showed them his ID, and he covered up his Christian name with his \nthumb. ``They told me to go,'' Joshua recalled later. ``Then another \nman came forward, and they said, what is the name of Muhammad's \nmother?'' The individual couldn't answer; so they shot him.\n  Mr. Speaker, history tells us that the persecution of Christians has \nbeen going on since the day Stephen was stoned for his faith in Acts 7.\n  As a country, the United States needs to reexamine its relationship \nwith countries and states that persecute or tolerate the persecution of \nChristians. Countries should get no U.S. foreign aid until they start \nprotecting Christians instead of persecuting them. And let's call \ngroups like ISIS what they truly are: a radical and dangerous Islamic \nextremist terrorist group.\n  Religious liberty is a basic civil right, a humanitarian right, and \nan inalienable right. Since Pilgrims came to America to escape \nreligious persecution in their homeland, our Nation has stood as a \nbright beacon to the world for religious freedom for everyone--Jews, \nMuslims, Hindus, Christians, and others.\n  It is written in the Good Book that a man was traveling on the \nJericho road and fell among robbers. The man was beaten, his property \nwas stolen, and he was left for dead. Other people traveled down the \nsame road, saw him in the ditch, but passed on by him on the\n\n[[Page H5984]]\n\nother side of the road. They went their own way. They did nothing.\n  The United States cannot be silent and walk on the other side of the \nroad while Christians worldwide are beaten, beheaded, and brutalized \nbecause they are Christians. We must be that beacon that shines in \nproud protection of religious freedom for all--including Christians.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5984-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5984]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HAPPY BIRTHDAY WISHES TO THE HONORABLE RON PAUL\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Jones) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. JONES. Mr. Speaker, one of my dearest friends, and a man \nnationally known for his knowledge and wisdom on so many subjects, \nrecently celebrated his 80th birthday on August 20. That special friend \nis Ron Paul.\n  Those who had the pleasure to serve with Ron know how he served with \nunwavering principles. Whether he was fighting the Federal Reserve, \nspeaking out against unnecessary war, or defending life, Ron Paul lived \nout the principles he holds dear and upheld the Constitution. That is \nwhy I supported him when he ran for the President of the United States \nof America.\n  Mr. Speaker, it was Ron Paul who started the Liberty Caucus, of which \nI am still a member. I will always remember very fondly when we met in \nhis office in the Cannon Building for lunch meetings. He would invite \nspeakers who were expert in everything from monetary policy to foreign \npolicy. We all got so much out of those Liberty Caucus meetings.\n  He helped me and many of my colleagues have a better understanding of \nmonetary policy, what are good policies and what are bad policies. Too \nmany times our leaders don't understand the impact and complexities of \nmonetary policy. Mr. Speaker, it is obvious, with our growing debt of \n$18.3 trillion, that our leadership in both parties should call on Ron \nPaul and ask his advice.\n  In my 20 years in Congress, I have not had a better friend than Ron \nPaul. I have always been able to count on Ron as both a personal and \nprofessional confidant.\n  In his many years as a ``citizen patriot,'' as his son United States \nSenator Rand Paul calls him, the cause of liberty has never had a \nbetter friend than Ron Paul. Ron is a great fighter for the \nConstitution; and even though he is out of public office, his fight is \njust as strong today as ever.\n  I'm sure many of my colleagues in the House would join me in wishing \na belated happy birthday to Ron Paul, my dear friend, and a friend of \nthe Constitution.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5984-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5984-H5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          U.S. FORESTRY BUDGET\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Thompson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this has been, once again, \na really catastrophic wildfire season. In fact, we saw the loss of \nlives of individuals who serve our country in the United States Forest \nService, and so we certainly keep them and their family members in our \nthoughts and prayers.\n  It is time that we address this issue in terms of the expansive fires \nthat we have seen. The administration has been very vocal for the need \nto provide more funding to combat more wildfires and also stop more \nfire-borrowing from the Forest Service budget. As a matter of fact, \nthere was a press release yesterday regarding the administration's \nletter to Congress addressing the budget issue.\n  I agree there needs to be a solution, but fixing the budget is not \nthe final solution. However, addressing the fire-borrowing will not \nsolve the problem alone.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 1995, fighting wildfires consumed one-sixth of the \nForest Service budget. In 2015, this August, it is consuming one-half, \n50 percent, of the Forest Service budget. We have to address, though, \nthe root cause of this problem, which is not just warmer temperatures, \nbut it is largely the fuel load, the fire load, from the lack of active \nmanagement, insufficient active management, in our national forests.\n  It is also very important that the Forest Service have the ability to \nexpediently treat national forest acres for forest health and wildfire \nprevention. The Agriculture Committee passed through the House H.R. \n2647. I was very proud to be a cosponsor of that bill and managed that \nbill on the floor. It passed with bipartisan support. This bill is \ncalled the Resilient Federal Forests Act of 2015. This legislation is \nan earnest attempt to give the Forest Service more authority and much-\nneeded flexibility to deal with these challenges of process, funding, \nlitigation, necessary timber harvesting, and much-needed active \nmanagement in our national forests.\n  Now, the Obama administration strongly opposes this legislation \ndespite, yesterday, in an Agriculture oversight hearing where we heard \nfrom the Under Secretary words like ``collaborative'' and the ``need \nfor expedited NEPA,'' which is a national environmental assessment. It \ndoesn't mean there is no assessment; it just does it in an efficient \nway. It provides what is necessary, not overregulation, providing more \ncategorical exclusions to NEPA. Those were all things the Under \nSecretary said that this administration is supportive of.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, those are all things in this bill, and yet the \nadministration, for whatever reason I have a hard time understanding, \nis opposed to this bill.\n  One of the solutions here, obviously, is to do good, active \ntimbering. I want to come back, Mr. Speaker, to those years, 1995, \nwhere one-sixth of the Forest Service budget was consumed for fighting \nwildfires--and that is a lot, one-sixth. That year, they generated 3.8 \nbillion board-feet of timber. That was the harvesting that took place. \nJust 7 years prior to that, we were harvesting 12.7 billion board-feet. \nThat was the high in recent decades, in 1987.\n  As you can imagine, when you are doing that much harvesting, you are \nreducing the fuel load. You are reducing the risk. Fire needs oxygen, \nit needs fuel, and it needs some type of energy to ignite it. If you \ntake away the fuel, any of those three triangles, as a long-time \nfirefighter, I can tell you that is how you prevent fires. Yet today, \nAugust 2015, where we are spending one-half of the Forest Service \nbudget, we are taking money out of timbering programs and multiuse \nprograms, they are only producing 2.4 billion board-feet from our \nforests.\n  Now, you look at what is the value of that? So you take the \ndifference between where we were at a high of 12.7 billion board-feet--\nand that wasn't at a sustainable rate; we were growing much more timber \nthan what we were cutting even in 1987--so that is a difference of 10.3 \nbillion board-feet.\n  How do we put an economic value on that? Well, if you just look at \nwhat the most recent average is for board-foot of timber harvested in \nnational forests, Mr. Speaker, and you calculate that difference, if we \nwould be harvesting and active timbering, active management the way we \nshould, just looking at that 1987 standard--which is well below what we \npotentially could be cutting--that is $169 billion in revenue coming \ninto the Treasury of the United States.\n  Our national forests are meant to be resources that provide for our \nNation. With $169 billion, do you know what, I think we would have the \nresources to fight the fires. But if we were truly timbering where we \nshould be, we wouldn't be having those fires.\n  The U.S. Forest Service did recently announce that it has already \nsurpassed its more than $1 billion budget for fighting wildfires and \nthat it will have to transfer an additional $450 million from programs \nwhich benefit national forests across the Nation. This is the eighth \ntime since 2002 that the service has had to transfer such funds because \nof wildfire costs. Such transfers take money directly out of timber \nharvesting and salvage logging, recreational activities, grants to \nStates, and even funding for fire suppression.\n  There is a better way to do things. I look forward to working with \nour Forest Service, and I encourage the Obama administration to support \nthat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with many of my colleagues that these wildfires \nshould be treated as natural disasters and the Forest Service needs \nbudget flexibility.\n  This is why I strongly support H.R. 167, the Wildfire Disaster \nFunding Act.\n  Avoiding these funding transfers, keeping funding where it belongs, \nand increasing our\n\n[[Page H5985]]\n\nharvest are critical first steps in getting our nation forests on \ntrack.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5985-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, over the last few years, I \nhave met with thousands of families of those with mental illness. Their \nnumber one concern is how the current system shuts them out.\n  Debbie and Chaz Mahoney lost their son Chuckie to suicide in 2002. \nAlthough Chuckie sought counseling from his college and showed signs of \nmental crisis, his parents knew nothing about his struggle. The Family \nEducational Rights and Privacy Act, also known as FERPA, kept Chuckie's \nparents in the dark.\n  The Mahoneys aren't alone. Each day, millions of families experience \nthe same tragic frustration. Schools will be sure to remind you when \nthe tuition check arrives, but because of FERPA, when it comes to your \nchild's mental health, you only receive a call when it is too, too \nlate.\n  This Suicide Prevention Month, Congress can fix this problem. The \nHelping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act allows doctors to provide \nlimited, but crucial, information concerning individuals with a serious \nmental illness to known caregivers. To save their lives and protect \ntheir rights to treatment, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 2646.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5985-7", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. HOYER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, we have only 7 legislative days left until \nanother unnecessary, costly, and entirely preventable government \nshutdown.\n  We need to negotiate an agreement to replace the sequester with a \nresponsible alternative. Because Republicans have refused to start \nthese negotiations, I have talked to Mrs. Lowey, the ranking member on \nthe Appropriations Committee, and I have talked to Mr. Van Hollen, the \nranking member on the Budget Committee, and I have talked to Mr. \nMcCarthy, but we have had no discussions on how to keep the government \nopen just 8 legislative days from now.\n  If the government were to shut down, as it did in 2013, it would cost \nour economy billions of dollars and put our national security at risk. \nHundreds of thousands of public service workers would be furloughed, \nand millions of people would be cut off from critical programs and \nservices.\n  Many Republicans are urging their leadership not to risk a shutdown. \nRepresentative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania said, ``I don't think we \nneed to do a replay of 2013. It would be an enormous tactical and \nstrategic blunder.'' Indiana Senator Dan Coats, a conservative \nRepublican, called a shutdown a failed tactic for political purposes \nthat is not going to succeed.\n  I urge my Republican colleagues to stop threatening a shutdown--not \nall of them, but some of them--and to, instead, take action to keep the \ngovernment open as we work to reach an agreement on a budget that \nreplaces the sequester and funds our Nation's priorities responsibly.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5985-8", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5985]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          NUCLEAR IRAN DEAL MERITS SENATE'S ``NUCLEAR'' OPTION\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas.

Last year, Planned Parenthood of the Heartland \nserved nearly 10,000 patients.\n  They conducted over 4,000 cervical and breast cancer screenings and \nover 13,000 tests for sexually transmitted infections. They provided \nprenatal care, pregnancy testing, and other preventive health services.\n  They are an active supporter of the national campaign to prevent teen \nand unplanned pregnancy, and they even have licensed adoption \nprofessionals on site to help women navigate the steps of adoption.\n  I am a strong believer that education regarding women's health \nprevents abortions. We must come together and work in a spirit of \nbipartisanship to avoid this government shutdown.\n\n[[Page H5986]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5986-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                    SACRED RIGHT--RELIGIOUS FREEDOM\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Coptic Christians--the largest \nreligious minority in Egypt and the largest Christian community in the \nMiddle East--are constantly persecuted.\n  In 2011, Ayman Nabil Labib went to school like he did every day. \nAyman, like most Coptic Christians in Egypt, had a cross tattooed on \nhis wrist as a sign of his Christian faith.\n  When he got to school, Ayman's Arabic language teacher asked him to \ncover the tattoo. Instead, Ayman pulled the cross from underneath his \nshirt and left it hanging around his neck.\n  The teacher became enraged. He choked Ayman and asked Ayman's Muslim \nclassmates: What are you going to do with him? Then his classmates beat \nhim to death to silence his faith.\n  Ayman was murdered because he was a Christian.\n  Religious freedom is a basic, sacred, universal human right. \nAlexander Hamilton said in 1775, ``The sacred rights of mankind . . . \nare written, as with a sun beam in the whole volume of human nature, by \nthe hand of the divinity itself; and can never be erased or obscured by \nmortal power.''\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5986-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, there are only 7 legislative days until the \nGOP shuts down this government again.\n  I have been back home. I don't know about you, but what I have heard \nis that the American people do not want to see another government \nshutdown. They don't want to see Planned Parenthood defunded, taking \naway essential health care for women across the country.\n  What they want to see is for us to work together. They want to see \nboth parties work together to keep the government open for sure, but to \ngo beyond that, to make sure that families can save to own a home, that \nthey can send their kids to college, that they can have something set \naside for retirement.\n  It is not just enough to keep the government open. That ought to be a \ngiven. We ought to take up the priorities of the American people.\n  Unfortunately, what we see is that, in an attempt to get something \nthat a minority of this body wants, they are going to hold up the \nentirety of the government--shut down the government--over one issue. \nThat is not responsible, and that is not what the American people sent \nus here to do.\n  House Democrats are ready to work together. We will compromise, but \nlet's negotiate. Let's have a discussion.\n  Let's talk to one another and come up with a budget that we can work \ntogether on and that we can present to the American people, and let's \nget back to the business the people sent us here to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5986-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5986]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           MANUFACTURING DAY\n\n  (Mr. BURGESS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. BURGESS.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize September as \nChildren's Cardiomyopathy Awareness Month.\n  Cardiomyopathy is a chronic disease of the heart muscle that \nincreases the risk of sudden cardiac arrest, which is a condition that \nclaims approximately 295,000 lives in the United States every year. It \nis also the leading cause of death among schoolchildren.\n  That is one reason I introduced the SAFE PLAY Act, which would \nimprove the health and safety of student athletes, including those who \nare diagnosed with cardiomyopathy.\n  We know that, when sudden cardiac arrest hits, quick intervention \nsaves lives. That is why the SAFE PLAY Act includes provisions to teach \nstudents across the country the life-saving skills of CPR and how to \nuse AEDs.\n  As we recognize Children's Cardiomyopathy Awareness Month, I want to \ninvite my colleagues and their staffs to the second annual AED Hunt on \nthe Hill, taking place tomorrow at 4 p.m. in the afternoon. There you \ncan learn more about cardiomyopathy, how AEDs save lives, and how the \nSAFE PLAY Act can help. Together, we can make a difference.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5986-6", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5986-H5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1415\n                    GOP SHUTDOWN/PLANNED PARENTHOOD\n\n  (Ms. ADAMS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. ADAMS. Mr. Speaker, once again, Republicans are threatening to \nshut down our government.\n  Instead of passing a sensible funding bill or a long-term \ntransportation bill that will create jobs, Republicans have chosen to \nput jobs at risk. They have chosen to weaken security at our airports. \nThey have chosen to close our national parks. They pretty much have \nchosen not to serve their constituents back home.\n  And it is for what reason? It is because they are so determined to \nregulate women's bodies and block women's right to access preventive \nand lifesaving health care that they would rather throw Americans under \nthe bus.\n  Last year alone, in my State of North Carolina, Planned Parenthood \nserved more than 31,000 patients, providing mammograms, pap smears, \ncancer screenings, contraceptive services, and STD testing.\n  Why would we want to deny women, many who are low income, of these\n\n[[Page H5987]]\n\nnecessary health benefits? Women's access to health care has always \nbeen important to me, and that is why I am a consistent advocate for \nthe work that Planned Parenthood does.\n  More importantly, I refuse to put jobs and our country's safety at \nrisk over partisan grandstanding. Only 7 days left--it is time to do \nwhat we were sent here to do and end this senseless shutdown talk.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5987-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H5987]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            GOP DYSFUNCTION\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 23, the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act \nReauthorization of 2015, reauthorizes the activities of the National \nWindstorm Impact Reduction Program through fiscal year 2017.\n\n[[Page H5989]]\n\n  Representative Randy Neugebauer, my Texas colleague, has championed \nthis program for over a decade. In the 113th Congress, he and \nRepresentative Frederica Wilson's bipartisan efforts helped move this \nlegislation through the Science Committee and to successfully pass the \nHouse.\n  It is because of their past work that we were able to bring this bill \nto the House floor on January 7, the second day of business in the \n114th Congress, this Congress. The bill overwhelmingly passed the House \n381-39.\n  Today, we consider the Senate amendment to H.R. 23. Thanks to \nleadership of my colleague on the other side of the Capitol, Senator \nJohn Thune, an amended version of H.R. 23 passed the Senate Commerce, \nScience, and Transportation Committee in June. It then passed the \nSenate by unanimous consent in July.\n  The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program supports Federal \nresearch and development efforts to help mitigate the loss of life and \nproperty due to wind-related hazards.\n  Millions of Americans live in areas vulnerable to hurricanes, \ntornados, and other windstorms. The National Weather Service reported \njust over 100 deaths and over 900 injuries last year due to tornados \nand other windstorms.\n  In Texas, we are all too familiar with the harm that strong wind can \ncause. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration's storm prediction center, 128 tornados and 1,366 \nwindstorms were reported just in Texas in the last 2 years. The effects \nof these disasters can be felt for a long time.\n  Initially established in 2004, the National Windstorm Impact \nReduction Program supports activities to improve our understanding of \nwindstorms and their impacts and helps to develop and encourage the \nimplementation of cost-effective mitigation measures. H.R. 23 \nestablishes the National Institute of Standards and Technology as the \nlead agency for the program.\n  The bill also improves coordination of interagency activities in a \nfiscally responsible manner. It expands transparency for how much money \nis being spent on windstorm research at the four participating \nagencies, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the \nNational Science Foundation, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric \nAdministration, and FEMA. It authorizes $21.4 million for this \ninteragency research.\n  The Senate amendment provides some flexibility to the advisory \ncommittee on windstorm impact reduction when it provides \nrecommendations in its report. It also ensures that northeasters are \nincluded in the definition of windstorm and makes a few other minor \nconforming and technical changes.\n  Again, I want to thank Representative Neugebauer for his continued \nefforts in support of this program. I encourage my colleagues to \nsupport the bill and to send it to the President's desk for his \nautograph.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 23, legislation that \nreauthorizes the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program, or NWIRP.\n  America faces significant exposure to windstorms. We saw that, \nindeed, in 2012 when Superstorm Sandy devastated parts of the \nNortheast. Superstorm Sandy was responsible for over 200 deaths and \ncaused over $70 billion in damage.\n  According to the National Weather Service, from 2005 to 2014, \nthousands of Americans lost their lives from the impacts of windstorms. \nAlong with the loss of life, windstorms caused many billions of dollars \nin property and crop damage during that time.\n  When windstorms occur, we must work to save lives and reduce the \namount of property and crop damage that the windstorm or other natural \ndisaster causes. We already are investing significant resources after a \nwindstorm, but we should be investing more in preparedness.\n  FEMA's predisaster mitigation program has demonstrated that every \ndollar invested in mitigation activities saves $3 to $4 in recovery \ncosts.\n  The National Windstorm Impact Reduction Act Reauthorization of 2015 \nis largely a mitigation program. The bill reauthorizes the NWIRP \nprogram that directs NIST, NSF, NOAA, and FEMA to support coordinated \nactivities to improve our understanding of windstorms and their impacts \nand to develop cost-effective mitigation measures.\n  This program has the potential to lessen the loss of life and \neconomic damage of windstorms by supporting research and helping to \ntranslate that research into more effective building codes and \nmitigation programs, but this program needs robust investment to \nachieve that result.\n  Unfortunately, this bill includes a lower total authorization level \nthan was authorized for this program in fiscal year 2008.\n  We have the responsibility, I believe, to assist our constituents \nafter a natural disaster occurs, but we also have the responsibility to \nproperly support mitigation programs that could reduce the loss of life \nand property damage caused by the next natural disaster.\n  Nevertheless, this is an important program that needs \nreauthorization, and I, today, support its passage.\n  I want to thank the members of the Science, Space and Technology \nCommittee, including Chair Smith, Ranking Member Johnson, and \nRepresentative Neugebauer, for their hard work on this bill.\n  I want to thank the members of the Senate Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation Committee for their hard work as well. It is nice to see \nmy colleagues here in the House of Representatives and over in the \nSenate working in a bipartisan, bicameral manner to bring this bill to \nthe floor today.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this bill, \nand I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, first of all, I would like to thank \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), a member of the Science \nCommittee, for his comments and for supporting this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Lubbock, Texas (Mr. Neugebauer), a Texas colleague. I want to \nthank him for sponsoring this piece of legislation and look forward to \nits passage today and to its being enacted into law as well.\n  Mr. NEUGEBAUER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support today for my bill, the \nNational Windstorm Impact Reduction Act, or NWIRP.\n  As I said, I want to thank Chairman Smith. I also want to thank \nSenator John Thune of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science, and \nTransportation, who helped shepherd this bill through the Senate.\n  The United States averages almost 1,300 recorded tornados every year, \ncausing over 70 deaths and 1,500 injuries. These storms cost about $400 \nmillion in damage each year, but particularly in a bad year, like 2011, \nwind damage from tornadoes and thunderstorms cost more than $28 \nbillion. This is a natural and a national disaster.\n  When a family loses their home in a windstorm, they don't just have \nto rebuild their house; they have to rebuild their lives as well, and \nwe can help these families, and we can help save their lives and, in \nmany cases, help save their property through the important research \nthat is going on at many universities around the country, including my \nalma mater, Texas Tech University.\n  With those families in mind, I introduced NWIRP. NWIRP promotes \nresearch that helps saves lives, reduce injuries, and lessens damage \nfrom windstorms.\n  As was mentioned by my colleague from New York, we have found that $1 \nin investments in the resilience against windstorms can result in $4 in \nsavings in a disaster response. Not only are we investing dollars to \nmake America safer, but we are also saving the taxpayers in the long \nrun.\n  Upon passage, this bill will move to the President's desk to be \nsigned into law, and I think it is important that we get this bill \npassed as quickly as we can because, again, windstorms can cause a lot \nof damage and can cause the loss of life.\n  The more we understand about the dynamics of these windstorms and \nunderstanding how they interface with different types of building \nmaterials, the safer and better structures that we are able to build \nand ultimately, in many cases, save lives.\n  A lot of important research has been going on. One of the things I \nlike about\n\n[[Page H5990]]\n\nthis particular piece of legislation is that it brings some \naccountability in making sure that we are investing the dollars in the \nplaces where we are getting the most bang for the buck for the American \ntaxpayers.\n  Not only are we looking out for the taxpayers in this bill, but we \nare also looking out for the people, the men and women, that are \naffected by these windstorms. I encourage my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must help our constituents prepare for and mitigate \nthe impacts of windstorms that threaten lives and property. This bill \nreauthorizes a program that would do just that, and I urge its \nadoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I have no other requests from \nMembers to speak on this piece of legislation, so I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nH.R. 23, legislation that would reauthorize the National Windstorm \nImpact Reduction Program--or NWIRP.\n  The last few years have been devastating years for natural disasters \nacross the country. For example, in May, the Great Plains had a six-day \noutbreak of tornado activity that affected areas ranging from Colorado \nto Texas and resulted in over 60 injuries and 5 fatalities.\n  H.R. 23 directs NIST, NSF, NOAA, and FEMA to support activities to \nimprove the understanding of windstorms and their impacts. We can use \nthat knowledge to reduce the vulnerability of our communities to \nnatural disasters. The NWIRP program helps our federal agencies and \ncommunities across the nation to develop and implement many measures \nthat help minimize the loss of life and property during windstorms and \nto rebuild effectively and safely after such storms.\n  I was pleased that when this bill was considered by the House \nScience, Space, and Technology Committee, we worked in a bipartisan \nmanner and made several improvements to the bill. We worked together to \nincrease the authorization for FEMA, the agency tasked with \nimplementing the research conducted by the other NWIRP agencies. Also, \nwe added several social science-related provisions to the bill. We \ncannot design effective disaster preparation strategies without \nunderstanding how people make decisions and respond to disaster \nwarnings.\n  The House of Representatives passed H.R. 23 at the end of January \nwith a vote of 381-39 and sent it to the Senate. During their \nconsideration, the Senate made minor changes to the bill, but I am \nhappy to report that all of the bipartisan improvements we made to the \nbill remain in H.R. 23.\n  I want to thank my fellow Texans--Chairman Smith and Mr. Neugebauer--\nfor working across the aisle on this bill. I also want to thank the \nCommerce, Science, and Transportation Committee in the Senate for their \nwork on this bill.\n  This is an important program that needs to be reauthorized. It is \ngood to see Members of the House and Senate coming together, working \nout their differences, compromising, and ending up with a bill with \nbipartisan, bicameral support.\n  I support the bill and urge my colleagues to support this important \nbill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Smith) that the House suspend the rules and \nconcur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 23.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5990-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5990-H5993]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             GERARDO HERNANDEZ AIRPORT SECURITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. KATKO.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) and the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) each \nwill control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New York?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today, Mr. Speaker, in strong support of H.R. 720, the Gerardo \nHernandez Airport Security Act of 2015.\n  This critically important piece of legislation is the product of a \nstrong bipartisan effort stemming from the fatal shooting at Los \nAngeles International Airport on November 1, 2013. On that tragic day, \nTSA Officer Gerardo Hernandez was shot and killed by an active shooter, \nbecoming the first Transportation Security Administration employee to \nbe killed in the line of duty. Two other Transportation Security \nAdministration officers and a passenger were also injured during the \nattack.\n  In the wake of that attack, Congressman Richard Hudson, who was then \nserving as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nSubcommittee on Transportation Security, spearheaded a bipartisan \neffort to investigate the vulnerabilities highlighted by the attack and \nenhance the state of airport security across the United States.\n  One of my first acts as chairman of the subcommittee in the 114th \nCongress was to work with Mr. Hudson and reintroduce this important \nlegislation, and I am pleased to see it through to final passage today.\n  This bill builds on important steps taken by TSA and airports across \nthe country and was developed with input from both public and private \nsector partners. The legislation makes important strides in enhancing \nthe level of preparedness of our Nation's transportation systems in \nresponding and mitigating security incidents, such as active shooters \nand terror attacks.\n  For example, it requires TSA to verify that airports and high-risk \nsurface transportation hubs have plans in place to effectively train \nfor and respond to security incidents when they occur.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  Further, it will ensure that emergency communications equipment is \nregularly tested and that emergency first responders are able to \ncommunicate with each other and the public during a major security \nincident. The legislation also directs TSA to seek ways in which \nfunding for reimbursable agreements to airport law enforcement can be \nincreased in order to provide better support to the critical layer of \nsecurity they provide.\n  Developing this preparedness will go a long way in improving the \nresponse to threats to public safety and will work to overcome the \nchallenges experienced by law enforcement, emergency first responders, \nTSA, and the public during the LAX shooting.\n  Just last week, the need for efficient and effective communications \nwas highlighted during a stabbing and shooting incident at Union \nStation here in Washington, D.C., in which law enforcement from \nmultiple agencies responded to mitigate the situation.\n  We must ensure that our frontline employees and first responders are \nequipped with the necessary tools and training to respond to these \ntypes of incidents in order to protect both themselves and the general \npublic.\n  I wish to extend a sincere thanks to Congressman Hudson for his work \non this legislation as well as to the chairman of the full committee, \nMr. McCaul of Texas, for his support. Additionally, I would like to \nthank Ranking Member Thompson, Ranking Member Rice, and the other \nbipartisan cosponsors for their work in getting this legislation to the \nfinish line. I would also like to extend gratitude to our colleagues in \nthe Senate, especially Chairman Thune and Ranking Member Nelson, for \nfurther refining the legislation and moving it through the Senate.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 720, the \nGerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015, a bill that I am \npleased to cosponsor.\n  The November 2013 shooting at the Los Angeles International Airport \nresulted in the death of Transportation Security Officer Gerardo \nHernandez. This terrible incident brought into focus the heroism of \nthose who serve on the front lines of aviation security--Transportation \nSecurity officers. Unarmed and exposed, Transportation Security \nofficers perform the often thankless task of screening 1.8 million \npassengers per day, even though they have limited workplace protections \nand are charged with great responsibility.\n  In March of 2014, I traveled with my committee's Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security to conduct a site visit and oversight hearing \nat Los Angeles International Airport to explore what lessons could be \nlearned from the tragic events of the shooting. Through this valuable \noversight work, we learned that there was much to be done to address \ngaps and vulnerabilities within airports. We found that vital \nequipment, such as panic buttons at the checkpoints, were not in \nworking order. We also found that there were other factors that could \nbe bolstered to aid during active shooter situations, such as \ninteroperable communications, so that every emergency responder would \nhave access to realtime information.\n  The legislation under consideration today is the product of a \nbipartisan effort to remedy many of the deficiencies identified \nfollowing the shooting.\n  Before yielding back, I would like to once again give my condolences \nto the family of Officer Hernandez and to remind Members that, under \ncurrent law, TSO's families do not receive death benefits.\n  Currently, Transportation Security officers do not meet the \ndefinition for a public safety officer; and as a result, the families \nof TSOs who are killed in the line of duty, such as the Hernandez \nfamily, are not entitled to funds from the Public Safety Officers' \nBenefits Programs.\n  Last Congress, the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Brownley) \nintroduced legislation that would grant Transportation Security \nofficers the benefits of other law enforcement officers that are killed \nin the line of duty; and she plans to reintroduce that legislation, the \nHonoring Our Fallen TSA Officers Act, today.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in supporting this forthcoming \nlegislation\n\n[[Page H5992]]\n\nso that the families of the men and women on the front lines of \nprotecting our aviation sector are properly compensated if tragedy \nstrikes. Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the Senate amendment to H.R. \n720.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ndistinguished gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Hudson).\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 720, the \nGerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015.\n  As the former chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nSubcommittee on Transportation Security, I introduced this bipartisan \nbill in the 113th Congress to improve the state of preparedness at our \nNation's airports in response to the shooting at Los Angeles \nInternational Airport in November of 2013.\n  I would like to thank Ranking Member Thompson for working with me in \na bipartisan way. We traveled together for the field hearing and toured \nthe site. And I think the work that he does in a bipartisan way on this \ncommittee is a true testament to what the American people expect us to \ndo here, which is to work together and put the people's business first. \nIt was a pleasure working with the ranking member.\n  I also want to thank Chairman McCaul for his strong leadership of \nthis committee. He also worked very closely with me on this legislation \nand traveled with us that day to Los Angeles. So without his support, \nthis would not have been possible.\n  That event, which tragically took the life of Transportation Security \nOfficer Gerardo Hernandez and wounded three other people, served as an \nunfortunate wake-up call to the gaps in our security and the relative \nease to which someone could wreak havoc on one of our Nation's \nairports.\n  After months and months of careful review and hard work, including \nthe site visit I mentioned to LAX, the subcommittee found that while \nState, Federal, and local law enforcement's response to the LAX \nshooting could be described as nothing but heroic and was swiftly \nexecuted, there was room for improvement in the coordinated response \nand communications in the critical moments after the major security \nincident. That is where this important, bipartisan bill stems from.\n  And I know, as chairman of the subcommittee, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Katko) has taken our work from the last Congress and has \nbuilt upon it. He has done the hard work to make sure that it reached \nthe finish line. I take my hat off to Chairman Katko for showing great \nleadership and the kind of fortitude and determination necessary to \nadvance this legislation, to finally get it to the Senate, and to have \nthe President sign it into law.\n  Serving as chairman of the House committee that oversees \ntransportation security is no easy task, but it is one that the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) has excelled at. He is not afraid \nto ask tough questions. He holds folks accountable, and he has worked \ndiligently to improve aviation security in this Nation.\n\n  The bottom line is, while TSA has taken positive measures to update \nthe emergency response protocols since the LAX incident, this bill will \nhelp to solidify these changes and ensure our airports are fully \nprepared to respond to future security incidents and potential acts of \nterrorism. This bill will provide for more extensive collaboration and \ncoordination between airports, law enforcement, first responders, and \nTSA, which will result in safer airports across the country. It is a \nnecessary step towards countering the threats facing our Nation's \nairports without placing an undue burden on airport operators, law \nenforcement, and the taxpayers.\n  The shooting at LAX was a tragedy that will never be forgotten by \nthose affected and those of us who are committed to protecting the \ntraveling public.\n  My thoughts today and my prayers continue to be with the family of \nOfficer Hernandez. I hope that they are watching today, and I hope they \nare proud of the work of this Congress.\n  I want to thank, again, Chairman Katko for his work to keep the \ntraveling public safe, and I applaud him for stepping up on such an \nimportant issue and ensuring this bill reaches the President's desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to honor the memory of Transportation Security \nOfficer Hernandez and to support this legislation.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I would like to \nthank Subcommittee Chairman Katko and Ranking Member Rice for their \nefforts on this legislation.\n  Through our votes today, we are honoring the life of Officer \nHernandez and ensuring that Transportation Security officers, airport \nworkers, and members of the flying public are more safe and secure.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support \nthe Senate amendment to this bill as well as the Honoring Our Fallen \nTSA Officers Act.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I once again urge my colleagues to support H.R. 720. The \ntragic event that unfolded at LAX in November of 2013 was a stark \nreminder that much remains to be done in securing America's transit \nhubs, particularly the nonsterile or nonsecure areas of airports that \nare, in many ways, just like open shopping malls. Because of this \nreality, we must react to ensure that airport communities are prepared \nto respond swiftly to any major security incidents that threaten the \nsafety of the traveling public.\n  In remembrance of TSA Officer Hernandez, I urge my colleagues to pass \nthis important legislation.\n  Before I close, Mr. Speaker, I do want to recognize and echo the \nsentiments of my colleague, the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. \nHudson) with respect to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson): \nHe set a tone of bipartisanship in the committee; and because of that, \nin the Committee on Homeland Security, itself, as well as the \nsubcommittee, much good work is being done and many bills are being \npassed. So I appreciate and acknowledge the bipartisanship because it \nis important. It is an art that all too often gets lost in this \nCongress, and we are doing well with it in our committee.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, as Chairman of the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity, it is with great pride that I rise in support of H.R. 720, \nthe Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015. The passage of this \nbipartisan legislation demonstrates the importance with which the \nCommittee on Homeland Security considers the security of our nation's \nairports and transit hubs. Moreover, this legislation shows Congress' \ndedication to the men and women of the TSA, who work diligently each \nday to keep the American people safe.\n  In order to mitigate threats from those with malicious intent seeking \nto wreak havoc on our critical transportation systems, we must stand \ntogether. Our law enforcement and first responder community must \ncommunicate, collaborate and coordinate, so they are better prepared to \nexecute emergency plans in response to all types of security incidents. \nI believe the passage of this bill creates a roadmap that will provide \nour first responders and TSA with the proper level of coordination to \nrespond to incidents like the senseless shooting that took place at Los \nAngeles International Airport on November 1, 2013.\n  After the shooting, I travelled with other Members of the Committee, \nincluding Ranking Member Thompson, to Los Angeles to meet with first \nresponders, TSA officials, airport personnel, as well as the injured \nTransportation Security Officers who bravely put themselves in harm's \nway to help an elderly passenger. I also had the somber opportunity to \nmeet with the widow of Officer Hernandez, before holding a field \nhearing to examine what could be done to mitigate such tragedies in the \nfuture. Today, I am proud to see this Committee's efforts set to cross \nthe finish line, and I hope that the wife of Officer Hernandez can find \nsome solace in the passage of this legislation, which bears her \nhusband's name.\n  The legislation will direct TSA to conduct necessary outreach to \nairports and transit hubs across the United States to ensure that there \nare adequate security incident response and communications plans in \nplace. Moreover, H.R. 720 establishes TSA as a clearinghouse of best-\npractices for transportation sector preparedness and incident response, \nwhich will streamline the proliferation of information and \ncommunication across transportation systems in the United States. This \nbill also looks for ways to overcome interoperable communications \nchallenges and increase funding for airport law enforcement, while also \nensuring that airport personnel are equipped with training on how to \nresponse to active shooters and other security incidents, such as \nterrorism.\n\n[[Page H5993]]\n\n  It is my pleasure to commend the Chairman of the Subcommittee on \nTransportation Security, Mr. Katko and former Chairman of the \nSubcommittee, Mr. Hudson, for their efforts in addressing this issue, \nas well as, working to foster bipartisan cooperation. I also wish to \ncommend the bipartisan efforts of both the Ranking Member of the Full \nCommittee, Mr. Thompson, and the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee, \nMs. Rice, whose support of this legislation is greatly appreciated. \nAdditionally, I would like to thank the other bipartisan cosponsors of \nthis legislation, as well as Chairman Thune and our Senate colleagues \nfor moving this important bill through the Senate. I urge my colleagues \nto support the final passage of H.R. 720 and strengthen the security of \nU.S. transportation.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 720, \nThe Gerardo Hernandez Airport Security Act of 2015, which improves \nintergovernmental planning and communication during security incidents \nat domestic airports.\n  As a former chair and ranking member of the Homeland Security \nCommittee Transportation Security Subcommittee, I understand how \nimportant this bill will be in enhancing safety and protection in the \nair transit industry, not just for our citizens but for our \nTransportation Security Officers working in the line of duty.\n  This legislation, which requires the Transportation Security \nAdministration (TSA) to devote more resources for planning and \ncommunication during and in case of threats or emergencies, is prompted \nby the tragic death of Gerardo I. Hernandez, a Transportation Security \nOfficer who was killed in the line of duty at Los Angeles International \nAirport on November 1, 2013.\n  In a senseless act of violence, the love and care TSA Officer Gerardo \nIsmael Hernandez gave to his wife, Ana Machuca, his 14-year-old son and \n12-year-old daughter, and the community he served, ended entirely too \nsoon.\n  Mr. Speaker, Gerardo Hernandez was what we want in an American, he is \nin spirit and deed the type of person we want in our Transportation \nSecurity Officers (TSOs).\n  At just 39 years old, Gerardo Hernandez was the first TSA officer to \nlose his life in the line of duty in the 12-year history of the agency.\n  He died from several gunshot wounds inflicted by an assailant while \non duty at the Los Angeles International Airport.\n  Gerardo Hernandez was among those thousands of TSA employees carrying \nout their mission to keep the airways safe for traveling citizens, and \ntheir work across the nation cannot be understated.\n  On average, TSA officers screen 1.7 million air passengers at more \nthan 450 airports across the nation, which averaged over 637.5 million \npassengers in 2012.\n  In 2014, the TSA screened more than 653 million passengers, or nearly \n1.8 million persons per day.\n  The Bush International and the William P. Hobby Airports that serve \nthe Houston metropolitan area are essential hubs for domestic and \ninternational air travel for Houston and the region:\n  Nearly 40 million passengers traveled through Bush International \nAirport (IAH) and an additional 10 million traveled through William P. \nHobby (HOU).\n  More than 650 daily departures occur at IAH.\n  IAH is the 11th busiest airport in the U.S. for total passenger \ntraffic.\n  IAH has 12 all-cargo airlines handling more than 419,205 metric tons \nof cargo in 2012.\n  The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates the implementation of \nH.R. 720 would cost about $2.5 million in 2015. Of the $2.5 million, an \nestimated $1.5 million would serve to provide additional technical \nassistance to airports, and the remaining $1 million would be used to \nevaluate the interoperability of communication systems used by \nemergency response teams.\n  Mr. Speaker, this month marked the 14th anniversary of the tragedy of \nthe 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n  We will never forget how that day changed our lives, and the lives of \nevery American generation to follow.\n  Security measures in airports across the country have been enhanced \ndramatically, and the resulting inconvenience is a small price to pay \nfor the protective measures needed to keep the travelling public safe.\n  It is people like Gerardo Hernandez who do their best to make the \nnecessary screening as least intrusive and burdensome as possible, \nconsistent with the mission of ensuring the security of all members of \nthe flying public.\n  TSA officers willingly risk their lives to make sure the job gets \ndone, and for that we owe these men and women a debt of gratitude.\n  In honor of Gerardo Hernandez's contribution to his country, I \nstrongly support this bill and urge all my colleagues to join me in \nvoting for its passage.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Katko) that the House suspend the rules \nand concur in the Senate amendment to the bill, H.R. 720.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the Senate amendment was concurred in.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5993-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5993-H5994]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             MIAMI TRIBE OF OKLAHOMA LAND LEASE OR TRANSFER\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 487) to allow the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to lease or \ntransfer certain lands.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                                H.R. 487\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED TO VALIDATE LAND \n                   TRANSACTIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, without further approval, ratification, or authorization \n     by the United States, the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma may lease, \n     sell, convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any part \n     of its interests in any real property that is not held in \n     trust by the United States for the benefit of such tribe.\n       (b) Trust Land Not Affected.--Nothing in this section \n     shall--\n       (1) authorize the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to lease, sell, \n     convey, warrant, or otherwise transfer all or any part of an \n     interest in any real property that is held in trust by the \n     United States for the benefit of such tribe; or\n       (2) affect the operation of any law governing leasing, \n     selling, conveying, warranting, or otherwise transferring any \n     interest in such trust land.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nDingell) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 days to revise and extend their remarks and include \nextraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 487 is a noncontroversial, one-page bill that would \nexempt lands held in fee by the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma from the \nlimitations imposed by the Indian Nonintercourse Act. According to the \ntribe, these limitations may hinder economic development.\n  Specifically, H.R. 487 would allow the tribe to lease, sell, convey, \nwarrant, or transfer all or any portion of interest in any real \nproperty not held in trust for the tribe. The bill also states that the \nlegislation does not authorize the tribe to lease, sell, convey, \nwarrant, or otherwise transfer all or any portion of any interest in \nany real property that is held in trust.\n  In accordance with the expressed wishes of the tribe's leadership, \nCongressman Markwayne Mullin, who represents the tribe in the House, \nsponsored H.R. 487. The Department of the Interior supports this bill, \nwhich passed the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous consent \nearlier this year.\n  I commend my colleague from Oklahoma for his hard work, and I urge my \ncolleagues to pass the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 487 will allow the Miami Tribe of Oklahoma to effectively manage \ntheir nontrust lands by providing relief from the Indian Nonintercourse \nAct. The Indian Nonintercourse Act was intended to protect Indian \ntribes by preventing the loss of their lands, except by treaty. \nHistorically, the act has generally not interfered with the tribe's \nability to buy, sell, or lease land that it owns in fee simple.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  But uncertainties raised by the act can be a hindrance when securing \npurchase agreements from outside parties.\n  Therefore, relief from the act is at times necessary for a tribe to \nsuccessfully manage their lands and to sell fee\n\n[[Page H5994]]\n\nparcels that are determined to be in excess of the tribe's needs or \nwere purchased for investment purposes.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 487 would simply allow the Miami Tribe to convey \nall the land that the tribe holds in fee simple without further Federal \napproval to facilitate those future transactions. I agree with the \ngoals of this legislation, and I ask my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he \nmay consume to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin), the author of \nthis measure.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, thank you for allowing us to bring this to \nthe floor. This is one of those commonsense bills that, unfortunately, \nrequires Congress to act. Several tribes before us have obtained \nlegislation like this from Congress to authorize them to sell or \nmortgage specific lands. The lands we are talking about are lands that \naren't needed anymore; it is outside of the trust. But in order for the \ntribes such as the Miami and other tribes that are out there to \neffectively manage their lands, Congress is required to act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairmen Bishop and Young for \nadvancing this legislation, and I urge support for the passage of H.R. \n487.\n  Mrs. DINGELL.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 959 authorizes a special resource study to be \nconducted by the Department of the Interior on the home of the late \ncivil rights activist Medgar Evers. This bill requires the Secretary to \ndetermine the national significance of the home and the feasibility of \ndesignating the site as a unit of the National Park Service.\n  The National Park Service does not have any objections to this bill, \nand it was reported out of the Natural Resources Committee by unanimous \nconsent. Once results of the study are available, Congress would have \nto act to create any new unit of the National Park system.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, 52 years ago, on June 12, 1963, Medgar Evers, a native \nMississippian and the first field officer in that State for the \nNational Association for the Advancement of Colored People, which we \nhave come to know as the NAACP, was shot in the driveway of his home in \nJackson, Mississippi. This horrific event occurred hours after \nPresident Kennedy made a televised speech in support of civil rights. \nThis was a critical moment in the modern civil rights movement as it \nmoved towards the seminal March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom.\n  Evers was a World War II veteran, fighting in the Battle of Normandy. \nHe returned home to find his path to the voting booth literally blocked \nat gunpoint. He personally fought to integrate the University of \nMississippi Law School and was integral in assisting James Meredith \nsuccessfully enroll as an undergraduate.\n  Evers was an activist, an organizer, a loving father, a husband, and, \nfinally, a martyr. He is a true American hero whose time came too soon, \nyet his name and what he stood for continues to inspire so many. It is \ntime that his service and loss be properly recognized by our Nation.\n  H.R. 959, the Medgar Evers House Study Act, would authorize the \nSecretary of the Interior to conduct a special resource study of the \nMedgar Evers House in Jackson, Mississippi, for potential inclusion in \nthe National Park system. We estimate that this study will cost \napproximately $200,000 to $300,000. Funding for this proposed study \nwould need to be allocated from the set amount of funding that Congress \nappropriates for all special resource studies.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend and colleague, Congressman \nBennie Thompson of Mississippi, for his very hard work on this \nlegislation and for his leadership on this critical issue. The Medgar \nEvers House is a piece of American history that must be preserved, \nwhich is why this legislation is so important.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support the adoption of H.R. \n959.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Mississippi \n(Mr. Thompson).\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman \nfrom Michigan for yielding me the necessary time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to urge our colleagues to support H.R. 959, \nthe Medgar Evers House Study Act.\n  Medgar Wiley Evers was born in the small town of Decatur, \nMississippi, in 1925. Medgar would go on to serve in our country's Army \nin France and in\n\n[[Page H5995]]\n\nGermany during World War II. After his military service, Medgar \nattended Alcorn State University, where he would meet his future wife, \nMyrlie.\n  After graduating from Alcorn, Medgar devoted his life to seeking \njustice and equality for all Americans. As field secretary for the \nNAACP in Mississippi, Mr. Evers led successful voter registration \nefforts throughout the State. He applied for admission to the \nUniversity of Mississippi Law School in an unsuccessful effort to \ndesegregate the university. Medgar also courageously led investigations \ninto the death of Emmett Till and publicly supported Clyde Kennard \nafter his imprisonment on erroneous charges stemming from his efforts \nto integrate the University of Southern Mississippi.\n  On June 12, 1963, as he returned home from a NAACP planning meeting, \nMedgar was shot in the back in the driveway of his home while his \nfamily was inside the house. He died at a local hospital less than an \nhour later. One week after his death, he was buried with full military \nhonors at Arlington National Cemetery.\n  Today, the Medgar Evers House has been preserved as a museum by \nTougaloo College. The home has been refurbished to appear as it did at \nthe time of Evers' death. The home contains an exhibit regarding Evers' \nfamily, career, death, and his legacy. The home has hosted scores of \nvisitors including many Members of Congress who participated in the \nFaith & Politics pilgrimages throughout the South.\n  My bill, H.R. 959, the Medgar Evers House Study Act, authorizes a \nspecial resource study by the Secretary of the Interior on the home in \nwhich his family lived and Medgar Evers was assassinated located at \n2332 Margaret Walker Alexander Drive in Jackson, Mississippi. The study \nwill determine the national significance of the Evers home and \ndetermine the feasibility of designating the site as a unit of the \nNational Park system.\n  Mr. Speaker, Medgar Evers was a civil rights giant. He dedicated his \nlife to bringing down the pillars that maintained Jim Crow in \nMississippi. The heroic life he lived and the remarkable legacy that he \nleft are unquestioned. Today's bill will further cement the role that \nhe played in advancing civil and human rights in our Nation. With that, \nI urge my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 959.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all Members to support \nH.R. 959.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, Medgar Evers was a patriot and a civil \nrights leader who gave his life to realize the full promise of the \nAmerican Declaration of Independence. His memory is vivid and revered \nby every American of goodwill who lived through those momentous years. \nIt is for us now to preserve his memory for the many generations of \nAmericans to follow who will have to look to history to know him.\n  This bill is a step toward recognizing the enormous debt our Nation \nowes him and to ensure that future generations can draw inspiration \nfrom his leadership, his patriotism, his courage, and his sacrifice \nthat he made in the cause of freedom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The management\n\n[[Page H5996]]\n\nof these isolated and encumbered parcels takes considerable resources \naway from the core mission of the Forest Service. Proceeds from the \nsale of these parcels would be deposited into a Sisk Act fund and may \nbe used for deferred maintenance, acquisition of lands for \nadministrative sites or recreational access, or to reimburse the Forest \nService for administrative costs in preparing the sales.\n  The U.S. Forest Service has a challenging mission. Enabling it to \ndevelop a more manageable land base is simply good government, which is \nwhy this bill has such broad-based support.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Conaway of the Agriculture Committee \nfor his assistance in expediting this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Natural Resources,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2015.\n     Hon.

The bill was referred primarily \n     to the Committee on Natural Resources, with an additional \n     referral to the Committee on Agriculture.\n       I ask that you allow the Committee on Agriculture to be \n     discharged from further consideration of the bill so that it \n     may be scheduled by the Majority Leader. This discharge in no \n     way affects your jurisdiction over the subject matter of the \n     bill, and it will not serve as precedent for future \n     referrals. In addition, should a conference oh the bill be \n     necessary, I would support your request to have the Committee \n     on Agriculture represented on the conference committee. \n     Finally, I would be pleased to include this letter and any \n     response in the bill report filed by the Committee on Natural \n     Resources to memorialize our understanding.\n       Thank you for your consideration of my request, and for \n     your continued strong cooperation between our committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                     Committee on Agriculture,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, June 5, 2015.\n     Hon. Rob Bishop,\n     Chairman, Committee on Natural Resources,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing concerning H.R. 1214, the \n     National Forest Small Tracts Act Amendments Act of 2015. It \n     is my understanding that, on April 30, 2015, the Committee on \n     Natural Resources ordered the bill reported without amendment \n     and by unanimous consent.\n       This legislation contains provisions within the Committee \n     on Agriculture's Rule X jurisdiction. As a result of your \n     having consulted with the Committee and in order to expedite \n     this bill for floor consideration, the Committee on \n     Agriculture will forego action on the bill. This is being \n     done on the basis of our mutual undemanding that doing so \n     will in no way diminish or alter the jurisdiction of the \n     Committee on Agriculture with respect to the appointment of \n     conferees, or to any future jurisdictional claim over the \n     subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation.\n       I would appreciate your response to this letter confirming \n     this understanding, and would request that you include a copy \n     of this letter and your response in the Committee Report and \n     in the Congressional Record during the floor consideration of \n     this bill. Thank you in advance for your cooperation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                               K. Michael Conaway,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1214 amends the Small Tracts Act to provide the \nForest Service with more flexibility to sell or exchange small parcels \nof national forest land. This increased flexibility will allow the \nForest Service to identify opportunities where the sale or exchange of \nsmall parcels of land will increase efficiency and improve the overall \nintegrity and health of our national forests.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Amodei, the sponsor of this \nlegislation, for working with the Forest Service to update this bill so \nthat it could be supported by both sides of the aisle.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support adoption of H.R. 1214.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Nevada (Mr. Amodei), my good friend and Nevada \nneighbor, the author of this bill.\n  Mr. AMODEI. Thank you, Mr. Chairman, and thank you Madam Ranking \nMember. I also want to thank the chairman of the full committee as well \nas my cosponsors in this measure: Mr. Polis from Colorado, Mr. Shimkus \nfrom Illinois, and Mr. Jones from North Carolina.\n  So as not to risk snatching defeat from the jaws of victory, I will \nbe brief. I would like to say that this was my idea and it is a \nwonderful thing, but this represents taking care of business that has \nbeen knocking around for probably a decade or more as far as the Forest \nService is concerned. We are not moving the frontier into national \nforests; we are simply giving them the ability to administratively \ndispose of those lands that have become not attached to the national \nforest and have no management or land use characteristics with respect \nto the managing of a national forest.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  The other thing I want to point out is that it will allow them the \nability to dispose of well into six figures' worth of acres, \npotentially, over the next few years, much more than last year, which \nwas almost nothing.\n  The most interesting thing is that the resources generated by this \nwill stay with the Forest Service for use under their various charges \nas opposed to disappearing into that sometimes black hole in space, \nreferred to as the ``United States Treasury.''\n  I urge nationwide bipartisan support.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all Members to support \nthis bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I, too, would urge the adoption of the \nbill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1214, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

JOHN MUIR NATIONAL HISTORIC SITE LAND ACQUISITION.\n\n       (a) Acquisition.--The Secretary of the Interior may acquire \n     by donation the approximately 44 acres of land, and interests \n     in such land, that are identified on the map entitled ``John \n     Muir National Historic Site Proposed Boundary Expansion'', \n     numbered 426/127150, and dated November, 2014.\n       (b) Boundary.--Upon the acquisition of the land authorized \n     by subsection (a), the Secretary of the Interior shall adjust \n     the boundaries of the John Muir Historic Site in Martinez, \n     California, to include the land identified on the map \n     referred to in subsection (a).\n       (c) Administration.--The land and interests in land \n     acquired under subsection (a) shall be administered as part \n     of the John Muir National Historic Site established by the \n     Act of August 31, 1964 (Public Law 88-547; 78 Stat. 753; 16 \n     U.S.C. 461 note).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nDingell) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H5997]]\n\n  H.R. 1289 would expand the John Muir National Historic Site by \napproximately 44 acres. This expansion may only occur by donation of \nthe land.\n  Located in the San Francisco Bay Area, in Martinez, California, this \nsite preserves the 14-room Italianate Victorian mansion where John Muir \nlived, as well as a 325-acre tract of native oak woodlands and \ngrasslands owned by the Muir family.\n  The additional proposed acreage in this bill is directly adjacent to \nthe current site and will allow for better public access to trails in \nthe area. This acreage has been donated to the National Park Service \nand will not be acquired with any Federal dollars.\n  This bill passed out of committee by unanimous consent, and a \nprevious version passed the House during the 113th Congress. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote in favor of the bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1289 will authorize the National Park Service to expand the \nboundary of the John Muir National Historic Site and acquire, by \ndonation, 44 acres of land from the Muir Heritage Land Trust. The \ndonation will expand the site and help carry on Muir's important legacy \nof conservation and environmental stewardship.\n  John Muir is one of our Nation's most respected and revered \necologists. His writings have inspired millions, and his activism and \nadvocacy led to the establishment of some of our first and most iconic \nnational parks.\n  From the moment he set foot in Yosemite Valley, John Muir was \nconsumed with its natural wonder and beauty. He became Yosemite's most \nvocal champion, but he didn't spend his whole life there.\n  From 1890 until his death in 1914, Muir lived on a farm not far from \nSan Francisco. It was from this corner of the Bay Area that Muir \ncofounded the Sierra Club and helped lay the groundwork for a century \nof conservation.\n  Muir's tireless advocacy led to the creation of the Yosemite and \nSequoia National Parks, and his spirit and enduring legacy led to the \nprotection of much more.\n  Since he is known by some as the father of our national parks, I know \nhe would be proud of all of our national parks today, especially as we \nare approaching the 100th anniversary of the National Park System.\n  My home State of Michigan has several beautiful national parks, \nincluding the Sleeping Bear Dunes National Lakeshore, Isle Royale, and \nthe River Raisin National Battlefield.\n  The passage of H.R. 1289 will contribute to John Muir's legacy, and \nit will help to protect and conserve the place where he found solace \nand inspiration in his later years.\n  I want to thank the bill's sponsor, my good friend Representative \nMark DeSaulnier from California, for his leadership.\n  I urge the swift passage of this legislation, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman for \nyielding and for her kind comments.\n  What a pleasure it is to be here on the House floor to continue to \nhonor and respect a great American and a great Californian, his adopted \nState.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I rise in support of H.R. 1289, the John Muir \nNational Historic Site Expansion Act.\n  This bipartisan legislation will expand the Martinez, California, \nhistoric site in my district as it celebrates the life and legacy of \nJohn Muir.\n  Muir was a lifelong conservationist and leading advocate of the \nNational Park Service and a cofounder of the Sierra Club. He worked to \nestablish and protect national parks, including Yosemite, Sequoia, the \nGrand Canyon, and Mt. Rainier.\n  The John Muir National Historic Site, which includes the home where \nhe lived, covers 330 acres in Contra Costa County, where Muir \nchampioned the revolutionary idea that wild spaces should be set aside \nfor all Americans to enjoy.\n  This bill would add 44 acres of donated land from a nonprofit trust, \nimproving access to the park and its scenic trails, including those on \nMount Wanda, named after Muir's eldest daughter.\n  The trail systems are accessible for hikers and bikers, including \ncritical connections to the 550-mile Bay Area Ridge Trail.\n  As Muir once said:\n  Every American needs beauty as well as bread, places to live in . . . \nwhere nature may heal and cheer and give enough strength to body and \nsoul alike.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my predecessor, Congressman George Miller, who \nhas been a champion of this bill and who introduced it in an earlier \nsession.\n  I would also like to thank Natural Resources Committee Chairman \nBishop, Ranking Member Grijalva, as well as Subcommittee Chairman \nMcClintock and Ranking Member Tsongas, for their leadership in bringing \nH.R. 1289 to the floor today.\n  I am also grateful for the support of 31 of my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle who cosponsored the bill as well as Senators Boxer \nand Feinstein for sponsoring this legislation in the Senate.\n  I would also like to thank the John Muir Land Trust for its hard work \nand dedication to preserving and protecting this valuable parkland and \nshoreline in the Bay Area for future generations.\n  As our Nation prepares to celebrate the centennial of the National \nPark Service, this legislation will help preserve the trails and lands \nthat surround the long-time home of the man known as the father of the \nNational Park Service.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this bipartisan legislation, \nthe John Muir National Historic Site Expansion Act.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, in closing, I urge all Members to support \nthe bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, my district comprises the \nSierra Nevada, and we are daily reminded of the foresight of pioneers \nlike John Muir who worked to set aside these natural assets for, in the \nwords of the original Yosemite Charter, ``the public's use, resort, and \nrecreation for all time.''\n  Keeping their memory fresh is an important objective, and I urge the \nadoption of the legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1289, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H5997-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H5997-H5998]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ELKHORN RANCH AND WHITE RIVER NATIONAL FOREST CONVEYANCE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 1554, introduced by my friend Congressman Scott Tipton of \nColorado, would require the U.S. Forest Service to convey by patent a \nsmall area of land near Rifle, Colorado, to its rightful owner.\n  Conflicting surveys between Federal agencies resulted in the \ninclusion of this land in the White River National Forest even though \nit was originally patented in the early 20th century and was legally \nowned by private landowners for decades. These landowners have paid \nproperty taxes on the acreage and have used it for a variety of \npurposes, including agriculture and grazing.\n  Earlier this year, the Forest Service testified that the bill would \n``resolve a longstanding title issue associated with the property'' and \nhas recommended that the area be ``confirmed in the successors in \ninterest to the original patentees.''\n  The bill is supported by Garfield County, Colorado, the city of \nRifle, Colorado, and many others.\n  Congressman Tipton has worked hard to correct this survey discrepancy \nand return this land to its rightful owner. I encourage my colleagues \nto vote ``yes'' on H.R. 1554.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 1554 will convey 148 acres of land to the Gordman-Leverich \nPartnership, a Colorado Limited Liability Partnership, and remedy a \nland dispute between a private landowner and the Forest Service.\n  In 1947, an administrative error occurred that shifted the boundary \nbetween the Elkhorn Ranch and the White River National Forest. This \nsurvey placed 148 acres of private land inside the forest boundary \nwithout providing consideration to the landholders.\n  Since then, the title to the ranch has changed hands several times, \nbut the administrative error has not been corrected. This bill will \ncorrect the error and acknowledge the correct boundary of the Elkhorn \nRanch, providing the current owner with a free and clear title.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Polis and Congressman \nTipton, for their good work on this legislation. The Forest Service \ntestified in support of this bill, and I urge its adoption.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton), my friend who has worked \ntirelessly to correct this administrative error.\n  Mr. TIPTON. I thank the chairman and the ranking member for their \nsupport on this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1554 is a straightforward bill, which Congressman \nPolis and I introduced, to reconfirm the private ownership of 140 acres \nof land in my congressional district.\n  The lands concerned were patented into two private ownerships via the \nUnited States land patents issued in 1914 and 1917 and 1957, but their \nownership has come into question by virtue of the 1949 government \nsurvey, which showed them to be national forest land rather than \nprivate land.\n  Long-held U.S. law specifically states that a government resurvey \ncannot take away private property or private property rights.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Forest Service and the private landowners of the \nElkhorn Ranch only became aware of the potential title issue in the \nearly 2000s. Thereafter, the Forest Service conducted a lengthy and \nthorough review of the matter.\n  Upon the completion of the review, both the supervisor and surveyor \nof the White River National Forest concluded that the ownership of the \n140 acres should be confirmed in the successors in interest to the \noriginal patentees, namely the Elkhorn Ranch.\n  In reaching this conclusion, the Forest Service noted that the land \nhas never been managed by the national forestland and, indeed, has been \nfenced and occupied with stock ponds to develop springs, roads, and \nother private improvements, and it has been used as private land for \nranching and agriculture for the better part of the past 100 years.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is a simple matter of fairness and equity to a \nprivate landowner to honor government land patents that were granted to \nthe landowner's predecessors 60 to 100 years ago.\n  The bill is supported by both the surveyor and the supervisor of the \nWhite River National Forest, the Garfield County Surveyor, the Garfield \nCounty Commissioners, the city of Rifle, Colorado Club 20, which \nrepresents 20 of Colorado's counties, and Piceance Energy, which has \nthe lease on part of the area.\n  In addition, at our hearing on H.R. 1554 in mid-June, the \nadministration testified that this bill is a practical and workable way \nto address the longstanding title issue.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1949 would transfer the responsibilities regarding \nthe construction of the National Liberty Memorial that honors the \nslaves and freemen of African descent who fought during the American \nRevolution to the Secretary of Agriculture.\n  The proposed site for the memorial is on Department of Agriculture \nland, so this change makes sense. Under current law, either the \nSecretary of the Interior or the General Services Administrator would \notherwise be responsible.\n  As a cosponsor of this bill, which passed out of committee by \nunanimous consent, I would urge my colleagues to vote favorably for its \npassage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, Public Law 112-239 authorized the establishment of a \nfund to create the National Liberty Memorial, dedicated to the honor \nand sacrifice of more than 5,000 enslaved and free Black people who \nserved as sailors, soldiers, or provided civilian assistance during the \nRevolutionary War. This is a long overdue memorial, which recognizes \nthe early military role Black people played in securing our Nation's \nfreedom.\n  In June 2014, the General Services Administration identified a \nlocation for the memorial at 14th and Independence Avenue, Southwest, \nhere in Washington, D.C. The approved site is on the grounds of the \nDepartment of Agriculture campus.\n  In the interest of eliminating unnecessary bureaucracy through \noverlapping jurisdiction, H.R. 1949 would make the Department of \nAgriculture responsible for the consideration of the site and design \nproposals, doing so on behalf of the Commission of Fine Arts and \nNational Capital Planning Commission. This responsibility would be \ntransferred from the GSA or the Department of the Interior, as it was \noriginally written.\n  I want to thank my good friend and colleague, the chairman of the \nCongressional Black Caucus, Congressman Butterfield of North Carolina, \nfor his years of hard work and leadership in establishing the National \nLiberty Memorial. We are all looking forward to seeing it open sometime \nin the future, and it will be a fitting tribute to those who sacrificed \nso much to create this great Nation of ours.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support H.R. 1949, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I am ready to close when the gentlewoman \nconcludes, so I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Butterfield).\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Dingell for \nyielding time. I thank her for those kind words a moment ago and thank \nher for her leadership here in the Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of my bill, H.R. 1949, the \nNational Liberty Memorial Clarification Act of 2015. I was joined by my \ncolleague, Congressman Tom McClintock from California, who serves as \nchairman of the Committee on Natural Resources Subcommittee on Federal \nLands.\n  I am grateful for Chairman McClintock's early and sustained support \nfor this bill and appreciate his moving it expeditiously to the floor \nfor consideration.\n  The National Liberty Memorial, which I have long supported, seeks to \nhonor the more than 5,000 slaves and free persons of color or, as \nhistorians sometimes refer to them, free Negroes who fought for \nindependence during the American Revolution.\n  The memorial will ultimately be constructed near the National Mall in \nwhat is known as area one, pursuant to H.J. Res. 120, my resolution \nthat was signed into law by President Obama last year. The preferred \nsite location for the memorial is at the Department of Agriculture's \nWhitten Building, where both the memorial's private sponsor and the \nUSDA want it to be ultimately constructed.\n  Under current law, governed by the Commemorative Works Act, the \nGovernment Services Administration is charged with, among other things, \nsite and design proposals and their submission to the appropriate \nmemorial planning commissions.\n  However, because the preferred site is physically located on property \noccupied by the Department of Agriculture, my bill will simply transfer \nsite and design responsibilities to the Secretary of Agriculture. The \nmemorial sponsor and the USDA both believe that the Secretary of \nAgriculture is in the best position to expeditiously move this \nimportant memorial project forward.\n  Doing so will allow the memorial sponsor and USDA to make progress on \na design and construction plan. This simple change, Mr. Speaker, will \neliminate duplication, better use scarce Federal resources, and avoid \nunnecessary delay.\n  Seeing this important and culturally significant memorial to fruition \nis of great importance to me. It is of great importance to the \nCongressional Black Caucus. It is important, certainly, to the \nconstituents that I represent in North Carolina and descendants of the \nbrave Revolutionary War soldiers who sacrificed so much on behalf of \nAmerican independence.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to signal their support for H.R. \n1949 simply by voting ``yes'' on final passage.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, the National Liberty Memorial reminds us \nof a story of patriotism and sacrifice that won the independence of our \ncountry and that set in motion what Lincoln called ``the last best hope \nof mankind.'' It is a story from the American Revolution that, to this \nday, has not been adequately acknowledged.\n  I am pleased to commend Mr. Butterfield for his legislation, to have \njoined as a cosponsor of it, and to urge the House its speedy adoption.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1949, the \nNational Liberty Memorial Clarification Act of 2015, which will help \nlay the final foundation for a National Liberty Memorial in Washington, \nD.C.\n  Two-hundred and thirty-nine years ago our nation was inked into \nexistence by Thomas Jefferson in defense of a simple idea: that all men \nwere created equal, and are endowed with certain unalienable rights. \nCountless men and women stood up for that idea around the new nation--\nsome volunteered to fight, but others served in their own way as \ncivilians. We know so many of those patriots' names by heart--George \nWashington, Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, John Adams--and those \nwe do not are remembered in their hometowns all across America.\n  However, there are a number of patriots who are too often forgotten: \nthe thousands of slaves and freed men and women who fought for our \ncountry and provided civilian assistance at our most vulnerable time. \nThese men and women believed so fully in the ideas and principles of \nthe American Revolution that they fought, died, and sacrificed even as \ntheir own rights were trampled.\n  Their actions demonstrated patriotism in its absolute highest form. \nBut there is no monument to their sacrifice, no memorial for their \ndescendants to honor, and no place for our nation to offer their \ncollective thanks.\n  The National Liberty Memorial Clarification Act of 2015 will finally \npay the debt we owe to these brave patriots who helped breathe life \ninto our new nation. After some 230 years, it is the least we can do.\n  I would like to thank Mr. Butterfield and Mr. McClintock for offering \nthis important legislation. I would also like to thank my former \nJudiciary staffer, Maurice Barboza, who has been fighting to honor the \nsacrifices of slaves and freed persons for decades. Their work is a \ncredit to us all.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr.\n\n[[Page H6000]]\n\nMcClintock) that the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. \n1949, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to acknowledge the gentlemen from Oregon, \nMr. DeFazio and Mr. Walden, for their hard work on this important piece \nof legislation that will benefit several Indian tribes in the State of \nOregon.\n  H.R. 2791 is a compilation of three stand-alone bills that were \nreported out of the Natural Resources Committee and passed by the full \nHouse as part of larger measures during the 113th Congress.\n  Since I have every confidence that Mr. DeFazio will describe the bill \nin detail, I will, at this point, reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  H.R. 2791 is the culmination of years of work to address the wrongs \nof the past. The ``termination era'' in Federal Indian policy is one of \nthe darkest chapters in American history. In Oregon, all but one of the \ntribes lost their Federal recognition.\n  Fortunately, the Federal Government eventually saw the error of their \nways and restored the recognition of the tribes, but they were now left \nwith nonexistent or inadequate land bases.\n  H.R. 2791, the Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act, will go a long way \nin helping reestablish long-promised land bases for the Oregon tribes, \nwhile also giving them the ability to effectively manage their land on \ntheir own terms.\n  Like my colleague, I want to thank our colleagues from Oregon, Mr. \nDeFazio and Mr. Walden, for listening to the needs of the Oregon tribal \npeople and continuing to push for this bipartisan legislation.\n  All the sections included in this bill passed the House by voice vote \nlast Congress, and I urge my colleagues to do the same now.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. DeFazio).\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for both the kind \nwords and for yielding the time here on the floor. I particularly want \nto thank the chairman of the Federal Lands Subcommittee and his words \nof support, also, and I thank the committee for sending this bill to \nthe floor.\n  The Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act is a bipartisan, no-cost, \ncommonsense bill that will go a long way toward helping resolve some of \nthe problems Federal Government and its haphazard policy shifts have \ncreated for three western Oregon tribes. The bill provides fairness for \nthree tribes: the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and Siuslaw; the Cow Creek; and \nthe Coquille.\n  The bill contains the text of provisions within H.R. 5701, which \npassed unanimously last December, but was not enacted into law.\n  For too long, Federal policies have unfairly disadvantaged Indian \ntribes in western Oregon. After signing many treaties with the tribes, \nthe United States removed them from their original homelands and put \nthem on only two reservations, established to house potentially more \nthan 60 tribal governments.\n  In 1954, Congress made things worse. All tribes west of the Cascades \nlost Federal recognition when the Western Oregon Termination Act became \nlaw. Scholars called it the ``termination era.'' It was terrible \nFederal Indian policy. It was so bad that it was formally rebuked by \nCongress less than 30 years later.\n  In the 1970s, Congress began the process of restoring the western \nOregon tribes to Federal recognition, cleaning up the mess and \ninjustice the United States had made.\n  In fact, I began my congressional career as an original sponsor of \nthe Coquille Restoration Act, legislation to restore one of Oregon's \nterminated tribes; yet, even today, it remains difficult for these \ntribes to function as the sovereign nations they are and to govern \nthemselves effectively. Unlike many tribes, the Coos, Lower Umpqua, and \nSiuslaw, as well as the Cow Creek, are deprived of any land held in \ntrust.\n  Unlike any other tribe in the United States, the Coquille Indian \nTribe must function under a legal anomaly with regard to its own \nforest.\n  The Western Oregon Tribal Fairness Act makes good on a decades-old \npromise to restore land bases for the Coos and Cow Creek tribes, and it \nputs the Coquille Indian Tribe's forest on an equal footing with those \nof other Indian tribes nationwide.\n  H.R. 2791 deals only with Oregon issues, Oregon tribes, and Oregon \nconstituents.\n  Mr. Speaker, I strongly encourage my colleagues to support the bill.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to join us in \nsupporting this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, my complete faith in Mr. DeFazio's \npowers of description was well placed. I endorse his remarks and ask \nfor adoption of the measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2791.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the\n\n[[Page H6002]]\n\nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6002-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6002]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NEW MEXICO NAVAJO WATER SETTLEMENT TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS ACT\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McClintock) and the gentlewoman from Michigan (Mrs. \nDingell) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n\n[[Page H6003]]\n\n  I would first like to acknowledge the gentleman from Alaska (Mr. \nYoung), the chairman of the Subcommittee on Indian, Insular, and Alaska \nNative Affairs, for his hard work as the sponsor of the House companion \nto this bill, H.R. 521.\n  This bill was favorably reported from the Committee on Natural \nResources by unanimous consent in July of this year. The Senate \nversion, S. 230, sponsored by Senator Murkowski, is before us today. \nThis bill directs the Secretary of Health and Human Services to convey \nby warranty deed a 23-acre parcel of Federal land under the \nadministration of the Indian Health Service and located in Bethel, \nAlaska, to the Yukon Kuskokwim Health Corporation for health and social \nservice-related programs.\n  The YKHC is a nonprofit Alaska Native organization which operates a \nregional hospital on the 23 acres of the Federal land conveyed under \nthis bill. In recent years, the hospital has had a need to expand and \nrenovate the existing facilities in this location. To secure funding \nfor the hospital expansion, the YKHC must demonstrate sufficient site \ncontrol, but because the surrounding land is federally owned, this bill \nis necessary to provide the health corporation the site control \nnecessary to improve its facilities.\n  Congress has enacted two similar bills in the last several Congresses \nand, like those, this bill is supported by the entire Alaska delegation \nand by the administration.\n  I again want to commend my colleague from Alaska for his hard work \nfor Alaska Natives, and I urge my colleagues to pass this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, S. 230, as my colleague has so eloquently stated, will \nprovide for the conveyance of approximately 23 acres to the YKHC, \nlocated in Bethel, Alaska, for the purposes of constructing a primary \ncare clinic attached to the existing hospital.\n  This bill is identical to H.R. 521, introduced by our colleague and \nmy very dear and good friend, Chairman Don Young, which we passed by \nunanimous consent out of the Committee on Natural Resources. The land \ntransfer is needed so that the YKHC might participate in the Indian \nHealth Service Joint Venture Construction Program.\n  Access to quality health care is a fundamental part of our trust \nresponsibility to tribal members, and passage of this bill will ensure \nthat the YKHC can meet the current and future needs of its residents.\n  I urge my colleagues to support passage of S. 230.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young), that legendary force of Alaskan \nnature.\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Alaska asked and was given permission to revise and \nextend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I do thank the chairman and I do \nthank the ranking member for their kind comments.\n  Much has been said about this fine piece of legislation. As was \nmentioned, it has passed the House twice. The Senate finally passed out \na bill, and now we are dealing with a Senate bill.\n  As was mentioned, this gives an opportunity for the YKHC, a Native \nhospital, to expand on Federal lands. By ownership of the land now, \nthere will be no cloud on that title.\n  I do appreciate the comments. I do appreciate the work that has been \nput into this. This is a bill that should have been signed into law a \nlot sooner. It will be done now, and we will be able to expand this \nhospital for my Alaska Natives.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the passage of this legislation.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, before I yield back for the day, I want to \nthank my colleague, Chairman McClintock, for his collegiality today and \nhis leadership in making this a pleasant afternoon and a bipartisan \nafternoon.\n  I urge all Members to join me in supporting S. 230.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McCLINTOCK. Mr. Speaker, I would reciprocate those kind words to \nthe gentlewoman from Michigan; thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for adoption of this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McClintock) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 230.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6003-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6003]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Lamborn) and the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Colorado.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2223, the Crags, Colorado Land \nExchange Act of 2015, which I introduced, along with Mr. Polis, to \nfacilitate a land exchange in El Paso and Teller Counties in Colorado.\n  Specifically, this legislation would convey to the United States the \n320-acre Crags property located on the west side of Pikes Peak that is \ncurrently owned by the Broadmoor Hotel and that is a perpetual public \naccess easement for the lower portion of the popular Barr Trail.\n  In exchange, an 83-acre Federal parcel located at Emerald Valley \nRanch on the southeast side of Pikes Peak and that is a perpetual \naccess easement along two Forest Service roads would be transferred to \nthe Broadmoor.\n  This exchange would eliminate the management and liability issues \ncurrently facing the United States because of the significant upgrades \nand improvements that Broadmoor has made to the Emerald Valley Ranch \nparcel.\n  Mr. Speaker, this land exchange will also provide increased outdoor \nrecreational opportunities for the public. The 320-acre Crags property \nis completely surrounded by the Pike National Forest and has been the \ntop acquisition priority for the Pikes Peak Ranger District for several \nyears.\n  The property provides several opportunities to connect forest system \ntrails emanating from The Crags Campground with trails in the Putney \nGulch area. In addition, existing trails within the property could \nbecome key links in the proposed Ring the Peak Trail.\n  I would like to thank Chairman Bishop and Chairman McClintock and the \nentire staff of the Subcommittee on Federal Lands for all of their hard \nwork in bringing this bill to the floor tonight to help increase the \neconomic and recreational opportunities around Colorado Springs. I \nencourage my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Rather than repeat what the chairman of the subcommittee just \nindicated on H.R. 2223, let me just say that the exchange eliminates a \nlarge private inholding in the National Forest and removes the need for \nthe Federal land management of the Emerald Valley Ranch. The Forest \nService testified in support of the legislation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues, Congressman Polis and Congressman \nLamborn, for their hard and constructive work on this legislation. This \nis a good, bipartisan piece of legislation, and I congratulate its two \nsponsors. I urge its passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, in conclusion, I appreciate the ranking \nmember, Representative Grijalva, for his work on the committee.\n  We have many spirited discussions. Sometimes we don't agree, but \nsometimes we do. This is one of those great occasions when, on a \nbipartisan basis, we do agree.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2223.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6006-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6006]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n            CONGRATULATING SABADO GIGANTE AND DON FRANCISCO\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise tonight to congratulate Mario \nKreutzberger, better known as Don Francisco, for his successful career \nas the host of Sabado Gigante whose last airing will be this Saturday, \nSeptember 19.\n  From its humble beginnings in the country of Chile 53 years ago, \nSabado Gigante has captivated and won the hearts of audiences \nthroughout Latin America and especially in our south Florida community.\n  Nearly 30 years since its first transmission into the United States, \nSabado Gigante has attracted loyal and enthusiastic viewers who enjoy \nthe combination of entertainment and coverage of current events. In \n2012, the Guinness Book of Records listed Sabado Gigante as the world's \nlongest running TV variety show.\n  Don Francisco has also been dedicated to promoting charitable giving \nthrough his Teleton and has served as a spokesperson for the Muscular \nDystrophy Association. Wherever Don Francisco decides to go, he will \nnot only find success, but also the heartfelt support of our community.\n  Congratulations--felicidades, Don Francisco.

Mr. Speaker, I am here today to recognize one of my \noutstanding constituents, Ms. Veronica Potter, of Barrington, Illinois.\n  She recently wrote a letter to a hometown paper saying:\n\n       I know that the service of women in our current history is \n     applauded because the service is indeed equal to that of men \n     in our military, but in World War II, there were many women \n     involved in serving their country in the military, but as a \n     whole, nothing is ever mentioned.\n\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, she is right, so I would like to mention her today \nhere on the House floor.\n  The Women's Reserve was created in 1942 when the strain of our two-\nfront war caused shortages in military personnel. Recognizing her \ncountry needed her in a time of war, Veronica selflessly volunteered \nand served in the U.S. Marines Corps Reserves from 1944 to 1946 and \nsupported our country's efforts during World War II.\n  Veronica joined the Marines right out of high school. After basic \ntraining, she was deployed to the Marine base in Parris Island, South \nCarolina, for 2 years, where she contributed to the wartime operations \non the base that helped train more than 204,000 marines destined for \nthe front line in defense of our great Nation.\n  Ms. Potter served our country in a dire time of need and has not been \nproperly recognized for her efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, please join me in honoring and recognizing Veronica \nPotter, a woman who contributed to the success of the U.S. Marines \nduring World War II.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6006-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6006-H6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN\n\n  (Mr. HONDA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. HONDA.

The Fifth District's \nown Promotion in Motion and M Mars have contributed to countless fond \nmemories of enjoying candy at sports games, movie theaters, and \nbirthday parties; but the confectionary industry provides even more \nthan just tasty treats.\n  In New Jersey and throughout the country, this industry is an \neconomic driver comprised of family-owned businesses employing tens of \nthousands of employees across the State and across the country.\n  No doubt, New Jersey is a sweeter place thanks to the candy \nmanufacturers that call our State of New Jersey home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6007-2", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CONCERNING THE CONTINUING RESOLUTION\n\n  (Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas asked and was given permission to address \nthe House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Members, here we are, 2 weeks \naway from another potential shutdown of the government.\n  Do my Republican friends know how silly it sounds to threaten \nshutting down the entire government over a manufactured crisis for \nfunding that does not even go to abortions?\n  Current law already withholds Federal funding from covering a woman's \nabortion, except in cases of extreme limited circumstances. To gamble \nwith valuable Federal programs should be embarrassing.\n  Here are just a few examples of programs that will be affected if the \nGOP pursues a strategy that I doubt they would want to see happen.\n  The GOP shutdown would mean that the Centers for Disease Control \nwould be unable to support the annual seasonal influenza program.\n  The GOP shutdown means we rely more on foreign energy as the issuance \nof permits for energy production on Federal lands stop. I certainly \nknow my Republican colleagues wouldn't want to see that happen.\n  Head Start centers around the country would close. During fiscal year \n2014, an estimated 1,600 Head Start agencies served over 927,000 \nchildren, including 71,000 in Texas. Apparently, our children are okay \nto target in a political debate.\n  Under the GOP shutdown, the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and \nExplosives would be affected; and gun permits will not be processed.\n  We could be using this time to debate the extension of valuable \nprograms like the Export-Import Bank or the highway trust fund, but \ninstead, we are going through the same theatrics we went through 2 \nyears ago, which accomplished nothing.\n  Mr. Speaker, I encourage my colleagues to be reasonable and pass a \nclean continuing resolution so Congress can get back to work doing what \nthe American people sent us here to do.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6007-3", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6007]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     QUESTIONS FOR TONIGHT'S DEBATE\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, the good news of this place is a \ncongratulations offered by my colleague just a few minutes ago to a 90-\nyear-old lady who served in World War II and had never received a thank \nyou.\n  Wouldn't it be a positive step to reflect on America and to be able \nto hold in this body positive things that shows the Congress working \ntogether? Yet, as has been mentioned, our colleagues want to defund \nPlanned Parenthood and shut down the government.\n  I wonder whether or not, in this debate coming up, that any of the \nmoderators will ask whether any of those debating will stand in \nshutting down the government. I wonder whether they will ask them \nwhether they support voting rights and will support the restoration of \nthe Voting Rights Act, like the Americans who walked 1,000 miles for \njustice.\n  I wonder whether or not, in fact, they would ask them whether they \ncare anything about criminal justice reform and decriminalizing, if you \nwill, this system where it has mass incarceration, children in jail, \nwhere it doesn't believe in rehabilitation for those who have served.\n  I wonder whether these individuals that have been making a lot of \nnoise in front of the public who will be in the public eye all over \nAmerica, Mr. Speaker, whether they will answer the real questions about \nAmerica and bring us together.\n  Voting rights, health care for women, and making sure that we fix the \ncriminal justice system, those are the questions that should be asked \ntonight.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6007-4", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6007-H6010]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Grijalva) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I rise this evening to talk about the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund, our Nation's most important conservation \nand outdoor recreation program.\n  For more than 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nconserved our Nation's most cherished natural spaces and historic \nlandmarks. This groundbreaking program, created and reauthorized on a \nstrong bipartisan basis, has protected and expanded iconic landscapes \nin every State and is responsible for more than 40,000 State and local \noutdoor recreation projects, from playgrounds and baseball fields to \nurban parks and nature refuges.\n  By reinvesting revenues from offshore oil and gas development in \ncommunities across America, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has \nbecome ``America's best parks program.''\n  In my home State of Arizona, the fund has provided approximately $223 \nmillion in funding to help preserve iconic places like the Grand \nCanyon, Buenos Aires National Wildlife Refuge, and the San Pedro \nRiparian National Conservation Area.\n  Recently, I had the pleasure of joining National Park staff and \nstudents from Cholla High School, Desert View High School, and Pueblo \nHigh School for a day of appreciation at Saguaro National Park West. \nFor many of the students that joined us on this visit, this was their \nfirst visit to Saguaro, despite it being a 15-minute drive from Tucson.\n  Saguaro officials have leveraged the Land and Water Conservation Fund \nfunding to benefit Arizonans, the desert tortoise, Gila monsters, and \nother desert wildlife that call Saguaro home. Without it, our students \nwould have had a smaller national park to experience, less to learn, \nand less to enjoy.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund has preserved iconic sites like \nthis all over the country. Our trip to Saguaro was hardly unique. These \nstories of discovery happen every day thanks to the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n\n[[Page H6008]]\n\n  Unfortunately, the fund's authorizing legislation expires on \nSeptember 30, 2015. Six legislative days remain before the clock runs \nout. The stakes are high.\n  If the Land and Water Conservation Fund is not renewed, special wild \nareas will be at greater risk of overdevelopment, and our Nation's \nability to conserve lands for future generations will be severely \nundercut.\n  Congress should build on the Land and Water Conservation Fund's \nlegacy. We should stop playing political games and do what the public \nclearly wants us to do. We should permanently reauthorize and fully \nfund the program. It is that simple.\n  The House Republican leadership has not acted to extend the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund. They seem perfectly content to let it expire.\n  Rather than meeting with their fellow legislators and reaching a \ncompromise, as Senate Republicans have done, the House Republican \nleadership, once again, has shown an inability to do what is best for \nsportsmen, the outdoor industry, recreation enthusiasts, and wildlife. \nBy allowing the fund to expire, they serve no one's interest and create \na deficit in our legacy as protectors of public land and public \nresources in this country.\n  This is not a controversial program. It protects public land for \nfuture use. There is no more an American goal than that, but it is held \nup by a leadership team that would rather do nothing.\n  Past Congresses have reauthorized the Land and Water Conservation \nFund with support from both parties. It shouldn't be any different this \ntime. The support is there.\n  On April 15, as the chart illustrates, a bill to permanently \nreauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund was introduced. To \ndate, the bill boasts support from over 165 Members of Congress, both \nRepublican and Democrats.\n  I have made a request--as the sequence of time that we have been \nwaiting--asking for a full hearing, a markup, and an eventual vote on \nthis floor.\n  We asked for a hearing on H.R. 1814. I made a request to hold a vote \non H.R. 1814. These requests have fallen on deaf ears.\n  The clock is running out. House Republican leaders must act. It won't \ntake much to get the Land and Water Conservation Fund back on track, \nbut they have to say yes to moving forward and to doing a bipartisan \nlegislation, which is what the colleagues of this Chamber are asking \nfor. It is time for action.\n  We are calling, in a bipartisan way, on our colleagues to permanently \nreauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund. To not do so is not \ncarrying out our full responsibilities as stewards of the public lands, \nbut also, more importantly, when you have before you a request by over \n165 Members on a bipartisan manner on a bill that has compromises \nwithin it that were reached at the Senate level as well, it appears to \nme that not to do this fund is to set up this fund for failure, to set \nup this fund for dismantling, and to set up this fund to redirect the \npurpose for which this fund was created 50 years ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. \nTsongas), the ranking member for the Subcommittee on Federal Lands.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Ranking Member \nGrijalva for his leadership and advocacy on behalf of the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  We have a generational responsibility to protect our Nation's \nremaining natural and historic resources for our children and our \ngrandchildren. The Land and Water Conservation Fund has been an \ninstrumental tool, an invaluable tool in this effort.\n  For over 50 years, the Land and Water Conservation Fund has carried \nout a simple, bipartisan idea: use revenues from the depletion of one \nFederal resource--offshore oil and gas--to conserve another--our land \nand water--and provide recreation opportunities for all Americans. It \ndoes not cost taxpayer money or contribute to the Federal deficit, \nrelying instead on royalties paid by oil and gas companies in exchange \nfor their right to develop offshore resources in waters that belong to \nall of the American people.\n  LWCF has also proven to be a critical tool to protect some of our \nNation's most significant cultural and historic sites, protecting \nplaces that have shaped and defined who we are as a people and a \ncountry and would not have been protected without support from the \nFederal Government.\n  This past weekend, I was honored to host Secretary of the Interior \nSally Jewell at my annual River Day, an event I have held in my \ndistrict for the past 9 years that celebrates the rivers that connect \nthe Third Congressional District of Massachusetts and the many partners \nwho work to protect these resources that provide clean drinking water, \ncreate tremendous recreational opportunities, and bring natural beauty \nto our daily life.\n  As part of River Day, Secretary Jewell and I visited Minute Man \nNational Historical Park, which commemorates the famous shot heard \n'round the world in the very beginnings of our country. Like many \nnational parks and public lands across the country, Minute Man, and all \nthose who visit, have directly benefited from the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  Barrett's Farm is the former home of Colonel James Barrett, the \ncommander of the Middlesex militia during the Revolutionary War. His \nfarm was used to store colonial militia weapons and was the objective \nof the British march on Concord that inspired Paul Revere's ride. \nBritish forces marched from Boston to seize the munitions stored at the \nfarm, but Barrett's militia confronted the British soldiers at the \nNorth Bridge, where the shot heard 'round the world was fired, \nlaunching America's war for independence.\n  For many years, this important historic site, Barrett's Farm, was \nprivately owned, restricted from the public, and was in a complete \nstate of disrepair. Thanks to the Land and Water Conservation Fund, the \nNational Park Service was able to purchase Barrett's Farm from a \nwilling, private local foundation, ensuring that this nationally \nsignificant historical site is preserved to be enjoyed by visitors for \nmany years to come.\n  Fifty years ago, our predecessors in this Congress had the wisdom and \nforesight to establish the Land and Water Conservation Fund for the \nbenefit of future generations of Americans. Dismantling this program or \nletting its authorization expire disadvantages all in real and \nsignificant ways. I can't imagine the loss of the important piece of \nhistory of Barrett's Farm that the LWCF made possible to preserve.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting full funding and \npermanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation Fund, \nmaking sure that it remains one of our Nation's most successful and \neffective conservation tools.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California's \n47th District (Mr. Lowenthal), the ranking member of the Subcommittee \non Energy and Mineral Resources.\n  Mr. LOWENTHAL. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ranking Member Grijalva for \ncalling us together for this Special Order hour to highlight the need \nfor the Land and Water Conservation Fund and for his leadership in \nseeking a permanent reauthorization of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund.\n  As has been pointed out, the Land and Water Conservation Fund is far \nand away our Nation's most important conservation program. The LWCF is \na popular and successful bipartisan program for the conservation and \nprotection of America's irreplaceable natural, historic, cultural, and \noutdoor landmarks.\n  Over its 50-year history, the fund has conserved more than 5 million \nacres for parks, for recreation, for forests, for refuges, and for \nother land through the Federal program, but that is just part of the \nLWCF. Also, more than 2.6 million acres has been saved in communities \nthroughout every State in the Nation.\n  It has conserved iconic landscapes in every State. It is responsible \nfor more than 40,000 State and local outdoor recreational projects at \nno cost, as has been pointed out, to the American taxpayer. In fact, \naccording to a recent economic analysis, every dollar invested in the \nconservation of public lands through the LWCF leads to $4 in economic \nactivities to local communities.\n  Our Nation's conserved public lands are the essential infrastructure \nfor a\n\n[[Page H6009]]\n\nvibrant outdoor recreational economy that contributes over $646 billion \nto the economy each year and supports more than 1 in every 15 jobs in \nthe United States.\n  That economic activity and job creation plays out locally all over \nthe country, not only in the broad service and manufacturing sectors, \nbut in the thousands upon thousands of recreational destination areas \nand the gateway communities where we all go to enjoy the outdoors. My \nhome State of California has received more than $2.3 billion in LWCF \nfunding over the past five decades, which has helped to protect some of \nour State's most treasured places.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund also plays a crucial role in \nbuilding up the ability of our lands to reduce the damages caused by \nclimate change. Our network of public lands plays a critical role in \naddressing the challenges that climate change poses to our forests, \nfish and wildlife, and riparian resources. America's forests naturally \ncapture a remarkable 13 percent of U.S. carbon emissions each year, but \nthe U.S. Forest Service projects that private forests, storing more \nthan 2 billion tons of carbon, are at risk of development in addition. \nCoastal wetlands, we also know, can lessen the damages caused by major \nstorms, and land conservation in the wildland-urban interface can \nreduce home losses from major fires.\n  Continued investment in the Land and Water Conservation Fund will be \nessential to help us buffer the impacts of a changing climate. If \nfunding is allowed to expire, the American public will lose one of our \ngreatest tools to ensure the protection of our public lands and waters \nand the ability of everyone to go outside and to enjoy these wonderful \nresources. We simply cannot let that happen.\n  Congress must honor the bipartisan commitment it made over 50 years \nago and ensure that our children and our grandchildren get to enjoy \nAmerica's treasured outdoor spaces the same way we have been able to \nenjoy those spaces. We must permanently reauthorize the LWCF.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California's \nSecond District (Mr. Huffman), the ranking member on the Water, Power, \nand Oceans Subcommittee of the Committee on Natural Resources.\n\n  Mr. HUFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, for more than 50 years, the Land and Water \nConservation Fund has protected America's natural heritage. This fund \nis one of our Nation's most important conservation tools. Every single \nyear, millions of Americans hike the trails that this fund has helped \nbuild, they visit the national parks that this fund helped create, and \nthey enjoy the wildland vistas that it helped protect.\n  This fund has supported more than 40,000 projects in nearly every \ncounty in every State in our Nation. In my own district on California's \nnorth coast, it has funded projects in Redwood National Park, in Six \nRivers National Forest, and in the Point Reyes National Seashore.\n  Since 2004, it has helped add more than 1,000 acres to the King Range \nNational Conservation Area, which is one of the most rugged and \nspectacular backpacking areas you will find anywhere in the continental \nUnited States. It is also known as the Lost Coast.\n  The positive impact that this fund has had is simply staggering. The \nLand and Water Conservation Fund has permanently protected 5 million \nacres of public lands, and that includes sections of American icons, \nlike the Grand Canyon National Park and the Appalachian Trail. Best of \nall, it has done all of this at no taxpayer expense. The Land and Water \nConservation Fund is financed by a portion of offshore drilling fees.\n  Congress needs to remember that preserving our natural heritage isn't \njust good for our environment; it is good for our economy. Outdoor \nrecreation is a cornerstone for many local and State economies, \nbringing tourists from around the world to shop at local businesses, to \neat at restaurants, to stay at hotels.\n  In California alone, outdoor recreation supports $85.4 billion in \nconsumer spending and 732,000 jobs across the State; but in just 2 \nweeks, authorization of this fund will expire, leaving local economies \nin jeopardy, leaving our land managers struggling to make up for lost \nfunding.\n  Fifty years ago, Congress created the Land and Water Conservation \nFund with an overwhelming bipartisan vote. I hope Congress can come \ntogether now to support H.R. 1814, a bipartisan bill sponsored by my \nfriend Mr. Grijalva, that permanently reauthorizes the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. America's natural heritage and our economy depend on \nit.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from \nWashington's First District (Ms. DelBene).\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Speaker, I have the honor of representing one of the \nmost beautiful and diverse districts in the country. It includes the \nAlpine Lakes Wilderness, the Mount Baker-Snoqualmie National Forest, \nthe North Cascades National Park, and the North Creek Forest, all \nincredible areas for people throughout our region and across the \ncountry to enjoy.\n  Unfortunately, in just 14 days, the congressional authorization for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund will expire. LWCF was established \n50 years ago to maintain outdoor recreational opportunities nationwide. \nIt is the only Federal program dedicated to the conservation of our \nnational parks, forests, wildernesses, wildlife refuges, State and \nlocal parks, and working forests.\n  Since its inception, the fund has invested $637 million in Washington \nState projects alone, including three grants for the North Creek \nForest, a 64-acre park I visited just last month. A community \norganization called Friends of North Creek Forest and a college student \nnamed Jordan from the University of Washington at Bothell gave me a \ntour of the forest.\n  For his senior thesis, Jordan has worked with the community and \nconservation volunteers to clean up the site and design new trails for \nhikers and hundreds of schoolchildren to enjoy. This forest is a safe \nand healthy place for our families and students to have fun and learn \nabout species diversity and the importance of conservation efforts. \nThis is just one project among thousands across the country.\n  Without a new authorization for this critical program, environmental \nconservation projects and Washington's outdoor recreational industry \nwould be needlessly harmed because not only is the Land and Water \nConservation Fund crucial for protecting the Pacific Northwest's \nbeautiful spaces, it is also important for our State's economy as well \nas the entire country's. In Washington State alone, outdoor recreation \nsupports nearly 200,000 jobs and contributes $20 billion a year to our \neconomy.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund uses no taxpayer dollars and is \nfunded through oil and gas receipts paid by energy companies. \nUnfortunately, in the past, Congress has diverted this money for other \nuses. That is why I, along with 159 of my colleagues, have cosponsored \na bill to permanently reauthorize the fund.\n  My beautiful State boasts some of our Nation's most beautiful \nforests, mountains, and waterways, and taking care of these natural \nresources and protecting our environment is critical to preserving the \nquality of life that we cherish.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  We can't risk defunding the great work of these environmental \nconservation projects, which is why Congress must reauthorize the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund.\n  I want to thank Congressman Grijalva for organizing this Special \nOrder hour on such a critical issue.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Speaker, after September 30, the authorization for \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund expires. That date is a looming \ndate for the Republican leadership of this House.\n  With it comes the talk and potential of a government shutdown. Other \ncritical programs that face reauthorization are also ending on \nSeptember 30.\n  Part of the issue of leadership is to allow the House to work its \nwill. Until this House has the opportunity to deal with this issue of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund, we will continue to not know its \nstatus and we will watch the agonizingly slow and painful dismantling \nand end of this program.\n  The reauthorization has, in its history, been bipartisan and \nbicameral.\n\n[[Page H6010]]\n\nThis legislation enjoys bipartisan and bicameral support.\n  Both Republican and Democratic colleagues are part of the 165 \nsponsors of the legislation in the House. The compromise in that \ncommittee was between the ranking member and the chair of that \ncommittee in the Senate.\n  So I think it behooves us to look at this fund, for every day past \nthe 30th of September $2.5 million will be lost to that fund, money \nthat we cannot afford to lose.\n  Mr. Speaker, to wait for the ashes of the Land and Water Conservation \nFund after the 30th and then to develop it without bipartisan input, \nwithout the Democrats playing any role at all in legislation that \nredefines the Fund and that includes purposes for which the Fund was \nnever established and redirect its funds into areas which are far from \nthe mission of the Fund when it was established 50 years ago, is \neffectively killing the Fund.\n  The cuts in our Federal land agencies and land management agencies \nthat have endured in the last four or five budgets point to the fact \nthat the Land and Water Conservation Fund has become an essential \nsupplemental support to many of our public lands and the projects and \noutdoor activities and wildlife protections that the American people \nexpect.\n  I suggest to the House that this reauthorization should be devoid of \ncontroversy and should be devoid of partisan bickering and political \ngrandstanding. This is a routine item that requires action by the \nHouse.\n  Mr. Speaker, before the time runs out, fully funding and fully \nauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation Fund on a permanent basis \nis what the public is asking for and is what 165 Members of this House \nare asking for.\n  I believe that the Republican leadership of this House has to act and \nallow the House of Representatives, the elected Representatives of the \npeople of this Nation, to work its will and take that vote.\n  My colleagues have mentioned the economic benefit and priorities of \nthe Land and Water Conservation Fund. Let me just add that a bipartisan \npoll found that 88 percent of the voters support continuing to set \naside offshore oil and gas drilling fees that should go into the Land \nand Water Conservation Fund and 85 percent of Americans want the fund \nto be fully funded.\n  For every dollar that is spent on Land and Water Conservation Funds \nand that is invested, it results in a return of $4 in economic value \nfrom the natural resources goods and services alone.\n  I think it is worth noting that $900 million comes from those \noffshore oil and gas resources and $17 billion that is collected from \nthose fees and resources that are collected from offshore drilling and \ngas and oil development goes for other purposes elsewhere in the \ngovernment.\n  So we are talking essentially about a very small sum of money that \nmany of us felt should have been raised a long time ago. We are \njeopardizing this sum of money.\n  In jeopardizing this sum of money, we are further dismantling and \nfurther hurting the public's use of our public lands and, more \nimportantly, the protections and cultural resource activities that \noccur as a result of the fund.\n  It is a simple matter. Bring it to a hearing. Bring it to a vote. I \nwould urge the leadership of this House that it is way past time. To \nagonizingly wait for September 30 is not a function of government. It \nis cynical. It is wrong.\n  When you have a bill before you that enjoys the bipartisan support \nthat H.R. 1814 enjoys, it is time to bring it to the floor and allow \nthis Congress to vote and allow this bill to be reauthorized on a \npermanent level, on a permanent basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6010-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6010-H6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Buck). Under the Speaker's announced \npolicy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, actually, there are some people that it is \nmore of a pleasure to work in this House with than others.\n  Congressman Buck, you are one of those that it is a real honor and \nprivilege to work with.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am back here on the floor to talk about one of the \nmost important issues, maybe the most important issue, of this \nCongress, recent Congresses, maybe future Congresses, because it has to \ndo with whether or not the Republican-marked majority in the Senate are \ngoing to just appear to oppose the Iranian agreement or if they are \ngoing to stop it.\n  The Corker-Cardin bill was done, I have no reason to doubt, with the \nbest of intentions. I didn't vote for it. I could see what I was afraid \nwas coming, and it is what has come. But those that voted for it had a \nlegitimate basis for doing so.\n  Because the President of the United States, Barack Obama, had said \nthis is basically an executive agreement, he doesn't need the Senate's \nvote. And that is true if it is not a treaty.\n  We had the Secretary of State say that he was--and he said it--\nnegotiating a nonbinding agreement. Those were the kind of statements \nfrom which the Corker-Cardin bill was based.\n  And so that bill gave the House and the Senate each a vote on \nsomething that was considered to be a nonbinding executive agreement \nwith Iran. However, after the U.N. Security Council voted on it, \nfinally Congress got to see the so-called nonbinding agreement.\n  After the U.N. voted on it, then we keep getting messages about: Gee, \nyou cannot stop this. Because to stop it would put us in breach of the \nagreement. How can we be in breach of a nonbinding agreement?\n  Well, the truth came out once we had a chance to read the so-called \nIranian deal, Iranian agreement. It is a treaty. There is no question \nit is a treaty.\n  I don't care whose law you go under. You cannot amend a treaty with \nanything that falls short of being a treaty itself.\n  It is just like here in the House. You can't amend legislation unless \nyou amend it with other legislation, although we have bureaucracies \nlike the EPA and others who have just decided to go off on their own \nand start legislating against the clear and expressed intent of \nCongress. But it is not lawful. They are acting unlawfully. They are \nacting outside the bounds of the Constitution.\n\n  The President has usurped power that is not his. He has done so in \nsetting out an amnesty. He spoke it, as any good monarch would, and \nthen the Secretary of Homeland Security put it into memos.\n  They effectively changed law from what it was on naturalization and \nimmigration passed by Congress, signed by the President. They just \nchanged it with the President speaking it and then Jeh Johnson, the \nSecretary of Homeland Security, doing memos.\n  Well, that is one thing. It does damage to this country. But when we \nare talking about an agreement which, under most everybody's \ndescription, will allow Iran to get nuclear weapons, there is \ndisagreement whether that will be later or sooner.\n  But it seems to be almost unanimous that, yes, it is going to allow \nthem to get nukes, but it will be later. Others of us know. They have \ncheated on every agreement they have entered since 1979, when they came \ninto existence as mullahs running a country.\n  Yes, President Carter welcomed the Ayatollah Khomeini as a man of \npeace--a peace of destruction--but they have broken every international \nagreement in which they participated in since 1979.\n  They have never been made to account or held accountable for taking \nour embassy employees hostage for over a year.\n  For heaven's sake, it is bad enough the administration negotiated \nwith a man that is being charged with desertion in return for giving \nradical Islamists, murderers, and terrorists back to continue to create \nhavoc and kill Americans and others, but now we are going to give them \nthe ability to have an agreement.\n  Well, they have broken every agreement they have entered for 36 \nyears. But this one, we think we in the Obama administration are so \nspecial that this time they are really not going to breach this \nagreement, despite the fact that the Ayatollah himself and the other \ntop leaders still say death to America, they still say they are \nplotting the destruction or overthrow of\n\n[[Page H6011]]\n\nIsrael, they still say they are plotting the destruction of the United \nStates.\n  And all the time they are doing that, we have people who didn't learn \nenough from the disastrous agreement with North Korea that gave the \nNorth Koreans nuclear weapons. Now they are trying the same strategy.\n  If we are nice enough and let them have the wherewithal to produce \nnuclear weapons, then maybe they really won't do that.\n  And if they do, it will be years down the road. But you don't even \nknow in Congress what the side deals are between the IAEA and Iran.\n  So where it says that this will hold Iran at bay for 8 years in this \nprovision or until the IAEA states the broader conclusion that Iran's \nnuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes, whichever is \nsooner, we don't even know what the deal between the IAEA and Iran is.\n  I heard recently the IAEA has been quoted as saying that, as far as \nthey know, their nuclear material is being used for peaceful purposes, \nbut they haven't been allowed into the material facilities for years.\n  As soon as this administration were to decide the agreement is \nfinalized and ratified, the IAEA could turn right around and say: As \nfar as we know, it is peaceful materials, but we haven't been allowed \ninto the military facilities where they are doing the real nuclear \nweapons work. They are going to give us samples, and the samples they \ngave us showed they are using it for peaceful purposes.\n  So surely they wouldn't lie, even though they have lied about every \ninternational agreement they have entered since 1979.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  For some reason, these people think they wouldn't lie now. I am \ntelling you that this Iranian agreement has to be stopped, and the \nUnited States voters gave the United States Senate over to a majority \nof Republicans in the last elections. As our great President has said, \nelections have consequences.\n  Now, he acts like the elections, where we got a majority, Republicans \ngot a majority in the House, that that was not meaningful, and he acts \nlike the voters giving the majority to Republicans in the Senate, that \ndidn't count, but it does count.\n  The only way it is going to count, it is going to have consequences, \nis if the Senate stands up--and I would encourage them, their leaders. \nMr. Speaker, I don't think I am asking too much to ask that the \nRepublican leadership have the same or close to the same amount of \nbackbone that Harry Reid did when he suspended cloture on \nconfirmations. I hope that is not too much to ask.\n  Just have Harry Reid--just almost as much as Harry Reid has stood up \nfor things he believes in, we are asking the Senate to, the Republicans \nin the Senate, please stand up, almost as much as Harry Reid did when \nhe set aside cloture on confirmations.\n  Now, a number of us sent a letter to Senate Majority Leader \nMcConnell, down the hall, imploring him to treat the Iranian agreement \nas the treaty it is because, if they just go along with the fiction \nthat the Iranian agreement does fall under the Corker bill and, \ntherefore, it takes two-thirds to disapprove in the Senate, two-thirds \nto disapprove in the House, well, here in the House, we have said the \nCorker bill doesn't apply at this time for sure. I would submit it \ndoesn't apply at all.\n  All we have to do is rely on our founding document, the Constitution, \nratified, made effective 1789, written 1787, and this article II, \nsection 2, second paragraph, beginning of the paragraph says the \nPresident ``shall have power, by and with the advice and consent of the \nSenate, to make treaties, provided two thirds of the Senators present \nconcur.''\n  The last thing the President wants is for us to follow the \nConstitution here because the Iranian agreement is a treaty. It \nmodifies other treaties, like the nonproliferation treaty.\n  It also, as was specifically not contemplated in the Corker bill, it \ndeals with allowing them to have weapons, purchase weapons, armaments, \nthat was not supposed to be in the Iranian agreement.\n  It also addresses the sanctions allowing them to have over $100 \nbillion, to $150 billion, so that they can use it for terrorist \nactivity, so that more Americans and Israeli, Jews, Christians, can be \nterrorized and killed--and I shouldn't fail to mention moderate \nMuslims. They are at every bit as much risk--or more--as Christians and \nJews because the first people they go after are Muslims that disagree \nwith them.\n  It is clearly a treaty. All the Senate has to do is take the example \nthat Harry Reid gave when he set aside cloture with 51 Democratic \nvotes, so they could get through a whole bunch of judges confirmed.\n  It must have been in hopes that they could have judges get to the \nbench that might have been stopped otherwise, judges like Justice \nGinsburg and Justice Kagan, who violated the law by not disqualifying \nthemselves on the same-sex marriage ruling. They performed same-sex \nmarriages.\n  The law requires them to, therefore, disqualify themselves because, \nby their actions and words, they made clear they thought it was \nconstitutional. Their impartiality was beyond being reasonably \nquestioned. They didn't have any impartiality.\n  I guess, when Leader Reid, at the time, got 51 Democrats to remove \ncloture as a problem for their confirmations, he probably did get some \nmore judges confirmed.\n  This is so much more serious--even then that, as serious as that is--\nbecause, if the Senate does not treat the Iranian agreement as the \ntreaty it is, then the President's already saying he is going to treat \nit as being approved--ratified is what that means.\n  When our U.S. administration treats the Iranian agreement as \nratified, then when our dear friend in the Middle East, Israel, defends \nitself, then the United States, under Commander in Chief Barack Obama, \nwill have to be at war with Israel for defending themselves against \nIran continuing to move toward nuclear weapons.\n  Now, it is possible, I don't think it will happen, but it is possible \nthat squeamish in Israel could win the day by saying--when we said \n``never again'' all those years, we meant never again, except we are \ngoing to let Iran have nukes and let them nuke us once they have \nnuclear weapons.\n  Other than the millions of Jews that may be killed with nuclear \nweapons Iran has, other than that, we mean never again, but I don't \nthink that is what a majority of Israelis are going to accept.\n  I have such complete respect for Prime Minister Netanyahu--I disagree \nwith him on issues; that is what friends often do. I don't believe when \nPrime Minister Netanyahu has said never again, he meant never again \nafter the Iranians nuke Israeli cities. They are going to have to do \nsomething.\n  If the Senate, with the Republican majority, does not stand up and \nhave a ratification vote on this treaty, the Iranian treaty, and in \nthat vote, fail to get the two-thirds to concur, as our Constitution \nrequires, then President Obama is going to go forward as if it were \nratified; and the consequences in the Middle East and to the United \nStates will be absolutely devastating.\n  As bad as the leadership is in North Korea, they are not radical \nIslamists. The leaders in North Korea do not advocate or at least \nhaven't been advocating suicide bombers. They haven't been advocating \nthat, if you die blowing up lots of innocent people in Israel or the \nUnited States, you go to paradise. They don't advocate that in North \nKorea.\n  This is 10 times--many, many, many times worse than North Korea \nhaving nukes. This is something that would be written about in history \nbooks years from now. If the Republican majority in the Senate doesn't \nstand up, it will be written that, when Iran got nuclear weapons--\nbecause the Republicans that were given the majority in the Senate, \nthey were given the majority in the House, but they refused to use \ntheir majority to vote on ratification of what was clearly a treaty.\n  As a result, the President was able to move forward as if it had been \nratified. Iran got nuclear weapons, and millions of people died, and it \nchanged the course of Western civilization forever.\n  If they have their way, we are headed for a dark age with nukes \nleading the way, and that will be on our heads. The blood from all \nthose lost lives, all of the murders, all of the bombings, all of\n\n[[Page H6012]]\n\nthose that occur with the tens of billions of dollars that the Obama \nadministration gives to Iran, all of those will not just be on \nPresident Obama's head, they will be on all of our heads because \nAmerica gave us the majority in the House and Senate, and we didn't \nhave the nerve to stop this horrendous, disastrous treaty with Iran.\n  Mr. Speaker, I even made an offer. I asked if the House just pass my \nresolution, which laid out this path for stopping this Iranian treaty, \nbut it ended with the Senate calling a vote on ratification as a treaty \nthe Iranian agreement is, and they fail to get two-thirds, then it \ncan't be enforced in any United States court or any court anywhere \naround the world because our Constitution requires ratification, the \nSenate took the vote, and they did not ratify it.\n\n  I said, if the Senate follows up the House and does that, I won't run \nagain. I know that will make a lot of people happy, especially those \nthat I am making very angry tonight with what I have got to say. I know \nthat there is a debate on, so probably most Republicans that are \npolitically plugged in are watching the debate.\n  I skipped some of the debate. I cannot avoid taking the opportunity, \nat least one more time, to beg our Republicans in the Senate to stop \nthis disaster to Western civilization so this chapter never has to be \nwritten about the demise of Western civilization going back to when the \nSenate refused to use their power to stop a horrendous treaty that gave \nto the biggest supporter of terrorism all of the instrumentality, all \nof the money they needed to set Western civilization back 100 years.\n  Here I am, Mr. Speaker. I promised you I wasn't going to take 30 \nminutes, but I had to take the time to beg the Senate: Use your \nmajority; 51 votes is all it takes.\n  Yes, I know, I know, the President normally sends things over that \nget on the executive calendar, and that is when you vote on things for \nthe President. I get that.\n  The President sent over this agreement. Now, he didn't call it a \ntreaty, but you should recognize it is a treaty. You have got one of \ntwo ways to bring it to the floor. One is you can say it is part of the \nexecutive calendar.\n  He sent it over to us, and under our own procedure, we set that for a \nvote, but it is a treaty, so we are treating it as a treaty, and it is \nmade through the executive calendar. I get that. You can do that in the \nSenate. Mr. Speaker, they could.\n  Or the other way is just to say: Look, the Constitution does not \nrequire that the President send us a treaty and say, Here is a treaty, \nnow ratify it, for us to take a vote on a treaty on whether or not to \nratify it.\n  That is not in the Constitution. It is in the Senate rules.\n  What does it take to suspend the Senate rules? It is 51 votes, and \nthe Senate has that many votes that know how bad this deal is.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  So either call it on the Executive Calendar because the President \nsubmitted, or suspend both the calendar rule and the cloture rule with \n51 votes and then bring it to the floor of the Senate for a vote where \nyou won't get the two-thirds needed to ratify it and we can all \nproclaim, ``This Iranian treaty is dead.'' Then we don't risk defending \nIran against our friend Israel in the beginning of a war that should \nnever have to start.\n  The alternative to this horrendous treaty is not war. As Michael Oren \nonce said, the day Iran believes the United States is a credible threat \nto attack its nuclear facilities is the day they stop enriching \nuranium. And he is exactly right. I hope he doesn't mind my saying \nthat, but he was exactly right.\n  War is not inevitable. It doesn't need to be. We don't need it. But \nif this Iranian treaty is not stopped by the Senate, it is going to be \na war that we don't see coming--at least our leaders don't--and \nmillions die. It doesn't have to happen. I hope and pray it won't. I \nurge the Senate to do the right thing: Have a vote on ratification, \nstop the Iranian treaty, and then we can get a better deal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/09/16/house-section/article/H6012-1", "month": "09", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6012]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Camens,\n\n                                  Chair of the Board of Directors,\n                                             Office of Compliance.\n\n        From the Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance\n\n\n    NOTICE OF PROPOSED RULEMAKING (NPRM or Notice), and request for \n                   comments from interested parties.\n\n     Modifications to the rights and protections under the Family \n         and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), Notice of Proposed \n         Rulemaking, as required by 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331, \n         Congressional Accountability Act of 1995, as amended \n         (CAA).\n     Background:\n       The purpose of this Notice is to propose modifications to \n     the existing legislative branch FMLA substantive regulations \n     under section 202 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302 et seq.), \n     which applies the rights and protections of sections 101 \n     through 105 of the FMLA to covered employees. These \n     modifications are necessary in order to bring existing \n     legislative branch FMLA regulations (adopted April 16, 1996) \n     in line with recent statutory changes to the FMLA, 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2601 et seq.\n       What is the authority under the CAA for these proposed \n     substantive regulations?\n       Section 202(a) of the CAA provides that the rights and \n     protections established by sections 101 through 105 of the \n     FMLA (29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2611-2615) shall apply to covered \n     employees.\n       Section 202(d)(1) and (2) of the CAA require that the \n     Office of Compliance (OOC) Board of Directors (the Board), \n     pursuant to section 1384 of the CAA, issue regulations \n     implementing the rights and protections of the FMLA and that \n     those regulations shall be ``the same as substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in the \n     subsection (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] except insofar as \n     the Board may determine, for good cause shown . . . that a \n     modification of such regulations would be more effective for \n     the implementation of the rights and protections under this \n     section.'' The modifications to the regulations issued by the \n     Board herein are on all matters for which section 202 of the \n     CAA requires regulations to be issued.\n       Are there currently FMLA regulations in effect?\n       Yes. On January 22, 1996, the OOC Board adopted and \n     submitted for publication in the Congressional Record the \n     original FMLA final regulations implementing section 202 of \n     the CAA, which applies certain rights and protections of the \n     FMLA. On April 15, 1996, pursuant to section 304(c) of the \n     CAA, the House and the Senate passed resolutions approving \n     the final regulations. Specifically, the Senate passed S. \n     Res. 242, providing for approval of the final regulations \n     applicable to the Senate and the employees of the Senate; the \n     House passed H. Res. 400 providing for approval of the final \n     regulations applicable to the House and the employees of the \n     House; and the House and the Senate passed S. Con. Res. 51, \n     providing for approval of the final regulations applicable to \n     employing offices and employees other than those offices and \n     employees of the House and the Senate. After the Senate and \n     the House passed these resolutions, the OOC Board formally \n     issued the FMLA regulations on April 19, 1996.\n       What does the FMLA provide?\n       The FMLA entitles eligible employees of covered employers \n     to take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate accrued paid leave, for up to a total of 12 \n     workweeks in a 12-month period: for the birth of the \n     employee's son or daughter and to care for the newborn child; \n     for the placement of a son or daughter with the employee for \n     adoption or foster care; to care for the employee's spouse, \n     parent, son, or daughter with a serious health condition; \n     when the employee is unable to work due to the employee's own \n     serious health condition; or for any qualifying exigency \n     arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent is a military member on covered active \n     duty (``qualifying exigency leave''). An eligible employee \n     may also take up to 26 workweeks of FMLA leave during a \n     ``single 12-month period'' to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness, when the \n     employee is the spouse, son, daughter, parent, or next of kin \n     of the servicemember.\n       FMLA leave may be taken in a block, or under certain \n     circumstances, intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     basis. In addition to providing job-protected family and \n     medical leave, employers must also maintain any preexisting \n     group health plan coverage for an employee on FMLA-protected \n     leave under the same conditions that would apply if the \n     employee had not taken leave. 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1312(a)(1) \n     (incorporating 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2614). Once the leave period is \n     concluded, the employer is required to restore the employee \n     to the same or an equivalent position with equivalent \n     employment benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of \n     employment. Id. Under the FMLA statute, but not applicable to \n     the legislative branch, if an employee believes that his or \n     her FMLA rights have been violated, the employee may file a \n     complaint with the Department of Labor (DOL) or file a \n     private lawsuit in federal or state court. Under the CAA, a \n     covered employee of the legislative branch may be awarded \n     damages if the employing office has violated the employee's \n     FMLA rights. The employee is entitled to reimbursement for \n     any monetary loss incurred, equitable relief as appropriate, \n     interest, attorneys' fees, expert witness fees, and court \n     costs. Liquidated damages also may be awarded. See 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2617.\n       What changes do the proposed amendments make?\n       First, these proposed amendments add the military leave \n     provisions of the FMLA enacted under the National Defense \n     Authorization Acts (NDAA) for Fiscal Years 2008 and 2010 \n     (Pub.L. 110-181, Div. A, Title V Sec. Sec. 585(a)(2), (3)(A)-\n     (D) and Pub.L. 111-84, Div. A, Title V Sec. 565(a)(1)(B) & \n     (4)), which: extend the availability of FMLA leave to family \n     members of the Regular Armed Forces for qualifying exigencies \n     arising out of a servicemember's deployment; define those \n     deployments covered under these provisions; extend FMLA \n     military caregiver leave for family members of current \n     servicemembers to include an injury or illness that existed \n     prior to service and was aggravated in the line of duty on \n     active duty; and extend FMLA military caregiver leave to \n     family members of certain veterans with serious injuries or \n     illnesses. This NPRM also sets forth a proposed revision to \n     the regulation defining ``spouse'' under the FMLA in light of \n     the DOL's February 25, 2015 Final Rule on the definition of \n     spouse and the United States Supreme Court's decision in \n     Obergefell, et al., v. Hodges, No. 14-556, 2015 WL 2473451 \n     (U.S. June 26, 2015), which requires a state to license a \n     marriage between two people of the same sex and to recognize \n     a marriage between two people of the same sex when their \n     marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-state.\n       Why are these changes to the FMLA regulations necessary?\n       The CAA requires that the FMLA regulations applicable to \n     the legislative branch and promulgated by the OOC, be the \n     same as substantive regulations issued by the Secretary of \n     Labor, unless good cause is shown for deviation therefrom. On \n     March 8, 2013, the DOL issued its Final Rule implementing its \n     amended FMLA regulations (77 FR 8962), which provide for \n     military caregiver leave for a veteran, qualifying exigency \n     leave for parental care, and special leave calculations for \n     flight crew employees. The OOC Board is required pursuant to \n     the CAA to amend its regulations to achieve parity unless \n     there is good cause shown to deviate from the DOL's \n     regulations.\n       In addition, the FMLA amendments providing additional \n     rights and protections for servicemembers and their families \n     were enacted into law by the NDAA for Fiscal Years 2008 and \n     2010. The Congressional committee reports accompanying the \n     bills containing these provisions do not comply with Section \n     102(b)(3) of the CAA in that, while the bills do contain \n     sections relating ``to terms and conditions of employment,'' \n     the accompanying reports do not ``describe the manner in \n     which the provision of the bill [relating to terms and \n     conditions of employment] . . . apply to the legislative \n     branch'' or ``include a statement of the reasons the \n     provision does not apply [to the legislative branch]'' (in \n     the case of a provision not applicable to the legislative \n     branch). 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1302(3); House Committee on Armed \n     Services, H.Rpt. 110-146 (May 11, 2007), H.Rpt. 111-166 (June \n     18, 2009). Consequently, when the FMLA was amended to add \n     these additional rights and protections, Congress failed to \n     make clear its intent as to whether these additional rights \n     and protections apply to the legislative branch.\\1\\ \n     Therefore, as there is no provision in the CAA that states \n     that the CAA will be considered amended whenever the FMLA is \n     amended, these proposed amendments to the regulations are \n     necessary to resolve any ambiguity regarding the \n     applicability of the 2008 and 2010 FMLA amendments to the \n     legislative branch by ensuring that protections under the CAA \n     are in line with existing public and private sector \n     protections under the FMLA.\\2\\ Accordingly, while these \n     regulations may technically require employing offices to do \n     more than what section 202 of the CAA currently requires, the \n     Board recommends that Congress use its rulemaking authority \n     to clarify that the rights and protections for legislative \n     branch servicemembers and their families have been expanded \n     in a manner consistent\n\n[[Page H6014]]\n\n     with the 2008 and 2010 amendments to the FMLA.\n       What do the military family leave provisions provide?\n       Section 585(a) of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2008 amends the \n     FMLA to provide leave to eligible employees of covered \n     employers to care for injured servicemembers and for any \n     qualifying exigency arising out of the fact that a covered \n     family member is on active duty or has been notified of an \n     impending call to active duty status in support of a \n     contingency operation (collectively referred to herein as \n     ``military family leave''). The provisions of this amendment \n     providing FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     became effective on January 28, 2008, when the law was \n     enacted. The provisions of this amendment providing for FMLA \n     leave due to a qualifying exigency arising out of a covered \n     family member's active duty (or call to active duty) status \n     were effective on January 16, 2009.\n       Section 565(a) of the NDAA for Fiscal Year 2010, enacted on \n     October 28, 2009, amends the military family leave provisions \n     of the FMLA. Pub. Law 111-84. The Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA \n     expands the availability of qualifying exigency leave and \n     military caregiver leave. Qualifying exigency leave, which \n     was made available to family members of the National Guard \n     and Reserve components under the Fiscal Year 2008 NDAA, is \n     expanded to include family members of the Regular Armed \n     Forces. The entitlement to qualifying exigency leave is \n     expanded by substituting the term ``covered active duty'' for \n     ``active duty'' and defining covered active duty for a member \n     of the Regular Armed Forces as ``duty during the deployment \n     of the member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country'' \n     and for a member of the Reserve components of the Armed \n     Forces as ``duty during the deployment of the member with the \n     Armed Forces to a foreign country under a call or order to \n     active duty under a provision of law referred to in section \n     101(a)(13)(B) of title 10, United States Code.'' 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2611(14). Prior to the Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA amendments, \n     there was no requirement that members of the National Guard \n     and Reserves be deployed to a foreign country.\n       The Fiscal Year 2010 NDAA amendments expand the definition \n     of a serious injury or illness for military caregiver leave \n     for current members of the Armed Forces to include an injury \n     or illness that existed prior to service and was aggravated \n     in the line of duty on active duty. 29 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 2611(18)(A). These amendments also expand the military \n     caregiver leave provisions of the FMLA to allow family \n     members to take military caregiver leave to care for certain \n     veterans. The definition of a ``covered servicemember,'' \n     which is the term the Act uses to indicate the group of \n     military members for whom military caregiver leave may be \n     taken, is broadened to include a veteran with a serious \n     injury or illness who is receiving medical treatment, \n     recuperation, or therapy, if the veteran was a member of the \n     Armed Forces at any time during the period of five years \n     preceding the date of the medical treatment, recuperation, or \n     therapy. 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611(15)(B). The amendments define a \n     serious injury or illness for a veteran as a ``qualifying (as \n     defined by the Secretary of Labor) injury or illness that was \n     incurred by the member in the line of duty on active duty in \n     the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of the \n     member's active duty and was aggravated by service in the \n     line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and that \n     manifested itself before or after the member became a \n     veteran.'' 29 U.S.C. Sec. 2611(18)(B).\n       What is the effect of amending the definition of \n     ``spouse''?\n       Amending the definition of ``spouse'' brings the \n     regulations in line with the DOL's February 25, 2015 Final \n     Rule and the United States Supreme Court's decision in \n     Obergefell et al. v. Hodges.\n       On February 25, 2015, the DOL published its Final Rule for \n     29 CFR 825 in the Federal Register, Vol. 80, No. 37, 9989. \n     This Final Rule changed the definition of ``spouse'' under \n     the FMLA in light of the United States Supreme Court's \n     decision in United States v. Windsor, which found section 3 \n     of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) to be unconstitutional. \n     The DOL's Final Rule amends the definition of spouse so that \n     eligible employees in legal same-sex marriages will be able \n     to take FMLA leave to care for their spouse or family member, \n     regardless of where they live.\n       Also, on June 26, 2015, the United States Supreme Court \n     issued Obergefell et al. v. Hodges, which requires a state to \n     license a marriage between two people of the same sex and to \n     recognize a marriage between two people of the same sex when \n     their marriage was lawfully licensed and performed out-of-\n     state.\n       To date, the DOL has not indicated whether it plans to \n     further amend the definition of spouse in light of the United \n     States Supreme Court's decision in Obergefell et al. v. \n     Hodges. Therefore, the Board invites comment regarding \n     whether the Board should adopt the DOL's current definition \n     of spouse or revise the definition of spouse as the Board has \n     proposed in sections 825.102 and 825.122.\n       Minor editorial changes are proposed to sections 825.120, \n     825.121, 825.122, 825.127, 825.201 and 825.202 to make gender \n     neutral references to husbands and wives, and mothers and \n     fathers where appropriate so that they apply equally to \n     opposite-sex and same-sex spouses. The OOC proposes using the \n     terms ``spouses'' and ``parents,'' as appropriate, in these \n     regulations. These editorial changes do not change the \n     availability of FMLA leave but simply clarify its \n     availability for all eligible employees who are legally \n     married.\n     Procedural Summary:\n       How are substantive regulations proposed and approved under \n     the CAA?\n       Pursuant to section 304 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1384, the \n     procedure for proposing and approving substantive regulations \n     provides that:\n       (1) the Board of Directors proposes substantive regulations \n     and publishes a general notice of proposed rulemaking in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (2) there be a comment period of at least 30 days after the \n     date of publication of the general notice of proposed \n     rulemaking;\n       (3) after consideration of comments by the Board of \n     Directors, the Board adopts regulations and transmits notice \n     of such action (together with the regulations and a \n     recommendation regarding the method for Congressional \n     approval of the regulations) to the Speaker of the House and \n     President Pro Tempore of the Senate for publication in the \n     Congressional Record;\n       (4) there be committee referral and action on the proposed \n     regulations by resolution in each House, concurrent \n     resolution, or by joint resolution; and\n       (5) there be final publication of the approved regulations \n     in the Congressional Record, with an effective date \n     prescribed in the final publication.\n       For more detail, please reference the text of 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384. This Notice of Proposed Rulemaking is step (1) of \n     the outline set forth above.\n       What is the approach taken by these proposed substantive \n     regulations?\n       The Board will follow the procedures as enumerated above \n     and as required by statute. The Board will review and respond \n     to any comments received under step (2) of the outline above, \n     and make any changes necessary to ensure that the regulations \n     fully implement section 210 of the CAA and reflect the \n     practices and policies particular to the legislative branch.\n       Are there substantive differences in the proposed \n     regulations for the House of Representatives, the Senate and \n     other employing offices?\n       No. The Board of Directors has identified no ``good cause'' \n     for varying the text of these regulations. Therefore, if \n     these regulations are approved as proposed, there will be one \n     text applicable to all employing offices and covered \n     employees. See 2 U.S.C. Sec. 1331(e)(2).\n       Are these proposed regulations also recommended by the \n     Office of Compliance's Executive Director, the Deputy \n     Executive Director for the Senate, and the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the House of Representatives?\n       As required by section 304(b)(1) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1384(b)(1), the substance of these regulations is also \n     recommended by the Executive Director, the Deputy Executive \n     Director for the Senate and the Deputy Executive Director for \n     the House of Representatives.\n       Are these proposed substantive regulations available to \n     persons with disabilities in an alternate format?\n       This Notice of Proposed Regulations is available on the \n     OOC's web site, www.compliance.gov, which is compliant with \n     section 508 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 \n     U.S.C. Sec. 794(d). This Notice can also be made available in \n     large print or Braille. Requests for this Notice in an \n     alternative format should be made to: Annie Leftwood, \n     Executive Assistant, Office of Compliance, 110 2nd Street, \n     S.E., Room LA-200, Washington, D.C. 20540; 202-724-9250; TDD: \n     202-426-1912; FAX: 202-426-1913.\n     60-DAY COMMENT PERIOD REGARDING THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS\n       How long do I have to submit comments regarding the \n     proposed regulations?\n       Comments regarding the OOC's proposed regulations set forth \n     in this Notice are invited for a period of sixty (60) days \n     following the date of the appearance of this Notice in the \n     Congressional Record.\n       How do I submit comments?\n       Comments must be made in writing to the Executive Director, \n     Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., Room LA-200, \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999.

Copies of submitted comments will be available for \n     review on the OOC's web site at www.compliance.gov, and at \n     the Office of Compliance, 110 Second Street, S.E., \n     Washington, D.C. 20540-1999, on Monday through Friday (non-\n     federal holidays) between the hours of 9:30 a.m. and 4:30 \n     p.m.\n     Summary:\n       The Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 (CAA), PL 104-\n     1, was enacted into law on January 23, 1995. The CAA, as \n     amended, applies the rights and protections of thirteen \n     federal labor and employment statutes to covered employees \n     and employing offices within the legislative branch of the \n     federal government. Section 202 of the CAA applies to \n     employees covered by the CAA, the rights and protections \n     established by sections 101\n\n[[Page H6015]]\n\n     through 105 of the Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 \n     (FMLA), 29 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 2611-2615. The above provisions \n     of section 202 became effective on January 1, 1997. 2 U.S.C. \n     Sec. 1312.\n       The Board of Directors of the Office of Compliance (OOC) is \n     now publishing proposed amended regulations to implement \n     section 202 of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. Sec. Sec. 1301-1438, as \n     applied to covered employees of the House of Representatives, \n     the Senate, and certain Congressional instrumentalities \n     listed below.\n       The purpose of these amended regulations is to implement \n     section 202 of the CAA. In this Notice of Proposed Rulemaking \n     (NPRM or Notice) the Board proposes that virtually identical \n     regulations be adopted for the Senate, the House of \n     Representatives, and the six Congressional instrumentalities. \n     Accordingly:\n       (1) Senate. It is proposed that the amended regulations as \n     described in this Notice be included in the body of \n     regulations that shall apply to entities within the Senate, \n     and this proposal regarding the Senate entities is \n     recommended by the OOC's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     Senate.\n       (2) House of Representatives. It is further proposed that \n     the amended regulations as described in this Notice be \n     included in the body of regulations that shall apply to \n     entities within the House of Representatives, and this \n     proposal regarding the House of Representatives entities is \n     recommended by the OOC's Deputy Executive Director for the \n     House of Representatives.\n       (3) Certain Congressional instrumentalities. It is further \n     proposed that the amended regulations as described in this \n     Notice be included in the body of regulations that shall \n     apply to the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, \n     the Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office, the \n     Office of the Architect of the Capitol (including the Botanic \n     Garden), the Office of the Attending Physician, and the \n     Office of Compliance; and this proposal regarding these six \n     Congressional instrumentalities is recommended by the OOC's \n     Executive Director.\n       Dates: Comments are due within 60 days after the date of \n     publication of this Notice in the Congressional Record.\n\n     Section-by-Section Discussion of Proposed Changes to the FMLA \n                              Regulations\n\n       The following is a section-by-section discussion of the \n     proposed revisions. Where a change is proposed to a \n     regulatory section, that section is discussed below. However, \n     as the DOL has significantly reorganized its FMLA \n     regulations, which the OOC's proposed regulations mirror, \n     many of the sections are moved into other areas of the \n     subpart. The OOC as a result will use the proposed section \n     and numbers to provide explanation and analysis of changes. \n     In addition, even if a section is not discussed, there may be \n     minor editorial changes or corrections that do not warrant \n     discussion. The titles to each section of the existing \n     regulations are in the form of a question. The proposal would \n     reword each question into the more common format of a \n     descriptive title, and the OOC invites comments on whether \n     this change is helpful. In addition, several sections have \n     been restructured and reorganized to improve the \n     accessibility of the information (e.g., guidance on leave for \n     pregnancy and birth of a child is addressed in one \n     consolidated section; an employing office's notice \n     obligations are combined in one section).\n     Section by Section Discussion\n     Subpart A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     Section 825.102 Definitions.\n       For the reasons stated below, the Board finds good cause to \n     depart from the DOL regulations with respect to some of the \n     definitions. For example, the term ``Act'' as defined in the \n     DOL regulations and referring to the FMLA can be confused \n     with the Congressional Accountability Act (CAA). Accordingly, \n     the definition of ``Act'' is excluded from the Board's \n     proposed regulations. In addition, to avoid any confusion, \n     the definition for ``Administrator'' in the DOL regulations \n     has been deleted. Similarly, as there is no airline flight \n     crew covered under the CAA, the definition of ``airline \n     flight crew employee'' has been deleted in the Board's \n     proposed regulations as have all references to ``airline \n     flight crew employee.''\n       Because the DOL definitions of ``commerce and industry or \n     activity affecting commerce'' and ``applicable monthly \n     guarantee'' involve concepts that do not apply to employing \n     offices covered by the CAA, the Board finds good cause to \n     exclude these definitions from the proposed regulations.\n       Because the DOL's definition of ``eligible employee'' \n     (paragraphs ii(3)(4)(5)(6)(7) in section 825.102) is not \n     consistent with the definition of ``eligible employee'' in \n     CAA section 202(a)(2)(B), the Board finds good cause to keep \n     the definition of ``employee'' that is used in the current \n     version of the OOC FMLA regulations and to exclude the \n     definition in the DOL regulation.\n       Likewise, because the definition of ``employer'' in CAA \n     section 202(a)(2)(A) is inconsistent with the definition in \n     the DOL regulations, the Board finds good cause to keep the \n     definition of ``employing office'' found in the current \n     regulations.\n       In the paragraphs defining ``health care provider,'' to \n     avoid confusion, the Board is substituting ``the Secretary'' \n     with ``the Department of Labor.'' Thus, the OOC FMLA \n     regulations include in the definition of ``health care \n     provider'' as ``any other person determined by the Department \n     of Labor to be capable of providing health care services.'' \n     825.102(1)(ii) (emphasis added).\n       Because these terms are not applicable to employing offices \n     covered by the CAA, the Board has also found good cause to \n     exclude from the proposed OOC regulations the DOL definitions \n     of ``person'' and ``public agency.''\n       Under the paragraph defining ``physical or mental \n     disability,'' the Board has replaced the language from the \n     DOL regulations indicating that 29 CFR part 1630 defines \n     these terms with language that states that regulations at 29 \n     CFR part 1630 issued by the Equal Employment Opportunity \n     Commission under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA), \n     42 U.S.C. Sec. 12101 et seq., as amended, provide guidance to \n     these terms. (Italics added).\n       The Board is proposing to adopt the following definition of \n     ``spouse'':\n       Spouse means a husband or wife. For purposes of this \n     definition, husband or wife refers to all individuals in \n     lawfully recognized marriages. This definition includes an \n     individual in a same-sex marriage. This definition also \n     includes an individual in a common law marriage that either: \n     (1) was entered into in a State that recognizes such \n     marriages or, (2) if entered into outside of any State, is \n     valid in the place where entered into and could have been \n     entered into in at least one State.\n     Section 825.105 Counting employees for determining coverage.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC's regulations.\n     Section 825.106 Joint Employer Coverage.\n       As joint employment relationships are treated differently \n     under the CAA than by the DOL, the Board finds good cause to \n     keep the language in the current OOC regulations in \n     paragraphs (b) through (e) of this section. Also, as it is \n     not applicable under the CAA, the Board finds good cause to \n     exclude from its definitions language relating to \n     Professional Employer Organizations (PEOs) as joint \n     employers. As the DOL has noted, PEOs contract with private \n     small businesses to provide services that large businesses \n     can afford, but small businesses cannot, such as compliance \n     with government standards, employer liability management, \n     retirement benefits, and other employment benefits. Congress \n     already provides these services for its employees.\n     Sections 825.107-825.109 Successor in interest coverage; \n         Public agency coverage; Federal agency coverage.\n       These sections do not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC's regulations. However, the Board invites \n     comment with respect to whether the DOL section 825.107, \n     Successor in interest coverage, should be adopted for the \n     legislative branch.\n     Section 825.110 Eligible employee.\n       The Board sees good cause to exclude from this section the \n     following language from the DOL regulations, which is not \n     applicable to the CAA:\n       ``(3) Is employed at a worksite where 50 or more employees \n     are employed by the employer within 75 miles of that \n     worksite. (See Sec. 825.105(b) regarding employees who work \n     outside the U.S.) ''\n       Similarly, the Board sees good cause to exclude from the \n     OOC regulations the following paragraph:\n       ``(e) Whether 50 employees are employed within 75 miles to \n     ascertain an employee's eligibility for FMLA benefits is \n     determined when the employee gives notice of the need for \n     leave. Whether the leave is to be taken at one time or on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, once an \n     employee is determined eligible in response to that notice of \n     the need for leave, the employee's eligibility is not \n     affected by any subsequent change in the number of employees \n     employed at or within 75 miles of the employee's worksite, \n     for that specific notice of the need for leave. Similarly, an \n     employer may not terminate employee leave that has already \n     started if the employee-count drops below 50. For example, if \n     an employer employs 60 employees in August, but expects that \n     the number of employees will drop to 40 in December, the \n     employer must grant FMLA benefits to an otherwise eligible \n     employee who gives notice of the need for leave in August.''\n     Section 825.111 Determining whether 50 employees are employed \n         within 75 miles.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Section 825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n       References in the DOL's regulations to state law in this \n     section and other sections throughout the DOL's regulations \n     have not been adopted by the Board because state law does not \n     apply to the legislative branch.\n       Further, in this section and other sections throughout the \n     DOL regulations, any references to spouses who are employed \n     at two different worksites of an employer located more than \n     75 miles from each other have not been adopted by the Board \n     because such scenarios are not applicable to the legislative \n     branch.\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     Section 825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n       Although the DOL amended its FMLA regulations to add \n     computer employees to the list of exempt employees who do not \n     lose their FLSA exempt status despite being provided unpaid \n     FMLA leave, the Board finds good cause not to include \n     ``computer employees'' to the list of employees who may\n\n[[Page H6016]]\n\n     qualify as exempt from the overtime and minimum wage \n     requirements of the FLSA. In light of the fact that the \n     Board's September 29, 2004 Proposed Regulations implementing \n     exemptions from the overtime pay requirements under the Fair \n     Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) were never enacted into \n     law and the existing OOC FLSA Regulations do not include \n     exemptions for computer employees, the OOC's FMLA regulations \n     should not include these employees in this section. The Board \n     specifically seeks comments to this departure from the DOL \n     regulations.\n       Further, any references in this section and other sections \n     throughout the DOL regulations which place limitations on an \n     employee who works for an employing office with fewer than 50 \n     employees have not been adopted by the Board because such \n     limitations do not apply to the legislative branch. See \n     825.111.\n     Section 825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n       The DOL regulations under section 825.207(f) permit an \n     employer to require that an employee's use of paid \n     compensatory time for a FMLA reason can be used against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n       As the Board does not know whether or under what \n     circumstances, employing offices currently allow or require \n     that paid compensatory time be used for a FMLA reason and be \n     counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement, the \n     Board proposes that the comparable OOC FMLA regulation read \n     as follows:\n       Under the FLSA, an employing office always has the right to \n     cash out an employee's compensatory time or to require the \n     employee to use the time. Therefore, if an employee requests \n     and is permitted to use accrued compensatory time to receive \n     pay for time taken off for an FMLA reason, or if the \n     employing office requires such use pursuant to the FLSA, the \n     time taken may be counted against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement.\n       The Board seeks comments from interested parties as to \n     whether such a provision is appropriate for the legislative \n     branch.\n     Section 825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n       The Board has changed what it believes to be a \n     typographical error in the DOL regulations and cross \n     references this section with section 825.102 and not section \n     825.800 when referring to the definition of ``group health \n     plan.''\n     Section 825.215 Equivalent position.\n       Any references from the DOL regulations in this section and \n     other sections to the Employee Retirement Income Security Act \n     (ERISA) have not been adopted by the Board because ERISA does \n     not apply to the legislative branch.\n     Section 825.216 Limitations on employee's right to \n         reinstatement.\n       The Board questions whether the following language in \n     section 825.216(a)(3) of the DOL regulations applies to the \n     legislative branch: ``On the other hand, if an employee was \n     hired to perform work on a contract, and after that contract \n     period the contract was awarded to another contractor, the \n     successor contractor may be required to restore the employee \n     if it is a successor employer. See Sec. 825.107.''\n       The Board proposes that the OOC regulations contain the \n     following language and requests comments from interested \n     parties, especially with respect to caucus or committee \n     employees: ``On the other hand, if an employee was hired to \n     perform work for one employing office for a project for a \n     specific time period, and after that time period has ended, \n     the same employee was assigned to work at another employing \n     office on the same project, the successor employing office \n     may be required to restore the employee if it is a successor \n     employing office.''\n     Section 825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n       For the reasons stated above, the Board finds good cause \n     not to follow the DOL changes to section 825.217(b) which \n     exempts computer employees from the minimum wage and overtime \n     requirements of the FLSA. As the language in the FLSA is \n     inconsistent with the OOC FLSA regulations, the Board \n     believes that this exemption should not be included. The \n     Board requests comments from interested parties on this \n     deletion.\n     Section 825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n       Except for the paragraph related to settlements, as noted \n     below, the Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with \n     respect to this section. Section 825.220 provides protection \n     for employees who request leave or otherwise assert FMLA \n     rights and includes new language discussing remedies when an \n     employing office interferes with an employee's rights under \n     the FMLA. This section further clarifies that the prohibition \n     against interference includes prohibitions against \n     retaliation as well as discrimination. The Board believes \n     that there is good cause to make changes to the DOL's \n     clarification of the settlement provision in paragraph (d) of \n     this section. Sections 1414 and 1415 of the CAA govern awards \n     and settlements made as a result of parties proceeding \n     through an OOC process. While the Board recognizes that \n     parties will now have the right to settle or release FMLA \n     claims without the approval of the OOC or a court, parties \n     seeking to release claims which were raised in an OOC process \n     pursuant to CAA sections 1414 and 1415 must still comply with \n     those provisions. Therefore, the Board proposes to insert the \n     following language: ``Except for settlement agreements \n     covered by 1414 and/or 1415 of the Congressional \n     Accountability Act, this does not prevent the settlement or \n     release of FMLA claims by employees based on past employing \n     office conduct without the approval of the Office of \n     Compliance or a court.''\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CAA.\n     Section 825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n       The Board proposes to follow the DOL regulations insofar as \n     they consolidate the employing office notice requirements \n     from sections 825.300, 825.301, 825.110 and 825.208 into one \n     comprehensive section addressing an employing office's notice \n     obligations. However, the Board finds good cause not to adopt \n     the DOL regulations in section 825.300(a) General notice, but \n     instead to keep the requirements found in the current OOC \n     regulations under section 825.301(a). The DOL regulations, at \n     section 825.300(a), address the requirement that employing \n     offices post a notice on employee rights and responsibilities \n     under the law and the civil monetary penalty provision in the \n     law for employing offices who willfully violate the posting \n     requirement. In 1995, while developing the current FMLA \n     regulations, the OOC Board determined that ``while the CAA \n     incorporates certain specific sections of the FMLA, the CAA \n     explicitly did not incorporate the notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements of sections 109 and 106(b) of the \n     FMLA. For the reasons discussed with respect to the FLSA, as \n     the CAA has not incorporated the notice posting and \n     recordkeeping requirements of the FMLA, the Board will not do \n     so.'' As a result, we find no authority that would require \n     employing offices covered under the CAA to provide notice \n     postings of employees' FMLA rights in the workplace. See \n     November 28, 1995 OOC Notice of Proposed Rulemaking S17628. \n     As to the remainder of the paragraphs in this section, the \n     Board finds no reason to depart from the amendments adopted \n     by the DOL.\n       The Board proposes to adopt section 825.300 regarding the \n     eligibility notice (825.300(b)); the rights and \n     responsibility notice (825.300(c)); the designation notice \n     (825.300(d)); and the consequences of failing to provide \n     notice (825.300(e)).\n       (b) Eligibility notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. The Board also proposes to adopt the DOL \n     regulations consolidating existing eligibility notice \n     requirements in current sections 825.110 and 825.301 into one \n     section, section 825.300(b) of the OOC regulations and to \n     strengthen and clarify them. For example, section \n     825.300(b)(1) of the DOL regulations requires an employer to \n     advise an employee of his or her eligibility status when the \n     employee requests leave under the FMLA. The regulations \n     extend the time frame for an employer to respond to an \n     employee's request for FMLA leave from two business days to \n     five business days. Further, the DOL regulations in section \n     825.300(b)(2) specify what information an employer must \n     convey to an employee as to eligibility status. The Board \n     also proposes in its regulations that an employing office \n     must provide reasons to an employee if he or she is not \n     eligible for FMLA leave, as do the DOL regulations. The \n     regulations limit that notification to any one of the \n     potential reasons why an employee fails to meet the \n     eligibility requirements.\n       Further, the proposed OOC regulations require employing \n     offices to include in the eligibility notice an explanation \n     of conditions applicable to the use of paid leave that runs \n     concurrently with unpaid FMLA. While this requirement is in \n     the current regulations, it is expanded to require that \n     employing offices also notify employees of their continuing \n     entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if they do not comply \n     with an employing office's required conditions for use of \n     paid leave.\n       (c) Rights and responsibilities notice.\n       The Board is following the DOL regulations separating the \n     notice of rights and responsibilities from the notice of \n     eligibility. Accordingly, if the employee is eligible for \n     FMLA leave, section 825.300(c) of the OOC regulations require \n     the employing office to provide the employee with specific \n     notice of his or her rights and obligations under the law and \n     the consequences of failing to meet those obligations.\n       To simplify the timing of the notice of rights and \n     responsibilities and to avoid unnecessary administrative \n     burden on employing offices, section 825.300(c)(1) of the \n     Board's proposed regulations requires employing offices to \n     provide this notice to employees at the same time they \n     provide the eligibility notice. Additionally, if the \n     information in the notice of rights and responsibilities \n     changes, section 825.300(c) requires the employing office to \n     notify the employee of any changes within five business days \n     of the first notice of the need for FMLA leave subsequent to \n     any change. This timing requirement will ensure that \n     employees receive timely notice of the expectations and \n     obligations associated with their FMLA leave each leave year \n     and also receive prompt notice of any change in those rights \n     or responsibilities when leave is needed during the leave \n     year.\n       In this section, employing offices are required to notify \n     employees of the method used for establishing the 12-month \n     period for\n\n[[Page H6017]]\n\n     FMLA entitlement, or, in the case of military caregiver \n     leave, the start date of the ``single 12-month period.''\n       Employing offices are not, however, required to provide the \n     certification form with the notice of rights and \n     responsibilities. Notice of any changes in the rights and \n     responsibilities notice must be provided within five business \n     days of the first notice of an employee's need for leave \n     subsequent to any change. Electronic distribution of the \n     notice of rights and responsibilities is allowed, so long as \n     the employing office can demonstrate that the employee (who \n     may already be on leave and who may not have access to \n     employing office-provided computers) has access to the \n     information electronically.\n       (d) Designation notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this requirement. Section 825.300(d) outlines the \n     requirements of the designation notice an employing office \n     must provide to an employee. Once the employing office has \n     enough information to determine whether the leave qualifies \n     as FMLA leave, the employing office must notify the employee \n     within five business days of making the determination whether \n     the leave has or has not been designated as FMLA leave. This \n     is an increase from the two-day time frame in the current OOC \n     regulations. Further, only one designation notice is required \n     for each FMLA-qualifying reason per leave year, regardless of \n     whether the leave is taken as a continuous block of leave or \n     on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis.\n       Further, the employing office must inform the employee of \n     the number of hours that would be designated as FMLA leave, \n     only upon employee request and no more often than every 30 \n     days if FMLA leave was taken during that period. To the \n     extent it is not possible to provide such information (such \n     as in the case of unforeseeable intermittent leave), the \n     employing office is required to provide such information to \n     the employee every 30 days if the employee took leave during \n     the 30-day period. The employing office is permitted to \n     notify the employee of the hours counted against the FMLA \n     leave entitlement orally and follow up with written \n     notification on a pay stub at the next payday (unless the \n     next payday is in less than one week, in which case the \n     notice must be no later than the subsequent payday). If the \n     employing office requires that paid leave be substituted for \n     unpaid leave, or that paid leave taken under an existing \n     leave plan be counted as FMLA leave, the employing office \n     must inform the employee of this designation at the time the \n     leave is designated as FMLA leave.\n       Although the designation notice has to be in writing, it \n     may be in any form, including a notation on the employee's \n     pay stub, and if the leave is not designated as FMLA leave, \n     the notice to the employee may be in the form of a simple \n     written statement. Employing offices can provide an employee \n     with both the eligibility and designation notice at the same \n     time in cases where the employing office has adequate \n     information to designate leave as FMLA leave when an employee \n     requests the leave.\n       Employing offices must provide written notice of any \n     requirement for a fitness-for-duty certification, including \n     whether the fitness-for-duty certification must address the \n     employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the \n     employee's position and, if so, to provide a list of the \n     essential functions of the employee's position with the \n     designation notice. If the employee handbook or other written \n     documents clearly provides that a fitness-for-duty \n     certificate will be required, written notice is not required, \n     but oral notice must be provided.\n       Finally, the employing office is required to notify the \n     employee if the information provided in the designation \n     notice changes. For example, if an employee exhausts his or \n     her FMLA leave entitlement and the leave will no longer be \n     designated as FMLA leave, the employing office must provide \n     the employee with written notice of this change consistent \n     with this section.\n       (e) Consequences of failing to provide notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.300(e) clarifies that failure to \n     comply with the notice requirements set forth in this section \n     could constitute interference with, restraint of, or denial \n     of the use of FMLA leave. The Board proposes that the \n     following language be included in the OOC regulations:\n       Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to \n     follow the notice requirements set forth in this section may \n     constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the \n     exercise of an employee's FMLA rights. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered See 825.400(c).\n     Section 825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.301 addresses an employing \n     office's obligations regarding timely designation of leave as \n     FMLA-qualifying and reiterates the requirement to notify the \n     employee of the designation within five business days. Among \n     other things, this section requires that the employing \n     office's designation decision be based only on information \n     received from the employee or the employee's representative \n     and also provides that, if the employing office does not have \n     sufficient information about the employee's reason for leave, \n     the employing office should inquire further of the employee \n     or of the employee's spokesperson.\n     Section 825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable \n         FMLA leave.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. In general, Section 825.302 addresses an \n     employee's obligation to provide notice of the need for \n     foreseeable FMLA leave. This includes requiring an employee \n     to give at least 30 days notice when the need for FMLA leave \n     is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance or ``as soon as \n     practicable'' if leave is foreseeable but 30 days notice is \n     not practicable. In such cases, employees must respond to \n     requests from employing offices to explain why it was not \n     possible to give 30 days notice. Further, the language in \n     this section defines ``as soon as practicable'' to be ``as \n     soon as both possible and practical, taking into account all \n     of the facts and circumstances in the individual case.'' This \n     is a change from defining ``as soon as practicable'' as \n     ``ordinarily within one or two business days.''\n       Further, when an employee seeks leave for the first time \n     for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need not expressly \n     assert rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     or even mention the FMLA but must provide: sufficient \n     information that indicates that a condition renders the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the job, or if \n     the leave is for a family member, that the condition renders \n     the family member unable to perform daily activities; the \n     anticipated duration of the absence; and whether the employee \n     or the employee's family member intends to visit a health \n     care provider or has a condition for which the employee or \n     the employee's family member is under the continuing care of \n     a health care provider. The regulations set forth the types \n     of information that an employee may have to provide in order \n     to put an employing office on notice of the employee's need \n     for FMLA-protected leave. Rather than establish a list of \n     information that must be provided in all cases, the \n     regulations provide additional guidance to employees so that \n     they would know what information to provide to their \n     employing offices. The nature of the information necessary to \n     put the employing office on notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     will vary depending on the circumstances.\n       Employees seeking leave for previously certified FMLA leave \n     must inform the employing office that the leave is for a \n     condition, covered servicemember's serious injury or illness, \n     or qualifying exigency that was previously certified or for \n     which the employee has previously taken FMLA leave.\n       While an employee must still comply with the employing \n     office's usual notice and procedural requirements for calling \n     in absences and requesting leave, under the new regulations, \n     language stating that an employing office cannot delay or \n     deny FMLA leave if an employee fails to follow such \n     procedures has been deleted. However, employing offices may \n     need to inquire further to determine for which reason the \n     leave is being taken, and employees will be required to \n     respond to such inquiries.\n       Additionally, the regulations make clear that the \n     requirement that an employee and employing office attempt to \n     work out a schedule without unduly disrupting the employing \n     office's operations applies only to military caregiver leave. \n     It does not apply to qualifying exigency leave.\n     Section 825.303 Employee notice requirements for \n         unforeseeable FMLA leave\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.303 addresses an employee's \n     obligation to provide notice when the need for FMLA leave is \n     unforeseeable. Section 825.303 retains the current standard \n     that employees must provide notice of their need for \n     unforeseeable leave ``as soon as practicable under the facts \n     and circumstances of the particular case,'' but instead of \n     expecting employees to give notice ``within no more than one \n     or two working days of learning of the need for leave,'' in \n     ``unusual circumstances,'' notice should be provided within \n     the time prescribed by the employing office's usual and \n     customary notice requirements applicable to such leave. \n     Section 825.303 also retains the current standard that \n     employees need not assert their rights under the FMLA or even \n     mention the FMLA to put employing offices on notice of the \n     need for unforeseeable FMLA leave, but adds the same language \n     used in proposed section 825.302 clarifying what information \n     must be provided in order to give sufficient notice to the \n     employing office of the need for FMLA leave. New regulations \n     in section 825.303 add that the employee has an obligation to \n     respond to an employing office's questions designed to \n     determine whether leave is FMLA-qualifying, explaining that \n     calling in ``sick,'' without providing additional \n     information, will not be sufficient notice.\n     Section 825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.304 follows the DOL's \n     reorganization of the rules that are applicable to leave \n     foreseeable at least 30 days in advance, leave foreseeable \n     less than 30 days in advance, and unforeseeable leave. This \n     section retains language that FMLA leave cannot be delayed \n     due to lack of required employee notice if\n\n[[Page H6018]]\n\n     the employing office has not complied with its notice \n     requirements.\n     Section 825.305 Certification, general rule.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Under the FMLA, as applied under the CAA, \n     employing offices are permitted to require that employees \n     provide a certification from their health care provider (or \n     their family member's health care provider, as appropriate) \n     to support the need for leave due to a serious health \n     condition. Section 825.305 sets forth the general rules \n     governing employing office requests for medical certification \n     to substantiate an employee's need for FMLA leave due to a \n     serious health condition. Military family leave provisions \n     have been added to permit employing offices to require \n     employees to provide a certification in the case of leave \n     taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Section \n     825.305 applies generally to all types of certification. In \n     most cases, for example, former references to ``medical \n     certification'' have been changed to ``certification.''\n       In section 825.305, the employing office should request \n     that an employee furnish certification from a health care \n     provider at the time the employee gives notice of the need \n     for leave or within five business days thereafter, or, in the \n     case of unforeseen leave, within five business days after the \n     leave commences. This time frame has been increased from two \n     to five business days after notice of the need for FMLA leave \n     is provided. Further, the employing office may request \n     certification at some later date if the employing office \n     later has reason to question the appropriateness of the leave \n     or its duration. This section also adds a 15-day time period \n     for providing a requested certification to all cases.\n       Definitions of incomplete and insufficient certifications \n     have been added in this section, as well as a procedure for \n     curing an incomplete or insufficient certification. This \n     procedure requires that an employing office notify the \n     employee in writing as to what additional information is \n     necessary for the medical certification and provides seven \n     calendar days in which the employee must provide the \n     additional information. If an employee fails to submit a \n     complete and sufficient certification, despite the \n     opportunity to cure the deficiency, the employing office may \n     deny the request for FMLA leave.\n       Section 825.305 also deletes an earlier provision that if a \n     less stringent medical certification standard applies under \n     the employing office's sick leave plan, only that lesser \n     standard may be required when the employee substitutes any \n     form of paid leave for FMLA leave and replaces it with a \n     provision allowing employing offices to require a new \n     certification on an annual basis for conditions lasting \n     beyond a single leave year.\n     Section 825.306 Content of medical certification for leave \n         taken because of an employee's own serious health \n         condition or the serious health condition of a family \n         member.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments with respect \n     to this section. Section 825.306 addresses the information an \n     employing office can require in the medical certification to \n     substantiate the existence of a serious health condition (of \n     the employee or a family member) and the employee's need for \n     leave due to the condition, and adds: the health care \n     provider's specialization; guidance as to what may constitute \n     appropriate medical facts, including that a health care \n     provider may provide a diagnosis; and whether intermittent or \n     reduced schedule leave is medically necessary. Section \n     825.306 clarifies that where a serious health condition may \n     also be a disability, employing offices are not prevented \n     from following the procedures under the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as applied under the CAA, for \n     requesting medical information. Section 825.306 also contains \n     new language that employing offices may not require employees \n     to sign a release of their medical information as a condition \n     of taking FMLA leave.\n       This section does not apply to the military family leave \n     provisions. The Board's proposed regulations have revised the \n     current optional certification form into two separate \n     optional forms, one for the employee's own serious health \n     condition and one for the serious health condition of a \n     covered family member.\n     Section 825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member; second and third opinions.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL's amendments covered \n     under this section. Section 825.307 addresses the employing \n     office's ability to clarify or authenticate a complete and \n     sufficient FMLA certification. Section 825.307 defines the \n     terms ``authentication'' and ``clarification.'' \n     ``Authentication'' involves providing the health care \n     provider with a copy of the certification and requesting \n     verification that the information on the form was completed \n     and/or authorized by the provider. The regulations add that \n     no additional medical information may be requested and the \n     employee's permission is not required. In contrast, \n     ``clarification'' involves contacting the employee's health \n     care provider in order to understand the handwriting on the \n     medical certification or to understand the meaning of a \n     response. As is the case with authentication, no additional \n     information beyond that included in the certification form \n     may be requested. Any contact with the employee's health care \n     provider must comply with the requirements of the HIPAA \n     Privacy Rule.\n       It is no longer necessary that the employing office utilize \n     a health care provider to make the contact with the \n     employee's health care provider, but the regulations do \n     clarify who may contact the employee's health care provider \n     and ensure that the employee's direct supervisor is not the \n     point of contact. Employee consent to the contact is no \n     longer required. However, before the employing office \n     contacts the employee's health care provider for \n     clarification or authentication of the FMLA certification, \n     the employee must first be given an opportunity to cure any \n     deficiencies in the certification. Section 825.307 also \n     provides requirements for an employing office's request for a \n     second opinion, and adds language requiring the employee or \n     the employee's family member to authorize his or her health \n     care provider to release relevant medical information \n     pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if such \n     information is requested by the second opinion health care \n     provider. Section 825.307 also increases the number of days \n     the employing office has to provide an employee with a \n     requested copy of a second or third opinion from two to five \n     business days. This section of the regulations does not apply \n     to the military family leave provisions.\n     Section 825.308 Recertifications for leave taken because of \n         an employee's own serious health condition or the serious \n         health condition of a family member.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL amendments covered in \n     this section. Section 825.308 of the regulations addresses \n     the employing office's ability to seek recertification of an \n     employee's medical condition. This section has been \n     reorganized to clarify how often employing offices may seek \n     recertification in situations where the minimum duration of \n     the condition, as opposed to the duration of the period of \n     incapacity, exceeds 30 days. Thus, an employing office may \n     request recertification no more often than every 30 days and \n     only in connection with an absence by the employee, unless \n     the medical certification indicates that the minimum duration \n     of the condition is more than 30 days, then an employing \n     office must wait until that minimum duration expires before \n     requesting a recertification. In all cases, an employing \n     office may request a recertification of a medical condition \n     every six months in connection with an absence by the \n     employee. An employing office may request recertification in \n     less than 30 days if, among other things, the employee \n     requests an extension of leave or circumstances described by \n     the previous certification change significantly. This section \n     clarifies that an employing office may request the same \n     information on recertification as required for the initial \n     certification and the employee has the same obligation to \n     cooperate in providing recertification as he or she does in \n     providing the initial certification.\n     Section 825.309 Certification for leave taken because of a \n         qualifying exigency.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the DOL's regulations under \n     this section. Under the military family leave provisions of \n     the DOL regulations, an employing office may require that \n     leave taken because of a qualifying exigency be supported by \n     a certification and require that the employee provide a copy \n     of the covered military member's active duty orders or other \n     documentation issued by the military which indicates that the \n     covered military member is on active duty (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to active duty) in \n     support of a contingency operation, as well as the dates of \n     the covered military member's active duty service. While a \n     form requesting this basic information may be used by the \n     employing office, no information may be required beyond that \n     specified in this section and in all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the qualifying \n     exigency for which the current need for leave exists. Section \n     825.309 also establishes the verification process for \n     certifications.\n       This section also provides that the information required in \n     a certification need only be provided to the employing office \n     the first time an employee requests leave because of a \n     qualifying exigency arising out of a particular active duty \n     or call to active duty of a covered military member. While \n     additional information may be needed to provide certification \n     for subsequent requests for exigency leave, an employee is \n     only required to give a copy of the active duty orders to the \n     employing office once. A copy of new active duty orders or \n     other documentation issued by the military only needs to be \n     provided to the employing office if the need for leave \n     because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different \n     active duty or call to active duty order of the same or a \n     different covered military member. See DOL (Form WH-384) and \n     OOC regulations proposed Form E.\n       An employing office may contact an appropriate unit of the \n     Department of Defense to request verification that a covered \n     military member has been called to active duty status (or \n     notified of an impending call to active duty status) in \n     support of a contingency operation. Again, no additional \n     information may be requested by the employing office and the \n     employee's permission is not required. This verification \n     process will protect employees from unnecessary intrusion \n     while still providing a useful tool for employing offices to \n     verify the certification information given to them.\n\n[[Page H6019]]\n\n       Consistent with the amendments to section 825.126(b)(6), \n     with respect to Rest and Recuperation qualifying exigency \n     leave, the employing office is permitted to request a copy of \n     the military member's Rest and Recuperation orders, or other \n     documentation issued by the military indicating that the \n     military member has been granted Rest and Recuperation leave, \n     as well as the dates of the leave, in order to determine the \n     employee's specific qualifying exigency leave period \n     available for Rest and Recuperation. Employing offices may \n     also contact the appropriate unit of the DOD to verify that \n     the military member is on active duty or call to active duty \n     status. The employee's permission is not required to conduct \n     such verifications. The employing office may not, however, \n     request any additional information.\n     Section 825.310 Certification for leave taken to care for a \n         covered servicemember (military caregiver leave).\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. While the military family \n     leave provisions of the NDAA amended the FMLA's certification \n     requirements to permit an employer to request certification \n     for leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, the \n     FMLA's existing certification requirements focus on providing \n     information related to a serious health condition--a term \n     that is not necessarily relevant to leave taken to care for a \n     covered servicemember. At the same time, the military family \n     leave provisions of the NDAA do not explicitly require that a \n     sufficient certification for purposes of military caregiver \n     leave provide relevant information regarding the covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness. Section 825.310 of \n     the DOL's regulations provide that when leave is taken to \n     care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or \n     illness, an employer may require an employee to support his \n     or her request for leave with a sufficient certification. An \n     employer may require that certain necessary information to \n     support the request for leave be supported by a certification \n     from one of the following authorized health care providers: \n     (1) A DOD health care provider; (2) a VA health care \n     provider; (3) a DOD TRICARE network authorized private health \n     care provider; or (4) a DOD non-network TRICARE authorized \n     private health care provider. Sections 825.310(b)-(c) of the \n     DOL regulations set forth the information an employing office \n     may request from an employee (or the authorized health care \n     provider) in order to support the employee's request for \n     leave. The DOL developed a new optional form, Form WH-385, \n     which the Board adopted for proposed OOC Form F. The Board \n     agrees that OOC Form F may be used to obtain appropriate \n     information to support an employee's request for leave to \n     care for a covered servicemember with a serious injury or \n     illness. However, an employing office may use any form \n     containing the following basic information: (1) whether the \n     servicemember has incurred a serious injury or illness; (2) \n     whether the injury or illness may render the servicemember \n     medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's office, \n     grade, rank, or rating; (3) whether the injury or illness was \n     incurred by the member in line of duty on active duty; and \n     (4) whether the servicemember is undergoing medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise on \n     outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list. However, as is the case for any \n     required certification for leave taken to care for a family \n     member with a serious health condition, no information may be \n     required beyond that specified above. In all instances, the \n     information on any required certification must relate only to \n     the serious injury or illness for which the current need for \n     leave exists.\n       Additionally, section 825.310 of the proposed OOC \n     regulations provides that an employing office requiring an \n     employee to submit a certification for leave to care for a \n     covered servicemember must accept as sufficient certification \n     ``invitational travel orders'' (ITOs) or ``invitational \n     travel authorizations'' (ITAs) issued by the DOD for a family \n     member to join an injured or ill servicemember at his or her \n     bedside. If an employee will need leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember beyond the expiration date specified in an ITO \n     or an ITA, the regulations provide that an employing office \n     may request further certification from the employee. Lastly \n     this section provides that in all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave.\n       The regulations also permit an eligible employee who is a \n     spouse, parent, son, daughter or next of kin of a covered \n     servicemember to submit an ITO or ITA issued to another \n     family member as sufficient certification for the duration of \n     time specified in the ITO or ITA, even if the employee \n     seeking leave is not the named recipient on the ITO or ITA. \n     The regulations further permit an employing office to \n     authenticate and clarify medical certifications submitted to \n     support a request for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember using the procedures applicable to FMLA leave \n     taken to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition. However, unlike the recertification, second and \n     third opinion processes used for other types of FMLA leave, \n     recertification, second and third opinions are not warranted \n     for purposes of military caregiver leave when the \n     certification has been completed by a DOD health care \n     provider, a VA health care provider, a DOD TRICARE network \n     authorized private health care provider, or a DOD non-network \n     TRICARE authorized private health care provider, but are \n     permitted when the certification has been completed by a \n     health care provider who is not affiliated with the DOD, VA, \n     or TRICARE.\n       An employee seeking to take military caregiver leave must \n     provide the requested certification to the employing office \n     within the time frame requested by the employing office \n     (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the \n     employing office's request), unless it is not practicable \n     under the particular circumstances to do so despite the \n     employee's diligent, good faith efforts.\n     Section 825.312 Fitness-for-duty certification.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL's regulations under this section. Section 825.312 \n     addresses the fitness for-duty certification that an employee \n     may be required to submit upon return to work from FMLA \n     leave. This section clarifies that employees have the same \n     obligation to provide a complete certification or provide \n     sufficient authorization to the health care provider in order \n     for that person to provide the information directly to the \n     employing office in the fitness-for-duty certification \n     process as they do in the initial certification process. The \n     employing office may require that the fitness-for-duty \n     certification address the employee's ability to perform the \n     essential functions of the employee's job, as long as the \n     employing office provides the employee with a list of those \n     essential job functions no later than the employing office \n     provides the designation notice. The designation notice must \n     indicate that the certification address the employee's \n     ability to perform those essential functions. An employing \n     office may contact the employee's health care provider \n     directly, consistent with the procedure in proposed section \n     825.307(a), for purposes of authenticating or clarifying the \n     fitness-for-duty certification. The employing office is \n     required to advise the employee in the eligibility notice \n     required by proposed section 825.300(b) if the employing \n     office will require a fitness-for-duty certification to \n     return to work. Employees are not entitled to the \n     reinstatement protections of the Act if they do not provide \n     the required fitness-for-duty certification or request \n     additional FMLA leave.\n       Section 825.312 also requires that the employing office \n     uniformly apply its policies permitting fitness-for-duty \n     certifications to intermittent and reduced schedule leave \n     users when reasonable safety concerns are present, but limits \n     the frequency of such certifications to once in a 30-day \n     period in which intermittent or reduced schedule leave was \n     taken. ``Reasonable safety concerns'' means a reasonable \n     belief of a significant risk of harm to the individual \n     employee or others. In determining whether reasonable safety \n     concerns exist, an employing office should consider the \n     nature and severity of the potential harm and the likelihood \n     that potential harm will occur. This is meant to be a high \n     standard. Thus, the determination that there are reasonable \n     safety concerns must rely on objective factual evidence, not \n     subjective perceptions. Employing offices cannot, under this \n     section, require such certifications in all intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule situations, but only where reasonable \n     safety concerns are present. There is no fitness-for-duty \n     certification form, nor is there any specific format such a \n     certification must follow as long as it contains the required \n     information. An employing office is allowed to require that \n     the fitness-for-duty certification address the employee's \n     ability to perform the essential functions of his or her \n     position. However, the employing office can choose to accept \n     a simple statement in place of the fitness-for-duty \n     certification (or not require a fitness-for-duty \n     certification at all).\n       There is no second and third opinion process for a fitness-\n     for-duty certification. A fitness-for-duty certification need \n     only address the condition for which FMLA leave was taken and \n     the employee's ability to perform the essential functions of \n     the job. The employee's health care provider determines \n     whether a separate examination is required in order to \n     determine the employee's fitness to return to duty under the \n     FMLA. A medical examination at the employing office's expense \n     may be required only after the employee has returned from \n     FMLA leave and must be job-related and consistent with \n     business necessity as required by the ADA. The employing \n     office cannot delay the employee's return to work while \n     arranging for and having the employee undergo a medical \n     examination.\n     Section 825.313 Failure to provide certification.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.313 explains \n     the consequences for an employee who fails to provide medical \n     certification in a timely manner. An employing office may \n     ``deny'' FMLA leave until the required certification is \n     provided. This section also addresses the consequences of \n     failing to provide timely recertification. Section 825.313 \n     also clarifies that recertification does not apply to leave \n     taken for a qualifying exigency or to care for a covered \n     servicemember.\n       Employees must be provided at least 15 calendar days to \n     provide the requested certification, and are entitled to \n     additional\n\n[[Page H6020]]\n\n     time when they are unable to meet that deadline despite their \n     diligent, good-faith efforts. An employee's certification (or \n     recertification) is not untimely until that period has \n     passed. Employing offices may deny FMLA protection when an \n     employee fails to provide a timely certification or \n     recertification, but it does not require employing offices to \n     do so. Employing offices always have the option of accepting \n     an untimely certification and not denying FMLA protection to \n     any absences that occurred during the period in which the \n     certification was delayed.\n     Subpart D--Enforcement Mechanisms\n     Section 825.400 Enforcement, general rules.\n       The Board finds good cause not to adopt DOL section 825.400 \n     because the enforcement of FMLA violations is different in \n     the legislative branch as opposed to the workforces regulated \n     by the DOL. The OOC section 825.400 remains the same.\n     Sections 825.401-825.404 Filing a complaint with the Federal \n         Government; Violations of the posting requirement; \n         Appealing the assessment of a penalty for willful \n         violation of the posting requirement; Consequences for an \n         employer when not paying the penalty assessment after a \n         final order is issued.\n       These sections do not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Subpart E--Recordkeeping Requirements\n     Section 825.500 Recordkeeping requirements.\n       This section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Subpart F--Special Rules Applicable to Employees of Schools\n     Sections 825.600-825.604 Special rules for school employees, \n         definitions; Special rules for school employees, \n         limitations on intermittent leave; Special rules for \n         school employees, limitations on leave near the end of an \n         academic term; Special rules for school employees, \n         duration of FMLA leave; Special rules for school \n         employees, restoration to an equivalent position.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under these sections. Sections 825.600-\n     825.604 cover the special rules applicable to instructional \n     employees. When an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced schedule basis to \n     care for a covered servicemember, the employee may choose to \n     either (1) take leave for a period or periods of particular \n     duration; or (2) transfer temporarily to an available \n     alternative position with equivalent pay and benefits that \n     better accommodates recurring periods of leave.\n       These sections also extend some of the limitations on leave \n     near the end of an academic term to leave requested during \n     this period to care for a covered servicemember. If an \n     instructional employee begins leave for a purpose other than \n     the employee's own serious health condition during the five-\n     week period before the end of the term, the employing office \n     may require the employee to continue taking leave until the \n     end of the term if the leave will last more than two weeks \n     and the employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term. Further, an employing \n     office may require an instructional employee to continue \n     taking leave until the end of the term if the employee begins \n     leave that will last more than five working days for a \n     purpose other than the employee's own serious health \n     condition during the three-week period before the end of the \n     term. The types of leave that are subject to the limitations \n     are: (1) leave because of the birth of a son or daughter, (2) \n     leave because of the placement of a son or daughter for \n     adoption or foster care, (3) leave taken to care for a \n     spouse, parent, or child with a serious health condition, and \n     (4) leave taken to care for a covered servicemember.\n     Subpart G--Effect of Other Laws, Employing Office Practices, \n         and Collective Bargaining Agreements on Employee Rights \n         Under FMLA\n     Section 825.700 Interaction with employing office's policies.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.700 provides \n     that an employing office may not limit the rights established \n     by the FMLA through an employment benefit program or plan, \n     but an employing office may provide greater leave rights than \n     the FMLA requires. This section also provides that an \n     employing office may amend existing leave programs, so long \n     as they comply with the FMLA, and that nothing in the FMLA is \n     intended to discourage employing offices from adopting or \n     retaining more generous leave policies. The Board proposes to \n     follow the DOL regulations and delete from the current OOC \n     section 825.700(a) the following: ``If an employee takes paid \n     or unpaid leave and the employing office does not designate \n     the leave as FMLA leave, the leave taken does not count \n     against an employee's FMLA entitlement.'' As explained by the \n     DOL, this last sentence of section 825.700(a) was deleted in \n     order to conform to the U.S. Supreme Court's decision in \n     Ragsdale v. Wolverine World Wide, 535 U.S. 81 (2002), which \n     specifically invalidated this provision.\n     Section 825.701 Interaction with State laws.\n       This DOL section does not apply to the CAA and will remain \n     reserved in the OOC regulations.\n     Section 825.702 Interaction with Federal and State anti-\n         discrimination laws.\n       The Board proposes to adopt the amendments covered in the \n     DOL regulations under this section. Section 825.702 addresses \n     the interaction between the FMLA and other Federal and State \n     antidiscrimination laws. Section 825.702 discusses the \n     interaction between the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA) and the FMLA. Under \n     USERRA, a returning servicemember would be entitled to FMLA \n     leave if, after including the hours that he or she would have \n     worked for the civilian employing office during the period of \n     military service, the employee would have met the FMLA \n     eligibility threshold. This is not an expansion of FMLA \n     rights through regulation; this is a requirement of USERRA.\n       With respect to the interaction of the FMLA and ADA, where \n     both laws may apply, the applicability of each statute needs \n     to be evaluated independently.\n       Further, the reference to employers who receive Federal \n     financial assistance and employers who contract with the \n     Federal government in this section has not been adopted by \n     the Board because federal contractor employers are not \n     covered by the CAA.\n       In its final regulations, the DOL removed the following \n     optional-use forms and notices from the Appendix of the \n     regulations, but continued to make them available to the \n     public on the WHD Web site: Forms WH-380-E (Certification of \n     Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious Health \n     Condition); WH-380-F (Certification of Health Care Provider \n     for Family Member's Serious Health Condition); WH-381 (Notice \n     of Eligibility and Rights & Responsibilities); WH-382 \n     (Designation Notice); WH-384 (Certification of Qualifying \n     Exigency for Military Family Leave); WH-385 (Certification \n     for Serious Injury or Illness of Current Servicemember for \n     Military Family Leave); and WH-385-V (Certification for \n     Serious Injury or Illness of a Veteran for Military Caregiver \n     Leave). The Board proposes to revise its forms and to make \n     the following OOC forms available on its website: Form A: \n     Certification of Health Care Provider for Employee's Serious \n     Health Condition; Form B: Certification of Health Care \n     Provider for Family Member's Serious Health Condition; Form \n     C: Notice of Eligibility and Rights and Responsibilities; \n     Form D: Designation Notice to Employee of FMLA Leave; Form E: \n     Certification of Qualifying Exigency for Military Family \n     Leave; Form F: Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of \n     Covered Servicemember for Military Family Leave; and Form G: \n     Certification for Serious Injury or Illness of a Veteran for \n     Military Caregiver Leave. The Board's proposed forms now \n     include references to the Genetic Information \n     Nondiscrimination Act of 2008, which is made applicable to \n     employees covered under the CAA. The Board invites comment on \n     whether these forms should be included in the regulations, or \n     whether covered employees and employing offices should be \n     directed to the DOL website for the appropriate forms. In any \n     event, the use of a specific set of forms is optional and \n     other forms requiring the same information may be used \n     instead. In proposing these revised forms, the Board \n     recognizes that the use of specific forms play a key role in \n     employing offices' compliance with the FMLA and employees' \n     ability to take FMLA protected leave when needed.\n\n   Substantive Regulations Proposed by the Board of Directors of the \nOffice of Compliance Extending Rights and Protections Under the Family \n                  and Medical Act of 1996, as amended\n\n\n                           FINAL REGULATIONS\n\n     Part 825--Family and Medical Leave\n     825.1 Purpose and Scope.\n     Subpart A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     825.100 The Family and Medical Leave Act.\n     825.101 Purpose of the FMLA.\n     825.102 Definitions.\n     825.103 [Reserved]\n     825.104 Covered employing offices.\n     825.105 Counting employees for determining coverage.\n     825.106 Joint employer coverage.\n     825.107 Successor in interest coverage.\n     825.108-825.109 [Reserved]\n     825.110 Eligible employee.\n     825.111 [Reserved]\n     825.112 Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule.\n     825.113 Serious health condition.\n     825.114 Inpatient care.\n     825.115 Continuing treatment.\n     825.116-825.118 [Reserved]\n     825.119 Leave for treatment of substance abuse.\n     825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n     825.121 Leave for adoption or foster care.\n     825.122 Definitions of covered servicemember, spouse, parent, \n         son or daughter, next of kin of a covered servicemember, \n         adoption, foster care, son or daughter on covered active \n         duty or call to covered active duty status, son or \n         daughter of a covered servicemember, and parent of a \n         covered servicemember.\n     825.123 Unable to perform the functions of the position.\n     825.124 Needed to care for a family member or covered \n         servicemember.\n     825.125 Definition of health care provider.\n     825.126 Leave because of a qualifying exigency.\n     825.127 Leave to care for a covered servicemember with a \n         serious injury or illness (military caregiver leave).\n\n[[Page H6021]]\n\n  \n\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n     825.200 Amount of leave.\n     825.201 Leave to care for a parent.\n     825.202 Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule.\n     825.203 Scheduling of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.\n     825.204 Transfer of an employee to an alternative position \n         during intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave.\n     825.205 Increments of FMLA leave for intermittent or reduced \n         schedule leave.\n     825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n     825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n     825.208 [Reserved]\n     825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n     825.210 Employee payment of group health benefit premiums.\n     825.211 Maintenance of benefits under multi-employer health \n         plans.\n     825.212 Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments.\n     825.213 Employing office recovery of benefit costs.\n     825.214 Employee right to reinstatement.\n     825.215 Equivalent position.\n     825.216 Limitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\n     825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n     825.218 Substantial and grievous economic injury.\n     825.219 Rights of a key employee.\n     825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CAA.\n     825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n     825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n     825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n     825.303 Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n     825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n     825.305 Certification, general rule.\n     825.306 Content of medical certification for leave taken \n         because of an employee's own serious health condition or \n         the serious health condition of a family member.\n     825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member;

See 825.102 of these \n     regulations for that definition.) The purpose of this part is \n     to set forth the regulations to carry out the provisions of \n     section 202 of the CAA.\n       (b) These regulations are issued by the Board of Directors \n     (Board) of the Office of Compliance, pursuant to sections \n     202(d) and 304 of the CAA, which direct the Board to \n     promulgate regulations implementing section 202 that are \n     ``the same as substantive regulations promulgated by the \n     Secretary of Labor to implement the statutory provisions \n     referred to in subsection (a) [of section 202 of the CAA] \n     except insofar as the Board may determine, for good cause \n     shown . . . that a modification of such regulations would be \n     more effective for the implementation of the rights and \n     protections under this section.'' The regulations issued by \n     the Board herein are on all matters for which section 202 of \n     the CAA requires regulations to be issued. Specifically, it \n     is the Board's considered judgment, based on the information \n     available to it at the time of the promulgation of these \n     regulations, that, with the exception of regulations adopted \n     and set forth herein, there are no other ``substantive \n     regulations promulgated by the Secretary of Labor to \n     implement the statutory provisions referred to in subsection \n     (a) [of section 202 of the CAA].''\n       (c) In promulgating these regulations, the Board has made \n     certain technical and nomenclature changes to the regulations \n     as promulgated by the Secretary. Such changes are intended to \n     make the provisions adopted accord more naturally to \n     situations in the legislative branch. However, by making \n     these changes, the Board does not intend a substantive \n     difference between these regulations and those of the \n     Secretary from which they are derived. Moreover, such \n     changes, in and of themselves, are not intended to constitute \n     an interpretation of the regulation or of the statutory \n     provisions of the CAA upon which they are based.\n     SUBPART A--COVERAGE UNDER THE FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE ACT\n     825.100 The Family and Medical Leave Act.\n       (a) The Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993 (FMLA), as \n     made applicable by the Congressional Accountability Act \n     (CAA), allows eligible employees of an employing office to \n     take job-protected, unpaid leave, or to substitute \n     appropriate paid leave if the employee has earned or accrued \n     it, for up to a total of 12 workweeks in any 12 months (see \n     825.200(b)) because of the birth of a child and to care for \n     the newborn child, because of the placement of a child with \n     the employee for adoption or foster care, because the \n     employee is needed to care for a family member (child, \n     spouse, or parent) with a serious health condition, because \n     the employee's own serious health condition makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of his or her job, \n     or because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the fact \n     that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is a \n     military member on active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status (or has been notified of an impending call or order to \n     covered active duty). In addition, eligible employees of a \n     covered employing office may take job-protected, unpaid \n     leave, or substitute appropriate paid leave if the employee \n     has earned or accrued it, for up to a total of 26 workweeks \n     in a single 12-month period to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. In certain \n     cases, FMLA leave may be taken on an intermittent basis \n     rather than all at once, or the employee may work a part-time \n     schedule.\n       (b) An employee on FMLA leave is also entitled to have \n     health benefits maintained while on leave as if the employee \n     had continued to work instead of taking the leave. If an \n     employee was paying all or part of the premium payments prior \n     to leave, the employee would continue to pay his or her share \n     during the leave period. The employing office or a disbursing \n     or other financial office of the House of Representatives or \n     [italicized language is in only the House and \n     Instrumentalities versions of the regulations] the Senate may \n     recover its share only if the employee does not return to \n     work for a reason other than the serious health condition of \n     the employee or the employee's covered family member, the \n     serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, or \n     another reason beyond the employee's control.\n       (c) An employee generally has a right to return to the same \n     position or an equivalent position with equivalent pay, \n     benefits, and working conditions at the conclusion of the \n     leave. The taking of FMLA leave cannot result in the loss of \n     any benefit that accrued prior to the start of the leave.\n       (d) The employing office generally has a right to advance \n     notice from the employee. In addition, the employing office \n     may require an employee to submit certification to \n     substantiate that the leave is due to the serious health \n     condition of the employee or the employee's covered family \n     member, due to the serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember, or because of a qualifying exigency. Failure \n     to comply with these requirements may result in a delay in \n     the start of FMLA leave. Pursuant to a uniformly applied \n     policy, the employing office may also require that an \n     employee present a certification of fitness to return to work \n     when the absence was caused by the employee's serious health \n     condition (see 825.312 and 825.313)).\n\n[[Page H6022]]\n\n     The employing office may delay restoring the employee to \n     employment without such certificate relating to the health \n     condition which caused the employee's absence.\n     825.101 Purpose of the FMLA.\n       (a) FMLA is intended to allow employees to balance their \n     work and family life by taking reasonable unpaid leave for \n     medical reasons, for the birth or adoption of a child, for \n     the care of a child, spouse, or parent who has a serious \n     health condition, for the care of a covered servicemember \n     with a serious injury or illness, or because of a qualifying \n     exigency arising out of the fact that the employee's spouse, \n     son, daughter, or parent is a military member on covered \n     active duty or call to covered active duty status. The FMLA \n     is intended to balance the demands of the workplace with the \n     needs of families, to promote the stability and economic \n     security of families, and to promote national interests in \n     preserving family integrity. It was intended that the FMLA \n     accomplish these purposes in a manner that accommodates the \n     legitimate interests of employing offices, and in a manner \n     consistent with the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth \n     Amendment in minimizing the potential for employment \n     discrimination on the basis of sex, while promoting equal \n     employment opportunity for men and women.\n       (b) The FMLA was predicated on two fundamental concerns--\n     the needs of the American workforce, and the development of \n     high-performance organizations. Increasingly, America's \n     children and elderly are dependent upon family members who \n     must spend long hours at work. When a family emergency \n     arises, requiring workers to attend to seriously-ill children \n     or parents, or to newly-born or adopted infants, or even to \n     their own serious illness, workers need reassurance that they \n     will not be asked to choose between continuing their \n     employment, and meeting their personal and family obligations \n     or tending to vital needs at home.\n       (c) The FMLA is both intended and expected to benefit \n     employing offices as well as their employees. A direct \n     correlation exists between stability in the family and \n     productivity in the workplace. FMLA will encourage the \n     development of high-performance organizations. When workers \n     can count on durable links to their workplace they are able \n     to make their own full commitments to their jobs. The record \n     of hearings on family and medical leave indicate the powerful \n     productive advantages of stable workplace relationships, and \n     the comparatively small costs of guaranteeing that those \n     relationships will not be dissolved while workers attend to \n     pressing family health obligations or their own serious \n     illness.\n     825.102 Definitions.\n       For purposes of this part:\n       ADA means the Americans With Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. \n     12101 et seq., as amended).\n       CAA means the Congressional Accountability Act of 1995 \n     (Pub.

A period of \n     incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition \n     for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or \n     family member must be under the continuing supervision of, \n     but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care \n     provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or \n     the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (5) Conditions requiring multiple treatments. Any period of \n     absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period \n     of recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a \n     provider of health care services under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider, for:\n       (i) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; \n     or\n       (ii) A condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive full calendar days \n     in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (6) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (2) or (3) of this definition qualify for FMLA leave even \n     though the employee or the covered family member does not \n     receive treatment from a health care provider during the \n     absence, and even if the absence does not last more than \n     three consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an \n     employee with asthma may be unable to report for work due to \n     the onset of an asthma attack or because the employee's \n     health care provider has advised the employee to stay home \n     when the pollen count exceeds a certain level.

Restorative dental or \n     plastic surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous \n     growths are serious health conditions provided all the other \n     conditions of this regulation are met. Mental illness or \n     allergies may be serious health conditions, but only if all \n     the conditions of 825.113 are met.\n       Serious injury or illness means:\n       (1) In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, \n     including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, an \n     injury or illness that was incurred by the covered \n     servicemember in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces or that existed before the beginning of the member's \n     active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty \n     on active duty in the Armed Forces and that may render the \n     servicemember medically unfit to perform the duties of the \n     member's office, grade, rank, or rating; and\n       (2) In the case of a covered veteran, an injury or illness \n     that was incurred by the member in the line of duty on active \n     duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the beginning of \n     the member's active duty and was aggravated by service in the \n     line of duty on active duty in the Armed Forces) and \n     manifested itself before or after the member became a \n     veteran, and is:\n       (i) A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was \n     incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member \n     of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember unable to \n     perform the duties of the servicemember's office, grade, \n     rank, or rating; or\n       (ii) A physical or mental condition for which the covered \n     veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or \n     greater, and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, \n     on the condition precipitating the need for military \n     caregiver leave; or\n       (iii) A physical or mental condition that substantially \n     impairs the covered veteran's ability to secure or follow a \n     substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or \n     disabilities related to military service, or would do so \n     absent treatment; or\n       (iv) An injury, including a psychological injury, on the \n     basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive \n     Assistance for Family Caregivers.

See also 825.126(a)(5).\n       Spouse, as defined in the FMLA and as made applicable by \n     the CAA, means a husband or wife. For purposes of this \n     definition, husband or wife refers to all individuals in \n     lawfully recognized marriages. This definition includes an \n     individual in a same-sex marriage. This definition also \n     includes an individual in a common law marriage that either:\n       (1) was entered into in a State that recognizes such \n     marriages or,\n       (2) if entered into outside of any State, is valid in the \n     place where entered into and could have been entered into in \n     at least one State.\n       State means any State of the United States or the District \n     of Columbia or any Territory or possession of the United \n     States.\n       Teacher (or employee employed in an instructional capacity, \n     or instructional employee) means an employee employed \n     principally in an instructional capacity by an educational \n     agency or school whose principal function is to teach and \n     instruct students in a class, a small group, or an individual \n     setting, and includes athletic coaches, driving instructors, \n     and special education assistants such as signers for the \n     hearing impaired. The term does not include teacher \n     assistants or aides who do not have as their principal \n     function actual teaching or instructing, nor auxiliary \n     personnel such as counselors, psychologists, curriculum \n     specialists, cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, bus \n     drivers, or other primarily noninstructional employees.\n       TRICARE is the health care program serving active duty \n     servicemembers, National Guard and Reserve members, retirees, \n     their families, survivors, and certain former spouses \n     worldwide.\n     825.103 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.104 Covered employing offices.\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, covers all \n     employing offices. As used in the CAA, the term employing \n     office means:\n       (1) The personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator;\n       (2) A committee of the House of Representatives or the \n     Senate or a joint committee;\n       (3) Any other office headed by a person with the final \n     authority to appoint, hire, discharge, and set the terms, \n     conditions, or privileges of the employment of an employee of \n     the House of Representatives or the Senate; or\n       (4) The Office of Congressional Accessibility Services, the \n     United States Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget \n     Office, the Office of the Architect of the Capitol, the \n     Office of the Attending Physician, the Office of Compliance, \n     and the Office of Technology Assessment.\n       (b) [Reserved]\n       (c) Separate entities will be deemed to be parts of a \n     single employing office for purposes of the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, if they meet the ``integrated \n     employer'' test. Where this test is met, the employees of all \n     entities making up the integrated employer will be counted in \n     determining employer coverage and employee eligibility. A \n     determination of whether or not separate entities are an \n     integrated employer is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be reviewed in its totality. Factors considered in \n     determining whether two or more entities are an integrated \n     employer include:\n       (1) Common management;\n       (2) Interrelation between operations;\n       (3) Centralized control of labor relations; and\n       (4) Degree of common financial control.\n     825.105 [Reserved].\n     825.106 Joint employer coverage.\n       (a) Where two or more employing offices exercise some \n     control over the work or working conditions of the employee, \n     the employing offices may be joint employers under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. Where the employee performs work \n     which simultaneously benefits two or more employing offices, \n     or works for two or more employing offices at different times \n     during the workweek, a joint employment relationship \n     generally will be considered to exist in situations such as:\n       (1) Where there is an arrangement between employing offices \n     to share an employee's services or to interchange employees;\n       (2) Where one employing office acts directly or indirectly \n     in the interest of the other employing office in relation to \n     the employee; or\n       (3) Where the employing offices are not completely \n     disassociated with respect to the employee's employment and \n     may be deemed\n\n[[Page H6025]]\n\n     to share control of the employee, directly or indirectly, \n     because one employing office controls, is controlled by, or \n     is under common control with the other employing office.\n       (b) A determination of whether or not a joint employment \n     relationship exists is not determined by the application of \n     any single criterion, but rather the entire relationship is \n     to be viewed in its totality. For example, joint employment \n     will ordinarily be found to exist when:\n       (1) An employee, who is employed by an employing office \n     other than the personal office of a Member of the House of \n     Representatives or of a Senator, is under the actual \n     direction and control of the Member of the House of \n     Representatives or Senator; or\n       (2) Two or more employing offices employ an individual to \n     work on common issues or other matters for both or all of \n     them.\n       (c) When employing offices employ a covered employee \n     jointly, they may designate one of themselves to be the \n     primary employing office, and the other or others to be the \n     secondary employing office(s). Such a designation shall be \n     made by written notice to the covered employee.\n       (d) If an employing office is designated a primary \n     employing office pursuant to paragraph (c) of this section, \n     only that employing office is responsible for giving required \n     notices to the covered employee, providing FMLA leave, and \n     maintenance of health benefits. Job restoration is the \n     primary responsibility of the primary employing office, and \n     the secondary employing office(s) may, subject to the \n     limitations in 825.216, be responsible for accepting the \n     employee returning from FMLA leave.\n       (e) If employing offices employ an employee jointly, but \n     fail to designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     paragraph (c) of this section, then all of these employing \n     offices shall be jointly and severally liable for giving \n     required notices to the employee, for providing FMLA leave, \n     for assuring that health benefits are maintained, and for job \n     restoration. The employee may give notice of need for FMLA \n     leave, as described in 825.302 and 825.303, to whichever of \n     these employing offices the employee chooses. If the employee \n     makes a written request for restoration to one of these \n     employing offices, that employing office shall be primarily \n     responsible for job restoration, and the other employing \n     office(s) may, subject to the limitations in 825.216, be \n     responsible for accepting the employee returning from FMLA \n     leave.\n     825.107 [Reserved]\n     825.108 [Reserved]\n     825.109 [Reserved]\n     825.110 Eligible employees.\n       (a) An eligible employee is an employee of a covered \n     employing office who:\n       (1) Has been employed by any employing office for at least \n     12 months, and\n       (2) Has been employed for at least 1,250 hours of service \n     during the 12-month period immediately preceding the \n     commencement of the leave.\n       (b) The 12 months an employee must have been employed by \n     any employing office need not be consecutive months, \n     provided:\n       (1) Subject to the exceptions provided in paragraph (b)(2) \n     of this section, employment periods prior to a break in \n     service of seven years or more need not be counted in \n     determining whether the employee has been employed by the \n     employing office for at least 12 months.\n       (2) Employment periods preceding a break in service of more \n     than seven years must be counted in determining whether the \n     employee has been employed by the employing office for at \n     least 12 months where:\n       (i) The employee's break in service is occasioned by the \n     fulfillment of his or her Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et seq., \n     covered service obligation. The period of absence from work \n     due to or necessitated by USERRA-covered service must be also \n     counted in determining whether the employee has been employed \n     for at least 12 months by the employing office. However, this \n     section does not provide any greater entitlement to the \n     employee than would be available under the USERRA; or\n       (ii) A written agreement, including a collective bargaining \n     agreement, exists concerning the employing office's intention \n     to rehire the employee after the break in service (e.g., for \n     purposes of the employee furthering his or her education or \n     for childrearing purposes).\n       (3) If an employee worked for two or more employing offices \n     sequentially, the time worked will be aggregated to determine \n     whether it equals 12 months.\n       (4) If an employee is maintained on the payroll for any \n     part of a week, including any periods of paid or unpaid leave \n     (sick, vacation) during which other benefits or compensation \n     are provided by the employing office (e.g., Federal \n     Employees' Compensation, group health plan benefits, etc.), \n     the week counts as a week of employment. For purposes of \n     determining whether intermittent/occasional/casual employment \n     qualifies as at least 12 months, 52 weeks is deemed to be \n     equal to 12 months.\n       (5) Nothing in this section prevents employing offices from \n     considering employment prior to a continuous break in service \n     of more than seven years when determining whether an employee \n     has met the 12-month employment requirement. However, if an \n     employing office chooses to recognize such prior employment, \n     the employing office must do so uniformly, with respect to \n     all employees with similar breaks in service.\n       (c)(1) If an employee was employed by two or more employing \n     offices, either sequentially or concurrently, the hours of \n     service will be aggregated to determine whether the minimum \n     of 1,250 hours has been reached.\n       (2) Except as provided in paragraph (c)(3) of this section, \n     whether an employee has worked the minimum 1,250 hours of \n     service is determined according to the principles established \n     under the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), as applied by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), for determining \n     compensable hours of work. The determining factor is the \n     number of hours an employee has worked for one or more \n     employing offices. The determination is not limited by \n     methods of recordkeeping, or by compensation agreements that \n     do not accurately reflect all of the hours an employee has \n     worked for or been in service to the employing office. Any \n     accurate accounting of actual hours worked under the FLSA's \n     principles may be used.\n       (3) An employee returning from USERRA-covered service shall \n     be credited with the hours of service that would have been \n     performed but for the period of absence from work due to or \n     necessitated by USERRA-covered service in determining the \n     employee's eligibility for FMLA-qualifying leave. \n     Accordingly, a person reemployed following USERRA-covered \n     service has the hours that would have been worked for the \n     employing office added to any hours actually worked during \n     the previous 12-month period to meet the hours of service \n     requirement. In order to determine the hours that would have \n     been worked during the period of absence from work due to or \n     necessitated by USERRA-covered service, the employee's pre-\n     service work schedule can generally be used for calculations.\n       (4) In the event an employing office does not maintain an \n     accurate record of hours worked by an employee, including for \n     employees who are exempt from FLSA's requirement that a \n     record be kept of their hours worked (e.g., bona fide \n     executive, administrative, and professional employees as \n     defined in the FLSA Regulations, 29 CFR part 541, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, the employing office has the burden of \n     showing that the employee has not worked the requisite hours. \n     An employing office must be able to clearly demonstrate, for \n     example, that full-time teachers (see 825.102 for definition) \n     of an elementary or secondary school system, or institution \n     of higher education, or other educational establishment or \n     institution (who often work outside the classroom or at their \n     homes) did not work 1,250 hours during the previous 12 months \n     in order to claim that the teachers are not eligible for FMLA \n     leave.\n       (d) The determination of whether an employee has worked for \n     any employing office for at least 1,250 hours in the past 12 \n     months and has been employed by any employing office for a \n     total of at least 12 months must be made as of the date the \n     FMLA leave is to start. An employee may be on non-FMLA leave \n     at the time he or she meets the 12-month eligibility \n     requirement, and in that event, any portion of the leave \n     taken for an FMLA-qualifying reason after the employee meets \n     the eligibility requirement would be FMLA leave. See \n     825.300(b) for rules governing the content of the eligibility \n     notice given to employees.\n       (e) [Reserved]\n     825.111 [Reserved]\n     825.112 Qualifying reasons for leave, general rule.\n       (a) Circumstances qualifying for leave. Employing offices \n     covered by FMLA as made applicable by the CAA are required to \n     grant leave to eligible employees:\n       (1) For birth of a son or daughter, and to care for the \n     newborn child (see 825.120);\n       (2) For placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care (see 825.121);\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition (see 825.113 and \n     825.122); and\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform the functions of the employee's \n     job (see 825.113 and 825.123);\n       (5) Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is \n     a military member on covered active duty (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to covered active \n     status) (see 825.122 and 825.126); and\n       (6) To care for a covered servicemember with a serious \n     injury or illness if the employee is the spouse, son, \n     daughter, parent, or next of kin of the covered servicemember \n     (see 825.122 and 825.127).\n       (b) Equal Application. The right to take leave under FMLA, \n     as made applicable by the CAA, applies equally to male and \n     female employees. A father, as well as a mother, can take \n     family leave for the birth, placement for adoption, or foster \n     care of a child.\n       (c) Active employee. In situations where the employing \n     office/employee relationship has been interrupted, such as an \n     employee who has been on layoff, the employee must be \n     recalled or otherwise be re-employed before being eligible \n     for FMLA leave. Under such circumstances, an eligible \n     employee is immediately entitled to further FMLA leave for a \n     qualifying reason.\n     825.113 Serious health condition.\n       (a) For purposes of FMLA, serious health condition \n     entitling an employee to FMLA leave means an illness, injury, \n     impairment, or physical or mental condition that involves \n     inpatient care as defined in 825.114 or\n\n[[Page H6026]]\n\n     continuing treatment by a health care provider as defined in \n     825.115.\n       (b) The term incapacity means inability to work, attend \n     school or perform other regular daily activities due to the \n     serious health condition, treatment therefore, or recovery \n     therefrom.\n       (c) The term treatment includes (but is not limited to) \n     examinations to determine if a serious health condition \n     exists and evaluations of the condition. Treatment does not \n     include routine physical examinations, eye examinations, or \n     dental examinations. A regimen of continuing treatment \n     includes, for example, a course of prescription medication \n     (e.g., an antibiotic) or therapy requiring special equipment \n     to resolve or alleviate the health condition (e.g., oxygen). \n     A regimen of continuing treatment that includes the taking of \n     over-the-counter medications such as aspirin, antihistamines, \n     or salves; or bed-rest, drinking fluids, exercise, and other \n     similar activities that can be initiated without a visit to a \n     health care provider, is not, by itself, sufficient to \n     constitute a regimen of continuing treatment for purposes of \n     FMLA leave.\n       (d) Conditions for which cosmetic treatments are \n     administered (such as most treatments for acne or plastic \n     surgery) are not serious health conditions unless inpatient \n     hospital care is required or unless complications develop. \n     Ordinarily, unless complications arise, the common cold, the \n     flu, ear aches, upset stomach, minor ulcers, headaches other \n     than migraine, routine dental or orthodontia problems, \n     periodontal disease, etc., are examples of conditions that do \n     not meet the definition of a serious health condition and do \n     not qualify for FMLA leave. Restorative dental or plastic \n     surgery after an injury or removal of cancerous growths are \n     serious health conditions provided all the other conditions \n     of this regulation are met. Mental illness or allergies may \n     be serious health conditions, but only if all the conditions \n     of this section are met.\n     825.114 Inpatient care.\n       Inpatient care means an overnight stay in a hospital, \n     hospice, or residential medical care facility, including any \n     period of incapacity as defined in 825.113(b), or any \n     subsequent treatment in connection with such inpatient care.\n     825.115 Continuing treatment.\n       A serious health condition involving continuing treatment \n     by a health care provider includes any one or more of the \n     following:\n       (a) Incapacity and treatment. A period of incapacity of \n     more than three consecutive, full calendar days, and any \n     subsequent treatment or period of incapacity relating to the \n     same condition, that also involves:\n       (1) Treatment two or more times, within 30 days of the \n     first day of incapacity, unless extenuating circumstances \n     exist, by a health care provider, by a nurse under direct \n     supervision of a health care provider, or by a provider of \n     health care services (e.g., physical therapist) under orders \n     of, or on referral by, a health care provider; or\n       (2) Treatment by a health care provider on at least one \n     occasion, which results in a regimen of continuing treatment \n     under the supervision of the health care provider.\n       (3) The requirement in paragraphs (a)(1) and (2) of this \n     section for treatment by a health care provider means an in-\n     person visit to a health care provider. The first (or only) \n     in-person treatment visit must take place within seven days \n     of the first day of incapacity.\n       (4) Whether additional treatment visits or a regimen of \n     continuing treatment is necessary within the 30-day period \n     shall be determined by the health care provider.\n       (5) The term extenuating circumstances in paragraph (a)(1) \n     of this section means circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control that prevent the follow-up visit from occurring as \n     planned by the health care provider. Whether a given set of \n     circumstances are extenuating depends on the facts. For \n     example, extenuating circumstances exist if a health care \n     provider determines that a second in-person visit is needed \n     within the 30-day period, but the health care provider does \n     not have any available appointments during that time period.\n       (b) Pregnancy or prenatal care. Any period of incapacity \n     due to pregnancy, or for prenatal care. See also 825.120.\n       (c) Chronic conditions. Any period of incapacity or \n     treatment for such incapacity due to a chronic serious health \n     condition. A chronic serious health condition is one which:\n       (1) Requires periodic visits (defined as at least twice a \n     year) for treatment by a health care provider, or by a nurse \n     under direct supervision of a health care provider;\n       (2) Continues over an extended period of time (including \n     recurring episodes of a single underlying condition); and\n       (3) May cause episodic rather than a continuing period of \n     incapacity (e.g., asthma, diabetes, epilepsy, etc.).\n       (d) Permanent or long-term conditions. A period of \n     incapacity which is permanent or long-term due to a condition \n     for which treatment may not be effective. The employee or \n     family member must be under the continuing supervision of, \n     but need not be receiving active treatment by, a health care \n     provider. Examples include Alzheimer's, a severe stroke, or \n     the terminal stages of a disease.\n       (e) Conditions requiring multiple treatments. Any period of \n     absence to receive multiple treatments (including any period \n     of recovery therefrom) by a health care provider or by a \n     provider of health care services under orders of, or on \n     referral by, a health care provider, for:\n       (1) Restorative surgery after an accident or other injury; \n     or\n       (2) A condition that would likely result in a period of \n     incapacity of more than three consecutive, full calendar days \n     in the absence of medical intervention or treatment, such as \n     cancer (chemotherapy, radiation, etc.), severe arthritis \n     (physical therapy), or kidney disease (dialysis).\n       (f) Absences attributable to incapacity under paragraphs \n     (b) or (c) of this section qualify for FMLA leave even though \n     the employee or the covered family member does not receive \n     treatment from a health care provider during the absence, and \n     even if the absence does not last more than three \n     consecutive, full calendar days. For example, an employee \n     with asthma may be unable to report for work due to the onset \n     of an asthma attack or because the employee's health care \n     provider has advised the employee to stay home when the \n     pollen count exceeds a certain level. An employee who is \n     pregnant may be unable to report to work because of severe \n     morning sickness.\n     825.116 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.117 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.118 [Removed and Reserved]\n     825.119 Leave for treatment of substance abuse.\n       (a) Substance abuse may be a serious health condition if \n     the conditions of 825.113 through 825.115 are met. However, \n     FMLA leave may only be taken for treatment for substance \n     abuse by a health care provider or by a provider of health \n     care services on referral by a health care provider. On the \n     other hand, absence because of the employee's use of the \n     substance, rather than for treatment, does not qualify for \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) Treatment for substance abuse does not prevent an \n     employing office from taking employment action against an \n     employee. The employing office may not take action against \n     the employee because the employee has exercised his or her \n     right to take FMLA leave for treatment. However, if the \n     employing office has an established policy, applied in a non-\n     discriminatory manner that has been communicated to all \n     employees, that provides under certain circumstances an \n     employee may be terminated for substance abuse, pursuant to \n     that policy the employee may be terminated whether or not the \n     employee is presently taking FMLA leave. An employee may also \n     take FMLA leave to care for a covered family member who is \n     receiving treatment for substance abuse. The employing office \n     may not take action against an employee who is providing care \n     for a covered family member receiving treatment for substance \n     abuse.\n     825.120 Leave for pregnancy or birth.\n       (a) General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA \n     leave for pregnancy or birth of a child as follows:\n       (1) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave for the birth \n     of their child.\n       (2) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave to be with the \n     healthy newborn child (i.e., bonding time) during the 12-\n     month period beginning on the date of birth. An employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA leave for a birth expires at the end of \n     the 12-month period beginning on the date of the birth. If \n     the employing office permits bonding leave to be taken beyond \n     this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA leave. Under \n     this section, both parents are entitled to FMLA leave even if \n     the newborn does not have a serious health condition.\n       (3) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same employing office may be limited to a \n     combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken for birth of the employee's son \n     or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care or to care for the child after placement, or \n     to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition. This limitation on the total weeks of leave \n     applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as long as \n     the spouses are employed by the same employing office. It \n     would apply, for example, even though the spouses are \n     employed at two different worksites of an employing office. \n     On the other hand, if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA \n     leave, the other spouse would be entitled to a full 12 weeks \n     of FMLA leave. Where spouses both use a portion of the total \n     12-week FMLA leave entitlement for either the birth of a \n     child, for placement for adoption or foster care, or to care \n     for a parent, the spouses would each be entitled to the \n     difference between the amount he or she has taken \n     individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other purposes. \n     For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave to care \n     for a healthy, newborn child, each could use an additional \n     six weeks due to his or her own serious health condition or \n     to care for a child with a serious health condition. Note, \n     too, that many state pregnancy disability laws specify a \n     period of disability either before or after the birth of a \n     child; such periods would also be considered FMLA leave for a \n     serious health condition of the birth mother, and would not \n     be subject to the combined limit.\n       (4) The expectant mother is entitled to FMLA leave for \n     incapacity due to pregnancy, for prenatal care, or for her \n     own serious health condition following the birth of the \n     child. An expectant mother may take FMLA leave before the \n     birth of the child for prenatal care or if her condition \n     makes her unable to work. The expectant mother is entitled to \n     leave for incapacity due to pregnancy\n\n[[Page H6027]]\n\n     even though she does not receive treatment from a health care \n     provider during the absence, and even if the absence does not \n     last for more than three consecutive calendar days.\n       (5) A spouse is entitled to FMLA leave if needed to care \n     for a pregnant spouse who is incapacitated or if needed to \n     care for her during her prenatal care, or if needed to care \n     for her following the birth of a child if she has a serious \n     health condition. See 825.124.\n       (6) Both parents are entitled to FMLA leave if needed to \n     care for a child with a serious health condition if the \n     requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and 825.122(d) are \n     met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of FMLA leave if \n     needed to care for their newborn child with a serious health \n     condition, even if both are employed by the same employing \n     office, provided they have not exhausted their entitlements \n     during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave period.\n       (b) Intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An eligible \n     employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule leave after \n     the birth to be with a healthy newborn child only if the \n     employing office agrees. For example, an employing office and \n     employee may agree to a part-time work schedule after the \n     birth. If the employing office agrees to permit intermittent \n     or reduced schedule leave for the birth of a child, the \n     employing office may require the employee to transfer \n     temporarily, during the period the intermittent or reduced \n     leave schedule is required, to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified and which better \n     accommodates recurring periods of leave than does the \n     employee's regular position. Transfer to an alternative \n     position may require compliance with any applicable \n     collective bargaining agreement and federal law (such as the \n     Americans with Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the \n     CAA). Transfer to an alternative position may include \n     altering an existing job to better accommodate the employee's \n     need for intermittent or reduced leave. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required for intermittent leave \n     required by the serious health condition of the expectant \n     mother or newborn child. See 825.202-825.205 for general \n     rules governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule \n     leave. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for adoption or \n     foster care. See 825.601 for special rules applicable to \n     instructional employees of schools.\n     825.121 Leave for adoption or foster care.\n       (a) General rules. Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA \n     leave for placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care as follows:\n       (1) Employees may take FMLA leave before the actual \n     placement or adoption of a child if an absence from work is \n     required for the placement for adoption or foster care to \n     proceed. For example, the employee may be required to attend \n     counseling sessions, appear in court, consult with his or her \n     attorney or the doctor(s) representing the birth parent, \n     submit to a physical examination, or travel to another \n     country to complete an adoption. The source of an adopted \n     child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement agency or \n     otherwise) is not a factor in determining eligibility for \n     leave for this purpose.\n       (2) An employee's entitlement to leave for adoption or \n     foster care expires at the end of the 12-month period \n     beginning on the date of the placement. If the employing \n     office permits leave for adoption or foster care to be taken \n     beyond this period, such leave will not qualify as FMLA \n     leave. Under this section, the employee is entitled to FMLA \n     leave even if the adopted or foster child does not have a \n     serious health condition.\n       (3) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same covered employing office may be limited \n     to a combined total of 12 weeks of leave during any 12-month \n     period if the leave is taken for the placement of the \n     employee's son or daughter or to care for the child after \n     placement, for the birth of the employee's son or daughter or \n     to care for the child after birth, or to care for the \n     employee's parent with a serious health condition. This \n     limitation on the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken \n     for the reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed \n     by the same employing office. It would apply, for example, \n     even though the spouses are employed at two different \n     worksites of an employing office. On the other hand, if one \n     spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would \n     be entitled to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where spouses \n     both use a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave \n     entitlement for either the birth of a child, for placement \n     for adoption or foster care, or to care for a parent, the \n     spouses would each be entitled to the difference between the \n     amount he or she has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA \n     leave for other purposes. For example, if each spouse took \n     six weeks of leave to care for a healthy, newly placed child, \n     each could use an additional six weeks due to his or her own \n     serious health condition or to care for a child with a \n     serious health condition.\n       (4) An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA leave in order \n     to care for an adopted or foster child with a serious health \n     condition if the requirements of 825.113 through 825.115 and \n     825.122(d) are met. Thus, spouses may each take 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave if needed to care for an adopted or foster child \n     with a serious health condition, even if both are employed by \n     the same employing office, provided they have not exhausted \n     their entitlements during the applicable 12-month FMLA leave \n     period.\n       (b) Use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. An \n     eligible employee may use intermittent or reduced schedule \n     leave after the placement of a healthy child for adoption or \n     foster care only if the employing office agrees. Thus, for \n     example, the employing office and employee may agree to a \n     part-time work schedule after the placement for bonding \n     purposes. If the employing office agrees to permit \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the placement for \n     adoption or foster care, the employing office may require the \n     employee to transfer temporarily, during the period the \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule is required, to an \n     available alternative position for which the employee is \n     qualified and which better accommodates recurring periods of \n     leave than does the employee's regular position. Transfer to \n     an alternative position may require compliance with any \n     applicable collective bargaining agreement and federal law \n     (such as the Americans with Disabilities Act, as made \n     applicable by the CAA). Transfer to an alternative position \n     may include altering an existing job to better accommodate \n     the employee's need for intermittent or reduced leave. The \n     employing office's agreement is not required for intermittent \n     leave required by the serious health condition of the adopted \n     or foster child. See 825.202-825.205 for general rules \n     governing the use of intermittent and reduced schedule leave. \n     See 825.120 for general rules governing leave for pregnancy \n     and birth of a child. See 825.601 for special rules \n     applicable to instructional employees of schools.\n     825.122 Definitions of covered servicemember, spouse, parent, \n         son or daughter, next of kin of a covered servicemember, \n         adoption, foster care, son or daughter on covered active \n         duty or call to covered active duty status, son or \n         daughter of a covered servicemember, and parent of a \n         covered servicemember.\n       (a) Covered servicemember means:\n       (1) A current member of the Armed Forces, including a \n     member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing \n     medical treatment, recuperation or therapy, is otherwise in \n     outpatient status, or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness; or\n       (2) A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, \n     recuperation, or therapy for a serious injury or illness. \n     Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the \n     Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or \n     Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions \n     other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year \n     period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes \n     FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. See \n     825.127(b)(2).\n       (b) Spouse, as defined in the FMLA and as made applicable \n     by the CAA, means a husband or wife. For purposes of this \n     definition, husband or wife refers to all individuals in \n     lawfully recognized marriages. This definition includes an \n     individual in a same-sex marriage. This definition also \n     includes an individual in a common law marriage that either:\n       (1) was entered into in a State that recognizes such \n     marriages or,\n       (2) if entered into outside of any State, is valid in the \n     place where entered into and could have been entered into in \n     at least one State.\n       (c) Parent. Parent means a biological, adoptive, step or \n     foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in \n     loco parentis to the employee when the employee was a son or \n     daughter as defined in paragraph (d) of this section. This \n     term does not include parents ``in law.''\n       (d) Son or daughter. For purposes of FMLA leave taken for \n     birth or adoption, or to care for a family member with a \n     serious health condition, son or daughter means a biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, a stepchild, a legal ward, or a \n     child of a person standing in loco parentis, who is either \n     under age 18, or age 18 or older and ``incapable of self-care \n     because of a mental or physical disability'' at the time that \n     FMLA leave is to commence.\n       (1) Incapable of self-care means that the individual \n     requires active assistance or supervision to provide daily \n     self-care in three or more of the activities of daily living \n     (ADLs) or instrumental activities of daily living (IADLs). \n     Activities of daily living include adaptive activities such \n     as caring appropriately for one's grooming and hygiene, \n     bathing, dressing and eating. Instrumental activities of \n     daily living include cooking, cleaning, shopping, taking \n     public transportation, paying bills, maintaining a residence, \n     using telephones and directories, using a post office, etc.\n       (2) Physical or mental disability means a physical or \n     mental impairment that substantially limits one or more of \n     the major life activities of an individual. Regulations at 29 \n     CFR 1630.2(h), (i), and (j), issued by the Equal Employment \n     Opportunity Commission under the Americans with Disabilities \n     Act (ADA), 42 U.S.C. 12101 et seq., define these terms.\n       (3) Persons who are ``in loco parentis'' include those with \n     day-to-day responsibilities to care for and financially \n     support a child, or, in the case of an employee, who had such \n     responsibility for the employee when the employee was a \n     child. A biological or legal relationship is not necessary.\n       (e) Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the \n     nearest blood relative other than the covered servicemember's \n     spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the following order of \n     priority: blood relatives who have been granted legal custody \n     of the covered servicemember by court decree or statutory \n     provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, aunts and \n     uncles, and first cousins, unless\n\n[[Page H6028]]\n\n     the covered servicemember has specifically designated in \n     writing another blood relative as his or her nearest blood \n     relative for purposes of military caregiver leave under the \n     FMLA. When no such designation is made, and there are \n     multiple family members with the same level of relationship \n     to the covered servicemember, all such family members shall \n     be considered the covered servicemember's next of kin and may \n     take FMLA leave to provide care to the covered servicemember, \n     either consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation \n     has been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to \n     be the covered servicemember's only next of kin. See \n     825.127(d)(3).\n       (f) Adoption means legally and permanently assuming the \n     responsibility of raising a child as one's own. The source of \n     an adopted child (e.g., whether from a licensed placement \n     agency or otherwise) is not a factor in determining \n     eligibility for FMLA leave. See 825.121 for rules governing \n     leave for adoption.\n       (g) Foster care means 24-hour care for children in \n     substitution for, and away from, their parents or guardian. \n     Such placement is made by or with the agreement of the State \n     as a result of a voluntary agreement between the parent or \n     guardian that the child be removed from the home, or pursuant \n     to a judicial determination of the necessity for foster care, \n     and involves agreement between the State and foster family \n     that the foster family will take care of the child. Although \n     foster care may be with relatives of the child, State action \n     is involved in the removal of the child from parental \n     custody. See 825.121 for rules governing leave for foster \n     care.\n       (h) Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status means the employee's biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child \n     for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, \n     and who is of any age. See 825.126(a)(5).\n       (i) Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the \n     covered servicemember's biological, adopted, or foster child, \n     stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered \n     servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age. \n     See 825.127(d)(1).\n       (j) Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered \n     servicemember's biological, adoptive, step or foster father \n     or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis \n     to the covered servicemember. This term does not include \n     parents ``in law.'' See 825.127(d)(2).\n       (k) Documenting relationships. For purposes of confirmation \n     of family relationship, the employing office may require the \n     employee giving notice of the need for leave to provide \n     reasonable documentation or statement of family relationship. \n     This documentation may take the form of a simple statement \n     from the employee, or a child's birth certificate, a court \n     document, etc. The employing office is entitled to examine \n     documentation such as a birth certificate, etc., but the \n     employee is entitled to the return of the official document \n     submitted for this purpose.\n     825.123 Unable to perform the functions of the position.\n       (a) Definition. An employee is unable to perform the \n     functions of the position where the health care provider \n     finds that the employee is unable to work at all or is unable \n     to perform any one of the essential functions of the \n     employee's position within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and made applicable by \n     Section 201(a) of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311(a)(3)). An employee \n     who must be absent from work to receive medical treatment for \n     a serious health condition is considered to be unable to \n     perform the essential functions of the position during the \n     absence for treatment.\n       (b) Statement of functions. An employing office has the \n     option, in requiring certification from a health care \n     provider, to provide a statement of the essential functions \n     of the employee's position for the health care provider to \n     review. A sufficient medical certification must specify what \n     functions of the employee's position the employee is unable \n     to perform so that the employing office can then determine \n     whether the employee is unable to perform one or more \n     essential functions of the employee's position. For purposes \n     of FMLA, the essential functions of the employee's position \n     are to be determined with reference to the position the \n     employee held at the time notice is given or leave commenced, \n     whichever is earlier. See 825.306.\n     825.124 Needed to care for a family member or covered \n         servicemember.\n       (a) The medical certification provision that an employee is \n     needed to care for a family member or covered servicemember \n     encompasses both physical and psychological care. It includes \n     situations where, for example, because of a serious health \n     condition, the family member is unable to care for his or her \n     own basic medical, hygienic, or nutritional needs or safety, \n     or is unable to transport himself or herself to the doctor. \n     The term also includes providing psychological comfort and \n     reassurance which would be beneficial to a child, spouse or \n     parent with a serious health condition who is receiving \n     inpatient or home care.\n       (b) The term also includes situations where the employee \n     may be needed to substitute for others who normally care for \n     the family member or covered servicemember, or to make \n     arrangements for changes in care, such as transfer to a \n     nursing home. The employee need not be the only individual or \n     family member available to care for the family member or \n     covered servicemember.\n       (c) An employee's intermittent leave or a reduced leave \n     schedule necessary to care for a family member or covered \n     servicemember includes not only a situation where the \n     condition of the family member or covered servicemember \n     itself is intermittent, but also where the employee is only \n     needed intermittently--such as where other care is normally \n     available, or care responsibilities are shared with another \n     member of the family or a third party. See 825.202-825.205 \n     for rules governing the use of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave.\n     825.125 Definition of health care provider.\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, defines health \n     care provider as:\n       (1) A doctor of medicine or osteopathy who is authorized to \n     practice medicine or surgery (as appropriate) by the State in \n     which the doctor practices; or\n       (2) Any other person determined by the Office of Compliance \n     to be capable of providing health care services.\n       (3) In making a determination referred to in subparagraph \n     (a)(2), and absent good cause shown to do otherwise, the \n     Office of Compliance will follow any determination made by \n     the Department of Labor (under section 101(6)(B) of FMLA (29 \n     U.S.C. 2611(6)(B))) that a person is capable of providing \n     health care services, provided the determination by the \n     Department of Labor was not made at the request of a person \n     who was then a covered employee.\n       (b) Others capable of providing health care services \n     include only:\n       (1) Podiatrists, dentists, clinical psychologists, \n     optometrists, and chiropractors (limited to treatment \n     consisting of manual manipulation of the spine to correct a \n     subluxation as demonstrated by X-ray to exist) authorized to \n     practice in the State and performing within the scope of \n     their practice as defined under State law;\n       (2) Nurse practitioners, nurse-midwives, clinical social \n     workers and physician assistants who are authorized to \n     practice under State law and who are performing within the \n     scope of their practice as defined under State law;\n       (3) Christian Science Practitioners listed with the First \n     Church of Christ, Scientist in Boston, Massachusetts. Where \n     an employee or family member is receiving treatment from a \n     Christian Science practitioner, an employee may not object to \n     any requirement from an employing office that the employee or \n     family member submit to examination (though not treatment) to \n     obtain a second or third certification from a health care \n     provider other than a Christian Science practitioner except \n     as otherwise provided under applicable State or local law or \n     collective bargaining agreement;\n       (4) Any health care provider from whom an employing office \n     or the employing office's group health plan's benefits \n     manager will accept certification of the existence of a \n     serious health condition to substantiate a claim for \n     benefits; and\n       (5) A health care provider listed above who practices in a \n     country other than the United States, who is authorized to \n     practice in accordance with the law of that country, and who \n     is performing within the scope of his or her practice as \n     defined under such law.\n       (c) The phrase authorized to practice in the State as used \n     in this section means that the provider must be authorized to \n     diagnose and treat physical or mental health conditions.\n     825.126 Leave because of a qualifying exigency.\n       (a) Eligible employees may take FMLA leave for a qualifying \n     exigency while the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent (the military member or member) is on covered active \n     duty or call to covered active duty status (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to covered active \n     duty).\n       (1) Covered active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status in the case of a member of the Regular Armed Forces \n     means duty during the deployment of the member with the Armed \n     Forces to a foreign country. The active duty orders of a \n     member of the Regular components of the Armed Forces will \n     generally specify if the member is deployed to a foreign \n     country.\n       (2) Covered active duty or call to covered active duty \n     status in the case of a member of the Reserve components of \n     the Armed Forces means duty during the deployment of the \n     member with the Armed Forces to a foreign country under a \n     Federal call or order to active duty in support of a \n     contingency operation pursuant to: Section 688 of Title 10 of \n     the United States Code, which authorizes ordering to active \n     duty retired members of the Regular Armed Forces and members \n     of the retired Reserve who retired after completing at least \n     20 years of active service; Section 12301(a) of Title 10 of \n     the United States Code, which authorizes ordering all reserve \n     component members to active duty in the case of war or \n     national emergency; Section 12302 of Title 10 of the United \n     States Code, which authorizes ordering any unit or unassigned \n     member of the Ready Reserve to active duty; Section 12304 of \n     Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes ordering \n     any unit or unassigned member of the Selected Reserve and \n     certain members of the Individual Ready Reserve to active \n     duty; Section 12305 of Title 10 of the United States Code, \n     which authorizes the suspension of promotion, retirement or \n     separation rules for certain Reserve components; Section \n     12406 of Title 10 of the United States Code, which authorizes \n     calling the National Guard into Federal service in certain \n     circumstances; chapter 15 of Title 10 of the United States \n     Code, which authorizes\n\n[[Page H6029]]\n\n     calling the National Guard and state military into Federal \n     service in the case of insurrections and national \n     emergencies; or any other provision of law during a war or \n     during a national emergency declared by the President or \n     Congress so long as it is in support of a contingency \n     operation.

State calls to active duty are not \n     covered unless under order of the President of the United \n     States pursuant to one of the provisions of law identified in \n     paragraph (a)(2) of this section.\n       (5) Son or daughter on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status means the employee's biological, \n     adopted, or foster child, stepchild, legal ward, or a child \n     for whom the employee stood in loco parentis, who is on \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status, \n     and who is of any age.\n       (b) An eligible employee may take FMLA leave for one or \n     more of the following qualifying exigencies:\n       (1) Short-notice deployment.

To attend counseling provided by someone \n     other than a health care provider, for oneself, for the \n     military member, or for the biological, adopted, or foster \n     child, a stepchild, or a legal ward of the military member, \n     or a child for whom the military member stands in loco \n     parentis, who is either under age 18, or age 18 or older and \n     incapable of self-care because of a mental or physical \n     disability at the time that FMLA leave is to commence, \n     provided that the need for counseling arises from the covered \n     active duty or call to covered active duty status of the \n     military member;\n       (6) Rest and Recuperation. (i) To spend time with the \n     military member who is on short-term, temporary, Rest and \n     Recuperation leave during the period of deployment;\n       (ii) Leave taken for this purpose can be used for a period \n     of 15 calendar days beginning on the date the military member \n     commences each instance of Rest and Recuperation leave;\n       (7) Post-deployment activities.

For purposes of leave for parental care \n     listed in (i) through (iv) of this paragraph, the parent of \n     the military member must be incapable of self-care and must \n     be the military member's biological, adoptive, step, or \n     foster father or mother, or any other individual who stood in \n     loco parentis to the military member when the member was \n     under 18 years of age. A parent who is incapable of self-care \n     means that the parent requires active assistance or \n     supervision to provide daily self-care in three or more of \n     the activities of daily living or instrumental activities of \n     daily living. Activities of daily living include adaptive \n     activities such as caring appropriately for one's grooming \n     and hygiene, bathing, dressing, and eating. Instrumental \n     activities of daily living include cooking, cleaning, \n     shopping, taking public transportation, paying bills, \n     maintaining a residence, using telephones and directories, \n     using a post office, etc. As with all instances of qualifying \n     exigency leave, the military member must be the spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent of the employee requesting qualifying \n     exigency leave.\n       (i) To arrange for alternative care for a parent of the \n     military member when the parent is incapable of self-care and \n     the covered active duty or call to covered active duty status \n     of the military member necessitates a change in the existing \n     care arrangement for the parent;\n       (ii) To provide care for a parent of the military member on \n     an urgent, immediate need basis (but not on a routine, \n     regular, or everyday basis) when the parent is incapable of \n     self-care and the need to provide such care arises from the \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status of \n     the military member;\n       (iii) To admit to or transfer to a care facility a parent \n     of the military member when admittance or transfer is \n     necessitated by the covered active duty or call to covered \n     active duty status of the military member; and\n       (iv) To attend meetings with staff at a care facility, such \n     as meetings with hospice or social service providers for a \n     parent of the military member, when such meetings are \n     necessary due to circumstances arising from the covered \n     active duty or call to covered active duty status of the \n     military member but not for routine or regular meetings;\n       (9) Additional activities. To address other events which \n     arise out of the military member's covered active duty or \n     call to covered active duty status provided that the \n     employing office and employee agree that such leave shall \n     qualify as an exigency, and agree to both the timing and \n     duration of such leave.\n     825.127 Leave to care for a covered servicemember with a \n         serious injury or illness (military caregiver leave).\n       (a) Eligible employees are entitled to FMLA leave to care \n     for a covered servicemember with a serious illness or injury.\n       (b) Covered servicemember means:\n       (1) A current member of the Armed Forces, including a \n     member of the National Guard or Reserves, who is undergoing \n     medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy, is otherwise in \n     outpatient status; or is otherwise on the temporary \n     disability retired list, for a serious injury or illness. \n     Outpatient status means the status of a member of the Armed \n     Forces assigned to either a military medical treatment \n     facility as an outpatient or a unit established for the \n     purpose of providing command and control of members of the \n     Armed Forces receiving medical care as outpatients.\n\n[[Page H6030]]\n\n       (2) A covered veteran who is undergoing medical treatment, \n     recuperation or therapy for a serious injury or illness. \n     Covered veteran means an individual who was a member of the \n     Armed Forces (including a member of the National Guard or \n     Reserves), and was discharged or released under conditions \n     other than dishonorable at any time during the five-year \n     period prior to the first date the eligible employee takes \n     FMLA leave to care for the covered veteran. An eligible \n     employee must commence leave to care for a covered veteran \n     within five years of the veteran's active duty service, but \n     the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e)(1) of \n     this section may extend beyond the five-year period.\n       (i) For an individual who was a member of the Armed Forces \n     (including a member of the National Guard or Reserves) and \n     who was discharged or released under conditions other than \n     dishonorable prior to the effective date of this Final Rule, \n     the period between October 28, 2009 and the effective date of \n     this Final Rule shall not count towards the determination of \n     the five-year period for covered veteran status.\n       (c) A serious injury or illness means:\n       (1) In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, \n     including a member of the National Guard or Reserves, means \n     an injury or illness that was incurred by the covered \n     servicemember in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces or that existed before the beginning of the member's \n     active duty and was aggravated by service in the line of duty \n     on active duty in the Armed Forces, and that may render the \n     member medically unfit to perform the duties of the member's \n     office, grade, rank or rating; and,\n       (2) In the case of a covered veteran, means an injury or \n     illness that was incurred by the member in the line of duty \n     on active duty in the Armed Forces (or existed before the \n     beginning of the member's active duty and was aggravated by \n     service in the line of duty on active duty in the Armed \n     Forces), and manifested itself before or after the member \n     became a veteran, and is:\n       (i) A continuation of a serious injury or illness that was \n     incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member \n     of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember unable to \n     perform the duties of the servicemember's office, grade, \n     rank, or rating; or\n       (ii) A physical or mental condition for which the covered \n     veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or \n     greater, and such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in part, \n     on the condition precipitating the need for military \n     caregiver leave; or\n       (iii) A physical or mental condition that substantially \n     impairs the covered veteran's ability to secure or follow a \n     substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or \n     disabilities related to military service, or would do so \n     absent treatment; or\n       (iv) An injury, including a psychological injury, on the \n     basis of which the covered veteran has been enrolled in the \n     Department of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive \n     Assistance for Family Caregivers.\n       (d) In order to care for a covered servicemember, an \n     eligible employee must be the spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent, or next of kin of a covered servicemember.\n       (1) Son or daughter of a covered servicemember means the \n     covered servicemember's biological, adopted, or foster child, \n     stepchild, legal ward, or a child for whom the covered \n     servicemember stood in loco parentis, and who is of any age.\n       (2) Parent of a covered servicemember means a covered \n     servicemember's biological, adoptive, step or foster father \n     or mother, or any other individual who stood in loco parentis \n     to the covered servicemember. This term does not include \n     parents ``in law.''\n       (3) Next of kin of a covered servicemember means the \n     nearest blood relative, other than the covered \n     servicemember's spouse, parent, son, or daughter, in the \n     following order of priority: blood relatives who have been \n     granted legal custody of the servicemember by court decree or \n     statutory provisions, brothers and sisters, grandparents, \n     aunts and uncles, and first cousins, unless the covered \n     servicemember has specifically designated in writing another \n     blood relative as his or her nearest blood relative for \n     purposes of military caregiver leave under the FMLA. When no \n     such designation is made, and there are multiple family \n     members with the same level of relationship to the covered \n     servicemember, all such family members shall be considered \n     the covered servicemember's next of kin and may take FMLA \n     leave to provide care to the covered servicemember, either \n     consecutively or simultaneously. When such designation has \n     been made, the designated individual shall be deemed to be \n     the covered servicemember's only next of kin. For example, if \n     a covered servicemember has three siblings and has not \n     designated a blood relative to provide care, all three \n     siblings would be considered the covered servicemember's next \n     of kin. Alternatively, where a covered servicemember has a \n     sibling(s) and designates a cousin as his or her next of kin \n     for FMLA purposes, then only the designated cousin is \n     eligible as the covered servicemember's next of kin. An \n     employing office is permitted to require an employee to \n     provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the \n     covered servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k).\n       (e) An eligible employee is entitled to 26 workweeks of \n     leave to care for a covered servicemember with a serious \n     injury or illness during a single 12-month period.\n       (1) The single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) \n     of this section begins on the first day the eligible employee \n     takes FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember and ends \n     12 months after that date, regardless of the method used by \n     the employing office to determine the employee's 12 workweeks \n     of leave entitlement for other FMLA-qualifying reasons. If an \n     eligible employee does not take all of his or her 26 \n     workweeks of leave entitlement to care for a covered \n     servicemember during this single 12-month period, the \n     remaining part of his or her 26 workweeks of leave \n     entitlement to care for the covered servicemember is \n     forfeited.\n       (2) The leave entitlement described in paragraph (e) of \n     this section is to be applied on a per-covered-servicemember, \n     per-injury basis such that an eligible employee may be \n     entitled to take more than one period of 26 workweeks of \n     leave if the leave is to care for different covered \n     servicemembers or to care for the same servicemember with a \n     subsequent serious injury or illness, except that no more \n     than 26 workweeks of leave may be taken within any single 12-\n     month period. An eligible employee may take more than one \n     period of 26 workweeks of leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with more than one serious injury or illness \n     only when the serious injury or illness is a subsequent \n     serious injury or illness. When an eligible employee takes \n     leave to care for more than one covered servicemember or for \n     a subsequent serious injury or illness of the same covered \n     servicemember, and the single 12-month periods corresponding \n     to the different military caregiver leave entitlements \n     overlap, the employee is limited to taking no more than 26 \n     workweeks of leave in each single 12-month period.\n       (3) An eligible employee is entitled to a combined total of \n     26 workweeks of leave for any FMLA-qualifying reason during \n     the single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this \n     section, provided that the employee is entitled to no more \n     than 12 workweeks of leave for one or more of the following: \n     because of the birth of a son or daughter of the employee and \n     in order to care for such son or daughter; because of the \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care; in order to care for the spouse, son, \n     daughter, or parent with a serious health condition; because \n     of the employee's own serious health condition; or because of \n     a qualifying exigency. Thus, for example, an eligible \n     employee may, during the single 12-month period, take 16 \n     workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     and 10 workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a newborn child. \n     However, the employee may not take more than 12 weeks of FMLA \n     leave to care for the newborn child during the single 12-\n     month period, even if the employee takes fewer than 14 \n     workweeks of FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember.\n       (4) In all circumstances, including for leave taken to care \n     for a covered servicemember, the employing office is \n     responsible for designating leave, paid or unpaid, as FMLA-\n     qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to the \n     employee as provided in 825.300. In the case of leave that \n     qualifies as both leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     and leave to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition during the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (e) of this section, the employing office must \n     designate such leave as leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember in the first instance. Leave that qualifies as \n     both leave to care for a covered servicemember and leave \n     taken to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition during the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (e) of this section must not be designated and \n     counted as both leave to care for a covered servicemember and \n     leave to care for a family member with a serious health \n     condition. As is the case with leave taken for other \n     qualifying reasons, employing offices may retroactively \n     designate leave as leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     pursuant to 825.301(d).\n       (f) Spouses who are eligible for FMLA leave and are \n     employed by the same covered employing office may be limited \n     to a combined total of 26 workweeks of leave during the \n     single 12-month period described in paragraph (e) of this \n     section if the leave is taken for birth of the employee's son \n     or daughter or to care for the child after birth, for \n     placement of a son or daughter with the employee for adoption \n     or foster care, or to care for the child after placement, to \n     care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition, or to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness. This limitation on the total weeks \n     of leave applies to leave taken for the reasons specified as \n     long as the spouses are employed by the same employing \n     office. It would apply, for example, even though the spouses \n     are employed at two different worksites. On the other hand, \n     if one spouse is ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse \n     would be entitled to a full 26 workweeks of FMLA leave.\n     Subpart B--EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENTS UNDER THE FAMILY AND \n         MEDICAL LEAVE ACT, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE \n         CONGRESSIONAL ACCOUNTABILITY ACT\n     825.200 Amount of Leave.\n       (a) Except in the case of leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness, an eligible \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement is limited to a total of 12 \n     workweeks of leave during any 12-month period for any one, or \n     more, of the following reasons:\n\n[[Page H6031]]\n\n       (1) The birth of the employee's son or daughter, and to \n     care for the newborn child;\n       (2) The placement with the employee of a son or daughter \n     for adoption or foster care, and to care for the newly placed \n     child;\n       (3) To care for the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or \n     parent with a serious health condition;\n       (4) Because of a serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of his or her job; and\n       (5) Because of any qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     fact that the employee's spouse, son, daughter, or parent is \n     a military member on covered active duty status (or has been \n     notified of an impending call or order to active duty).\n       (b) An employing office is permitted to choose any one of \n     the following methods for determining the 12-month period in \n     which the 12 weeks of leave entitlement described in \n     paragraph (a) of this section occurs:\n       (1) The calendar year;\n       (2) Any fixed 12-month leave year, such as a fiscal year or \n     a year starting on an employee's anniversary date;\n       (3) The 12-month period measured forward from the date any \n     employee's first FMLA leave under paragraph (a) begins; or\n       (4) A ``rolling'' 12-month period measured backward from \n     the date an employee uses any FMLA leave as described in \n     paragraph (a).\n       (c) Under methods in paragraphs (b)(1) and (b)(2) of this \n     section an employee would be entitled to up to 12 weeks of \n     FMLA leave at any time in the fixed 12-month period selected. \n     An employee could, therefore, take 12 weeks of leave at the \n     end of the year and 12 weeks at the beginning of the \n     following year. Under the method in paragraph (b)(3) of this \n     section, an employee would be entitled to 12 weeks of leave \n     during the year beginning on the first date FMLA leave is \n     taken; the next 12-month period would begin the first time \n     FMLA leave is taken after completion of any previous 12-month \n     period. Under the method in paragraph (b)(4) of this section, \n     the ``rolling'' 12-month period, each time an employee takes \n     FMLA leave the remaining leave entitlement would be any \n     balance of the 12 weeks which has not been used during the \n     immediately preceding 12 months. For example, if an employee \n     has taken eight weeks of leave during the past 12 months, an \n     additional four weeks of leave could be taken. If an employee \n     used four weeks beginning February 1, 2008, four weeks \n     beginning June 1, 2008, and four weeks beginning December 1, \n     2008, the employee would not be entitled to any additional \n     leave until February 1, 2009. However, beginning on February \n     1, 2009, the employee would again be eligible to take FMLA \n     leave, recouping the right to take the leave in the same \n     manner and amounts in which it was used in the previous year. \n     Thus, the employee would recoup (and be entitled to use) one \n     additional day of FMLA leave each day for four weeks, \n     commencing February 1, 2009. The employee would also begin to \n     recoup additional days beginning on June 1, 2009, and \n     additional days beginning on December 1, 2009. Accordingly, \n     employing offices using the rolling 12-month period may need \n     to calculate whether the employee is entitled to take FMLA \n     leave each time that leave is requested, and employees taking \n     FMLA leave on such a basis may fall in and out of FMLA \n     protection based on their FMLA usage in the prior 12 months. \n     For example, in the example above, if the employee needs six \n     weeks of leave for a serious health condition commencing \n     February 1, 2009, only the first four weeks of the leave \n     would be FMLA-protected.\n       (d)(1) Employing offices will be allowed to choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for the \n     leave entitlements described in paragraph (a) of this section \n     provided the alternative chosen is applied consistently and \n     uniformly to all employees. An employing office wishing to \n     change to another alternative is required to give at least 60 \n     days notice to all employees, and the transition must take \n     place in such a way that the employees retain the full \n     benefit of 12 weeks of leave under whichever method affords \n     the greatest benefit to the employee. Under no circumstances \n     may a new method be implemented in order to avoid the CAA's \n     FMLA leave requirements.\n       (2) [Reserved]\n       (e) If an employing office fails to select one of the \n     options in paragraph (b) of this section for measuring the \n     12-month period for the leave entitlements described in \n     paragraph (a), the option that provides the most beneficial \n     outcome for the employee will be used. The employing office \n     may subsequently select an option only by providing the 60-\n     day notice to all employees of the option the employing \n     office intends to implement. During the running of the 60-day \n     period any other employee who needs FMLA leave may use the \n     option providing the most beneficial outcome to that \n     employee. At the conclusion of the 60-day period the \n     employing office may implement the selected option.\n       (f) An eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement is \n     limited to a total of 26 workweeks of leave during a single \n     12-month period to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness. An employing office shall \n     determine the single 12-month period in which the 26 weeks of \n     leave entitlement described in this paragraph occurs using \n     the 12-month period measured forward from the date an \n     employee's first FMLA leave to care for the covered \n     servicemember begins. See 825.127(e)(1).\n       (g) During the single 12-month period described in \n     paragraph (f), an eligible employee's FMLA leave entitlement \n     is limited to a combined total of 26 workweeks of FMLA leave \n     for any qualifying reason. See 825.127(e)(3).\n       (h) For purposes of determining the amount of leave used by \n     an employee, the fact that a holiday may occur within the \n     week taken as FMLA leave has no effect; the week is counted \n     as a week of FMLA leave. However, if an employee is using \n     FMLA leave in increments of less than one week, the holiday \n     will not count against the employee's FMLA entitlement unless \n     the employee was otherwise scheduled and expected to work \n     during the holiday. Similarly, if for some reason the \n     employing office's business activity has temporarily ceased \n     and employees generally are not expected to report for work \n     for one or more weeks (e.g., a school closing two weeks for \n     the Christmas/New Year holiday or the summer vacation or an \n     employing office closing the office for repairs), the days \n     the employing office's activities have ceased do not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Methods for \n     determining an employee's 12-week leave entitlement are also \n     described in 825.205.\n       (i)(1) If employing offices jointly employ an employee, and \n     if they designate a primary employing office pursuant to \n     825.106(c), the primary employing office may choose any one \n     of the alternatives in paragraph (b) of this section for \n     measuring the 12-month period, provided that the alternative \n     chosen is applied consistently and uniformly to all employees \n     of the primary employing office including the jointly \n     employed employee.\n       (2) If employing offices fail to designate a primary \n     employing office pursuant to 825.106(c), an employee jointly \n     employed by the employing offices may, by so notifying one of \n     the employing offices, select that employing office to be the \n     primary employing office of the employee for purposes of the \n     application of paragraphs (d) and (e) of this section.\n     825.201 Leave to care for a parent.\n       (a) General rule. An eligible employee is entitled to FMLA \n     leave if needed to care for the employee's parent with a \n     serious health condition. Care for parents-in-law is not \n     covered by the FMLA. See 825.122(c) for definition of parent.\n       (b) Same employing office limitation. Spouses who are \n     eligible for FMLA leave and are employed by the same covered \n     employing office may be limited to a combined total of 12 \n     weeks of leave during any 12-month period if the leave is \n     taken to care for the employee's parent with a serious health \n     condition, for the birth of the employee's son or daughter or \n     to care for the child after the birth, or for placement of a \n     son or daughter with the employee for adoption or foster care \n     or to care for the child after placement. This limitation on \n     the total weeks of leave applies to leave taken for the \n     reasons specified as long as the spouses are employed by the \n     same employing office. It would apply, for example, even \n     though the spouses are employed at two different worksites of \n     an employing office. On the other hand, if one spouse is \n     ineligible for FMLA leave, the other spouse would be entitled \n     to a full 12 weeks of FMLA leave. Where the spouses both use \n     a portion of the total 12-week FMLA leave entitlement for \n     either the birth of a child, for placement for adoption or \n     foster care, or to care for a parent, the spouses would each \n     be entitled to the difference between the amount he or she \n     has taken individually and 12 weeks for FMLA leave for other \n     purposes. For example, if each spouse took six weeks of leave \n     to care for a parent, each could use an additional six weeks \n     due to his or her own serious health condition or to care for \n     a child with a serious health condition. See also 825.127(d).\n     825.202 Intermittent leave or reduced leave schedule.\n       (a) Definition. FMLA leave may be taken intermittently or \n     on a reduced leave schedule under certain circumstances. \n     Intermittent leave is FMLA leave taken in separate blocks of \n     time due to a single qualifying reason. A reduced leave \n     schedule is a leave schedule that reduces an employee's usual \n     number of working hours per workweek, or hours per workday. A \n     reduced leave schedule is a change in the employee's schedule \n     for a period of time, normally from full-time to part-time.\n       (b) Medical necessity. For intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule taken because of one's own serious \n     health condition, to care for a spouse, parent, son, or \n     daughter with a serious health condition, or to care for a \n     covered servicemember with a serious injury or illness, there \n     must be a medical need for leave and it must be that such \n     medical need can be best accommodated through an intermittent \n     or reduced leave schedule. The treatment regimen and other \n     information described in the certification of a serious \n     health condition and in the certification of a serious injury \n     or illness, if required by the employing office, addresses \n     the medical necessity of intermittent leave or leave on a \n     reduced leave schedule. See 825.306, 825.310. Leave may be \n     taken intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule when \n     medically necessary for planned and/or unanticipated medical \n     treatment of a serious health condition or of a covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness, or for recovery \n     from treatment or recovery from a serious health condition or \n     a covered servicemember's serious injury or illness. It may \n     also be taken to provide care or psychological comfort to a \n     covered family member with a serious health condition or a \n     covered\n\n[[Page H6032]]\n\n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness.\n       (1) Intermittent leave may be taken for a serious health \n     condition of a spouse, parent, son, or daughter, for the \n     employee's own serious health condition, or a serious injury \n     or illness of a covered servicemember which requires \n     treatment by a health care provider periodically, rather than \n     for one continuous period of time, and may include leave of \n     periods from an hour or more to several weeks. Examples of \n     intermittent leave would include leave taken on an occasional \n     basis for medical appointments, or leave taken several days \n     at a time spread over a period of six months, such as for \n     chemotherapy. A pregnant employee may take leave \n     intermittently for prenatal examinations or for her own \n     condition, such as for periods of severe morning sickness. An \n     example of an employee taking leave on a reduced leave \n     schedule is an employee who is recovering from a serious \n     health condition and is not strong enough to work a full-time \n     schedule.\n       (2) Intermittent or reduced schedule leave may be taken for \n     absences where the employee or family member is incapacitated \n     or unable to perform the essential functions of the position \n     because of a chronic serious health condition or a serious \n     injury or illness of a covered servicemember, even if he or \n     she does not receive treatment by a health care provider. See \n     825.113 and 825.127.\n       (c) Birth or placement. When leave is taken after the birth \n     of a healthy child or placement of a healthy child for \n     adoption or foster care, an employee may take leave \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule only if the \n     employing office agrees. Such a schedule reduction might \n     occur, for example, where an employee, with the employing \n     office's agreement, works part-time after the birth of a \n     child, or takes leave in several segments. The employing \n     office's agreement is not required, however, for leave during \n     which the expectant mother has a serious health condition in \n     connection with the birth of her child or if the newborn \n     child has a serious health condition. See 825.204 for rules \n     governing transfer to an alternative position that better \n     accommodates intermittent leave. See also 825.120 (pregnancy) \n     and 825.121 (adoption and foster care).\n       (d) Qualifying exigency. Leave due to a qualifying exigency \n     may be taken on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule \n     basis.\n     825.203 Scheduling of intermittent or reduced schedule leave.\n       Eligible employees may take FMLA leave on an intermittent \n     or reduced schedule basis when medically necessary due to the \n     serious health condition of a covered family member or the \n     employee or the serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember. See 825.202. Eligible employees may also take \n     FMLA leave on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis when \n     necessary because of a qualifying exigency. If an employee \n     needs leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule for \n     planned medical treatment, then the employee must make a \n     reasonable effort to schedule the treatment so as not to \n     disrupt unduly the employing office's operations.\n     825.204 Transfer of an employee to an alternative position \n         during intermittent leave or reduced schedule leave.\n       (a) Transfer or reassignment. If an employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule that \n     is foreseeable based on planned medical treatment for the \n     employee, a family member, or a covered servicemember, \n     including during a period of recovery from one's own serious \n     health condition, a serious health condition of a spouse, \n     parent, son, or daughter, or a serious injury or illness of a \n     covered servicemember, or if the employing office agrees to \n     permit intermittent or reduced schedule leave for the birth \n     of a child or for placement of a child for adoption or foster \n     care, the employing office may require the employee to \n     transfer temporarily, during the period the intermittent or \n     reduced leave schedule is required, to an available \n     alternative position for which the employee is qualified and \n     which better accommodates recurring periods of leave than \n     does the employee's regular position. See 825.601 for special \n     rules applicable to instructional employees of schools.\n       (b) Compliance. Transfer to an alternative position may \n     require compliance with any applicable collective bargaining \n     agreement and Federal law (such as the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act, as made applicable by the CAA). Transfer to \n     an alternative position may include altering an existing job \n     to better accommodate the employee's need for intermittent or \n     reduced scheduled leave.\n       (c) Equivalent pay and benefits. The alternative position \n     must have equivalent pay and benefits. An alternative \n     position for these purposes does not have to have equivalent \n     duties. The employing office may increase the pay and \n     benefits of an existing alternative position, so as to make \n     them equivalent to the pay and benefits of the employee's \n     regular job. The employing office may also transfer the \n     employee to a part-time job with the same hourly rate of pay \n     and benefits, provided the employee is not required to take \n     more leave than is medically necessary. For example, an \n     employee desiring to take leave in increments of four hours \n     per day could be transferred to a half-time job, or could \n     remain in the employee's same job on a part-time schedule, \n     paying the same hourly rate as the employee's previous job \n     and enjoying the same benefits. The employing office may not \n     eliminate benefits which otherwise would not be provided to \n     part-time employees; however, an employing office may \n     proportionately reduce benefits such as vacation leave where \n     an employing office's normal practice is to base such \n     benefits on the number of hours worked.\n       (d) Employing office limitations. An employing office may \n     not transfer the employee to an alternative position in order \n     to discourage the employee from taking leave or otherwise \n     work a hardship on the employee. For example, a white collar \n     employee may not be assigned to perform laborer's work; an \n     employee working the day shift may not be reassigned to the \n     graveyard shift; an employee working in the headquarters \n     facility may not be reassigned to a branch a significant \n     distance away from the employee's normal job location. Any \n     such attempt on the part of the employing office to make such \n     a transfer will be held to be contrary to the prohibited acts \n     provisions of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) Reinstatement of employee. When an employee who is \n     taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     and has been transferred to an alternative position no longer \n     needs to continue on leave and is able to return to full-time \n     work, the employee must be placed in the same or equivalent \n     job as the job he or she left when the leave commenced. An \n     employee may not be required to take more leave than \n     necessary to address the circumstance that precipitated the \n     need for leave.\n     825.205 Increments of FMLA leave for intermittent or reduced \n         schedule leave.\n       (a) Minimum increment. (1) When an employee takes FMLA \n     leave on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis, the \n     employing office must account for the leave using an \n     increment no greater than the shortest period of time that \n     the employing office uses to account for use of other forms \n     of leave provided that it is not greater than one hour and \n     provided further that an employee's FMLA leave entitlement \n     may not be reduced by more than the amount of leave actually \n     taken. An employing office may not require an employee to \n     take more leave than is necessary to address the \n     circumstances that precipitated the need for the leave, \n     provided that the leave is counted using the shortest \n     increment of leave used to account for any other type of \n     leave. See also 825.205(a)(2) for the physical impossibility \n     exception, and 825.600 and 825.601 for special rules \n     applicable to employees of schools. If an employing office \n     uses different increments to account for different types of \n     leave, the employing office must account for FMLA leave in \n     the smallest increment used to account for any other type of \n     leave. For example, if an employing office accounts for the \n     use of annual leave in increments of one hour and the use of \n     sick leave in increments of one-half hour, then FMLA leave \n     use must be accounted for using increments no larger than \n     one-half hour. If an employing office accounts for use of \n     leave in varying increments at different times of the day or \n     shift, the employing office may also account for FMLA leave \n     in varying increments, provided that the increment used for \n     FMLA leave is no greater than the smallest increment used for \n     any other type of leave during the period in which the FMLA \n     leave is taken. If an employing office accounts for other \n     forms of leave use in increments greater than one hour, the \n     employing office must account for FMLA leave use in \n     increments no greater than one hour. An employing office may \n     account for FMLA leave in shorter increments than used for \n     other forms of leave. For example, an employing office that \n     accounts for other forms of leave in one hour increments may \n     account for FMLA leave in a shorter increment when the \n     employee arrives at work several minutes late, and the \n     employing office wants the employee to begin work \n     immediately. Such accounting for FMLA leave will not alter \n     the increment considered to be the shortest period used to \n     account for other forms of leave or the use of FMLA leave in \n     other circumstances. In all cases, employees may not be \n     charged FMLA leave for periods during which they are working.\n       (2) Where it is physically impossible for an employee using \n     intermittent leave or working a reduced leave schedule to \n     commence or end work mid-way through a shift, such as where a \n     flight attendant or a railroad conductor is scheduled to work \n     aboard an airplane or train, or a laboratory employee is \n     unable to enter or leave a sealed ``clean room'' during a \n     certain period of time and no equivalent position is \n     available, the entire period that the employee is forced to \n     be absent is designated as FMLA leave and counts against the \n     employee's FMLA entitlement. The period of the physical \n     impossibility is limited to the period during which the \n     employing office is unable to permit the employee to work \n     prior to a period of FMLA leave or return the employee to the \n     same or equivalent position due to the physical impossibility \n     after a period of FMLA leave. See 825.214.\n       (b) Calculation of leave. (1) When an employee takes leave \n     on an intermittent or reduced leave schedule, only the amount \n     of leave actually taken may be counted toward the employee's \n     leave entitlement. The actual workweek is the basis of leave \n     entitlement. Therefore, if an employee who would otherwise \n     work 40 hours a week takes off eight hours, the employee \n     would use one-fifth (\\1/5\\) of a week of FMLA leave. \n     Similarly, if a full-time employee who would otherwise work \n     eight hour days works four-hour days under a reduced leave \n     schedule, the employee would use one half (\\1/2\\) week of \n     FMLA leave each week. Where an employee works a part-\n\n[[Page H6033]]\n\n     time schedule or variable hours, the amount of FMLA leave \n     that an employee uses is determined on a pro rata or \n     proportional basis. If an employee who would otherwise work \n     30 hours per week, but works only 20 hours a week under a \n     reduced leave schedule, the employee's 10 hours of leave \n     would constitute one-third (1/3) of a week of FMLA leave for \n     each week the employee works the reduced leave schedule. An \n     employing office may convert these fractions to their hourly \n     equivalent so long as the conversion equitably reflects the \n     employee's total normally scheduled hours. An employee does \n     not accrue FMLA-protected leave at any particular hourly \n     rate. An eligible employee is entitled to up to a total of 12 \n     workweeks of leave, or 26 workweeks in the case of military \n     caregiver leave, and the total number of hours contained in \n     those workweeks is necessarily dependent on the specific \n     hours the employee would have worked but for the use of \n     leave. See also 825.601 and 825.602 on special rules for \n     schools.\n       (2) If an employing office has made a permanent or long-\n     term change in the employee's schedule (for reasons other \n     than FMLA, and prior to the notice of need for FMLA leave), \n     the hours worked under the new schedule are to be used for \n     making this calculation.\n       (3) If an employee's schedule varies from week to week to \n     such an extent that an employing office is unable to \n     determine with any certainty how many hours the employee \n     would otherwise have worked (but for the taking of FMLA \n     leave), a weekly average of the hours worked over the 12 \n     months prior to the beginning of the leave period (including \n     any hours for which the employee took leave of any type) \n     would be used for calculating the employee's leave \n     entitlement.\n       (c) Overtime. If an employee would normally be required to \n     work overtime, but is unable to do so because of a FMLA-\n     qualifying reason that limits the employee's ability to work \n     overtime, the hours which the employee would have been \n     required to work may be counted against the employee's FMLA \n     entitlement. In such a case, the employee is using \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave. For example, if an \n     employee would normally be required to work for 48 hours in a \n     particular week, but due to a serious health condition the \n     employee is unable to work more than 40 hours that week, the \n     employee would utilize eight hours of FMLA-protected leave \n     out of the 48-hour workweek, or one-sixth (\\1/6\\) of a week \n     of FMLA leave. Voluntary overtime hours that an employee does \n     not work due to an FMLA-qualifying reason may not be counted \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n     825.206 Interaction with the FLSA.\n       (a) Leave taken under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     may be unpaid. If an employee is otherwise exempt from \n     minimum wage and overtime requirements of the Fair Labor \n     Standards Act (FLSA), as made applicable by the CAA, as a \n     salaried executive, administrative, or professional employee \n     (under regulations issued by the Board, at part 541), \n     providing unpaid FMLA-qualifying leave to such an employee \n     will not cause the employee to lose the FLSA exemption. This \n     means that under regulations currently in effect, where an \n     employee meets the specified duties test, is paid on a salary \n     basis, and is paid a salary of at least the amount specified \n     in the regulations, the employing office may make deductions \n     from the employee's salary for any hours taken as \n     intermittent or reduced FMLA leave within a workweek, without \n     affecting the exempt status of the employee. The fact that an \n     employing office provides FMLA leave, whether paid or unpaid, \n     and maintains records regarding FMLA leave, will not be \n     relevant to the determination whether an employee is exempt \n     within the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541.\n       (b) For an employee paid in accordance with a fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment for overtime, where permitted by \n     section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), the employing office, \n     during the period in which intermittent or reduced schedule \n     FMLA leave is scheduled to be taken, may compensate an \n     employee on an hourly basis and pay only for the hours the \n     employee works, including time and one-half the employee's \n     regular rate for overtime hours. The change to payment on an \n     hourly basis would include the entire period during which the \n     employee is taking intermittent leave, including weeks in \n     which no leave is taken. The hourly rate shall be determined \n     by dividing the employee's weekly salary by the employee's \n     normal or average schedule of hours worked during weeks in \n     which FMLA leave is not being taken. If an employing office \n     chooses to follow this exception from the fluctuating \n     workweek method of payment, the employing office must do so \n     uniformly, with respect to all employees paid on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis for whom FMLA leave is taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule basis. If an employing \n     office does not elect to convert the employee's compensation \n     to hourly pay, no deduction may be taken for FMLA leave \n     absences. Once the need for intermittent or reduced scheduled \n     leave is over, the employee may be restored to payment on a \n     fluctuating workweek basis.\n       (c) This special exception to the salary basis requirements \n     of the FLSA exemption or fluctuating workweek payment \n     requirements applies only to employees of covered employing \n     offices who are eligible for FMLA leave, and to leave which \n     qualifies as FMLA leave. Hourly or other deductions which are \n     not in accordance with the Board's FLSA regulations at part \n     541 or with a permissible fluctuating workweek method of \n     payment for overtime may not be taken, for example, where the \n     employee has not worked long enough to be eligible for FMLA \n     leave without potentially affecting the employee's \n     eligibility for exemption. Nor may deductions which are not \n     permitted by the Board's FLSA regulations at part 541 or by a \n     permissible fluctuating workweek method of payment for \n     overtime be taken from such an employee's salary for any \n     leave which does not qualify as FMLA leave, for example, \n     deductions from an employee's pay for leave required under an \n     employing office's policy or practice for a reason which does \n     not qualify as FMLA leave, e.g., leave to care for a \n     grandparent or for a medical condition which does not qualify \n     as a serious health condition; or for leave which is more \n     generous than provided by the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, such as leave in excess of 12 weeks in a year. Employing \n     offices may comply with the employing office's own policy/\n     practice under these circumstances and maintain the \n     employee's eligibility for exemption or for the fluctuating \n     workweek method of pay by not taking hourly deductions from \n     the employee's pay, in accordance with FLSA requirements, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, or may take such deductions, \n     treating the employee as an hourly employee and pay overtime \n     premium pay for hours worked over 40 in a workweek.\n     825.207 Substitution of paid leave.\n       (a) Generally, FMLA leave is unpaid. However, under the \n     circumstances described in this section, FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, permits an eligible employee to choose \n     to substitute accrued paid leave for FMLA leave. If an \n     employee does not choose to substitute accrued paid leave, \n     the employing office may require the employee to substitute \n     accrued paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave. The term substitute \n     means that the paid leave provided by the employing office, \n     and accrued pursuant to established policies of the employing \n     office, will run concurrently with the unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Accordingly, the employee receives pay pursuant to the \n     employing office's applicable paid leave policy during the \n     period of otherwise unpaid FMLA leave. An employee's ability \n     to substitute accrued paid leave is determined by the terms \n     and conditions of the employing office's normal leave policy. \n     When an employee chooses, or an employing office requires, \n     substitution of accrued paid leave, the employing office must \n     inform the employee that the employee must satisfy any \n     procedural requirements of the paid leave policy only in \n     connection with the receipt of such payment. See 825.300(c). \n     If an employee does not comply with the additional \n     requirements in an employing office's paid leave policy, the \n     employee is not entitled to substitute accrued paid leave, \n     but the employee remains entitled to take unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Employing offices may not discriminate against employees on \n     FMLA leave in the administration of their paid leave \n     policies.\n       (b) If neither the employee nor the employing office elects \n     to substitute paid leave for unpaid FMLA leave under the \n     above conditions and circumstances, the employee will remain \n     entitled to all the paid leave which is earned or accrued \n     under the terms of the employing office's plan.\n       (c) If an employee uses paid leave under circumstances \n     which do not qualify as FMLA leave, the leave will not count \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. For example, \n     paid sick leave used for a medical condition which is not a \n     serious health condition or serious injury or illness does \n     not count against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n       (d) Leave taken pursuant to a disability leave plan would \n     be considered FMLA leave for a serious health condition and \n     counted in the leave entitlement permitted under FMLA if it \n     meets the criteria set forth above in 825.112 through \n     825.115. In such cases, the employing office may designate \n     the leave as FMLA leave and count the leave against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement. Because leave pursuant to \n     a disability benefit plan is not unpaid, the provision for \n     substitution of the employee's accrued paid leave is \n     inapplicable, and neither the employee nor the employing \n     office may require the substitution of paid leave. However, \n     employing offices and employees may agree to have paid leave \n     supplement the disability plan benefits, such as in the case \n     where a plan only provides replacement income for two-thirds \n     of an employee's salary.\n       (e) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, provides that \n     a serious health condition may result from injury to the \n     employee on or off the job. If the employing office \n     designates the leave as FMLA leave in accordance with \n     825.300(d), the leave counts against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. Because the workers' compensation absence \n     is not unpaid, the provision for substitution of the \n     employee's accrued paid leave is not applicable, and neither \n     the employee nor the employing office may require the \n     substitution of paid leave. However, employing offices and \n     employees may agree, to have paid leave supplement workers' \n     compensation benefits, such as in the case where workers' \n     compensation only provides replacement income for two-thirds \n     of an employee's salary. If the health care provider treating \n     the employee for the workers' compensation injury certifies \n     the employee is able to return to a light duty job but is \n     unable to return to the\n\n[[Page H6034]]\n\n     same or equivalent job, the employee may decline the \n     employing office's offer of a light duty job. As a result, \n     the employee may lose workers' compensation payments, but is \n     entitled to remain on unpaid FMLA leave until the employee's \n     FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted. As of the date workers' \n     compensation benefits cease, the substitution provision \n     becomes applicable and either the employee may elect or the \n     employing office may require the use of accrued paid leave. \n     See also 825.210(f), 825.216(d), 825.220(d), 825.307(a) and \n     825.702 (d)(1) and (2) regarding the relationship between \n     workers' compensation absences and FMLA leave.\n       (f) Under the FLSA, as made applicable by the CAA, an \n     employing office always has the right to cash out an \n     employee's compensatory time or to require the employee to \n     use the time. Therefore, if an employee requests and is \n     permitted to use accrued compensatory time to receive pay for \n     time taken off for an FMLA reason, or if the employing office \n     requires such use pursuant to the FLSA, the time taken may be \n     counted against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement.\n     825.208 [Removed and reserved]\n     825.209 Maintenance of employee benefits.\n       (a) During any FMLA leave, an employing office must \n     maintain the employee's coverage under the Federal Employees \n     Health Benefits Program or any group health plan (as defined \n     in the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 at 26 U.S.C. 5000(b)(1)) \n     on the same conditions as coverage would have been provided \n     if the employee had been continuously employed during the \n     entire leave period. All employing offices are subject to the \n     requirements of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to \n     maintain health coverage. The definition of group health plan \n     is set forth in 825.102. For purposes of FMLA, the term group \n     health plan shall not include an insurance program providing \n     health coverage under which employees purchase individual \n     policies from insurers provided that:\n       (1) No contributions are made by the employing office;\n       (2) Participation in the program is completely voluntary \n     for employees;\n       (3) The sole functions of the employing office with respect \n     to the program are, without endorsing the program, to permit \n     the insurer to publicize the program to employees, to collect \n     premiums through payroll deductions and to remit them to the \n     insurer;\n       (4) The employing office receives no consideration in the \n     form of cash or otherwise in connection with the program, \n     other than reasonable compensation, excluding any profit, for \n     administrative services actually rendered in connection with \n     payroll deduction; and\n       (5) The premium charged with respect to such coverage does \n     not increase in the event the employment relationship \n     terminates.\n       (b) The same group health plan benefits provided to an \n     employee prior to taking FMLA leave must be maintained during \n     the FMLA leave. For example, if family member coverage is \n     provided to an employee, family member coverage must be \n     maintained during the FMLA leave. Similarly, benefit coverage \n     during FMLA leave for medical care, surgical care, hospital \n     care, dental care, eye care, mental health counseling, \n     substance abuse treatment, etc., must be maintained during \n     leave if provided in an employing office's group health plan, \n     including a supplement to a group health plan, whether or not \n     provided through a flexible spending account or other \n     component of a cafeteria plan.\n       (c) If an employing office provides a new health plan or \n     benefits or changes health benefits or plans while an \n     employee is on FMLA leave, the employee is entitled to the \n     new or changed plan/benefits to the same extent as if the \n     employee were not on leave. For example, if an employing \n     office changes a group health plan so that dental care \n     becomes covered under the plan, an employee on FMLA leave \n     must be given the same opportunity as other employees to \n     receive (or obtain) the dental care coverage. Any other plan \n     changes (e.g., in coverage, premiums, deductibles, etc.) \n     which apply to all employees of the workforce would also \n     apply to an employee on FMLA leave.\n       (d) Notice of any opportunity to change plans or benefits \n     must also be given to an employee on FMLA leave. If the group \n     health plan permits an employee to change from single to \n     family coverage upon the birth of a child or otherwise add \n     new family members, such a change in benefits must be made \n     available while an employee is on FMLA leave. If the employee \n     requests the changed coverage it must be provided by the \n     employing office.\n       (e) An employee may choose not to retain group health plan \n     coverage during FMLA leave. However, when an employee returns \n     from leave, the employee is entitled to be reinstated on the \n     same terms as prior to taking the leave, including family or \n     dependent coverages, without any qualifying period, physical \n     examination, exclusion of pre-existing conditions, etc. See \n     825.212(c).\n       (f) Except as required by the Consolidated Omnibus Budget \n     Reconciliation Act of 1986 (COBRA) or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable, and for key employees (as discussed \n     below), an employing office's obligation to maintain health \n     benefits during leave (and to restore the employee to the \n     same or equivalent employment) under FMLA ceases if and when \n     the employment relationship would have terminated if the \n     employee had not taken FMLA leave (e.g., if the employee's \n     position is eliminated as part of a nondiscriminatory \n     reduction in force and the employee would not have been \n     transferred to another position); an employee informs the \n     employing office of his or her intent not to return from \n     leave (including before starting the leave if the employing \n     office is so informed before the leave starts); or the \n     employee fails to return from leave or continues on leave \n     after exhausting his or her FMLA leave entitlement in the 12-\n     month period.\n       (g) If a key employee (see 825.218) does not return from \n     leave when notified by the employing office that substantial \n     or grievous economic injury will result from his or her \n     reinstatement, the employee's entitlement to group health \n     plan benefits continues unless and until the employee advises \n     the employing office that the employee does not desire \n     restoration to employment at the end of the leave period, or \n     the FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted, or reinstatement is \n     actually denied.\n       (h) An employee's entitlement to benefits other than group \n     health benefits during a period of FMLA leave (e.g., holiday \n     pay) is to be determined by the employing office's \n     established policy for providing such benefits when the \n     employee is on other forms of leave (paid or unpaid, as \n     appropriate).\n     825.210 Employee payment of group health benefit premiums.\n       (a) Group health plan benefits must be maintained on the \n     same basis as coverage would have been provided if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. Therefore, any share of group health plan premiums \n     which had been paid by the employee prior to FMLA leave must \n     continue to be paid by the employee during the FMLA leave \n     period. If premiums are raised or lowered, the employee would \n     be required to pay the new premium rates. Maintenance of \n     health insurance policies which are not a part of the \n     employing office's group health plan, as described in \n     825.209(a), are the sole responsibility of the employee. The \n     employee and the insurer should make necessary arrangements \n     for payment of premiums during periods of unpaid FMLA leave.\n       (b) If the FMLA leave is substituted paid leave, the \n     employee's share of premiums must be paid by the method \n     normally used during any paid leave, presumably as a payroll \n     deduction.\n       (c) If FMLA leave is unpaid, the employing office has a \n     number of options for obtaining payment from the employee. \n     The employing office may require that payment be made to the \n     employing office or to the insurance carrier, but no \n     additional charge may be added to the employee's premium \n     payment for administrative expenses. The employing office may \n     require employees to pay their share of premium payments in \n     any of the following ways:\n       (1) Payment would be due at the same time as it would be \n     made if by payroll deduction;\n       (2) Payment would be due on the same schedule as payments \n     are made under COBRA or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is \n     applicable;\n       (3) Payment would be prepaid pursuant to a cafeteria plan \n     at the employee's option;\n       (4) The employing office's existing rules for payment by \n     employees on leave without pay would be followed, provided \n     that such rules do not require prepayment (i.e., prior to the \n     commencement of the leave) of the premiums that will become \n     due during a period of unpaid FMLA leave or payment of higher \n     premiums than if the employee had continued to work instead \n     of taking leave; or\n       (5) Another system voluntarily agreed to between the \n     employing office and the employee, which may include \n     prepayment of premiums (e.g., through increased payroll \n     deductions when the need for the FMLA leave is foreseeable).\n       (d) The employing office must provide the employee with \n     advance written notice of the terms and conditions under \n     which these payments must be made. See 825. 300(c).\n       (e) An employing office may not require more of an employee \n     using unpaid FMLA leave than the employing office requires of \n     other employees on leave without pay.\n       (f) An employee who is receiving payments as a result of a \n     workers' compensation injury must make arrangements with the \n     employing office for payment of group health plan benefits \n     when simultaneously taking FMLA leave. See 825.207(e).\n     825.211 Maintenance of benefits under multi-employer health \n         plans.\n       (a) A multi-employer health plan is a plan to which more \n     than one employing office is required to contribute, and \n     which is maintained pursuant to one or more collective \n     bargaining agreements between employee organization(s) and \n     the employing offices.\n       (b) An employing office under a multi-employer plan must \n     continue to make contributions on behalf of an employee using \n     FMLA leave as though the employee had been continuously \n     employed, unless the plan contains an explicit FMLA provision \n     for maintaining coverage such as through pooled contributions \n     by all employing offices party to the plan.\n       (c) During the duration of an employee's FMLA leave, \n     coverage by the group health plan, and benefits provided \n     pursuant to the plan, must be maintained at the level of \n     coverage and benefits which were applicable to the employee \n     at the time FMLA leave commenced.\n       (d) An employee using FMLA leave cannot be required to use \n     banked hours or pay a\n\n[[Page H6035]]\n\n     greater premium than the employee would have been required to \n     pay if the employee had been continuously employed.\n       (e) As provided in 825.209(f) of this part, group health \n     plan coverage must be maintained for an employee on FMLA \n     leave until:\n       (1) The employee's FMLA leave entitlement is exhausted;\n       (2) The employing office can show that the employee would \n     have been laid off and the employment relationship \n     terminated; or\n       (3) The employee provides unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work.\n     825.212 Employee failure to pay health plan premium payments.\n       (a)(1) In the absence of an established employing office \n     policy providing a longer grace period, an employing office's \n     obligations to maintain health insurance coverage cease under \n     FMLA if an employee's premium payment is more than 30 days \n     late. In order to drop the coverage for an employee whose \n     premium payment is late, the employing office must provide \n     written notice to the employee that the payment has not been \n     received. Such notice must be mailed to the employee at least \n     15 days before coverage is to cease, advising that coverage \n     will be dropped on a specified date at least 15 days after \n     the date of the letter unless the payment has been received \n     by that date. If the employing office has established \n     policies regarding other forms of unpaid leave that provide \n     for the employing office to cease coverage retroactively to \n     the date the unpaid premium payment was due, the employing \n     office may drop the employee from coverage retroactively in \n     accordance with that policy, provided the 15-day notice was \n     given. In the absence of such a policy, coverage for the \n     employee may be terminated at the end of the 30-day grace \n     period, where the required 15-day notice has been provided.\n       (2) An employing office has no obligation regarding the \n     maintenance of a health insurance policy which is not a group \n     health plan. See 825.209(a).\n       (3) All other obligations of an employing office under FMLA \n     would continue; for example, the employing office continues \n     to have an obligation to reinstate an employee upon return \n     from leave.\n       (b) The employing office may recover the employee's share \n     of any premium payments missed by the employee for any FMLA \n     leave period during which the employing office maintains \n     health coverage by paying the employee's share after the \n     premium payment is missed.\n       (c) If coverage lapses because an employee has not made \n     required premium payments, upon the employee's return from \n     FMLA leave the employing office must still restore the \n     employee to coverage/benefits equivalent to those the \n     employee would have had if leave had not been taken and the \n     premium payment(s) had not been missed, including family or \n     dependent coverage. See 825.215(d)(1)-(5). In such case, an \n     employee may not be required to meet any qualification \n     requirements imposed by the plan, including any new \n     preexisting condition waiting period, to wait for an open \n     season, or to pass a medical examination to obtain \n     reinstatement of coverage. If an employing office terminates \n     an employee's insurance in accordance with this section and \n     fails to restore the employee's health insurance as required \n     by this section upon the employee's return, the employing \n     office may be liable for benefits lost by reason of the \n     violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as a \n     direct result of the violation, and for appropriate equitable \n     relief tailored to the harm suffered.\n     825.213 Employing office recovery of benefit costs.\n       (a) In addition to the circumstances discussed in \n     825.212(b), an employing office may recover its share of \n     health plan premiums during a period of unpaid FMLA leave \n     from an employee if the employee fails to return to work \n     after the employee's FMLA leave entitlement has been \n     exhausted or expires, unless the reason the employee does not \n     return is due to:\n       (1) The continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a \n     serious health condition of the employee or the employee's \n     family member, or a serious injury or illness of a covered \n     servicemember, which would otherwise entitle the employee to \n     leave under FMLA; or\n       (2) Other circumstances beyond the employee's control. \n     Examples of other circumstances beyond the employee's control \n     are necessarily broad. They include such situations as where \n     a parent chooses to stay home with a newborn child who has a \n     serious health condition; an employee's spouse is \n     unexpectedly transferred to a job location more than 75 miles \n     from the employee's worksite; a relative or individual other \n     than a covered family member has a serious health condition \n     and the employee is needed to provide care; the employee is \n     laid off while on leave; or, the employee is a key employee \n     who decides not to return to work upon being notified of the \n     employing office's intention to deny restoration because of \n     substantial and grievous economic injury to the employing \n     office's operations and is not reinstated by the employing \n     office. Other circumstances beyond the employee's control \n     would not include a situation where an employee desires to \n     remain with a parent in a distant city even though the parent \n     no longer requires the employee's care, or a parent chooses \n     not to return to work to stay home with a well, newborn \n     child.\n       (3) When an employee fails to return to work because of the \n     continuation, recurrence, or onset of either a serious health \n     condition of the employee or employee's family member, or a \n     serious injury or illness of a covered servicemember, thereby \n     precluding the employing office from recovering its (share \n     of) health benefit premium payments made on the employee's \n     behalf during a period of unpaid FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may require medical certification of the employee's or \n     the family member's serious health condition or the covered \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness. Such certification \n     is not required unless requested by the employing office. The \n     cost of the certification shall be borne by the employee, and \n     the employee is not entitled to be paid for the time or \n     travel costs spent in acquiring the certification. The \n     employee is required to provide medical certification in a \n     timely manner which, for purposes of this section, is within \n     30 days from the date of the employing office's request. For \n     purposes of medical certification, the employee may use the \n     optional forms developed for this purpose. See 825.306(b), \n     825.310(c)-(d) and Forms A, B, and F. If the employing office \n     requests medical certification and the employee does not \n     provide such certification in a timely manner (within 30 \n     days), or the reason for not returning to work does not meet \n     the test of other circumstances beyond the employee's \n     control, the employing office may recover 100 percent of the \n     health benefit premiums it paid during the period of unpaid \n     FMLA leave.\n       (b) Under some circumstances an employing office may elect \n     to maintain other benefits, e.g., life insurance, disability \n     insurance, etc., by paying the employee's (share of) premiums \n     during periods of unpaid FMLA leave. For example, to ensure \n     the employing office can meet its responsibilities to provide \n     equivalent benefits to the employee upon return from unpaid \n     FMLA leave, it may be necessary that premiums be paid \n     continuously to avoid a lapse of coverage. If the employing \n     office elects to maintain such benefits during the leave, at \n     the conclusion of leave, the employing office is entitled to \n     recover only the costs incurred for paying the employee's \n     share of any premiums whether or not the employee returns to \n     work.\n       (c) An employee who returns to work for at least 30 \n     calendar days is considered to have returned to work. An \n     employee who transfers directly from taking FMLA leave to \n     retirement, or who retires during the first 30 days after the \n     employee returns to work, is deemed to have returned to work.\n       (d) When an employee elects or an employing office requires \n     paid leave to be substituted for FMLA leave, the employing \n     office may not recover its (share of) health insurance or \n     other non-health benefit premiums for any period of FMLA \n     leave covered by paid leave. Because paid leave provided \n     under a plan covering temporary disabilities (including \n     workers' compensation) is not unpaid, recovery of health \n     insurance premiums does not apply to such paid leave.\n       (e) The amount that self-insured employing offices may \n     recover is limited to only the employing office's share of \n     allowable premiums as would be calculated under COBRA, \n     excluding the two percent fee for administrative costs.\n       (f) When an employee fails to return to work, any health \n     and non-health benefit premiums which this section of the \n     regulations permits an employing office to recover are a debt \n     owed by the non-returning employee to the employing office. \n     The existence of this debt caused by the employee's failure \n     to return to work does not alter the employing office's \n     responsibilities for health benefit coverage and, under a \n     self-insurance plan, payment of claims incurred during the \n     period of FMLA leave. To the extent recovery is allowed, the \n     employing office may recover the costs through deduction from \n     any sums due to the employee (e.g., unpaid wages, vacation \n     pay, etc.), provided such deductions do not otherwise violate \n     applicable wage payment or other laws. Alternatively, the \n     employing office may initiate legal action against the \n     employee to recover such costs.\n     825.214 Employee right to reinstatement.\n       General Rule. On return from FMLA leave, an employee is \n     entitled to be returned to the same position the employee \n     held when leave commenced, or to an equivalent position with \n     equivalent benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of \n     employment. An employee is entitled to such reinstatement \n     even if the employee has been replaced or his or her position \n     has been restructured to accommodate the employee's absence. \n     See also 825.106(e) for the obligations of employing offices \n     that are joint employers.\n     825.215 Equivalent position.\n       (a) Equivalent position. An equivalent position is one that \n     is virtually identical to the employee's former position in \n     terms of pay, benefits and working conditions, including \n     privileges, prerequisites and status. It must involve the \n     same or substantially similar duties and responsibilities, \n     which must entail substantially equivalent skill, effort, \n     responsibility, and authority.\n       (b) Conditions to qualify. If an employee is no longer \n     qualified for the position because of the employee's \n     inability to attend a necessary course, renew a license, \n     etc., as a result of the leave, the employee shall be given a \n     reasonable opportunity to fulfill those conditions upon \n     return to work.\n       (c) Equivalent Pay. (1) An employee is entitled to any \n     unconditional pay increases which may have occurred during \n     the FMLA leave period, such as cost of living increases. Pay \n     increases conditioned upon seniority, length of service, or \n     work performed must be granted in accordance with the \n     employing\n\n[[Page H6036]]\n\n     office's policy or practice with respect to other employees \n     on an equivalent leave status for a reason that does not \n     qualify as FMLA leave. An employee is entitled to be restored \n     to a position with the same or equivalent pay premiums, such \n     as a shift differential. If an employee departed from a \n     position averaging ten hours of overtime (and corresponding \n     overtime pay) each week, an employee is ordinarily entitled \n     to such a position on return from FMLA leave.\n       (2) Equivalent pay includes any bonus or payment, whether \n     it is discretionary or non-discretionary, made to employees \n     consistent with the provisions of paragraph (c)(1) of this \n     section. However, if a bonus or other payment is based on the \n     achievement of a specified goal such as hours worked, \n     products sold or perfect attendance, and the employee has not \n     met the goal due to FMLA leave, then the payment may be \n     denied, unless otherwise paid to employees on an equivalent \n     leave status for a reason that does not qualify as FMLA \n     leave. For example, if an employee who used paid vacation \n     leave for a non-FMLA purpose would receive the payment, then \n     the employee who used paid vacation leave for an FMLA-\n     protected purpose also must receive the payment.\n       (d) Equivalent benefits. Benefits include all benefits \n     provided or made available to employees by an employing \n     office, including group life insurance, health insurance, \n     disability insurance, sick leave, annual leave, educational \n     benefits, and pensions, regardless of whether such benefits \n     are provided by a practice or written policy of an employing \n     office through an employee benefit plan.\n       (1) At the end of an employee's FMLA leave, benefits must \n     be resumed in the same manner and at the same levels as \n     provided when the leave began, and subject to any changes in \n     benefit levels that may have taken place during the period of \n     FMLA leave affecting the entire work force, unless otherwise \n     elected by the employee. Upon return from FMLA leave, an \n     employee cannot be required to requalify for any benefits the \n     employee enjoyed before FMLA leave began (including family or \n     dependent coverages). For example, if an employee was covered \n     by a life insurance policy before taking leave but is not \n     covered or coverage lapses during the period of unpaid FMLA \n     leave, the employee cannot be required to meet any \n     qualifications, such as taking a physical examination, in \n     order to requalify for life insurance upon return from leave. \n     Accordingly, some employing offices may find it necessary to \n     modify life insurance and other benefits programs in order to \n     restore employees to equivalent benefits upon return from \n     FMLA leave, make arrangements for continued payment of costs \n     to maintain such benefits during unpaid FMLA leave, or pay \n     these costs subject to recovery from the employee on return \n     from leave. See 825.213(b).\n       (2) An employee may, but is not entitled to, accrue any \n     additional benefits or seniority during unpaid FMLA leave. \n     Benefits accrued at the time leave began, however, (e.g., \n     paid vacation, sick or personal leave to the extent not \n     substituted for FMLA leave) must be available to an employee \n     upon return from leave.\n       (3) If, while on unpaid FMLA leave, an employee desires to \n     continue life insurance, disability insurance, or other types \n     of benefits for which he or she typically pays, the employing \n     office is required to follow established policies or \n     practices for continuing such benefits for other instances of \n     leave without pay. If the employing office has no established \n     policy, the employee and the employing office are encouraged \n     to agree upon arrangements before FMLA leave begins.\n       (4) With respect to pension and other retirement plans, any \n     period of unpaid FMLA leave shall not be treated as or \n     counted toward a break in service for purposes of vesting and \n     eligibility to participate. Also, if the plan requires an \n     employee to be employed on a specific date in order to be \n     credited with a year of service for vesting, contributions or \n     participation purposes, an employee on unpaid FMLA leave on \n     that date shall be deemed to have been employed on that date. \n     However, unpaid FMLA leave periods need not be treated as \n     credited service for purposes of benefit accrual, vesting and \n     eligibility to participate.\n       (5) Employees on unpaid FMLA leave are to be treated as if \n     they continued to work for purposes of changes to benefit \n     plans. They are entitled to changes in benefits plans, except \n     those which may be dependent upon seniority or accrual during \n     the leave period, immediately upon return from leave or to \n     the same extent they would have qualified if no leave had \n     been taken. For example if the benefit plan is predicated on \n     a pre-established number of hours worked each year and the \n     employee does not have sufficient hours as a result of taking \n     unpaid FMLA leave, the benefit is lost. (In this regard, \n     825.209 addresses health benefits.)\n       (e) Equivalent terms and conditions of employment. An \n     equivalent position must have substantially similar duties, \n     conditions, responsibilities, privileges and status as the \n     employee's original position.\n       (1) The employee must be reinstated to the same or a \n     geographically proximate worksite (i.e., one that does not \n     involve a significant increase in commuting time or distance) \n     from where the employee had previously been employed. If the \n     employee's original worksite has been closed, the employee is \n     entitled to the same rights as if the employee had not been \n     on leave when the worksite closed. For example, if an \n     employing office transfers all employees from a closed \n     worksite to a new worksite in a different city, the employee \n     on leave is also entitled to transfer under the same \n     conditions as if he or she had continued to be employed.\n       (2) The employee is ordinarily entitled to return to the \n     same shift or the same or an equivalent work schedule.\n       (3) The employee must have the same or an equivalent \n     opportunity for bonuses, and other similar discretionary and \n     non-discretionary payments.\n       (4) FMLA does not prohibit an employing office from \n     accommodating an employee's request to be restored to a \n     different shift, schedule, or position which better suits the \n     employee's personal needs on return from leave, or to offer a \n     promotion to a better position. However, an employee cannot \n     be induced by the employing office to accept a different \n     position against the employee's wishes.\n       (f) De minimis exception. The requirement that an employee \n     be restored to the same or equivalent job with the same or \n     equivalent pay, benefits, and terms and conditions of \n     employment does not extend to de minimis, intangible, or \n     unmeasurable aspects of the job.\n     825.216 Limitations on an employee's right to reinstatement.\n       (a) An employee has no greater right to reinstatement or to \n     other benefits and conditions of employment than if the \n     employee had been continuously employed during the FMLA leave \n     period. An employing office must be able to show that an \n     employee would not otherwise have been employed at the time \n     reinstatement is requested in order to deny restoration to \n     employment. For example:\n       (1) If an employee is laid off during the course of taking \n     FMLA leave and employment is terminated, the employing \n     office's responsibility to continue FMLA leave, maintain \n     group health plan benefits and restore the employee ceases at \n     the time the employee is laid off, provided the employing \n     office has no continuing obligations under a collective \n     bargaining agreement or otherwise. An employing office would \n     have the burden of proving that an employee would have been \n     laid off during the FMLA leave period and, therefore, would \n     not be entitled to restoration. Restoration to a job slated \n     for lay-off when the employee's original position is not \n     would not meet the requirements of an equivalent position.\n       (2) If a shift has been eliminated, or overtime has been \n     decreased, an employee would not be entitled to return to \n     work that shift or the original overtime hours upon \n     restoration. However, if a position on, for example, a night \n     shift has been filled by another employee, the employee is \n     entitled to return to the same shift on which employed before \n     taking FMLA leave.\n       (3) If an employee was hired for a specific term or only to \n     perform work on a discrete project, the employing office has \n     no obligation to restore the employee if the employment term \n     or project is over and the employing office would not \n     otherwise have continued to employ the employee. On the other \n     hand, if an employee was hired to perform work for one \n     employing office for a specific time period, and after that \n     time period has ended, the work was assigned to another \n     employing office, the successor employing office may be \n     required to restore the employee if it is a successor \n     employing office. See 825.107.\n       (b) In addition to the circumstances explained above, an \n     employing office may deny job restoration to salaried \n     eligible employees (key employees, as defined in 825.217(c)), \n     if such denial is necessary to prevent substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the operations of the employing \n     office; or may delay restoration to an employee who fails to \n     provide a fitness-for-duty certificate to return to work \n     under the conditions described in 825.312.\n       (c) If the employee is unable to perform an essential \n     function of the position because of a physical or mental \n     condition, including the continuation of a serious health \n     condition or an injury or illness also covered by workers' \n     compensation, the employee has no right to restoration to \n     another position under the FMLA. The employing office's \n     obligations may, however, be governed by the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by \n     the CAA. See 825.702.\n       (d) An employee who fraudulently obtains FMLA leave from an \n     employing office is not protected by the job restoration or \n     maintenance of health benefits provisions of the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (e) If the employing office has a uniformly-applied policy \n     governing outside or supplemental employment, such a policy \n     may continue to apply to an employee while on FMLA leave. An \n     employing office which does not have such a policy may not \n     deny benefits to which an employee is entitled under FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, on this basis unless the FMLA \n     leave was fraudulently obtained as in paragraph (d) of this \n     section.\n     825.217 Key employee, general rule.\n       (a) A key employee is a salaried FMLA-eligible employee who \n     is among the highest paid 10 percent of all the employees \n     employed by the employing office within 75 miles of the \n     employee's worksite.\n       (b) The term salaried means paid on a salary basis, within \n     the meaning of the Board's regulations at part 541, \n     implementing section 203 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1313), \n     regarding employees who may qualify as exempt from\n\n[[Page H6037]]\n\n     the minimum wage and overtime requirements of the FLSA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, as executive, administrative, and \n     professional employees).\n       (c) A key employee must be among the highest paid 10 \n     percent of all the employees--both salaried and non-salaried, \n     eligible and ineligible--who are employed by the employing \n     office within 75 miles of the worksite.\n       (1) In determining which employees are among the highest \n     paid 10 percent, year- to-date earnings are divided by weeks \n     worked by the employee (including weeks in which paid leave \n     was taken). Earnings include wages, premium pay, incentive \n     pay, and non-discretionary and discretionary bonuses. \n     Earnings do not include incentives whose value is determined \n     at some future date, e.g., benefits or prerequisites.\n       (2) The determination of whether a salaried employee is \n     among the highest paid 10 percent shall be made at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave. No more than \n     10 percent of the employing office's employees within 75 \n     miles of the worksite may be key employees.\n     825.218 Substantial and grievous economic injury.\n       (a) In order to deny restoration to a key employee, an \n     employing office must determine that the restoration of the \n     employee to employment will cause substantial and grievous \n     economic injury to the operations of the employing office, \n     not whether the absence of the employee will cause such \n     substantial and grievous injury.\n       (b) An employing office may take into account its ability \n     to replace on a temporary basis (or temporarily do without) \n     the employee on FMLA leave. If permanent replacement is \n     unavoidable, the cost of then reinstating the employee can be \n     considered in evaluating whether substantial and grievous \n     economic injury will occur from restoration; in other words, \n     the effect on the operations of the employing office of \n     reinstating the employee in an equivalent position.\n       (c) A precise test cannot be set for the level of hardship \n     or injury to the employing office which must be sustained. If \n     the reinstatement of a key employee threatens the economic \n     viability of the employing office, that would constitute \n     substantial and grievous economic injury. A lesser injury \n     which causes substantial, long-term economic injury would \n     also be sufficient. Minor inconveniences and costs that the \n     employing office would experience in the normal course would \n     certainly not constitute substantial and grievous economic \n     injury.\n       (d) FMLA's substantial and grievous economic injury \n     standard is different from and more stringent than the undue \n     hardship test under the ADA. See also 825.702.\n     825.219 Rights of a key employee\n       (a) An employing office that believes that reinstatement \n     may be denied to a key employee, must give written notice to \n     the employee at the time the employee gives notice of the \n     need for FMLA leave (or when FMLA leave commences, if \n     earlier) that he or she qualifies as a key employee. At the \n     same time, the employing office must also fully inform the \n     employee of the potential consequences with respect to \n     reinstatement and maintenance of health benefits if the \n     employing office should determine that substantial and \n     grievous economic injury to the employing office's operations \n     will result if the employee is reinstated from FMLA leave. If \n     such notice cannot be given immediately because of the need \n     to determine whether the employee is a key employee, it shall \n     be given as soon as practicable after being notified of a \n     need for leave (or the commencement of leave, if earlier). It \n     is expected that in most circumstances there will be no \n     desire that an employee be denied restoration after FMLA \n     leave and, therefore, there would be no need to provide such \n     notice. However, an employing office who fails to provide \n     such timely notice will lose its right to deny restoration \n     even if substantial and grievous economic injury will result \n     from reinstatement.\n       (b) As soon as an employing office makes a good faith \n     determination, based on the facts available, that substantial \n     and grievous economic injury to its operations will result if \n     a key employee who has given notice of the need for FMLA \n     leave or is using FMLA leave is reinstated, the employing \n     office shall notify the employee in writing of its \n     determination, that it cannot deny FMLA leave, and that it \n     intends to deny restoration to employment on completion of \n     the FMLA leave. It is anticipated that an employing office \n     will ordinarily be able to give such notice prior to the \n     employee starting leave. The employing office must serve this \n     notice either in person or by certified mail. This notice \n     must explain the basis for the employing office's finding \n     that substantial and grievous economic injury will result, \n     and, if leave has commenced, must provide the employee a \n     reasonable time in which to return to work, taking into \n     account the circumstances, such as the length of the leave \n     and the urgency of the need for the employee to return.\n       (c) If an employee on leave does not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notification of intent to \n     deny restoration, the employee continues to be entitled to \n     maintenance of health benefits and the employing office may \n     not recover its cost of health benefit premiums. A key \n     employee's rights under FMLA continue unless and until the \n     employee either gives notice that he or she no longer wishes \n     to return to work, or the employing office actually denies \n     reinstatement at the conclusion of the leave period.\n       (d) After notice to an employee has been given that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result if the \n     employee is reinstated to employment, an employee is still \n     entitled to request reinstatement at the end of the leave \n     period even if the employee did not return to work in \n     response to the employing office's notice. The employing \n     office must then again determine whether there will be \n     substantial and grievous economic injury from reinstatement, \n     based on the facts at that time. If it is determined that \n     substantial and grievous economic injury will result, the \n     employing office shall notify the employee in writing (in \n     person or by certified mail) of the denial of restoration.\n     825.220 Protection for employees who request leave or \n         otherwise assert FMLA rights.\n       (a) The FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, prohibits \n     interference with an employee's rights under the law, and \n     with legal proceedings or inquiries relating to an employee's \n     rights. More specifically, the law contains the following \n     employee protections:\n       (1) An employing office is prohibited from interfering \n     with, restraining, or denying the exercise of (or attempts to \n     exercise) any rights provided by the FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA.\n       (2) An employing office is prohibited from discharging or \n     in any other way discriminating against any covered employee \n     (whether or not an eligible employee) for opposing or \n     complaining about any unlawful practice under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA.\n       (3) All employing offices are prohibited from discharging \n     or in any other way discriminating against any covered \n     employee (whether or not an eligible employee) because that \n     covered employee has--\n       (i) Filed any charge, or has instituted (or caused to be \n     instituted) any proceeding under or related to the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA;\n       (ii) Given, or is about to give, any information in \n     connection with an inquiry or proceeding relating to a right \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA;\n       (iii) Testified, or is about to testify, in any inquiry or \n     proceeding relating to a right under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA.\n       (b) Any violations of the FMLA, as made applicable by the \n     CAA, or of these regulations constitute interfering with, \n     restraining, or denying the exercise of rights provided by \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered. See 825.400(c). Interfering with the exercise \n     of an employee's rights would include, for example, not only \n     refusing to authorize FMLA leave, but discouraging an \n     employee from using such leave. It would also include \n     manipulation by a covered employing office to avoid \n     responsibilities under FMLA, for example:\n       (1) [Reserved]\n       (2) Changing the essential functions of the job in order to \n     preclude the taking of leave; or\n       (3) Reducing hours available to work in order to avoid \n     employee eligibility.\n       (c) The FMLA's prohibition against interference prohibits \n     an employing office from discriminating or retaliating \n     against an employee or prospective employee for having \n     exercised or attempted to exercise FMLA rights. For example, \n     if an employee on leave without pay would otherwise be \n     entitled to full benefits (other than health benefits), the \n     same benefits would be required to be provided to an employee \n     on unpaid FMLA leave. By the same token, employing offices \n     cannot use the taking of FMLA leave as a negative factor in \n     employment actions, such as hiring, promotions or \n     disciplinary actions; nor can FMLA leave be counted under no \n     fault attendance policies. See 825.215.\n       (d) Employees cannot waive, nor may employing offices \n     induce employees to waive, their rights under FMLA. For \n     example, employees (or their collective bargaining \n     representatives) cannot trade off the right to take FMLA \n     leave against some other benefit offered by the employing \n     office. Except for settlement agreements covered by 1414 and/\n     or 1415 of the Congressional Accountability Act, this does \n     not prevent the settlement or release of FMLA claims by \n     employees based on past employing office conduct without the \n     approval of the Office of Compliance or a court. Nor does it \n     prevent an employee's voluntary and uncoerced acceptance (not \n     as a condition of employment) of a light duty assignment \n     while recovering from a serious health condition. See \n     825.702(d). An employee's acceptance of such light duty \n     assignment does not constitute a waiver of the employee's \n     prospective rights, including the right to be restored to the \n     same position the employee held at the time the employee's \n     FMLA leave commenced or to an equivalent position. The \n     employee's right to restoration, however, ceases at the end \n     of the applicable 12-month FMLA leave year.\n       (e) Individuals, and not merely covered employees, are \n     protected from retaliation for opposing (e.g., filing a \n     complaint about) any practice which is unlawful under the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. They are similarly \n     protected if they oppose any practice which they reasonably \n     believe to be a\n\n[[Page H6038]]\n\n     violation of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or \n     regulations.\n     Subpart C--EMPLOYEE AND EMPLOYING OFFICE RIGHTS AND \n         OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE CAA\n     825.300 Employing office notice requirements.\n       (a)(1) If an employing office has any eligible employees \n     and has any written guidance to employees concerning employee \n     benefits or leave rights, such as in an employee handbook, \n     information concerning both entitlements and employee \n     obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     must be included in the handbook or other document. For \n     example, if an employing office provides an employee handbook \n     to all employees that describes the employing office's \n     policies regarding leave, wages, attendance, and similar \n     matters, the handbook must incorporate information on FMLA \n     rights and responsibilities and the employing office's \n     policies regarding the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. \n     Informational publications describing the provisions of the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, are available from the \n     Office of Compliance and may be incorporated in such \n     employing office handbooks or written policies.\n       (2) If such an employing office does not have written \n     policies, manuals, or handbooks describing employee benefits \n     and leave provisions, the employing office shall provide \n     written guidance to an employee concerning all the employee's \n     rights and obligations under the FMLA, as made applicable by \n     the CAA. This notice shall be provided to employees each time \n     notice is given pursuant to paragraph (c), and in accordance \n     with the provisions of that paragraph. Employing offices may \n     duplicate and provide the employee a copy of the FMLA Fact \n     Sheet available from the Office of Compliance to provide such \n     guidance.\n       (b) Eligibility notice. (1) When an employee requests FMLA \n     leave, or when the employing office acquires knowledge that \n     an employee's leave may be for an FMLA-qualifying reason, the \n     employing office must notify the employee of the employee's \n     eligibility to take FMLA leave within five business days, \n     absent extenuating circumstances. See 825.110 for definition \n     of an eligible employee. Employee eligibility is determined \n     (and notice must be provided) at the commencement of the \n     first instance of leave for each FMLA-qualifying reason in \n     the applicable 12-month period. See 825.127(c) and \n     825.200(b). All FMLA absences for the same qualifying reason \n     are considered a single leave and employee eligibility as to \n     that reason for leave does not change during the applicable \n     12-month period.\n       (2) The eligibility notice must state whether the employee \n     is eligible for FMLA leave as defined in 825.110. If the \n     employee is not eligible for FMLA leave, the notice must \n     state at least one reason why the employee is not eligible, \n     including as applicable the number of months the employee has \n     been employed by the employing office and the hours of \n     service with the employing office during the 12-month period. \n     Notification of eligibility may be oral or in writing; \n     employing offices may use Form C to provide such notification \n     to employees. The employing office is obligated to translate \n     this notice in any situation in which it is obligated to do \n     so in 825.300(a)(4).\n       (3) If, at the time an employee provides notice of a \n     subsequent need for FMLA leave during the applicable 12-month \n     period due to a different FMLA-qualifying reason, and the \n     employee's eligibility status has not changed, no additional \n     eligibility notice is required. If, however, the employee's \n     eligibility status has changed (e.g., if the employee has not \n     met the hours of service requirement in the 12 months \n     preceding the commencement of leave for the subsequent \n     qualifying reason), the employing office must notify the \n     employee of the change in eligibility status within five \n     business days, absent extenuating circumstances.\n       (c) Rights and responsibilities notice. (1) Employing \n     offices shall provide written notice detailing the specific \n     expectations and obligations of the employee and explaining \n     any consequences of a failure to meet these obligations. The \n     employing office is obligated to translate this notice in any \n     situation in which it is obligated to do so in 825.300(a)(4). \n     This notice shall be provided to the employee each time the \n     eligibility notice is provided pursuant to paragraph (b) of \n     this section. If leave has already begun, the notice should \n     be mailed to the employee's address of record. Such specific \n     notice must include, as appropriate:\n       (i) That the leave may be designated and counted against \n     the employee's annual FMLA leave entitlement if qualifying \n     (see 825.300(c) and 825.301) and the applicable 12-month \n     period for FMLA entitlement (see 825.127(c), 825.200(b), (f), \n     and (g));\n       (ii) Any requirements for the employee to furnish \n     certification of a serious health condition, serious injury \n     or illness, or qualifying exigency arising out of active duty \n     or call to active duty status, and the consequences of \n     failing to do so (see 825.305, 825.309, 825.310, 825.313);\n       (iii) The employee's right to substitute paid leave, \n     whether the employing office will require the substitution of \n     paid leave, the conditions related to any substitution, and \n     the employee's entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave if the \n     employee does not meet the conditions for paid leave (see \n     825.207);\n       (iv) Any requirement for the employee to make any premium \n     payments to maintain health benefits and the arrangements for \n     making such payments (see 825.210), and the possible \n     consequences of failure to make such payments on a timely \n     basis (i.e., the circumstances under which coverage may \n     lapse);\n       (v) The employee's status as a key employee and the \n     potential consequence that restoration may be denied \n     following FMLA leave, explaining the conditions required for \n     such denial (see 825.218);\n       (vi) The employee's right to maintenance of benefits during \n     the FMLA leave and restoration to the same or an equivalent \n     job upon return from FMLA leave (see 825.214 and 825.604); \n     and\n       (vii) The employee's potential liability for payment of \n     health insurance premiums paid by the employing office during \n     the employee's unpaid FMLA leave if the employee fails to \n     return to work after taking FMLA leave (see 825.213).\n       (2) The notice of rights and responsibilities may include \n     other information--e.g., whether the employing office will \n     require periodic reports of the employee's status and intent \n     to return to work--but is not required to do so.\n       (3) The notice of rights and responsibilities may be \n     accompanied by any required certification form.\n       (4) If the specific information provided by the notice of \n     rights and responsibilities changes, the employing office \n     shall, within five business days of receipt of the employee's \n     first notice of need for leave subsequent to any change, \n     provide written notice referencing the prior notice and \n     setting forth any of the information in the notice of rights \n     and responsibilities that has changed. For example, if the \n     initial leave period was paid leave and the subsequent leave \n     period would be unpaid leave, the employing office may need \n     to give notice of the arrangements for making premium \n     payments.\n       (5) Employing offices are also expected to responsively \n     answer questions from employees concerning their rights and \n     responsibilities under the FMLA, as made applicable under the \n     CAA.\n       (6) A prototype notice of rights and responsibilities may \n     be obtained in Form C, or from the Office of Compliance. \n     Employing offices may adapt the prototype notice as \n     appropriate to meet these notice requirements. The notice of \n     rights and responsibilities may be distributed electronically \n     so long as it otherwise meets the requirements of this \n     section.\n       (d) Designation notice. (1) The employing office is \n     responsible in all circumstances for designating leave as \n     FMLA-qualifying, and for giving notice of the designation to \n     the employee as provided in this section. When the employing \n     office has enough information to determine whether the leave \n     is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason (e.g., after \n     receiving a certification), the employing office must notify \n     the employee whether the leave will be designated and will be \n     counted as FMLA leave within five business days absent \n     extenuating circumstances. Only one notice of designation is \n     required for each FMLA-qualifying reason per applicable 12-\n     month period, regardless of whether the leave taken due to \n     the qualifying reason will be a continuous block of leave or \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave. If the employing \n     office determines that the leave will not be designated as \n     FMLA-qualifying (e.g., if the leave is not for a reason \n     covered by FMLA or the FMLA leave entitlement has been \n     exhausted), the employing office must notify the employee of \n     that determination. If the employing office requires paid \n     leave to be substituted for unpaid FMLA leave, or that paid \n     leave taken under an existing leave plan be counted as FMLA \n     leave, the employing office must inform the employee of this \n     designation at the time of designating the FMLA leave.\n       (2) If the employing office has sufficient information to \n     designate the leave as FMLA leave immediately after receiving \n     notice of the employee's need for leave, the employing office \n     may provide the employee with the designation notice at that \n     time.\n       (3) If the employing office will require the employee to \n     present a fitness-for-duty certification to be restored to \n     employment, the employing office must provide notice of such \n     requirement with the designation notice. If the employing \n     office will require that the fitness-for-duty certification \n     address the employee's ability to perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, the employing office \n     must so indicate in the designation notice, and must include \n     a list of the essential functions of the employee's position. \n     See 825.312. If the employing office's handbook or other \n     written documents (if any) describing the employing office's \n     leave policies clearly provide that a fitness-for-duty \n     certification will be required in specific circumstances \n     (e.g., by stating that fitness-for-duty certification will be \n     required in all cases of back injuries for employees in a \n     certain occupation), the employing office is not required to \n     provide written notice of the requirement with the \n     designation notice, but must provide oral notice no later \n     than with the designation notice.\n       (4) The designation notice must be in writing. A prototype \n     designation notice is contained in Form D or may be obtained \n     from the Office of Compliance. If the leave is not designated \n     as FMLA leave because it does not meet the requirements of \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, the notice to the \n     employee that the leave is not designated as FMLA leave may \n     be in the form of a simple written statement.\n\n[[Page H6039]]\n\n       (5) If the information provided by the employing office to \n     the employee in the designation notice changes (e.g., the \n     employee exhausts the FMLA leave entitlement), the employing \n     office shall provide, within five business days of receipt of \n     the employee's first notice of need for leave subsequent to \n     any change, written notice of the change.\n       (6) The employing office must notify the employee of the \n     amount of leave counted against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. If the amount of leave needed is known at the \n     time the employing office designates the leave as FMLA-\n     qualifying, the employing office must notify the employee of \n     the number of hours, days, or weeks that will be counted \n     against the employee's FMLA leave entitlement in the \n     designation notice. If it is not possible to provide the \n     hours, days, or weeks that will be counted against the \n     employee's FMLA leave entitlement (such as in the case of \n     unforeseeable intermittent leave), then the employing office \n     must provide notice of the amount of leave counted against \n     the employee's FMLA leave entitlement upon the request by the \n     employee, but no more often than once in a 30-day period and \n     only if leave was taken in that period. The notice of the \n     amount of leave counted against the employee's FMLA \n     entitlement may be oral or in writing. If such notice is \n     oral, it shall be confirmed in writing no later than the \n     following payday (unless the payday is less than one week \n     after the oral notice, in which case the notice must be no \n     later than the subsequent payday). Such written notice may be \n     in any form, including a notation on the employee's pay stub.\n       (e) Consequences of failing to provide notice. Failure to \n     follow the notice requirements set forth in this section may \n     constitute an interference with, restraint, or denial of the \n     exercise of an employee's FMLA rights. An employing office \n     may be liable for compensation and benefits lost by reason of \n     the violation, for other actual monetary losses sustained as \n     a direct result of the violation, and for appropriate \n     equitable or other relief, including employment, \n     reinstatement, promotion, or any other relief tailored to the \n     harm suffered. See 825.400(c).\n     825.301 Designation of FMLA leave.\n       (a) Employing office responsibilities. The employing \n     office's decision to designate leave as FMLA-qualifying must \n     be based only on information received from the employee or \n     the employee's spokesperson (e.g., if the employee is \n     incapacitated, the employee's spouse, adult child, parent, \n     doctor, etc., may provide notice to the employing office of \n     the need to take FMLA leave). In any circumstance where the \n     employing office does not have sufficient information about \n     the reason for an employee's use of leave, the employing \n     office should inquire further of the employee or the \n     spokesperson to ascertain whether leave is potentially FMLA-\n     qualifying. Once the employing office has acquired knowledge \n     that the leave is being taken for a FMLA-qualifying reason, \n     the employing office must notify the employee as provided in \n     825.300(d).\n       (b) Employee responsibilities. An employee giving notice of \n     the need for FMLA leave does not need to expressly assert \n     rights under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even \n     mention the FMLA to meet his or her obligation to provide \n     notice, though the employee would need to state a qualifying \n     reason for the needed leave and otherwise satisfy the notice \n     requirements set forth in 825.302 or 825.303 depending on \n     whether the need for leave is foreseeable or unforeseeable. \n     An employee giving notice of the need for FMLA leave must \n     explain the reasons for the needed leave so as to allow the \n     employing office to determine whether the leave qualifies \n     under the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA. If the \n     employee fails to explain the reasons, leave may be denied. \n     In many cases, in explaining the reasons for a request to use \n     leave, especially when the need for the leave was unexpected \n     or unforeseen, an employee will provide sufficient \n     information for the employing office to designate the leave \n     as FMLA leave. An employee using accrued paid leave may in \n     some cases not spontaneously explain the reasons or their \n     plans for using their accrued leave. However, if an employee \n     requesting to use paid leave for a FMLA-qualifying reason \n     does not explain the reason for the leave and the employing \n     office denies the employee's request, the employee will need \n     to provide sufficient information to establish a FMLA-\n     qualifying reason for the needed leave so that the employing \n     office is aware that the leave may not be denied and may \n     designate that the paid leave be appropriately counted \n     against (substituted for) the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. Similarly, an employee using accrued paid \n     vacation leave who seeks an extension of unpaid leave for a \n     FMLA-qualifying reason will need to state the reason. If this \n     is due to an event which occurred during the period of paid \n     leave, the employing office may count the leave used after \n     the FMLA-qualifying reason against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement.\n       (c) Disputes. If there is a dispute between an employing \n     office and an employee as to whether leave qualifies as FMLA \n     leave, it should be resolved through discussions between the \n     employee and the employing office. Such discussions and the \n     decision must be documented.\n       (d) Retroactive designation. If an employing office does \n     not designate leave as required by 825.300, the employing \n     office may retroactively designate leave as FMLA leave with \n     appropriate notice to the employee as required by 825.300 \n     provided that the employing office's failure to timely \n     designate leave does not cause harm or injury to the \n     employee. In all cases where leave would qualify for FMLA \n     protections, an employing office and an employee can mutually \n     agree that leave be retroactively designated as FMLA leave.\n       (e) Remedies. If an employing office's failure to timely \n     designate leave in accordance with 825.300 causes the \n     employee to suffer harm, it may constitute an interference \n     with, restraint of, or denial of the exercise of an \n     employee's FMLA rights. An employing office may be liable for \n     compensation and benefits lost by reason of the violation, \n     for other actual monetary losses sustained as a direct result \n     of the violation, and for appropriate equitable or other \n     relief, including employment, reinstatement, promotion, or \n     any other relief tailored to the harm suffered. See \n     825.400(c). For example, if an employing office that was put \n     on notice that an employee needed FMLA leave failed to \n     designate the leave properly, but the employee's own serious \n     health condition prevented him or her from returning to work \n     during that time period regardless of the designation, an \n     employee may not be able to show that the employee suffered \n     harm as a result of the employing office's actions. However, \n     if an employee took leave to provide care for a son or \n     daughter with a serious health condition believing it would \n     not count toward his or her FMLA entitlement, and the \n     employee planned to later use that FMLA leave to provide care \n     for a spouse who would need assistance when recovering from \n     surgery planned for a later date, the employee may be able to \n     show that harm has occurred as a result of the employing \n     office's failure to designate properly. The employee might \n     establish this by showing that he or she would have arranged \n     for an alternative caregiver for the seriously-ill son or \n     daughter if the leave had been designated timely.\n     825.302 Employee notice requirements for foreseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) Timing of notice. An employee must provide the \n     employing office at least 30 days advance notice before FMLA \n     leave is to begin if the need for the leave is foreseeable \n     based on an expected birth, placement for adoption or foster \n     care, planned medical treatment for a serious health \n     condition of the employee or of a family member, or the \n     planned medical treatment for a serious injury or illness of \n     a covered servicemember. If 30 days notice is not \n     practicable, such as because of a lack of knowledge of \n     approximately when leave will be required to begin, a change \n     in circumstances, or a medical emergency, notice must be \n     given as soon as practicable. For example, an employee's \n     health condition may require leave to commence earlier than \n     anticipated before the birth of a child. Similarly, little \n     opportunity for notice may be given before placement for \n     adoption. For foreseeable leave due to a qualifying exigency, \n     notice must be provided as soon as practicable, regardless of \n     how far in advance such leave is foreseeable. Whether FMLA \n     leave is to be continuous or is to be taken intermittently or \n     on a reduced schedule basis, notice need only be given one \n     time, but the employee shall advise the employing office as \n     soon as practicable if dates of scheduled leave change or are \n     extended, or were initially unknown. In those cases where the \n     employee is required to provide at least 30 days notice of \n     foreseeable leave and does not do so, the employee shall \n     explain the reasons why such notice was not practicable upon \n     a request from the employing office for such information.\n       (b) As soon as practicable means as soon as both possible \n     and practical, taking into account all of the facts and \n     circumstances in the individual case. When an employee \n     becomes aware of a need for FMLA leave less than 30 days in \n     advance, it should be practicable for the employee to provide \n     notice of the need for leave either the same day or the next \n     business day. In all cases, however, the determination of \n     when an employee could practicably provide notice must take \n     into account the individual facts and circumstances.\n       (c) Content of notice. An employee shall provide at least \n     verbal notice sufficient to make the employing office aware \n     that the employee needs FMLA-qualifying leave, and the \n     anticipated timing and duration of the leave. Depending on \n     the situation, such information may include that a condition \n     renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the \n     job; that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized \n     overnight; whether the employee or the employee's family \n     member is under the continuing care of a health care \n     provider; if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that \n     a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty), and that the \n     requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in \n     825.126(b); if the leave is for a family member, that the \n     condition renders the family member unable to perform daily \n     activities, or that the family member is a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness; and the \n     anticipated duration of the absence, if known. When an \n     employee seeks leave for the first time for a FMLA-qualifying \n     reason, the employee need not expressly assert rights under \n     the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, or even mention the \n     FMLA. When an employee seeks leave due to a FMLA-qualifying \n     reason, for which the employing office has\n\n[[Page H6040]]\n\n     previously provided FMLA-protected leave, the employee must \n     specifically reference the qualifying reason for leave or the \n     need for FMLA leave. In all cases, the employing office \n     should inquire further of the employee if it is necessary to \n     have more information about whether FMLA leave is being \n     sought by the employee, and obtain the necessary details of \n     the leave to be taken. In the case of medical conditions, the \n     employing office may find it necessary to inquire further to \n     determine if the leave is because of a serious health \n     condition and may request medical certification to support \n     the need for such leave. See 825.305. An employing office may \n     also request certification to support the need for leave for \n     a qualifying exigency or for military caregiver leave. See \n     825.309, 825.310. When an employee has been previously \n     certified for leave due to more than one FMLA-qualifying \n     reason, the employing office may need to inquire further to \n     determine for which qualifying reason the leave is needed. An \n     employee has an obligation to respond to an employing \n     office's questions designed to determine whether an absence \n     is potentially FMLA-qualifying. Failure to respond to \n     reasonable employing office inquiries regarding the leave \n     request may result in denial of FMLA protection if the \n     employing office is unable to determine whether the leave is \n     FMLA-qualifying.\n       (d) Complying with the employing office policy. An \n     employing office may require an employee to comply with the \n     employing office's usual and customary notice and procedural \n     requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual \n     circumstances. For example, an employing office may require \n     that written notice set forth the reasons for the requested \n     leave, the anticipated duration of the leave, and the \n     anticipated start of the leave. An employee also may be \n     required by an employing office's policy to contact a \n     specific individual. Unusual circumstances would include \n     situations such as when an employee is unable to comply with \n     the employing office's policy that requests for leave should \n     be made by contacting a specific number because on the day \n     the employee needs to provide notice of his or her need for \n     FMLA leave there is no one to answer the call-in number and \n     the voice mail box is full. Where an employee does not comply \n     with the employing office's usual notice and procedural \n     requirements, and no unusual circumstances justify the \n     failure to comply, FMLA-protected leave may be delayed or \n     denied. However, FMLA-protected leave may not be delayed or \n     denied where the employing office's policy requires notice to \n     be given sooner than set forth in paragraph (a) of this \n     section and the employee provides timely notice as set forth \n     in paragraph (a) of this section.\n       (e) Scheduling planned medical treatment. When planning \n     medical treatment, the employee must consult with the \n     employing office and make a reasonable effort to schedule the \n     treatment so as not to disrupt unduly the employing office's \n     operations, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider. Employees are ordinarily expected to consult with \n     their employing offices prior to the scheduling of treatment \n     in order to work out a treatment schedule which best suits \n     the needs of both the employing office and the employee. For \n     example, if an employee who provides notice of the need to \n     take FMLA leave on an intermittent basis for planned medical \n     treatment neglects to consult with the employing office to \n     make a reasonable effort to arrange the schedule of \n     treatments so as not to unduly disrupt the employing office's \n     operations, the employing office may initiate discussions \n     with the employee and require the employee to attempt to make \n     such arrangements, subject to the approval of the health care \n     provider. See 825.203 and 825.205.\n       (f) Intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule \n     must be medically necessary due to a serious health condition \n     or a serious injury or illness. An employee shall advise the \n     employing office, upon request, of the reasons why the \n     intermittent/reduced leave schedule is necessary and of the \n     schedule for treatment, if applicable. The employee and \n     employing office shall attempt to work out a schedule for \n     such leave that meets the employee's needs without unduly \n     disrupting the employing office's operations, subject to the \n     approval of the health care provider.\n       (g) An employing office may waive employees' FMLA notice \n     requirements. See 825.304.\n     825.303 Employee notice requirements for unforeseeable FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) Timing of notice. When the approximate timing of the \n     need for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must provide \n     notice to the employing office as soon as practicable under \n     the facts and circumstances of the particular case. It \n     generally should be practicable for the employee to provide \n     notice of leave that is unforeseeable within the time \n     prescribed by the employing office's usual and customary \n     notice requirements applicable to such leave. See 825.303(c). \n     Notice may be given by the employee's spokesperson (e.g., \n     spouse, adult family member, or other responsible party) if \n     the employee is unable to do so personally. For example, if \n     an employee's child has a severe asthma attack and the \n     employee takes the child to the emergency room, the employee \n     would not be required to leave his or her child in order to \n     report the absence while the child is receiving emergency \n     treatment. However, if the child's asthma attack required \n     only the use of an inhaler at home followed by a period of \n     rest, the employee would be expected to call the employing \n     office promptly after ensuring the child has used the \n     inhaler.\n       (b) Content of notice. An employee shall provide sufficient \n     information for an employing office to reasonably determine \n     whether the FMLA may apply to the leave request. Depending on \n     the situation, such information may include that a condition \n     renders the employee unable to perform the functions of the \n     job; that the employee is pregnant or has been hospitalized \n     overnight; whether the employee or the employee's family \n     member is under the continuing care of a health care \n     provider; if the leave is due to a qualifying exigency, that \n     a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty), that the \n     requested leave is for one of the reasons listed in \n     825.126(b), and the anticipated duration of the absence; or \n     if the leave is for a family member that the condition \n     renders the family member unable to perform daily activities \n     or that the family member is a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness; and the anticipated duration of \n     the absence, if known. When an employee seeks leave for the \n     first time for a FMLA-qualifying reason, the employee need \n     not expressly assert rights under the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, or even mention the FMLA. When an \n     employee seeks leave due to a qualifying reason, for which \n     the employing office has previously provided the employee \n     FMLA-protected leave, the employee must specifically \n     reference either the qualifying reason for leave or the need \n     for FMLA leave. Calling in ``sick'' without providing more \n     information will not be considered sufficient notice to \n     trigger an employing office's obligations under the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. The employing office will be \n     expected to obtain any additional required information \n     through informal means. An employee has an obligation to \n     respond to an employing office's questions designed to \n     determine whether an absence is potentially FMLA-qualifying. \n     Failure to respond to reasonable employing office inquiries \n     office regarding the leave request may result in denial of \n     FMLA protection if the employing office is unable to \n     determine whether the leave is FMLA-qualifying.\n       (c) Complying with employing office policy. When the need \n     for leave is not foreseeable, an employee must comply with \n     the employing office's usual and customary notice and \n     procedural requirements for requesting leave, absent unusual \n     circumstances. For example, an employing office may require \n     employees to call a designated number or a specific \n     individual to request leave. However, if an employee requires \n     emergency medical treatment, he or she would not be required \n     to follow the call-in procedure until his or her condition is \n     stabilized and he or she has access to, and is able to use, a \n     phone. Similarly, in the case of an emergency requiring leave \n     because of a FMLA-qualifying reason, written advance notice \n     pursuant to an employing office's internal rules and \n     procedures may not be required when FMLA leave is involved. \n     If an employee does not comply with the employing office's \n     usual notice and procedural requirements, and no unusual \n     circumstances justify the failure to comply, FMLA-protected \n     leave may be delayed or denied.\n     825.304 Employee failure to provide notice.\n       (a) Proper notice required. In all cases, in order for the \n     onset of an employee's FMLA leave to be delayed due to lack \n     of required notice, it must be clear that the employee had \n     actual notice of the FMLA notice requirements. This condition \n     would be satisfied by the employing office's proper posting, \n     at the worksite where the employee is employed, of the \n     information regarding the FMLA provided (pursuant to section \n     301(h)(2) of the CAA, 2 U.S.C. 1381(h)(2)) by the Office of \n     Compliance to the employing office in a manner suitable for \n     posting.\n       (b) Foreseeable leave--30 days. When the need for FMLA \n     leave is foreseeable at least 30 days in advance and an \n     employee fails to give timely advance notice with no \n     reasonable excuse, the employing office may delay FMLA \n     coverage until 30 days after the date the employee provides \n     notice. The need for leave and the approximate date leave \n     would be taken must have been clearly foreseeable to the \n     employee 30 days in advance of the leave. For example, \n     knowledge that an employee would receive a telephone call \n     about the availability of a child for adoption at some \n     unknown point in the future would not be sufficient to \n     establish the leave was clearly foreseeable 30 days in \n     advance.\n       (c) Foreseeable leave--less than 30 days. When the need for \n     FMLA leave is foreseeable fewer than 30 days in advance and \n     an employee fails to give notice as soon as practicable under \n     the particular facts and circumstances, the extent to which \n     an employing office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends \n     on the facts of the particular case. For example, if an \n     employee reasonably should have given the employing office \n     two weeks' notice but instead only provided one week's \n     notice, then the employing office may delay FMLA-protected \n     leave for one week (thus, if the employing office elects to \n     delay FMLA coverage and the employee nonetheless takes leave \n     one week after providing the notice (i.e., a week before the \n     two week notice period has been met) the leave will not be \n     FMLA-protected).\n       (d) Unforeseeable leave. When the need for FMLA leave is \n     unforeseeable and an employee fails to give notice in \n     accordance with 825.303, the extent to which an employing \n     office may delay FMLA coverage for leave depends on the facts \n     of the particular case. For\n\n[[Page H6041]]\n\n     example, if it would have been practicable for an employee to \n     have given the employing office notice of the need for leave \n     very soon after the need arises consistent with the employing \n     office's policy, but instead the employee provided notice two \n     days after the leave began, then the employing office may \n     delay FMLA coverage of the leave by two days.\n       (e) Waiver of notice. An employing office may waive \n     employees' FMLA notice obligations or the employing office's \n     own internal rules on leave notice requirements. If an \n     employing office does not waive the employee's obligations \n     under its internal leave rules, the employing office may take \n     appropriate action under its internal rules and procedures \n     for failure to follow its usual and customary notification \n     rules, absent unusual circumstances, as long as the actions \n     are taken in a manner that does not discriminate against \n     employees taking FMLA leave and the rules are not \n     inconsistent with 825.303(a).\n     825.305 Certification, general rule.\n       (a) General. An employing office may require that an \n     employee's leave to care for the employee's covered family \n     member with a serious health condition, or due to the \n     employee's own serious health condition that makes the \n     employee unable to perform one or more of the essential \n     functions of the employee's position, be supported by a \n     certification issued by the health care provider of the \n     employee or the employee's family member. An employing office \n     may also require that an employee's leave because of a \n     qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember \n     with a serious injury or illness be supported by a \n     certification, as described in 825.309 and 825.310, \n     respectively. An employing office must give notice of a \n     requirement for certification each time a certification is \n     required; such notice must be written notice whenever \n     required by 825.300(c). An employing office's oral request to \n     an employee to furnish any subsequent certification is \n     sufficient.\n       (b) Timing. In most cases, the employing office should \n     request that an employee furnish certification at the time \n     the employee gives notice of the need for leave or within \n     five business days thereafter, or, in the case of unforeseen \n     leave, within five business days after the leave commences. \n     The employing office may request certification at some later \n     date if the employing office later has reason to question the \n     appropriateness of the leave or its duration. The employee \n     must provide the requested certification to the employing \n     office within 15 calendar days after the employing office's \n     request, unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts or the employing office provides more than 15 \n     calendar days to return the requested certification.\n       (c) Complete and sufficient certification. The employee \n     must provide a complete and sufficient certification to the \n     employing office if required by the employing office in \n     accordance with 825.306, 825.309, and 825.310. The employing \n     office shall advise an employee whenever the employing office \n     finds a certification incomplete or insufficient, and shall \n     state in writing what additional information is necessary to \n     make the certification complete and sufficient. A \n     certification is considered incomplete if the employing \n     office receives a certification, but one or more of the \n     applicable entries have not been completed. A certification \n     is considered insufficient if the employing office receives a \n     complete certification, but the information provided is \n     vague, ambiguous, or non-responsive. The employing office \n     must provide the employee with seven calendar days (unless \n     not practicable under the particular circumstances despite \n     the employee's diligent good faith efforts) to cure any such \n     deficiency. If the deficiencies specified by the employing \n     office are not cured in the resubmitted certification, the \n     employing office may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in \n     accordance with 825.313. A certification that is not returned \n     to the employing office is not considered incomplete or \n     insufficient, but constitutes a failure to provide \n     certification.\n       (d) Consequences. At the time the employing office requests \n     certification, the employing office must also advise an \n     employee of the anticipated consequences of an employee's \n     failure to provide adequate certification. If the employee \n     fails to provide the employing office with a complete and \n     sufficient certification, despite the opportunity to cure the \n     certification as provided in paragraph (c) of this section, \n     or fails to provide any certification, the employing office \n     may deny the taking of FMLA leave, in accordance with \n     825.313. It is the employee's responsibility either to \n     furnish a complete and sufficient certification or to furnish \n     the health care provider providing the certification with any \n     necessary authorization from the employee or the employee's \n     family member in order for the health care provider to \n     release a complete and sufficient certification to the \n     employing office to support the employee's FMLA request. This \n     provision will apply in any case where an employing office \n     requests a certification permitted by these regulations, \n     whether it is the initial certification, a recertification, a \n     second or third opinion, or a fitness-for-duty certificate, \n     including any clarifications necessary to determine if such \n     certifications are authentic and sufficient. See 825.306, \n     825.307, 825.308, and 825.312.\n       (e) Annual medical certification. Where the employee's need \n     for leave due to the employee's own serious health condition, \n     or the serious health condition of the employee's covered \n     family member, lasts beyond a single leave year (as defined \n     in 825.200), the employing office may require the employee to \n     provide a new medical certification in each subsequent leave \n     year. Such new medical certifications are subject to the \n     provisions for authentication and clarification set forth in \n     825.307, including second and third opinions.\n     825.306 Content of medical certification for leave taken \n         because of an employee's own serious health condition or \n         the serious health condition of a family member.\n       (a) Required information. When leave is taken because of an \n     employee's own serious health condition, or the serious \n     health condition of a family member, an employing office may \n     require an employee to obtain a medical certification from a \n     health care provider that sets forth the following \n     information:\n       (1) The name, address, telephone number, and fax number of \n     the health care provider and type of medical practice/\n     specialization;\n       (2) The approximate date on which the serious health \n     condition commenced, and its probable duration;\n       (3) A statement or description of appropriate medical facts \n     regarding the patient's health condition for which FMLA leave \n     is requested. The medical facts must be sufficient to support \n     the need for leave. Such medical facts may include \n     information on symptoms, diagnosis, hospitalization, doctor \n     visits, whether medication has been prescribed, any referrals \n     for evaluation or treatment (physical therapy, for example), \n     or any other regimen of continuing treatment;\n       (4) If the employee is the patient, information sufficient \n     to establish that the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's job as well as the nature of any \n     other work restrictions, and the likely duration of such \n     inability (see 825.123(b) and (c));\n       (5) If the patient is a covered family member with a \n     serious health condition, information sufficient to establish \n     that the family member is in need of care, as described in \n     825.124, and an estimate of the frequency and duration of the \n     leave required to care for the family member;\n       (6) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment of the \n     employee's or a covered family member's serious health \n     condition, information sufficient to establish the medical \n     necessity for such intermittent or reduced schedule leave and \n     an estimate of the dates and duration of such treatments and \n     any periods of recovery;\n       (7) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for the employee's serious health \n     condition, including pregnancy, that may result in \n     unforeseeable episodes of incapacity, information sufficient \n     to establish the medical necessity for such intermittent or \n     reduced schedule leave and an estimate of the frequency and \n     duration of the episodes of incapacity; and\n       (8) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis to care for a covered family member \n     with a serious health condition, a statement that such leave \n     is medically necessary to care for the family member, as \n     described in 825.124 and 825.203(b), which can include \n     assisting in the family member's recovery, and an estimate of \n     the frequency and duration of the required leave.\n       (b) The Office of Compliance has developed two optional \n     forms (Form A and Form B) for use in obtaining medical \n     certification, including second and third opinions, from \n     health care providers that meets FMLA's certification \n     requirements, as made applicable by the CAA. (See Forms A and \n     B.) Optional Form A is for use when the employee's need for \n     leave is due to the employee's own serious health condition. \n     Optional Form B is for use when the employee needs leave to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition. \n     These optional forms reflect certification requirements so as \n     to permit the health care provider to furnish appropriate \n     medical information. Forms A and B are modeled closely on \n     Form WH-380E and Form WH-380F, as revised, which were \n     developed by the Department of Labor (see 29 C.F.R. Part \n     825). The employing office may use the Office of Compliance's \n     forms, or Form WH-380E and Form WH-380F, as revised, or \n     another form containing the same basic information; however, \n     no information may be required beyond that specified in \n     825.306, 825.307, and 825.308. In all instances the \n     information on the form must relate only to the serious \n     health condition for which the current need for leave exists.\n       (c) If an employee is on FMLA leave running concurrently \n     with a workers' compensation absence, and the provisions of \n     the workers' compensation statute permit the employing office \n     or the employing office's representative to request \n     additional information from the employee's workers' \n     compensation health care provider, the FMLA does not prevent \n     the employing office from following the applicable workers' \n     compensation provisions and information received under those \n     provisions may be considered in determining the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. Similarly, an employing \n     office may request additional information in accordance with \n     a paid leave policy or disability plan that requires greater \n     information to qualify for payments or benefits, provided \n     that the employing office informs the employee that the \n     additional information only needs to be provided in \n     connection with receipt of such payments or benefits. Any \n     information received pursuant\n\n[[Page H6042]]\n\n     to such policy or plan may be considered in determining the \n     employee's entitlement to FMLA-protected leave. If the \n     employee fails to provide the information required for \n     receipt of such payments or benefits, such failure will not \n     affect the employee's entitlement to take unpaid FMLA leave. \n     See 825.207(a).\n       (d) If an employee's serious health condition may also be a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by \n     the CAA, the FMLA does not prevent the employing office from \n     following the procedures for requesting medical information \n     under the ADA. Any information received pursuant to these \n     procedures may be considered in determining the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA-protected leave.\n       (e) While an employee may choose to comply with the \n     certification requirement by providing the employing office \n     with an authorization, release, or waiver allowing the \n     employing office to communicate directly with the health care \n     provider of the employee or his or her covered family member, \n     the employee may not be required to provide such an \n     authorization, release, or waiver. In all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).\n     825.307 Authentication and clarification of medical \n         certification for leave taken because of an employee's \n         own serious health condition or the serious health \n         condition of a family member; second and third opinions.\n       (a) Clarification and authentication. If an employee \n     submits a complete and sufficient certification signed by the \n     health care provider, the employing office may not request \n     additional information from the health care provider. \n     However, the employing office may contact the health care \n     provider for purposes of clarification and authentication of \n     the medical certification (whether initial certification or \n     recertification) after the employing office has given the \n     employee an opportunity to cure any deficiencies as set forth \n     in 825.305(c). To make such contact, the employing office \n     must use a health care provider, a human resources \n     professional, a leave administrator, or a management \n     official. Under no circumstances, however, may the employee's \n     direct supervisor contact the employee's health care \n     provider.\n       For purposes of these regulations, authentication means \n     providing the health care provider with a copy of the \n     certification and requesting verification that the \n     information contained on the certification form was completed \n     and/or authorized by the health care provider who signed the \n     document; no additional medical information may be requested. \n     Clarification means contacting the health care provider to \n     understand the handwriting on the medical certification or to \n     understand the meaning of a response. Employing offices may \n     not ask health care providers for additional information \n     beyond that required by the certification form. The \n     requirements of the Health Insurance Portability and \n     Accountability Act (HIPAA) Privacy Rule, (see 45 CFR parts \n     160 and 164), which governs the privacy of individually-\n     identifiable health information created or held by HIPAA-\n     covered entities, must be satisfied when individually-\n     identifiable health information of an employee is shared with \n     an employing office by a HIPAA-covered health care provider. \n     If an employee chooses not to provide the employing office \n     with authorization allowing the employing office to clarify \n     the certification with the health care provider, and does not \n     otherwise clarify the certification, the employing office may \n     deny the taking of FMLA leave if the certification is \n     unclear. See 825.305(d). It is the employee's responsibility \n     to provide the employing office with a complete and \n     sufficient certification and to clarify the certification if \n     necessary.\n       (b) Second Opinion. (1) An employing office that has reason \n     to doubt the validity of a medical certification may require \n     the employee to obtain a second opinion at the employing \n     office's expense. Pending receipt of the second (or third) \n     medical opinion, the employee is provisionally entitled to \n     the benefits of the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     including maintenance of group health benefits. If the \n     certifications do not ultimately establish the employee's \n     entitlement to FMLA leave, the leave shall not be designated \n     as FMLA leave and may be treated as paid or unpaid leave \n     under the employing office's established leave policies. In \n     addition, the consequences set forth in 825.305(d) will apply \n     if the employee or the employee's family member fails to \n     authorize his or her health care provider to release all \n     relevant medical information pertaining to the serious health \n     condition at issue if requested by the health care provider \n     designated to provide a second opinion in order to render a \n     sufficient and complete second opinion.\n       (2) The employing office is permitted to designate the \n     health care provider to furnish the second opinion, but the \n     selected health care provider may not be employed on a \n     regular basis by the employing office. The employing office \n     may not regularly contract with or otherwise regularly \n     utilize the services of the health care provider furnishing \n     the second opinion unless the employing office is located in \n     an area where access to health care is extremely limited \n     (e.g., a rural area where no more than one or two doctors \n     practice in the relevant specialty in the vicinity).\n       (c) Third opinion. If the opinions of the employee's and \n     the employing office's designated health care providers \n     differ, the employing office may require the employee to \n     obtain certification from a third health care provider, again \n     at the employing office's expense. This third opinion shall \n     be final and binding. The third health care provider must be \n     designated or approved jointly by the employing office and \n     the employee. The employing office and the employee must each \n     act in good faith to attempt to reach agreement on whom to \n     select for the third opinion provider. If the employing \n     office does not attempt in good faith to reach agreement, the \n     employing office will be bound by the first certification. If \n     the employee does not attempt in good faith to reach \n     agreement, the employee will be bound by the second \n     certification. For example, an employee who refuses to agree \n     to see a doctor in the specialty in question may be failing \n     to act in good faith. On the other hand, an employing office \n     that refuses to agree to any doctor on a list of specialists \n     in the appropriate field provided by the employee and whom \n     the employee has not previously consulted may be failing to \n     act in good faith. In addition, the consequences set forth in \n     825.305(d) will apply if the employee or the employee's \n     family member fails to authorize his or her health care \n     provider to release all relevant medical information \n     pertaining to the serious health condition at issue if \n     requested by the health care provider designated to provide a \n     third opinion in order to render a sufficient and complete \n     third opinion.\n       (d) Copies of opinions. The employing office is required to \n     provide the employee with a copy of the second and third \n     medical opinions, where applicable, upon request by the \n     employee. Requested copies are to be provided within five \n     business days unless extenuating circumstances prevent such \n     action.\n       (e) Travel expenses. If the employing office requires the \n     employee to obtain either a second or third opinion the \n     employing office must reimburse an employee or family member \n     for any reasonable ``out of pocket'' travel expenses incurred \n     to obtain the second and third medical opinions. The \n     employing office may not require the employee or family \n     member to travel outside normal commuting distance for \n     purposes of obtaining the second or third medical opinions \n     except in very unusual circumstances.\n       (f) Medical certification abroad. In circumstances in which \n     the employee or a family member is visiting in another \n     country, or a family member resides in another country, and a \n     serious health condition develops, the employing office shall \n     accept a medical certification as well as second and third \n     opinions from a health care provider who practices in that \n     country. Where a certification by a foreign health care \n     provider is in a language other than English, the employee \n     must provide the employing office with a written translation \n     of the certification upon request.\n     825.308 Recertifications for leave taken because of an \n         employee's own serious health condition or the serious \n         health condition of a family member.\n       (a) 30-day rule. An employing office may request \n     recertification no more often than every 30 days and only in \n     connection with an absence by the employee, unless paragraphs \n     (b) or (c) of this section apply.\n       (b) More than 30 days. If the medical certification \n     indicates that the minimum duration of the condition is more \n     than 30 days, an employing office must wait until that \n     minimum duration expires before requesting a recertification, \n     unless paragraph (c) of this section applies. For example, if \n     the medical certification states that an employee will be \n     unable to work, whether continuously or on an intermittent \n     basis, for 40 days, the employing office must wait 40 days \n     before requesting a recertification. In all cases, an \n     employing office may request a recertification of a medical \n     condition every six months in connection with an absence by \n     the employee. Accordingly, even if the medical certification \n     indicates that the employee will need intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave for a period in excess of six months (e.g., \n     for a lifetime condition), the employing office would be \n     permitted to request recertification every six months in \n     connection with an absence.\n       (c) Less than 30 days. An employing office may request \n     recertification in less than 30 days if:\n       (1) The employee requests an extension of leave;\n       (2) Circumstances described by the previous certification \n     have changed significantly (e.g., the duration or frequency \n     of the absence, the nature or severity of the illness, \n     complications). For example, if a medical certification \n     stated that an employee would need leave for one to two days \n     when the employee suffered a migraine headache and the \n     employee's absences for his or her last two migraines lasted \n     four days each, then the increased duration of absence might \n     constitute a significant change in circumstances allowing the \n     employing office to request a recertification in less than 30 \n     days. Likewise, if an employee had a pattern of using \n     unscheduled FMLA leave for migraines in conjunction with his \n     or her scheduled days off, then the timing of the absences \n     also might constitute a significant change in circumstances \n     sufficient for an employing office to request a \n     recertification more frequently than every 30 days; or\n\n[[Page H6043]]\n\n       (3) The employing office receives information that casts \n     doubt upon the employee's stated reason for the absence or \n     the continuing validity of the certification. For example, if \n     an employee is on FMLA leave for four weeks due to the \n     employee's knee surgery, including recuperation, and the \n     employee plays in company softball league games during the \n     employee's third week of FMLA leave, such information might \n     be sufficient to cast doubt upon the continuing validity of \n     the certification allowing the employing office to request a \n     recertification in less than 30 days.\n       (d) Timing. The employee must provide the requested \n     recertification to the employing office within the time frame \n     requested by the employing office (which must allow at least \n     15 calendar days after the employing office's request), \n     unless it is not practicable under the particular \n     circumstances to do so despite the employee's diligent, good \n     faith efforts.\n       (e) Content. The employing office may ask for the same \n     information when obtaining recertification as that permitted \n     for the original certification as set forth in 825.306. The \n     employee has the same obligations to participate and \n     cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient \n     certification or adequate authorization to the health care \n     provider) in the recertification process as in the initial \n     certification process. See 825.305(d). As part of the \n     information allowed to be obtained on recertification for \n     leave taken because of a serious health condition, the \n     employing office may provide the health care provider with a \n     record of the employee's absence pattern and ask the health \n     care provider if the serious health condition and need for \n     leave is consistent with such a pattern.\n       (f) Any recertification requested by the employing office \n     shall be at the employee's expense unless the employing \n     office provides otherwise. No second or third opinion on \n     recertification may be required.\n     825.309 Certification for leave taken because of a qualifying \n         exigency.\n       (a) Active Duty Orders. The first time an employee requests \n     leave because of a qualifying exigency arising out of the \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or \n     notification of an impending call or order to covered active \n     duty) of a military member (see 825.126(a)), an employing \n     office may require the employee to provide a copy of the \n     military member's active duty orders or other documentation \n     issued by the military which indicates that the military \n     member is on covered active duty or call to covered active \n     duty status, and the dates of the military member's covered \n     active duty service. This information need only be provided \n     to the employing office once. A copy of new active duty \n     orders or other documentation issued by the military may be \n     required by the employing office if the need for leave \n     because of a qualifying exigency arises out of a different \n     covered active duty or call to covered active duty status (or \n     notification of an impending call or order to covered active \n     duty) of the same or a different military member;\n       (b) Required information. An employing office may require \n     that leave for any qualifying exigency specified in 825.126 \n     be supported by a certification from the employee that sets \n     forth the following information:\n       (1) A statement or description, signed by the employee, of \n     appropriate facts regarding the qualifying exigency for which \n     FMLA leave is requested. The facts must be sufficient to \n     support the need for leave. Such facts should include \n     information on the type of qualifying exigency for which \n     leave is requested and any available written documentation \n     which supports the request for leave; such documentation, for \n     example, may include a copy of a meeting announcement for \n     informational briefings sponsored by the military, a document \n     confirming an appointment with a counselor or school \n     official, or a copy of a bill for services for the handling \n     of legal or financial affairs;\n       (2) The approximate date on which the qualifying exigency \n     commenced or will commence;\n       (3) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency for a single, continuous period of time, the \n     beginning and end dates for such absence;\n       (4) If an employee requests leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency on an intermittent or reduced schedule basis, an \n     estimate of the frequency and duration of the qualifying \n     exigency;\n       (5) If the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a \n     third party, appropriate contact information for the \n     individual or entity with whom the employee is meeting (such \n     as the name, title, organization, address, telephone number, \n     fax number, and email address) and a brief description of the \n     purpose of the meeting; and\n       (6) If the qualifying exigency involves Rest and \n     Recuperation leave, a copy of the military member's Rest and \n     Recuperation orders, or other documentation issued by the \n     military which indicates that the military member has been \n     granted Rest and Recuperation leave, and the dates of the \n     military member's Rest and Recuperation leave.\n       (c) The Office of Compliance has developed an optional form \n     (Form E) for employees' use in obtaining a certification that \n     meets FMLA's certification requirements. (See Form E). This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to \n     support his or her request for leave because of a qualifying \n     exigency. Form E, or another form containing the same basic \n     information, may be used by the employing office; however, no \n     information may be required beyond that specified in this \n     section.\n       (d) Verification. If an employee submits a complete and \n     sufficient certification to support his or her request for \n     leave because of a qualifying exigency, the employing office \n     may not request additional information from the employee. \n     However, if the qualifying exigency involves meeting with a \n     third party, the employing office may contact the individual \n     or entity with whom the employee is meeting for purposes of \n     verifying a meeting or appointment schedule and the nature of \n     the meeting between the employee and the specified individual \n     or entity. The employee's permission is not required in order \n     to verify meetings or appointments with third parties, but no \n     additional information may be requested by the employing \n     office. An employing office also may contact an appropriate \n     unit of the Department of Defense to request verification \n     that a military member is on covered active duty or call to \n     covered active duty status (or has been notified of an \n     impending call or order to covered active duty); no \n     additional information may be requested and the employee's \n     permission is not required.\n     825.310 Certification for leave taken to care for a covered \n         servicemember (military caregiver leave).\n       (a) Required information from health care provider. When \n     leave is taken to care for a covered servicemember with a \n     serious injury or illness, an employing office may require an \n     employee to obtain a certification completed by an authorized \n     health care provider of the covered servicemember. For \n     purposes of leave taken to care for a covered servicemember, \n     any one of the following health care providers may complete \n     such a certification:\n       (1) A United States Department of Defense (``DOD'') health \n     care provider;\n       (2) A United States Department of Veterans Affairs (``VA'') \n     health care provider;\n       (3) A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care \n     provider;\n       (4) A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health \n     care provider; or\n       (5) Any health care provider as defined in 825.125.\n       (b) If the authorized health care provider is unable to \n     make certain military-related determinations outlined below, \n     the authorized health care provider may rely on \n     determinations from an authorized DOD representative (such as \n     a DOD recovery care coordinator) or an authorized VA \n     representative. An employing office may request that the \n     health care provider provide the following information:\n       (1) The name, address, and appropriate contact information \n     (telephone number, fax number, and/or email address) of the \n     health care provider, the type of medical practice, the \n     medical specialty, and whether the health care provider is \n     one of the following:\n       (i) A DOD health care provider;\n       (ii) A VA health care provider;\n       (iii) A DOD TRICARE network authorized private health care \n     provider;\n       (iv) A DOD non-network TRICARE authorized private health \n     care provider; or\n       (v) A health care provider as defined in 825.125.\n       (2) Whether the covered servicemember's injury or illness \n     was incurred in the line of duty on active duty or, if not, \n     whether the covered servicemember's injury or illness existed \n     before the beginning of the servicemember's active duty and \n     was aggravated by service in the line of duty on active duty;\n       (3) The approximate date on which the serious injury or \n     illness commenced, or was aggravated, and its probable \n     duration;\n       (4) A statement or description of appropriate medical facts \n     regarding the covered servicemember's health condition for \n     which FMLA leave is requested. The medical facts must be \n     sufficient to support the need for leave.\n       (i) In the case of a current member of the Armed Forces, \n     such medical facts must include information on whether the \n     injury or illness may render the covered servicemember \n     medically unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember's \n     office, grade, rank, or rating and whether the member is \n     receiving medical treatment, recuperation, or therapy;\n       (ii) In the case of a covered veteran, such medical facts \n     must include:\n       (A) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is the continuation of an injury or illness that was \n     incurred or aggravated when the covered veteran was a member \n     of the Armed Forces and rendered the servicemember medically \n     unfit to perform the duties of the servicemember's office, \n     grade, rank, or rating; or\n       (B) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is a physical or mental condition for which the covered \n     veteran has received a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs \n     Service-Related Disability Rating (VASRD) of 50 percent or \n     greater, and that such VASRD rating is based, in whole or in \n     part, on the condition precipitating the need for military \n     caregiver leave; or\n       (C) Information on whether the veteran is receiving medical \n     treatment, recuperation, or therapy for an injury or illness \n     that is a physical or mental condition that substantially \n     impairs the covered veteran's ability to secure or follow a \n     substantially gainful occupation by reason of a disability or \n     disabilities related to military service, or would do so \n     absent treatment; or\n\n[[Page H6044]]\n\n       (D) Documentation of enrollment in the Department of \n     Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for \n     Family Caregivers.\n       (5) Information sufficient to establish that the covered \n     servicemember is in need of care, as described in 825.124, \n     and whether the covered servicemember will need care for a \n     single continuous period of time, including any time for \n     treatment and recovery, and an estimate as to the beginning \n     and ending dates for this period of time;\n       (6) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis for planned medical treatment \n     appointments for the covered servicemember, whether there is \n     a medical necessity for the covered servicemember to have \n     such periodic care and an estimate of the treatment schedule \n     of such appointments;\n       (7) If an employee requests leave on an intermittent or \n     reduced schedule basis to care for a covered servicemember \n     other than for planned medical treatment (e.g., episodic \n     flare-ups of a medical condition), whether there is a medical \n     necessity for the covered servicemember to have such periodic \n     care, which can include assisting in the covered \n     servicemember's recovery, and an estimate of the frequency \n     and duration of the periodic care.\n       (c) Required information from employee and/or covered \n     servicemember. In addition to the information that may be \n     requested under 825.310(b), an employing office may also \n     request that such certification set forth the following \n     information provided by an employee and/or covered \n     servicemember:\n       (1) The name and address of the employing office of the \n     employee requesting leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember, the name of the employee requesting such \n     leave, and the name of the covered servicemember for whom the \n     employee is requesting leave to care;\n       (2) The relationship of the employee to the covered \n     servicemember for whom the employee is requesting leave to \n     care;\n       (3) Whether the covered servicemember is a current member \n     of the Armed Forces, the National Guard or Reserves, and the \n     covered servicemember's military branch, rank, and current \n     unit assignment;\n       (4) Whether the covered servicemember is assigned to a \n     military medical facility as an outpatient or to a unit \n     established for the purpose of providing command and control \n     of members of the Armed Forces receiving medical care as \n     outpatients (such as a medical hold or warrior transition \n     unit), and the name of the medical treatment facility or \n     unit;\n       (5) Whether the covered servicemember is on the temporary \n     disability retired list;\n       (6) Whether the covered servicemember is a veteran, the \n     date of separation from military service, and whether the \n     separation was other than dishonorable. The employing office \n     may require the employee to provide documentation issued by \n     the military which indicates that the covered servicemember \n     is a veteran, the date of separation, and that the separation \n     is other than dishonorable. Where an employing office \n     requires such documentation, an employee may provide a copy \n     of the veteran's Certificate of Release or Discharge from \n     Active Duty issued by the U.S. Department of Defense (DD Form \n     214) or other proof of veteran status. See 825.127(c)(2).\n       (7) A description of the care to be provided to the covered \n     servicemember and an estimate of the leave needed to provide \n     the care.\n       (d) The Office of Compliance has developed an optional form \n     (Form F) for employees' use in obtaining certification that \n     meets FMLA's certification requirements. (See Form F). This \n     optional form reflects certification requirements so as to \n     permit the employee to furnish appropriate information to \n     support his or her request for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember with a serious injury or illness. Form F, or \n     Form WH-385 (developed by the Department of Labor), or \n     another form containing the same basic information, may be \n     used by the employing office; however, no information may be \n     required beyond that specified in this section. In all \n     instances the information on the certification must relate \n     only to the serious injury or illness for which the current \n     need for leave exists. An employing office may seek \n     authentication and/or clarification of the certification \n     under 825.307. However, second and third opinions under \n     825.307 are not permitted for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember. Additionally, recertifications under 825.308 \n     are not permitted for leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember. An employing office may require an employee to \n     provide confirmation of covered family relationship to the \n     seriously injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(j) \n     of the FMLA.\n       (e) An employing office requiring an employee to submit a \n     certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     must accept as sufficient certification, in lieu of the \n     Office of Compliance's optional certification form (Form F) \n     or an employing office's own certification form, invitational \n     travel orders (ITOs) or invitational travel authorizations \n     (ITAs) issued to any family member to join an injured or ill \n     servicemember at his or her bedside. An ITO or ITA is \n     sufficient certification for the duration of time specified \n     in the ITO or ITA. During that time period, an eligible \n     employee may take leave to care for the covered servicemember \n     in a continuous block of time or on an intermittent basis. An \n     eligible employee who provides an ITO or ITA to support his \n     or her request for leave may not be required to provide any \n     additional or separate certification that leave taken on an \n     intermittent basis during the period of time specified in the \n     ITO or ITA is medically necessary. An ITO or ITA is \n     sufficient certification for an employee entitled to take \n     FMLA leave to care for a covered servicemember regardless of \n     whether the employee is named in the order or authorization.\n       (1) If an employee will need leave to care for a covered \n     servicemember beyond the expiration date specified in an ITO \n     or ITA, an employing office may request that the employee \n     have one of the authorized health care providers listed under \n     825.310(a) complete the Office of Compliance optional \n     certification form (Form F) or an employing office's own \n     form, as requisite certification for the remainder of the \n     employee's necessary leave period.\n       (2) An employing office may seek authentication and \n     clarification of the ITO or ITA under 825.307. An employing \n     office may not utilize the second or third opinion process \n     outlined in 825.307 or the recertification process under \n     825.308 during the period of time in which leave is supported \n     by an ITO or ITA.\n       (3) An employing office may require an employee to provide \n     confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously \n     injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an \n     employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a \n     copy of an ITO or ITA.\n       (f) An employing office requiring an employee to submit a \n     certification for leave to care for a covered servicemember \n     must accept as sufficient certification of the \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness documentation \n     indicating the servicemember's enrollment in the Department \n     of Veterans Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for \n     Family Caregivers. Such documentation is sufficient \n     certification of the servicemember's serious injury or \n     illness to support the employee's request for military \n     caregiver leave regardless of whether the employee is the \n     named caregiver in the enrollment documentation.\n       (1) An employing office may seek authentication and \n     clarification of the documentation indicating the \n     servicemember's enrollment in the Department of Veterans \n     Affairs Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family \n     Caregivers under 825.307. An employing office may not utilize \n     the second or third opinion process outlined in 825.307 or \n     the recertification process under 825.308 when the \n     servicemember's serious injury or illness is shown by \n     documentation of enrollment in this program.\n       (2) An employing office may require an employee to provide \n     confirmation of covered family relationship to the seriously \n     injured or ill servicemember pursuant to 825.122(k) when an \n     employee supports his or her request for FMLA leave with a \n     copy of such enrollment documentation. An employing office \n     may also require an employee to provide documentation, such \n     as a veteran's Form DD-214, showing that the discharge was \n     other than dishonorable and the date of the veteran's \n     discharge.\n       (g) Where medical certification is requested by an \n     employing office, an employee may not be held liable for \n     administrative delays in the issuance of military documents, \n     despite the employee's diligent, good-faith efforts to obtain \n     such documents. See 825.305(b). In all instances in which \n     certification is requested, it is the employee's \n     responsibility to provide the employing office with complete \n     and sufficient certification and failure to do so may result \n     in the denial of FMLA leave. See 825.305(d).\n     825.311 Intent to return to work.\n       (a) An employing office may require an employee on FMLA \n     leave to report periodically on the employee's status and \n     intent to return to work. The employing office's policy \n     regarding such reports may not be discriminatory and must \n     take into account all of the relevant facts and circumstances \n     related to the individual employee's leave situation.\n       (b) If an employee gives unequivocal notice of intent not \n     to return to work, the employing office's obligations under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, to maintain health \n     benefits (subject to COBRA requirements or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, \n     whichever is applicable) and to restore the employee cease. \n     However, these obligations continue if an employee indicates \n     he or she may be unable to return to work but expresses a \n     continuing desire to do so.\n       (c) It may be necessary for an employee to take more leave \n     than originally anticipated. Conversely, an employee may \n     discover after beginning leave that the circumstances have \n     changed and the amount of leave originally anticipated is no \n     longer necessary. An employee may not be required to take \n     more FMLA leave than necessary to resolve the circumstance \n     that precipitated the need for leave. In both of these \n     situations, the employing office may require that the \n     employee provide the employing office reasonable notice \n     (i.e., within two business days) of the changed circumstances \n     where foreseeable. The employing office may also obtain \n     information on such changed circumstances through requested \n     status reports.\n     825.312 Fitness-for-duty certification.\n       (a) As a condition of restoring an employee whose FMLA \n     leave was occasioned by the employee's own serious health \n     condition that made the employee unable to perform the \n     employee's job, an employing office may\n\n[[Page H6045]]\n\n     have a uniformly-applied policy or practice that requires all \n     similarly-situated employees (i.e., same occupation, same \n     serious health condition) who take leave for such conditions \n     to obtain and present certification from the employee's \n     health care provider that the employee is able to resume \n     work. The employee has the same obligations to participate \n     and cooperate (including providing a complete and sufficient \n     certification or providing sufficient authorization to the \n     health care provider to provide the information directly to \n     the employing office) in the fitness-for-duty certification \n     process as in the initial certification process. See \n     825.305(d).\n       (b) An employing office may seek a fitness-for-duty \n     certification only with regard to the particular health \n     condition that caused the employee's need for FMLA leave. The \n     certification from the employee's health care provider must \n     certify that the employee is able to resume work. \n     Additionally, an employing office may require that the \n     certification specifically address the employee's ability to \n     perform the essential functions of the employee's job. In \n     order to require such a certification, an employing office \n     must provide an employee with a list of the essential \n     functions of the employee's job no later than with the \n     designation notice required by 825.300(d), and must indicate \n     in the designation notice that the certification must address \n     the employee's ability to perform those essential functions. \n     If the employing office satisfies these requirements, the \n     employee's health care provider must certify that the \n     employee can perform the identified essential functions of \n     his or her job. Following the procedures set forth in \n     825.307(a), the employing office may contact the employee's \n     health care provider for purposes of clarifying and \n     authenticating the fitness-for-duty certification. \n     Clarification may be requested only for the serious health \n     condition for which FMLA leave was taken. The employing \n     office may not delay the employee's return to work while \n     contact with the health care provider is being made. No \n     second or third opinions on a fitness-for-duty certification \n     may be required.\n       (c) The cost of the certification shall be borne by the \n     employee, and the employee is not entitled to be paid for the \n     time or travel costs spent in acquiring the certification.\n       (d) The designation notice required in 825.300(d) shall \n     advise the employee if the employing office will require a \n     fitness-for-duty certification to return to work and whether \n     that fitness-for-duty certification must address the \n     employee's ability to perform the essential functions of the \n     employee's job.\n       (e) An employing office may delay restoration to employment \n     until an employee submits a required fitness-for-duty \n     certification unless the employing office has failed to \n     provide the notice required in paragraph (d) of this section. \n     If an employing office provides the notice required, an \n     employee who does not provide a fitness-for-duty \n     certification or request additional FMLA leave is no longer \n     entitled to reinstatement under the FMLA. See 825.313(d).\n       (f) An employing office is not entitled to a certification \n     of fitness to return to duty for each absence taken on an \n     intermittent or reduced leave schedule. However, an employing \n     office is entitled to a certification of fitness to return to \n     duty for such absences up to once every 30 days if reasonable \n     safety concerns exist regarding the employee's ability to \n     perform his or her duties, based on the serious health \n     condition for which the employee took such leave. If an \n     employing office chooses to require a fitness-for-duty \n     certification under such circumstances, the employing office \n     shall inform the employee at the same time it issues the \n     designation notice that for each subsequent instance of \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave, the employee will be \n     required to submit a fitness-for-duty certification unless \n     one has already been submitted within the past 30 days. \n     Alternatively, an employing office can set a different \n     interval for requiring a fitness-for-duty certification as \n     long as it does not exceed once every 30 days and as long as \n     the employing office advises the employee of the requirement \n     in advance of the employee taking the intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave. The employing office may not terminate the \n     employment of the employee while awaiting such a \n     certification of fitness to return to duty for an \n     intermittent or reduced schedule leave absence. Reasonable \n     safety concerns means a reasonable belief of significant risk \n     of harm to the individual employee or others. In determining \n     whether reasonable safety concerns exist, an employing office \n     should consider the nature and severity of the potential harm \n     and the likelihood that potential harm will occur.\n       (g) If the terms of a collective bargaining agreement \n     govern an employee's return to work, those provisions shall \n     be applied.\n       (h) Requirements under the Americans with Disabilities Act \n     (ADA), as amended and as made applicable by the CAA, apply. \n     After an employee returns from FMLA leave, the ADA requires \n     any medical examination at an employing office's expense by \n     the employing office's health care provider be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity. For example, an \n     attorney could not be required to submit to a medical \n     examination or inquiry just because her leg had been \n     amputated. The essential functions of an attorney's job do \n     not require use of both legs; therefore such an inquiry would \n     not be job related. An employing office may require a \n     warehouse laborer, whose back impairment affects the ability \n     to lift, to be examined by an orthopedist, but may not \n     require this employee to submit to an HIV test where the test \n     is not related to either the essential functions of his or \n     her job or to his/her impairment. If an employee's serious \n     health condition may also be a disability within the meaning \n     of the ADA, as made applicable by the CAA, the FMLA does not \n     prevent the employing office from following the procedures \n     for requesting medical information under the ADA.\n     825.313 Failure to provide certification.\n       (a) Foreseeable leave. In the case of foreseeable leave, if \n     an employee fails to provide certification in a timely manner \n     as required by 825.305, then an employing office may deny \n     FMLA coverage until the required certification is provided. \n     For example, if an employee has 15 days to provide a \n     certification and does not provide the certification for 45 \n     days without sufficient reason for the delay, the employing \n     office can deny FMLA protections for the 30-day period \n     following the expiration of the 15-day time period, if the \n     employee takes leave during such period.\n       (b) Unforeseeable leave. In the case of unforeseeable \n     leave, an employing office may deny FMLA coverage for the \n     requested leave if the employee fails to provide a \n     certification within 15 calendar days from receipt of the \n     request for certification unless not practicable due to \n     extenuating circumstances. For example, in the case of a \n     medical emergency, it may not be practicable for an employee \n     to provide the required certification within 15 calendar \n     days. Absent such extenuating circumstances, if the employee \n     fails to timely return the certification, the employing \n     office can deny FMLA protections for the leave following the \n     expiration of the 15-day time period until a sufficient \n     certification is provided. If the employee never produces the \n     certification, the leave is not FMLA leave.\n       (c) Recertification. An employee must provide \n     recertification within the time requested by the employing \n     office (which must allow at least 15 calendar days after the \n     request) or as soon as practicable under the particular facts \n     and circumstances. If an employee fails to provide a \n     recertification within a reasonable time under the particular \n     facts and circumstances, then the employing office may deny \n     continuation of the FMLA leave protections until the employee \n     produces a sufficient recertification. If the employee never \n     produces the recertification, the leave is not FMLA leave. \n     Recertification does not apply to leave taken for a \n     qualifying exigency or to care for a covered servicemember.\n       (d) Fitness-for-duty certification. When requested by the \n     employing office pursuant to a uniformly applied policy for \n     similarly-situated employees, the employee must provide \n     medical certification, at the time the employee seeks \n     reinstatement at the end of FMLA leave taken for the \n     employee's serious health condition, that the employee is fit \n     for duty and able to return to work (see 825.312(a)) if the \n     employing office has provided the required notice (see \n     825.300(e)); the employing office may delay restoration until \n     the certification is provided. Unless the employee provides \n     either a fitness-for-duty certification or a new medical \n     certification for a serious health condition at the time FMLA \n     leave is concluded, the employee may be terminated. See also \n     825.213(a)(3).\n     SUBPART D--ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS\n     825.400 Enforcement of FMLA rights, as made applicable by the \n         CAA.\n       (a) To commence a proceeding, a covered employee alleging a \n     violation of the rights and protections of the FMLA, made \n     applicable by the CAA, must request counseling by the Office \n     of Compliance not later than 180 days after the date of the \n     alleged violation. If a covered employee misses this \n     deadline, the covered employee will be unable to obtain a \n     remedy under the CAA.\n       (b) The following procedures are available under title IV \n     of the CAA for covered employees who believe that their \n     rights under FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, have been \n     violated:\n       (1) counseling;\n       (2) mediation; and\n       (3) election of either--\n       (A) a formal complaint, filed with the Office of \n     Compliance, and a hearing before a hearing officer, subject \n     to review by the Board of Directors of the Office of \n     Compliance, and judicial review in the United States Court of \n     Appeals for the Federal Circuit; or\n       (B) a civil action in a district court of the United \n     States.\n       (c) Regulations of the Office of Compliance describing and \n     governing these procedures are found at www.compliance.gov.\n     825.401 [Reserved]\n     825.402 [Reserved]\n     825.403 [Reserved]\n     825.404 [Reserved]\n     SUBPART E--[RESERVED]\n     SUBPART F--SPECIAL RULES APPLICABLE TO EMPLOYEES OF SCHOOLS\n     825.600 Special rules for school employees, definitions.\n       (a) Certain special rules apply to employees of local \n     educational agencies, including public school boards and \n     elementary schools under their jurisdiction, and private \n     elementary and secondary schools. The special rules do not \n     apply to other kinds of educational institutions, such as \n     colleges and universities, trade schools, and preschools.\n\n[[Page H6046]]\n\n       (b) Educational institutions are covered by FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA (and these special rules). The usual \n     requirements for employees to be eligible do apply.\n       (c) The special rules affect the taking of intermittent \n     leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule, or leave near the \n     end of an academic term (semester), by instructional \n     employees. Instructional employees are those whose principal \n     function is to teach and instruct students in a class, a \n     small group, or an individual setting. This term includes not \n     only teachers, but also athletic coaches, driving \n     instructors, and special education assistants such as signers \n     for the hearing impaired. It does not include, and the \n     special rules do not apply to, teacher assistants or aides \n     who do not have as their principal job actual teaching or \n     instructing, nor does it include auxiliary personnel such as \n     counselors, psychologists, or curriculum specialists. It also \n     does not include cafeteria workers, maintenance workers, or \n     bus drivers.\n       (d) Special rules which apply to restoration to an \n     equivalent position apply to all employees of local \n     educational agencies.\n     825.601 Special rules for school employees, limitations on \n         intermittent leave.\n       (a) Leave taken for a period that ends with the school year \n     and begins the next semester is leave taken consecutively \n     rather than intermittently. The period during the summer \n     vacation when the employee would not have been required to \n     report for duty is not counted against the employee's FMLA \n     leave entitlement. An instructional employee who is on FMLA \n     leave at the end of the school year must be provided with any \n     benefits over the summer vacation that employees would \n     normally receive if they had been working at the end of the \n     school year.\n       (1) If an eligible instructional employee needs \n     intermittent leave or leave on a reduced leave schedule to \n     care for a family member with a serious health condition, to \n     care for a covered servicemember, or for the employee's own \n     serious health condition, which is foreseeable based on \n     planned medical treatment, and the employee would be on leave \n     for more than 20 percent of the total number of working days \n     over the period the leave would extend, the employing office \n     may require the employee to choose either to:\n       (i) Take leave for a period or periods of a particular \n     duration, not greater than the duration of the planned \n     treatment; or\n       (ii) Transfer temporarily to an available alternative \n     position for which the employee is qualified, which has \n     equivalent pay and benefits and which better accommodates \n     recurring periods of leave than does the employee's regular \n     position.\n       (2) These rules apply only to a leave involving more than \n     20 percent of the working days during the period over which \n     the leave extends. For example, if an instructional employee \n     who normally works five days each week needs to take two days \n     of FMLA leave per week over a period of several weeks, the \n     special rules would apply. Employees taking leave which \n     constitutes 20 percent or less of the working days during the \n     leave period would not be subject to transfer to an \n     alternative position. Periods of a particular duration means \n     a block, or blocks, of time beginning no earlier than the \n     first day for which leave is needed and ending no later than \n     the last day on which leave is needed, and may include one \n     uninterrupted period of leave.\n       (b) If an instructional employee does not give required \n     notice of foreseeable FMLA leave (see 825.302) to be taken \n     intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule, the employing \n     office may require the employee to take leave of a particular \n     duration, or to transfer temporarily to an alternative \n     position. Alternatively, the employing office may require the \n     employee to delay the taking of leave until the notice \n     provision is met.\n     825.602 Special rules for school employees, limitations on \n         leave near the end of an academic term.\n       (a) There are also different rules for instructional \n     employees who begin leave more than five weeks before the end \n     of a term, less than five weeks before the end of a term, and \n     less than three weeks before the end of a term. Regular rules \n     apply except in circumstances when:\n       (1) An instructional employee begins leave more than five \n     weeks before the end of a term. The employing office may \n     require the employee to continue taking leave until the end \n     of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last at least three weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the three-\n     week period before the end of the term.\n       (2) The employee begins leave during the five-week period \n     before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or \n     daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or \n     foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent \n     with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered \n     servicemember. The employing office may require the employee \n     to continue taking leave until the end of the term if--\n       (i) The leave will last more than two weeks, and\n       (ii) The employee would return to work during the two-week \n     period before the end of the term.\n       (3) The employee begins leave during the three-week period \n     before the end of a term because of the birth of a son or \n     daughter; the placement of a son or daughter for adoption or \n     foster care; to care for a spouse, son, daughter, or parent \n     with a serious health condition; or to care for a covered \n     servicemember. The employing office may require the employee \n     to continue taking leave until the end of the term if the \n     leave will last more than five working days.\n       (b) For purposes of these provisions, academic term means \n     the school semester, which typically ends near the end of the \n     calendar year and the end of spring each school year. In no \n     case may a school have more than two academic terms or \n     semesters each year for purposes of FMLA, as made applicable \n     by the CAA. An example of leave falling within these \n     provisions would be where an employee plans two weeks of \n     leave to care for a family member which will begin three \n     weeks before the end of the term. In that situation, the \n     employing office could require the employee to stay out on \n     leave until the end of the term.\n     825.603 Special rules for school employees, duration of FMLA \n         leave.\n       (a) If an employee chooses to take leave for periods of a \n     particular duration in the case of intermittent or reduced \n     schedule leave, the entire period of leave taken will count \n     as FMLA leave.\n       (b) In the case of an employee who is required to take \n     leave until the end of an academic term, only the period of \n     leave until the employee is ready and able to return to work \n     shall be charged against the employee's FMLA leave \n     entitlement. The employing office has the option not to \n     require the employee to stay on leave until the end of the \n     school term. Therefore, any additional leave required by the \n     employing office to the end of the school term is not counted \n     as FMLA leave; however, the employing office shall be \n     required to maintain the employee's group health insurance \n     and restore the employee to the same or equivalent job \n     including other benefits at the conclusion of the leave.\n     825.604 Special rules for school employees, restoration to an \n         equivalent position.\n       The determination of how an employee is to be restored to \n     an equivalent position upon return from FMLA leave will be \n     made on the basis of ``established school board policies and \n     practices, private school policies and practices, and \n     collective bargaining agreements.'' The ``established \n     policies'' and collective bargaining agreements used as a \n     basis for restoration must be in writing, must be made known \n     to the employee prior to the taking of FMLA leave, and must \n     clearly explain the employee's restoration rights upon return \n     from leave. Any established policy which is used as the basis \n     for restoration of an employee to an equivalent position must \n     provide substantially the same protections as provided in the \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, for reinstated \n     employees. See 825.215. In other words, the policy or \n     collective bargaining agreement must provide for restoration \n     to an equivalent position with equivalent employment \n     benefits, pay, and other terms and conditions of employment. \n     For example, an employee may not be restored to a position \n     requiring additional licensure or certification.\n     SUBPART G--EFFECT OF OTHER LAWS, EMPLOYING OFFICE PRACTICES, \n         AND COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS ON EMPLOYEE RIGHTS \n         UNDER THE FMLA, AS MADE APPLICABLE BY THE CAA.\n     825.700 Interaction with employing office's policies.\n       (a) An employing office must observe any employment benefit \n     program or plan that provides greater family or medical leave \n     rights to employees than the rights established by the FMLA. \n     Conversely, the rights established by the FMLA, as made \n     applicable by the CAA, may not be diminished by any \n     employment benefit program or plan. For example, a provision \n     of a collective bargaining agreement (CBA) which provides for \n     reinstatement to a position that is not equivalent because of \n     seniority (e.g., provides lesser pay) is superseded by FMLA. \n     If an employing office provides greater unpaid family leave \n     rights than are afforded by FMLA, the employing office is not \n     required to extend additional rights afforded by FMLA, such \n     as maintenance of health benefits (other than through COBRA \n     or 5 U.S.C. 8905a, whichever is applicable), to the \n     additional leave period not covered by FMLA.\n       (b) Nothing in the FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA, \n     prevents an employing office from amending existing leave and \n     employee benefit programs, provided they comply with FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA. However, nothing in the FMLA, as \n     made applicable by the CAA, is intended to discourage \n     employing offices from adopting or retaining more generous \n     leave policies.\n     825.701 [Reserved]\n     825.702 Interaction with anti-discrimination laws, as applied \n         by section 201 of the CAA.\n       (a) Nothing in FMLA modifies or affects any applicable law \n     prohibiting discrimination on the basis of race, religion, \n     color, national origin, sex, age, or disability (e.g., Title \n     VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as amended by the \n     Pregnancy Discrimination Act and as made applicable by the \n     CAA). FMLA's legislative history explains that FMLA is ``not \n     intended to modify or affect the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, \n     as amended, the regulations concerning employment which have \n     been promulgated pursuant to that statute, or the Americans \n     with Disabilities Act of 1990 [as amended] or the regulations \n     issued under that act. Thus, the leave provisions of the \n     [FMLA] are wholly distinct\n\n[[Page H6047]]\n\n     from the reasonable accommodation obligations of employers \n     covered under the [ADA] . . . or the Federal government \n     itself. The purpose of the FMLA, as applied by the CAA, is to \n     make leave available to eligible employees and [employing \n     offices] within its coverage, and not to limit already \n     existing rights and protection.'' S. Rep. No. 3, 103d Cong., \n     1st Sess. 38 (1993). An employing office must therefore \n     provide leave under whichever statutory provision provides \n     the greater rights to employees. When an employer violates \n     both FMLA and a discrimination law, an employee may be able \n     to recover under either or both statutes (double relief may \n     not be awarded for the same loss; when remedies coincide a \n     claimant may be allowed to utilize whichever avenue of relief \n     is desired. Laffey v. Northwest Airlines, Inc., 567 F.2d 429, \n     445 (D.C. Cir. 1976), cert. denied, 434 U.S. 1086 (1978).\n       (b) If an employee is a qualified individual with a \n     disability within the meaning of the Americans with \n     Disabilities Act (ADA), the employing office must make \n     reasonable accommodations, etc., barring undue hardship, in \n     accordance with the ADA. At the same time, the employing \n     office must afford an employee his or her FMLA rights. ADA's \n     ``disability'' and FMLA's ``serious health condition'' are \n     different concepts, and must be analyzed separately. FMLA \n     entitles eligible employees to 12 weeks of leave in any 12-\n     month period due to their own serious health condition, \n     whereas the ADA allows an indeterminate amount of leave, \n     barring undue hardship, as a reasonable accommodation. FMLA \n     requires employing offices to maintain employees' group \n     health plan coverage during FMLA leave on the same conditions \n     as coverage would have been provided if the employee had been \n     continuously employed during the leave period, whereas ADA \n     does not require maintenance of health insurance unless other \n     employees receive health insurance during leave under the \n     same circumstances.\n       (c)(1) A reasonable accommodation under the ADA might be \n     accomplished by providing an individual with a disability \n     with a part-time job with no health benefits, assuming the \n     employing office did not ordinarily provide health insurance \n     for part-time employees. However, FMLA would permit an \n     employee to work a reduced leave schedule until the \n     equivalent of 12 workweeks of leave were used, with group \n     health benefits maintained during this period. FMLA permits \n     an employing office to temporarily transfer an employee who \n     is taking leave intermittently or on a reduced leave schedule \n     to an alternative position, whereas the ADA allows an \n     accommodation of reassignment to an equivalent, vacant \n     position only if the employee cannot perform the essential \n     functions of the employee's present position and an \n     accommodation is not possible in the employee's present \n     position, or an accommodation in the employee's present \n     position would cause an undue hardship. The examples in the \n     following paragraphs of this section demonstrate how the two \n     laws would interact with respect to a qualified individual \n     with a disability.\n       (2) A qualified individual with a disability who is also an \n     eligible employee entitled to FMLA leave requests 10 weeks of \n     medical leave as a reasonable accommodation, which the \n     employing office grants because it is not an undue hardship. \n     The employing office advises the employee that the 10 weeks \n     of leave is also being designated as FMLA leave and will \n     count towards the employee's FMLA leave entitlement. This \n     designation does not prevent the parties from also treating \n     the leave as a reasonable accommodation and reinstating the \n     employee into the same job, as required by the ADA, rather \n     than an equivalent position under FMLA, if that is the \n     greater right available to the employee. At the same time, \n     the employee would be entitled under FMLA to have the \n     employing office maintain group health plan coverage during \n     the leave, as that requirement provides the greater right to \n     the employee.\n       (3) If the same employee needed to work part-time (a \n     reduced leave schedule) after returning to his or her same \n     job, the employee would still be entitled under FMLA to have \n     group health plan coverage maintained for the remainder of \n     the two-week equivalent of FMLA leave entitlement, \n     notwithstanding an employing office policy that part-time \n     employees do not receive health insurance. This employee \n     would be entitled under the ADA to reasonable accommodations \n     to enable the employee to perform the essential functions of \n     the part-time position. In addition, because the employee is \n     working a part-time schedule as a reasonable accommodation, \n     the FMLA's provision for temporary assignment to a different \n     alternative position would not apply. Once the employee has \n     exhausted his or her remaining FMLA leave entitlement while \n     working the reduced (part-time) schedule, if the employee is \n     a qualified individual with a disability, and if the employee \n     is unable to return to the same full-time position at that \n     time, the employee might continue to work part-time as a \n     reasonable accommodation, barring undue hardship; the \n     employee would then be entitled to only those employment \n     benefits ordinarily provided by the employing office to part-\n     time employees.\n       (4) At the end of the FMLA leave entitlement, an employing \n     office is required under FMLA to reinstate the employee in \n     the same or an equivalent position, with equivalent pay and \n     benefits, to that which the employee held when leave \n     commenced. The employing office's FMLA obligations would be \n     satisfied if the employing office offered the employee an \n     equivalent full-time position. If the employee were unable to \n     perform the essential functions of that equivalent position \n     even with reasonable accommodation, because of a disability, \n     the ADA may require the employing office to make a reasonable \n     accommodation at that time by allowing the employee to work \n     part-time or by reassigning the employee to a vacant \n     position, barring undue hardship.\n       (d)(1) If FMLA entitles an employee to leave, an employing \n     office may not, in lieu of FMLA leave entitlement, require an \n     employee to take a job with a reasonable accommodation. \n     However, ADA may require that an employing office offer an \n     employee the opportunity to take such a position. An \n     employing office may not change the essential functions of \n     the job in order to deny FMLA leave. See 825.220(b).\n       (2) An employee may be on a workers' compensation absence \n     due to an on-the-job injury or illness which also qualifies \n     as a serious health condition under FMLA. The workers' \n     compensation absence and FMLA leave may run concurrently \n     (subject to proper notice and designation by the employing \n     office). At some point the health care provider providing \n     medical care pursuant to the workers' compensation injury may \n     certify the employee is able to return to work in a light \n     duty position. If the employing office offers such a \n     position, the employee is permitted but not required to \n     accept the position. See 825.220(d). As a result, the \n     employee may no longer qualify for payments from the workers' \n     compensation benefit plan, but the employee is entitled to \n     continue on unpaid FMLA leave either until the employee is \n     able to return to the same or equivalent job the employee \n     left or until the 12-week FMLA leave entitlement is \n     exhausted. See 825.207 (e). If the employee returning from \n     the workers' compensation injury is a qualified individual \n     with a disability, he or she will have rights under the ADA.\n       (e) If an employing office requires certifications of an \n     employee's fitness for duty to return to work, as permitted \n     by FMLA under a uniform policy, it must comply with the ADA \n     requirement that a fitness for duty physical be job-related \n     and consistent with business necessity.\n       (f) Under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, as \n     amended by the Pregnancy Discrimination Act, and as made \n     applicable by the CAA, an employing office should provide the \n     same benefits for women who are pregnant as the employing \n     office provides to other employees with short-term \n     disabilities. Because Title VII does not require employees to \n     be employed for a certain period of time to be protected, an \n     employee employed for less than 12 months by the employing \n     office (and, therefore, not an ``eligible'' employee under \n     FMLA, as made applicable by the CAA) may not be denied \n     maternity leave if the employing office normally provides \n     short-term disability benefits to employees with the same \n     tenure who are experiencing other short-term disabilities.\n       (g) Under the Uniformed Services Employment and \n     Reemployment Rights Act of 1994 (USERRA), 38 U.S.C. 4301, et \n     seq., veterans are entitled to receive all rights and \n     benefits of employment that they would have obtained if they \n     had been continuously employed. Therefore, under USERRA, a \n     returning servicemember would be eligible for FMLA leave if \n     the months and hours that he or she would have worked for the \n     civilian employing office during the period of absence due to \n     or necessitated by USERRA-covered service, combined with the \n     months employed and the hours actually worked, meet the FMLA \n     eligibility threshold of 12 months of employment and the \n     hours of service requirement. See 825.110(b)(2)(i) and (c)(2) \n     and 825.802(c).\n       (h) For further information on Federal antidiscrimination \n     laws applied by section 201 of the CAA (2 U.S.C. 1311), \n     including Title VII, the Rehabilitation Act, and the ADA, \n     individuals are encouraged to contact the Office of \n     Compliance.\n\n                                Endnotes\n\n       1. In contrast, the committee report accompanying the bill \n     containing the ADA Amendments Act of 2008 complied with \n     section 102(b)(3) of the CAA and contained a provision that \n     indicated an intent to apply the ADA Amendments to the \n     legislative branch.

By regulation, the Board can require employing offices \n     to provide the additional rights and protections for \n     servicemembers and their families added to the FMLA since \n     1996. This is because, unlike executive branch agencies, the \n     rulemaking power of the Board (after Congressional approval) \n     is ``an exercise of the rulemaking power of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate'' under the Constitution. 2 \n     U.S.C.
