The number one \naccomplishment that he came up with was to use taxpayer dollars to \ncreate a committee for the specific purpose of affecting the \nPresidential campaign and driving down the polling numbers of a \nDemocratic candidate.\n  Is that your job when it took until yesterday to get a budget for \njust 2 months to the floor of this House, but you spend millions of \ndollars, thousands of hours, specifically for the purposes of driving \ndown the polling numbers of a Presidential candidate in the Democratic \nParty?\n  Give me a break. This has gone too far.

He transitioned to the Oklahoma National Guard as a C-26 \ninspector pilot before retraining in the F-16. Colonel Burgy has logged \nover 3,800 military flight hours and deployed five times to fight our \nNation's wars.\n  As the 138th commander since December 2012, Colonel Burgy led the Air \nNational Guard's best fighter wing of over 1,200 airmen.

Now it is documentary proof \nin front of literally millions of Americans, bragged about and set out \nas: Yeah.

This \nweek we celebrate a cleanup milestone and the transfer of more than \n1,600 acres of land back to these communities.\n  This transfer represents the culmination of years of local efforts as \nwell as bipartisan, bicameral cooperation. I commend the work of Doc \nHastings and Senators Murray and Cantwell that laid the groundwork for \nthis achievement.\n  As Hanford's cleanup mission is completed, this unneeded Federal land \nshould continue to be returned to the local community for the goals of \nconservation, preservation, public access, and economic development to \nbe achieved.\n  This long anticipated land transfer will be used for industrial and \nenergy production and creates jobs and boosts economic development in \nthe mid-Columbia region. This week's transfer is an exciting step for \nthe post-Hanford future. I will continue to work with all parties to \nhave more land returned to the community.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/house-section/article/H6752-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6752]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Dold).

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n\n[[Page H6753]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 449 provides a rule for the \nconsideration of H.R. 3457, the Justice for Victims of Iranian \nTerrorism Act, and the conference report to accompany H.R. 1735, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.\n  Mr. Speaker, these two bills are directly related to one of the most \nimportant functions of Congress, which is to provide for the national \nsecurity of our country. For 53 straight years, Congress has come \ntogether in a bipartisan fashion to pass a National Defense \nAuthorization Act to ensure that our military men and women have the \nresources and the policies they need to do their job. Even in an era of \ndeep partisanship in Congress, we have still been able to keep the \ntradition alive and pass an NDAA each year. This rule would allow us to \nkeep that tradition alive.\n  The NDAA process has been a great example of following regular order \nand doing congressional business the way it is supposed to be done. In \nboth the House and the Senate, the respective Armed Services Committees \nheld multiple hearings and markups that allowed all Members to have a \nrole in the process.\n  Here in the House, the NDAA came up for a vote on the floor with a \nrecord number of amendments--135, to be exact. It passed with \nbipartisan support by a vote of 269-151. The Senate followed a very \nsimilar process and was able to approve their version of the bill by a \nvote of 71-125, a veto-proof majority.\n  Since our bills were different, the last few months have been spent \nin a conference committee to iron out the differences. The bill doesn't \ninclude everything I would like, but it is the true definition of a \nbipartisan collaborative work product. This NDAA is a textbook example \nof how Congress should work.\n  Despite all of that, I am shocked to learn that some of my colleagues \non the other side of the aisle are not supporting this critical \nlegislation. Even worse, the President has threatened to veto this \nbill.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's take a quick look at what is going on in the world \ntoday. North Korea is trying to develop an ability to deliver a nuclear \nwarhead to our allies in South Korea and to other places. China is \nbuilding new islands in the western Pacific and daring America to come \ninto what they now claim is their new sea space and airspace. Russia \nhas pushed into Crimea, is consolidating its gains in the Donbass; Iran \nhas just now been given the ability to get a nuclear weapon; ISIS and \nother terrorist groups are running wild in the area that used to be \nSyria, Iraq, Yemen, and Libya. Now we have Russia coming into that same \narea in Syria and using their jets for military purposes and daring us \nto get in those skies with them.\n  In the middle of all of this, we should be having a bipartisan, \nunified front to tell the world, to tell our adversaries, to tell our \nallies, and to tell our service men and women that we are united. There \nis no Republican, there is no Democrat when it comes to the defense \npolicy of this country.\n  Instead, we are going to have a debate not about the defense policy \nof our country, but about whether we are going to fund other functions \nof government, whether we are going to fund the IRS at a high level \nthat the President wants, whether we are going to fund the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency that is attacking businesses across \nthis country. We are going to talk about all those domestic issues and \nnot talk about the defense of the country at this critical juncture.\n  If there ever was a time when we should continue that tradition of \nstanding together, it would be today. And for our President, our \nCommander in Chief, to threaten to veto this bipartisan bill is simply \nbeyond belief.\n  Now, I expect my friend from Colorado will argue that they oppose \nthis bill because we should be spending more money on nondefense \nprograms, and that is a debate worth having, but this is not the time \nfor that debate. There is nothing more important for us to do today \nthan to make sure that we are standing tall and standing unified for \nthe defense of our country, and we should never ever use the military \nas a pawn in some political game to increase controversial nondefense \nspending.\n  Today's debate should be about providing for our Nation's military \nmen and women and their families, and I hope my colleagues and the \nPresident will reconsider their objections.\n  This rule also provides for consideration of H.R. 3457, the Justice \nfor Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act.\n  A lot has been said on this floor recently about the threat and \ndangers posed to the United States and our allies by the Islamic \nRepublic of Iran. I don't want to rehash that debate, but I do think it \nis important to remember that Iran is the top state sponsor of \nterrorism on the globe.\n  Over the past 15 years, more than 80 judgments have been handed down \nagainst Iran under the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act exception for \nstate sponsors of terrorism. These judgments add up to over $43.5 \nbillion in unpaid damages. This straightforward bill would simply \nrequire Iran to pay each of these Federal court judgments before the \nPresident can lift, waive, or suspend any sanctions currently in place \nagainst Iran. Let me briefly highlight a few examples of these \njudgments.\n  In 1985, a Navy petty officer named Robert Stethem was killed during \nthe hijacking of TWA flight 847. Hezbollah, an Iran-financed terrorist \norganization, was found responsible for the hijacking and his family is \nnow owed $329 million, and that is in a Federal court judgment.\n  My friend from Colorado might be particularly interested in this one. \nThomas Sutherland, a teacher at Colorado State University for 26 years, \nwas the former dean of agriculture at the American University of \nBeirut. He was kidnapped on June 9, 1985, after Iran directed \nterrorists to kidnap Americans in Lebanon. He was held in prison until \nNovember 18, 1991. His judgment is for $323.5 million.\n\n  There is the story of Alan Beer, an American living in Israel who was \ntragically killed after the Iranian-backed terrorist organization Hamas \nblew up a bus in Jerusalem. There is a $300 million judgment against \nIran for Alan's death.\n  These are just a few stories of Americans who have been tragically \ninjured, killed, tortured, and kidnapped by Iranian-sponsored terrorist \norganizations.\n  I simply can't understand why some of my colleagues and the President \nwon't support this bill. This shouldn't be a partisan debate. American \ncourts have already ruled that Iran owes money to these individuals and \ntheir families, citizens of the United States. So why is it \ncontroversial to require that these payments are made before rewarding \nIran with billions of dollars in sanctions relief?\n  This bill is really pretty simple to me. You can either stand with \nAmerican citizens or you can stand with the Islamic Republic of Iran. \nYou can stand with the Ayatollah or the families of servicemembers who \nwere killed by Iran-backed terrorists. To me, this is an obvious \nchoice.\n  Mr. Speaker, both of these bills are more than deserving of broad, \nbipartisan support, and I hope that they receive just that. So I urge \nmy colleagues to support this rule.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for \nyielding me 30 minutes, and I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  (Mr. POLIS asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition today to this rule and \nto both of the underlying bills.\n  Both of these bills, the conference report to accompany the annual \nNational Defense Authorization Act and the so-called Justice for \nVictims of Iranian Terrorism Act, are simply partisan political \ncharades. They are not a serious effort at the lawmaking process. They \nare not a serious effort at improving our national defense, nor do they \neven attempt to solve the problems that the American people want this \nCongress to take up.\n  I would first like to acknowledge that at least these two bills are \nsomewhat related under this rule. In the past, we have had bills in \nvastly disparate areas.\n  A couple of points about these bills:\n  The National Defense Authorization bill is not a version of the bill \nthat is going anywhere. It contorts the budget\n\n[[Page H6754]]\n\nprocess in a way that doesn't make sense to anybody. It doesn't make \nsense to budget hawks or defense hawks, and it is a way that many \nMembers of the majority party don't even seem to understand.\n  Neither bill will be signed into law. The President has indicated he \nwill veto them, nor will consideration of them today here on the floor \nof the House advance national security one iota.\n  Even after knowing the budget plans on National Defense Authorization \nfor months, here we have a convoluted bill that won't make us any safer \nor financially secure. What it does is it takes the emergency account, \nthe overseas contingency operations fund, and turns it into a slush \nfund to temporarily fund all kinds of other programs. So effectively, \nit is a deficit spending bill by fudging the different pots of money \nthat we have for defense.\n  Now, I should point out this doesn't even appeal to the Pentagon or \nto the military. The Pentagon strongly dislikes this plan of using \noverseas contingency money to fund items in the base budget.\n  So the question I pose, Mr. Speaker, is, if it is not being done to \nsatisfy defense hawks and the Pentagon and it is not being done to \nsatisfy budget hawks because it is an increased spending proposal, who \nis the constituency for this and why are people even proposing this?\n  Now, it is completely fiscally irresponsible to disregard budget caps \nin a way that anybody who cares about our deficit should find \nmaddening, and it is why so many of our colleagues on the majority, \nfrom what we have heard, had to be pushed to even go along with this \nhighly flawed plan\n  As I mentioned, it doesn't make sense to the defense hawk contingency \nin this body either. The Pentagon does not like the plan. Using short-\nterm money for base funding and long-term problems makes planning and \nprocurement nearly impossible on the ground. This budget plan hurts \nnational security, and it damages our fiscal responsibility in our \ncountry.\n  Like many bills, it is simply not going anywhere. The President said \nhe opposes a version of the NDAA with this budget gimmick in it.\n  Congress, of course, needs to pass a National Defense Authorization \nbill. Unfortunately, the time that we are spending on this today gets \nus no closer.\n  Passing a National Defense Authorization Act is very important, and \nit seems like an obvious and routine thing to do; but with this \nCongress, nothing is surprising. Even routine matters are made \ninfinitely more difficult as we jump through these self-created hoops \nto appeal to whoever is yelling loudest at the time, and that seems to \nbe what we are doing today on the floor of this body is turning our \nnational defense into a political football and missing yet another \nopportunity to provide the stability that our national defense needs to \ndefend our country.\n  Now, this could have been an opportunity to address what voters want \nus to address. We could have talked about an Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force. I have heard from so many of my constituents regarding \nthat.\n  We could be talking about the fact that just yesterday Russia is \nsupposedly bombing targets in Syria in support of Assad, and we have \nbeen conducting military operations in that part of the world for over \na year without a specific Authorization for Use of Military Force.\n  We could have talked about Guantanamo Bay and how we can approach \nfinally leaving that chapter behind and closing down our extra-legal \ndetention facility there.\n  We could have debated how we can save money by right-sizing our \nmassive nuclear arsenal that would allow us to blow up the world \nseveral times over to meet our needs here in the 21st century. Perhaps \nbeing able to blow up the world once might be enough for our nuclear \narsenal, and that would save a lot of money that we could reduce the \ndeficit with.\n  Instead, this bill would have us spend billions upon billions of \ndollars, reassign money to a slush fund, blow through budget caps that \nwe put in place to reduce the deficit in support of a war we have never \ndebated, never voted on, and in support of a failed policy in \ncontinuing to fight wars that we have not approved and the military \narsenal that was meant to fight a cold war which ended decades ago.\n  This is simply a charade that does not advance our national security, \nand I urge my colleagues to reject it.\n  The other bill under consideration is another charade. It is another \nsymbol of the failure of this body to take up the issues that matter to \nthe American people. It is a bill, as we talked about in our Rules \nCommittee, that had zero hearings, no markup, no amendments, and was \nrushed to the floor for unknown reasons. This bill serves as nothing \nmore than another attempt to undermine the agreement that prevents Iran \nfrom developing nuclear weapons.\n  Now, Members on my side of the aisle were on varied sides of that \nIran agreement. Some felt that the agreement was the best way to \nprevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons. Others felt that there \nwere other ways. But nearly everybody on my side agrees that this bill \nis simply a terrible idea.\n\n                              {time}  0930\n\n  Now we are in the stage of implementing the Iran Nuclear Review Act, \nconsistent with the agreement that was reached to prevent Iran from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons. If we want to advance national security, \nlet's have a discussion about how to enforce the agreement to prevent \nIran from developing nuclear weapons.\n  If there is a problem with the compensation of victims of state \nterrorism, we should have a broad bipartisan bill that addresses that. \nIran is one of the countries, but there are certainly other sponsors of \nstate terrorism; and if there is a problem collecting court judgments, \nlet's add some teeth to that in a bipartisan proposal to do that rather \nthan attach it to sanctions that were put in place for the specific \npurpose of deterring Iran from developing nuclear weapons.\n  Congress said that was the purpose of those sanctions. They were part \nof that discussion for Iran to open themselves up to inspections and \nagree not to develop nuclear weapons. This is a separate and legitimate \nissue that there are judgments against Iran that are not being \nenforced.\n  There are probably judgments against a number of other nation-states \nthat are not being enforced. That is a perfectly fine issue and one \nthat there is no reason in the world for it to be partisan. We should \nhave a thoughtful, deliberative process with hearings and markup in \ncommittee with the opportunity to take good ideas from both sides and \nsimply address that problem to make sure that we add some teeth to the \nability to make sure that payments are made to victims of terrorism, a \nconcept that this bill wouldn't even come close to accomplishing.\n  This bill adds no teeth to making sure that terrorist victims \nactually get their money. It merely tries to reinstate sanctions that \nare tied to the development of Iran's nuclear problem. It makes it no \nmore likely that a single victim of terrorism will ever see any kind of \nrestitution.\n  Now, if we are serious about national defense, what in the world have \nwe been doing the last few days? Because of this body's inaction in \nmaintaining government funding, you know what the Pentagon has been \ndoing the last few days? They have been focused on planning for a \nshutdown, because we were just hours away from a shutdown when finally \nthis body figured out how to continue funding national defense. We \nshould have done that weeks ago.\n  Why did we put the Pentagon through the exercise these last few days \nof figuring out who had to go home and what missions had to be \ngrounded? Do you think ISIS or Moscow or the Assad regime spent \nyesterday wondering if they would have the money when they showed up \nfor work today? Well, that is what this Congress has done to our \nmilitary and risks doing again in December when we face another \ngovernment shutdown. We might as well be telling our generals: ``Okay, \nkeep doing what you are doing, but don't make any plans to combat ISIS \non December 12.''\n  Well done, Congress. I am sure America and the rest of the world is \nimpressed with your work.\n  It is completely incongruous to be discussing a budget trick for \ndefense authorization just a day after we risked closing down many \nparts of our\n\n[[Page H6755]]\n\nmilitary. Just yesterday, 151 Republicans voted to shut down the \nPentagon and the military. They voted to shut down the Department of \nHomeland Security. They voted to shut down the State Department just \nbecause they couldn't get their way on an unrelated healthcare \nprovision for low-income women. Now, suddenly, the Republicans support \nnational security? I don't think so.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule and both of the underlying \nbills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The gentleman from Colorado made some interesting points. He said \nthis is not serious, that the President is going to veto it. If we go \nback over the vote total in the Senate, this bill was passed in the \nSenate by a veto-proof majority. It passed in this House by a near \nveto-proof majority. If a couple more people from the other side will \njoin with us, we can override that veto, and we would stand united \nbehind our servicemen and -women. So it is, indeed, serious. If the \nPresident were serious, he wouldn't be threatening a veto. He would \nunderstand the importance at this point in time for the Congress and \nthe President to stand together across party lines.\n  We also heard about what is happening in Syria. I am a member of the \nHouse Armed Services Committee. I served on the conference committee \nthat brought this report to us. Let me assure you, Mr. Speaker, this \nbill contains things that are critical to what we are doing in Syria.\n  He talked about Guantanamo Bay. One of the main items that I was \nappointed to the conference committee for was for the provision that \nregards Guantanamo Bay and what we are going to do and not do with the \nprisoners there. He talked about the military's view of this. I have \ntalked to dozens of generals and admirals about this very issue, and \nthey would like for us to find a different way, but they understand and \nagree that this way gets us where we need to go. What is important to \nthem is really not which way we get there but the fact that we get \nthere. This gets us there.\n  He talks about the fact that there is a failed policy here. There is \na failed policy here. It is a failed policy of this administration in \nthe Middle East. If we had done what we should have done in the Middle \nEast, we wouldn't have Iran nuclearized. We wouldn't have Russia there \nflying sorties with their jets and daring the United States. The \nfailure of policy here is the failure of the policy of the President of \nthe United States.\n  The House Armed Services Committee, the Senate Armed Services \nCommittee, Democrats and Republicans from both sides here have tried to \nwork together to give the President the authorization he needed to do \nthe right thing, to make sure we don't have the instability we have \ntoday in the Middle East. Instead, we have seen a President that seems \nto be inert, doing nothing. Russia comes in, makes this big play. What \nis the President doing? Nothing.\n  We were asked this time last year to authorize the training of \ncertain Syrian troops to combat ISIS. Well, they trained 50-some-odd. \nWe have about six left. After all that, a year, all this time, all this \nmoney, that is what the failed policy is. The whole idea was not going \nto work, but we gave him the authorization because we are trying to \nstand behind our President. We are trying to push him to do the right \nthing. Still, nothing happens, except he threatens to veto this bill.\n  If he wants to be the Commander in Chief that we need, he needs to \nstand with us. He needs to stand with the Congress. We need to stand \ntogether as Republicans and Democrats--we support our men and women in \nuniform--and do what needs to be done.\n  Now, my friend from Colorado referenced the Iran bill and called it a \ncharade. Let me assure him, this is not a charade to the people who \nhave these judgments. To the people who are victims or the families of \nvictims, this is far from a charade. This will get them real \ncompensation.\n  He says that there are no teeth here. Well, guess what. The sanctions \ndon't get lifted unless Iran pays this money. I call that real teeth, \nbecause Iran wants that money more than anything else in the world \nright now because, with that money, they will go out and fund terrorism \nthroughout the Middle East.\n\n  What we will do here is not only get money to American people who \nhave been victimized, but we will deny that money to Iran that will use \nit to fund Hamas and Hezbollah and the Houthis in Yemen. That is what \nthis is all about. This is dead serious. This is as serious as you can \npossibly get. I wish my colleagues on the other side of the aisle would \ncome together with us so we can do right by the American military and \nthe men and women that wear our uniform and do right by American \ncitizens who have been victimized by the largest sponsor of state \nterrorism.\n  I have said this before, and I am going to say it again, that Iran \nbill is real clear. You stand with the Ayatollah or you stand with the \nUnited States citizens. It is one or the other. If you stand with the \nAyatollah, you stand with the Ayatollah. I am going to stand with the \ncitizens of the United States that have these judgments. They deserve \nto be paid.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will \noffer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that would \nprotect jobs in America to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of my \namendment in the Record along with extraneous material immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Kildee) to discuss our proposal to save \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join with me in \ndefeating the previous question so that this body can immediately take \nup reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank and, in fact, immediately \ntake up legislation offered by Mr. Fincher, a Republican who, like many \nRepublicans in this House and every Democrat, supports the \nreauthorization of an institution that has been reauthorized by this \nbody for eight decades, routinely, that is essential to supporting \nsmall American manufacturers that I represent back home in Michigan.\n  During the recess, I spent some time with my local manufacturers. I \ndid a couple manufacturing roundtables; one in Flint, my hometown, and \none up in the Tri-Cities. These are small manufacturers. They are not \nbig companies. No one would recognize their names. They are small \nmanufacturers that have found that they have products that the world \nwants, but they didn't feel comfortable entering into that kind of \nglobal trade without some help, without some support, without their own \ngovernment standing behind them where they can. That was what the \nExport-Import Bank provided for them. They told me, without exception, \nthat the failure of this Congress to reauthorize the Export-Import Bank \nputs that kind of trade in jeopardy, puts the company itself in \njeopardy, and puts the workers who build great American products that \nwe can sell to the world in a position of some jeopardy as well.\n  We don't agree on a lot of things in this body, and that is the way \nit is supposed to be; but when we do agree, the American people expect \nus to do something about it. We agree in this body on the Export-Import \nBank, Democrats and Republicans. Why can't we see a bill come to the \nfloor to simply reauthorize something that is essential to supporting \nAmerican manufacturers, supporting American exports, supporting \nAmerican workers?\n  Sadly, almost ironically, there are more Republicans in this Congress \nthat support the Export-Import Bank than supported keeping the \ngovernment open itself. You would think--you would think--that somehow \nwe would figure out a way.\n  There is all this talk of bipartisanship. It is just a word unless we \ndo something about it. It doesn't mean anything unless it translates to \nsomething that helps the American worker. Here is a chance to do that. \nWe should bring up the Export-Import Bank reauthorization, a Republican \nbill, which I\n\n[[Page H6756]]\n\nwill vote for, and we should do it today.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I just observed that the gentleman from \nMichigan talked about something that had nothing to do with the defense \nof this country or getting these judgments paid for American citizens \nwho were victims at the hands of Iran. What he is talking about may be \nimportant at a time down the road, but it is not relevant to what we \nare talking about today.\n  The bipartisanship we need today is to stand up for the American \npeople and defend the American people and to provide for our servicemen \nand -women, to make the victims of Iranian tyranny, make them whole. \nLet's get together and be bipartisan about that, and maybe there will \nbe more opportunities to be bipartisan about these other issues. Let's \nnot confuse what is on the floor today with what people want to talk \nabout down the road. Let's have a bipartisan majority, a big bipartisan \nmajority, a veto-proof majority, pass both of these bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Just to be clear, what we are offering as a previous question, if we \nwin the previous question vote, this bill will then be amended and sent \nback to include a reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank, so the \nDemocrats are choosing to focus on protecting American jobs rather than \npartisan games.\n  Unfortunately, I wish either of these two bills under this rule had \nsomething to do with national defense. They don't. One of them diverts \nmoney from the overseas contingency fund to a slush fund, which the \nmilitary says will weaken their ability to prepare for conflict around \nthe world. The other one is another attempt to undermine a deal that \nprevents Iran from developing nuclear weapons and won't lead to \nAmerican victims seeing money.\n  If they were serious about making sure American victims were \ncompensated, we would be talking about putting teeth in the ability of \nAmerican courts to impound assets and make sure that judgments are paid \nfor victims of state terrorism. Why, instead, are we seeing a deal that \nrelates only to one particular sponsor of state terrorism and deals \nwith a set of tariffs that were put in place to prevent them from \ndeveloping nuclear weapons? The tariffs that are in place with regard \nto Iranian sponsorship of state terrorism are still in place and \nweren't even on the table during the discussions around the nuclear \nagreement.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Washington (Mr. \nHeck), who wants to discuss our amendment that will protect and save \nAmerican jobs.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Mr. Speaker, one of the previous speakers, \nthe gentleman and my friend from Alabama, said today is not the time, \nit is not now. I want to remind him that in my effort here to defeat \nthe previous question so that we may take up reauthorization of the \nExport-Import Bank, the charter for the Bank expired 3 months ago \nyesterday. You are right, the time isn't now; it was 3 months ago. The \nfact is, in the ensuing 90 days, there has begun a drumbeat of job \nloss, concrete and measurable. It is real.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  But I want to start over. Today is the first day of the new fiscal \nyear for the Federal Government. We can all give at least some thanks \nthat we avoided a government shutdown. So let's take a fresh start to \nthis thing. Take a step back.\n  The truth is, when I am home in the district talking with people, an \namazing number have a consciousness, an awareness, about the \ntermination of the charter of the Export-Import Bank and its impact. \nThe most frequently asked question I get is, ``How can anybody do \nthat?''\n  How can anybody do away with an institution that, as my friend, the \ngentleman from Michigan, Congressman Kildee, so eloquently said, has in \n81 years been almost unanimously reauthorized 16 times by 13 different \nPresidents and has a track record of reducing the deficit and creating \njobs? How can anybody do that?\n  That is a very challenging question for me to answer. Adherence to \nideological purity is just not something somebody can compete with when \nit stands up against the real-life job loss that we have begun to \nexperience.\n  So, in my effort--which I just digressed from--of taking a fresh \nstart, I want to say that this Chamber will take up later today the \nNational Defense Authorization Act. It is not unrelated to our effort \nto reauthorize the Export-Import Bank.\n  Some people actually support what we call the NDAA because it creates \njobs. I frankly don't think that that is a good reason to support the \nNDAA. One should support or oppose it because of how it reinforces us \nand helps us fulfill our national security objectives and goals and \nmissions. That is why you support or don't support the NDAA. But some \npeople do support it because of the jobs it helps create.\n  Well, the truth of the matter is, as we have said so often, the \nExport-Import Bank also creates jobs. In fact, for the last year for \nwhich we have data, it supported 164,000 jobs.\n  We have an existential threat to those jobs. The fact is, as you all \nhave heard, both General Electric and The Boeing Company have announced \nlayoffs directly attributable to the demise of the Export-Import Bank. \nPeople are not concluding negotiations for foreign sales as a \nconsequence of us not having that arrow in our quiver.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. Because the fact of the matter is the Chinese \nare developing a wide-body aircraft to compete in the international \nmarket, code name C919. They think it will be online in 2 years. I \nthink it is more like 10 years.\n  They will take business away from us. When they do, they will take \njobs away from us. And I remind you that China has not one, but four, \nexport credit authorities.\n  It is also a relevant issue to the subject we take up later today--\nthe NDAA--because the truth of the matter is the Export-Import Bank \nhelps protect the homeland very directly.\n  There is a lot of talk about rebalancing the Pacific and Asia and the \npivot. But the fact of the matter is, in order for us to compete with \nChina, we have to retain the heart of our manufacturing base.\n  And, frankly, the production of aircraft, in the aggregate, \nconstitutes the largest concentration of engineers and manufacturing \ncapacity within that base.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HECK of Washington. This is vital to our national security. \nImagine a world 20, 30, 40 years from now in which The Boeing Company \nno longer exists. I don't want to imagine that future, but think of \nwhat it would it would do to our national security circumstance. It \nwould be devastating to our national security. And we are ceding this \nterritory. We are literally ceding this territory.\n  The irony of this debate and why, again, I find it so challenging to \nanswer the question of why would anybody do this is, truly, if we had \nnever had an Export-Import Bank, we would all be sitting around asking \nourselves, ``How do we compete with those other countries, all of whom \nhave export credit authorities?''\n  We would be devising and standing up an Export-Import Bank and we \nwould say, ``What do we want that to look like?'' First of all, we want \nit to support American jobs. Secondly, we would say we want it to \nprotect American taxpayers and not have them on the hook. Well, guess \nwhat, my friends. We already have--or had--that institution.\n  The Export-Import Bank in the last generation has transferred \nbillions of dollars to the Treasury and reduced the deficit. The \nExport-Import Bank has helped create and support millions of jobs.\n  If you want to compete in the global economy, you need an export \ncredit authority that creates jobs. Please defeat the previous question \nand take up the issue of reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate the words of my good friend from the State of \nWashington,\n\n[[Page H6757]]\n\nmy co-chair for the Singapore Caucus. I know that he feels those words \ndeeply. I agree with him that manufacturing is very important to this \ncountry.\n  Manufacturing aircraft is very important to my district. We just \nopened up 3 weeks ago an Airbus facility that will make competing \naircraft against Boeing. It is good for America to have competition. So \nI certainly agree with him about that.\n  It has nothing to do with these two bills. We are here today again, \namazingly, talking about the most important thing we do in our \ngovernment, and we get off on a side issue. It is a side issue today. \nIt may be a big issue tomorrow. But today we are here to talk about \nthese two bills.\n  My friend from Colorado for the second time has referred to the \noverseas contingency fund as a slush fund. The President of the United \nStates, President Obama, has asked for that fund every year that he has \nbeen President, and we, the Congress, have given him that fund every \nyear that he has been President.\n  I don't think when the President asked for it or when the Congress \ngave it to him either side thought we were giving a slush fund. It has \nbeen used to protect the people of the United States. Everyone has \nagreed on that. It only became a slush fund when they didn't want it to \nbe used for a particular purpose. It is not a slush fund.\n  The purposes for which it will be used are spelled out in detail in \nthe National Defense Authorization Act, an act, as I said, we have gone \nthrough in both Houses, through committees and floor debate and this \nvery lengthy process of trying to get to this conference report. This \nis not a slush fund. This is something that is necessary to defending \nthe country.\n  So I hope, instead of using terms like that, which, quite frankly, \ndoes not reflect very well on President Obama, who asked for it, I \nthink we should use other terms.\n  And let's get back to the heart of this argument: Are we going to \nstand together for the defense of this country or are we not? Are we \ngoing to stand with Ayatollah or are we going to stand with the people \nwho have been harmed by the Ayatollah.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  We haven't even passed an Authorization for Use of Military Force to \nestablish the legal way for who we are supposed to be fighting against. \nWe are still operating under the post-9/11 Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force that names al Qaeda. But if you talk to most military \nexperts, al Qaeda is not the preeminent threat today.\n  There are a lot of threats in the world, including ISIS, including \nthreats in the Syrian civil war, including threats of the resurgence of \nthe Taliban in Afghanistan, and this body needs to take up an \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force to ensure that funds that we \nappropriate for defense are used in a way that Congress is aware of and \nhas oversight of.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Let me thank my good friend from Colorado for \nmanaging this bill.\n  Let me also thank the majority manager as well for coming to the \nfloor and doing the people's bidding.\n  Although we disagree in both the purpose of the underlying bill and \nits effectiveness, there is no doubt that this bill has a good cause. \nNone of us take a backseat to protecting the American people, to \nseeking compensation, to bringing those who are missing or those who \nhave been captured on false terms back home to American soil. And I \nstand here to make that commitment.\n  As well, I recognize that we are going down the trail, Mr. Speaker, \nthat we have done for the Affordable Care Act, one more attempt to \nundermine a legitimately debated initiative--the Iran nonnuclear \nproliferation--where Members made a conscious decision, personal \ndecision, on reflecting on the best direction for the American people.\n  In both the Senate and the procedures set out for this Congress to \ndetermine whether this bill, this initiative, will be turned back, it \ndid not work. So it is the law of the land. It is an effort to ensure \npeace, to reconcile in the area, to stop the proliferation of nuclear \nweapons by Iran. It does not in any way diminish the United States' \nstance on Iran's terrorist activities. It does none of that.\n  But this legislation, under the pretense of not allowing the \nsanctions to be relieved, has a very key component and a number of \nmeasures in that initiative. It has a number of measures, another \nroadblock, before those sanctions will be removed. It is under the \npretense of dealing with the individuals who we all want to be brought \nhome.\n  I don't know how this Congress does not know of the negotiations and \nthe engagement that is going on, but they know that this is legislation \nthat will be vetoed by the President.\n  I say this in the backdrop of the Madison Papers, No. 51, that says, \n``Justice is the end of government.'' It means that we on this floor \nmust do things that really get us in the direction of justice, the end \nresult for the American people.\n  The reason why I am so disappointed is I listened to my two \ncolleagues speak eloquently about the Export-Import Bank. I can tell \nthem that I was in Africa with the President, and an American stood up \nand pleaded that he was going to lose 400 jobs if we could not get that \nExport-Import Bank. I hesitate to think that his contract and his \nengagement--what we asked him to do--has collapsed.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me repeat again, ``Justice is the end of \ngovernment.'' So here we are on a bill that is going to be a copycat of \nwhat we are doing with the Affordable Care Act.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I am so disappointed, Mr. Speaker, because here I am \non the floor discussing justice and we have yet another disappointing \nrepresentation of this Congress when a leader of the Congress can speak \nand say that the Benghazi Committee is only a farce, it was only used \nto besmirch a public servant.\n  That is not what Madison wanted for this Nation. They didn't want us \nto stop the economic engine for the Export-Import Bank. They didn't \nwant us to over and over attack the Affordable Care Act that has been \npassed and upheld by the Supreme Court. They didn't want us to pass a \nbill like the underlying deal blocking the Iran sanctions process of \nthe bill that we passed to stop nuclear proliferation.\n  They didn't want us to do that, Mr. Speaker. They wanted us to have \njustice established, and they wanted us to do what is right for the \nAmerican people.\n  I ask for a vote against the rule and the underlying bill. Justice \nshould be the end of government, not what we are doing here today.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just note that the gentlewoman from Texas talked \nabout justice. One of the bills that is in this rule is the Justice for \nVictims of Iranian Terrorism Act.\n  It is about justice for the victims and for the families, victims of \nstate-sponsored terrorism by Iran. This doesn't undo the Iranian deal. \nIf Iran pays the judgments, the deal goes forward. That is the law.\n  So I would disagree with the gentlewoman with regard to the whole \nconcept of justice. This rule contains a bill that is directly about \njustice.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  It is remarkable the gentleman from Alabama hasn't been able to find \nany other Republicans to support these bills and come down and help him \nargue. I think that that speaks volumes about how these bills are \nsimply not consistent with promoting our national defense and are \nfiscally irresponsible. They don't please the defense hawks or the \nbudget hawks. So my poor colleague, Mr. Byrne, is left alone to fend \nfor himself.\n  Here we are, trying to use the contingency funding as base funding \nand use it to somehow form the base from which our military must fund \nits everyday operations. The commanders and generals all agree this is \na bad idea, and the gentleman from Alabama has even acknowledged that.\n  Here we are, discussing a bill that won't result in any of the \nvictims of\n\n[[Page H6758]]\n\nstate-sponsored terrorism actually seeing their settlement, when there \nis another path and we certainly could have a deliberative process \naround a bill that empowers the impoundment and collection of assets \nfrom state sponsors of terrorism States here in our country to ensure \nthat victims see their judgments.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  What this bill does is it ties it to an unrelated set of sanctions \nthat were put in place to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons \nto settlement of these claims when, actually, we should be giving our \ncourts, or if we are concerned about this issue with regard to \nsettlements against sponsors of state terrorism, we should give courts \nthe increased ability to make sure that they can see that restitution \nand impound assets from sponsors of state terrorism.\n  Now, Democrats have come down and offered something, if we defeat the \nprevious question, that actually will improve our national defense. It \nwill ensure that we have a strong aerospace industry here in our \ncountry.\n  The gentleman from Alabama has mentioned that Airbus is in his \ndistrict. Well, Airbus is a company that will do very well if we fail \nto authorize the Export-Import Bank because it will put American \ncompetitors like Boeing and Lockheed at a significant disadvantage.\n  Now, I hope that we are fighting to ensure that America maintains its \naerospace capacity and leadership and we don't cede all of that to \nEuropean companies like Airbus that are welcome to compete on a level \nplaying field. It is critical for our national security that we have \nthe ability to lead the world as we have in the aerospace industry.\n  I also want to bring up that we should be discussing an Authorization \nfor Use of Military Force. The National Defense Authorization Act does \ncontain some parameters about how money is used, but it is not a \nsubstitute for an Authorization for Use of Military Force, and we \nshould be having that debate.\n  Who are we even fighting? Who are we even fighting? I don't think \nthat most people believe that it is still al Qaeda from the post-9/11 \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force.\n  Now, I don't know what to call what we are doing in Iraq and Syria. \nMaybe it is a war. Maybe it is a security operation. Maybe it is \noccasional support to some Syrian rebels or support to the Iraqi \nGovernment or on-and-off commitment to the Kurds. But whatever it is, I \ndon't think it is what Congress voted for in 2001 or 2003, before I was \nhere, before Mr. Byrne was here, before the vast majority of this body \nthat currently serves was even here.\n  Those authorizations should be in the history books, not being \ninvoked as legal justification for conducting operations in a world, in \n2015, which is vastly different than the world of 2001 and 2003. And \nwho knows how much longer or how many different wars or security \noperations will continue to be administered if Congress doesn't finally \nspecify and do our job with regard to an Authorization for Use of \nMilitary Force.\n  Now, that is a hard debate. It is a hard issue. It is not a partisan \ndebate. There are Democrats and Republicans on all sides; and many \nMembers, when we have that debate, will make sure that we have the very \nbest information to act on.\n  But since we authorized military force against al Qaeda and \n``affiliated'' groups in 2001, there have been over 300 new Members of \nCongress elected, so the vast majority of this body, including myself \nand Mr. Byrne, including Mr. Heck, including Mr. Kildee--I believe, of \nall of us. I believe Ms. Jackson Lee was the only one who was actually \nhere when we even had that discussion. The rest of us talking about \ndefense and NDAA didn't even play any role in choosing what the target \nand what our focus of our national security operations are.\n  The American people deserve and demand this debate. They don't want \nyet another fight with Congresspeople playing budget tricks around \ndefense. They want to know what our Nation's plan is for the operations \nthat have been ongoing. They want to see Congress take its \nconstitutional responsibilities for actions in the world.\n  And whether any one of us ultimately votes in favor or against an \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force, we all, I hope, are for the \ndebate, and we should join in demanding one.\n  On the conference report, Madam Speaker, this plan will not work, \nwill not become law. The President will veto it. The generals oppose \nit. The budget hawks oppose it. No one even came down to join Mr. Byrne \nin arguing for it. It is a terrible plan. It will hurt our national \ndefense. We need to defeat it.\n  The Iran bill tries to get at a legitimate issue in completely the \nwrong way. It is not a partisan issue that we want to see restitution \nfor victims of state terrorism. Let's get into that act and look at the \nenforcement mechanisms rather than try to use these victims as yet \nanother attempt to go after the deal that prevents Iran from developing \nnuclear weapons.\n  I think it is clear from our Rules Committee debate that everyone \nsupports efforts for American victims of terrorism to pursue \ncompensation. The Iran nuclear agreement has nothing to do with that, \nand it certainly doesn't prevent that from happening.\n  No matter what country, whether it is Iran or other sponsors of state \nterrorism, we all remain committed to this process of seeing justice. \nUndermining the ability to enforce a nuclear agreement is not the \nproper way or even a relevant way to achieve this goal.\n  The reauthorization of the Export-Import Bank is ready to go. If we \ndefeat the previous question, we will bring it to the floor. We have \nthe votes in the House. I hope my colleague, Mr. Byrne from Alabama, \nwill join us in that vote if we can defeat the previous question. We \nhave the votes in the Senate, the President. We can stop this \nunnecessary loss of jobs every single day in districts across our \ncountry solely due to our inability to act.\n  Hopefully, we can move to take up highway authorization, ESEA, \nimmigration reform, raising the minimum wage. These are some of the \nissues that I hear from my constituents about every day that we need to \nact on. So rather than waste time, waste money, hurt our national \ndefense, let's get to work and accomplish something.\n  I urge my colleagues to defeat the previous question and defeat the \nrule.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I appreciate Mr. Polis being concerned that I am here by myself. I \nthink it has been a good debate, and I know I have the full support of \nmy colleagues behind me, and there will be a number of them here to \ndebate the bill when it comes up after we adopt this rule.\n  It is extremely important that we understand what we are about in \nthese two bills. It is not about the Export-Import Bank. It is not \nabout immigration. It is not about any of the other issues that he \nbrought up. It is about defending the American people and making \nvictims of Iran terrorism whole. That is what it is about.\n  Now, I have seen the public opinion polls on national security. \nNational security has rocketed up to be the number one issue for the \npeople of America. I didn't need to see those polls. I have done 18 \ntownhall meetings in the last several weeks in my district, and I have \nlooked my constituents in the eyes and heard their concerns.\n  They don't bring up the Export-Import Bank to me. They bring up the \nfact that they are worried about what is happening to our country's \nstanding abroad. They are worried about what is going on with these \nbrutal terrorists in the Middle East. They are worried about the fact \nthat we have just given Iran a nuclear weapon. They are worried about \nwhether we are going to have an adequate defense to continue to protect \nthem, as we have for decades now, in a bipartisan fashion. That is what \nthey are worried about, and that is what they expect us to come here \nand do something about.\n  These two bills do something very important. The National Defense \nAuthorization Act, for 53 years, has been passed in a bipartisan \nfashion, which has said to the world, which has said to our allies, \nwhich has said to our enemies, which has said to the men and women in \nuniform in the United States of America, we stand as one.\n  Now this President and some--not all of my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle--some of my colleagues on\n\n[[Page H6759]]\n\nthe other side of the aisle are going to break that, after five \ndecades, at this critical time. I find that hard to believe, but I \naccept the fact that it is nonetheless true.\n  I would plead with them to reconsider that. I would plead with the \nPresident, who is our Commander in Chief, not to veto this bill. This \nis critically important at a critically important time.\n  On the Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act, you know, we \ndon't get very many opportunities where we in this body can do \nsomething that will directly bring some measure of compensation to \npeople, citizens of the United States, who have been victimized by the \nlargest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. We don't get very many \nopportunities like that, and we have it right now this with this bill. \nWe have the opportunity to make them whole, or come close to making \nthem whole.\n  They have got judgments from courts, valid judgments; and with the \npassage of this bill, which should truly be a bipartisan thing, and if \nthe President signs it, with passage of this bill, we could give it to \nthem. What a wonderful thing we could give to them after all the \nsuffering they have been through. We would deny them that because we \nwant to stand with the Ayatollah, because we think Iran is more \nimportant than they are?\n  If we think for one second that Iran is going to take this money that \nis going to be released and use it for good and peaceful purposes, we \nare excessively naive. They are going to take this money, based upon \nwhat they have done in the past and what they are doing today, and they \nwill use it to fund Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthis, and other terrorist \ngroups around the Middle East and perhaps around the world not just \nagainst other people outside the United States, against people in the \nUnited States. So by passing that bill, we deny them tens of billions \nof dollars. They won't be able to use it for that.\n  I wish that, for once, we could come into this room, on something of \nthis magnitude and stand shoulder to shoulder, not as Democrats, not as \nRepublicans, but as Americans, which we have done for decades. It \nsaddens me that the President and some of the members of his own party \nin this House would not do that.\n  So I beg my colleagues on the other side of the aisle to reconsider, \nand I beg the President of the United States to reconsider. There has \nnever been a more important time for us to stand together for the \ndefense of this country and for the men and women in uniform.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n      An Amendment to H. Res. 449 Offered by Mr. Polis of Colorado\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 4. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     3611) to reauthorize and reform the Export-Import Bank of the \n     United States, and for other purposes. The first reading of \n     the bill shall be dispensed with. All points of order against \n     consideration of the bill are waived. General debate shall be \n     confined to the bill and shall not exceed one hour equally \n     divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Financial Services. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 5. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 3611.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen). The question is on \nordering the previous question.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Madam Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption of the resolution.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 237, \nnays 180, not voting 17, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 529]\n\n                               YEAS--237\n\n     Abraham\n     Aderholt\n

Madam Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 449, I call up \nthe bill (H.R. 3457) to prohibit the lifting of sanctions on Iran until \nthe Government of Iran pays the judgments against it for acts of \nterrorism, and for other purposes, and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 449, the \namendment in the nature of a substitute printed in House Report 114-\n273, is adopted and the bill, as amended, is considered read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3457\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Justice for Victims of \n     Iranian Terrorism Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. PROHIBITION ON LIFTING OF SANCTIONS ON IRAN PENDING \n                   PAYMENT OF CERTAIN JUDGMENTS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Notwithstanding any other provision of \n     law, the President may not take any of the actions described \n     in subsection (b) until the President has certified to the \n     Congress that the Government of Iran has paid each judgment \n     against Iran that is described in subsection (c).\n       (b) Actions Described.--\n       (1) In general.--The actions described in this subsection \n     are the following:\n       (A) To waive, suspend, reduce, provide relief from, or \n     otherwise limit the application of sanctions described in \n     paragraph (2) or refrain from applying any such sanctions.\n       (B) To remove a foreign person listed in Attachment 3 or \n     Attachment 4 to Annex II of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of \n     Action from the list of specially designated nationals and \n     blocked persons maintained by the Office of Foreign Asset \n     Control of the Department of the Treasury.\n       (2) Sanctions described.--The sanctions described in this \n     paragraph are--\n       (A) the sanctions described in sections 4 through 7.9 of \n     Annex II of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action; and\n       (B) the sanctions described in any other agreement related \n     to the nuclear program of Iran that includes the United \n     States, commits the United States to take action, or pursuant \n     to which the United States commits or otherwise agrees to \n     take action, regardless of the form it takes, whether a \n     political commitment or otherwise, and regardless of whether \n     it is legally binding or not.\n       (c) Judgments.--A judgment is a judgment described in this \n     subsection if it is a final judgment entered by the courts of \n     the United States or of the States--\n       (1) that relates to a claim--\n       (A) that was brought against Iran or its political \n     subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities (regardless of \n     whether the claim was also brought, or the resulting judgment \n     was also entered, against another defendant); and\n       (B) for which the court determined that Iran (or its \n     political subdivisions, agencies, or instrumentalities, as \n     the case may be) was not immune from the jurisdiction of the \n     courts of the United States or of the States under section \n     1605A, or section 1605(a)(7) (as such section was in effect \n     on January 27, 2008), of title 28, United States Code; and\n       (2) that was entered during the period beginning on April \n     24, 1996, and ending on the date of the enactment of this \n     Act.\n       (d) Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action Described.--In this \n     section, the term ``Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action'' \n     means the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action, agreed to at \n     Vienna on July 14, 2015, by Iran and by the People's Republic \n     of China, France, Germany, the Russian Federation, the United \n     Kingdom and the United States, with the High Representative \n     of the European Union for Foreign Affairs and Security \n     Policy, and all implementing materials and agreements related \n     to the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California (Mr. Royce) \nand the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \nsubmit extraneous materials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Madam Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of this bill. This is the Justice for \nVictims of Iranian Terrorism Act.\n  I appreciate the work of the bill's author, Mr. Meehan of \nPennsylvania. He has worked very hard on this. There are about 100 \ncosponsors in this House.\n  On the Foreign Affairs Committee, we have made Iran the central focus \nof our work. As a matter of fact, we have had over 30 hearings and \nbriefings so far on Iran and on the dangerous nuclear agreement that \nwas struck with this state sponsor of terrorism.\n  Madam Speaker, since coming to power in the late 1970s--well, 1979--\nthe Iranian regime has funded terrorist groups such as Hezbollah and \nHamas and directed their operations.\n  Now, the way they do that is they have a special force. It is called \nthe Quds Force. It is headed up by General Soleimani. He is in charge \nof assassinations outside the country, assassinations of U.S. targets, \nby the way, besides other targets.\n  Recently you will have heard of General Soleimani because--by the \nway, European sanctions are going to be lifted on him under this \nagreement, but you will have read or heard that he traveled--he \ntraveled--to Moscow to meet with Putin. As a result of those meetings, \nyou will notice the discussions about weapons coming from Russia into \nSyria into the hands of the Quds Forces.\n  So we look at what he has done and what U.S. courts have done as a \nresult. There have been 80 separate attacks on U.S. installations and \nU.S. individuals. We remember the 1983 bombing of the U.S. marine \nbarracks in Beirut, the 1996 bombing of the Khobar Towers in Saudi \nArabia. Those two attacks killed 260 American servicemen and left their \nwidows and left children to be raised by one parent.\n  There are judgments that have been rendered that direct payment from \nIran to these families, to the victims' families. Unfortunately, under \nthe Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act, even though this reward has been \ngiven, even though U.S. victims of state-sponsored terrorism got their \nday in court, and even though they have brought the suits in U.S. \ncourts and had the right to collect these damages, Iran has not as of \nyet paid.\n  U.S. courts have held Iran liable for the attacks carried out by its \nterrorist proxies when those attacks were orchestrated and paid for by \nthe Iranian regime. The judgments that remain outstanding are $43.5 \nbillion in unpaid damages for those 80 cases over the last decade and a \nhalf.\n  In one case, $9 billion was awarded to the victims of the bombing of \nthe marine barracks in 1983. Again, the Government of Iran was found \nresponsible through lawful proceedings in a U.S. court. That judgment \nremains unpaid.\n  Madam Speaker, the Obama administration during its negotiations with \nIran did not seek for Iran to compensate the families of those whose\n\n[[Page H6762]]\n\nlives were taken by Iranian terrorism despite these U.S. court \njudgments. That is very much in contrast with our past procedure.\n  In the case of Libya, for example, a decade ago, when we reached that \nagreement with Libya, the U.S. secured the right or the demand that the \nQadhafi regime compensate the victims of the attacks, such as the \nbombing of Pan Am 103 over Lockerbie, Scotland. That was $2.5 billion. \nThat was done. That is our procedure.\n  Iran will soon obtain $100 billion, approximately, in unfrozen assets \nas well as immeasurable economic and financial benefits by escaping the \nsanctions regime and reintegrating into the global economy. Iran will \nget sanctions lifted and American victims will still be out in the \ncold. That is not right.\n  This legislation would address that injustice. It is straightforward. \nIt would say that, of the $100 billion and some in sanctions relief, \nthose judgments will be paid out of that. That $43 billion will be paid \nto the survivors of those families of those 80 attacks orchestrated, \npaid for, by Iran.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                  Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n                               Washington, DC, September 30, 2015.\n     Hon.

Royce,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in opposition to the bill.\n  Let me start by acknowledging my friend, Chairman Royce. The \nCommittee on Foreign Affairs is the most bipartisan committee in \nCongress. We are collaborative, we are productive, and we have built a \nrecord advancing bipartisan legislation that promotes American \ninterests abroad and keeps the American people safe. I want to state \nthat Chairman Royce's leadership is to thank for much of our \ncommittee's good work.\n  So I am disappointed that the House Republican leadership decided to \nignore regular order on this bill. They have rushed it to the floor \nwithout any consideration by the Foreign Affairs Committee. As has been \npointed out, we have had 30 hearings. We know a little bit about Iran \non the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  So rushing it to the floor without any consideration by the Foreign \nAffairs Committee is wrong. I think it is a shame. Because I think, \nleft to our own volition, we could have sent forward a bill that could \nmake a difference for the victims of Iranian-sponsored terrorism. \nIranian-sponsored terrorism is there, it is palpable, and we should do \nsomething to try to help the victims.\n  But this bill, on the other hand, would not do that. Let me explain \nwhy. American courts have awarded roughly $46 billion to about 1,300 \nvictims and their families. We all want justice for these families. We \nall want to hold Iran accountable for its act of terrorism against \nAmericans. Iran should pay these claims. But this bill does nothing for \nthe victims of Iranian terror.\n  Here is the problem. Let's assume for argument that Iran's leaders \ndid change course and decide to pay the claims. This bill would \nactually make it more difficult for Iran to pay these judgments.\n  Iran owes American claimants $46 billion, but Iran has access to $20 \nbillion of its cash reserves, not $46 billion. The rest--$95 billion--\nis frozen in bank accounts in Europe and Asia.\n  On top of that, Iran's oil revenues are frozen. When Iran sells oil, \nthe payments are kept frozen under the threat of American sanctions, \nwhich I support. Iran can access these funds only for certain purposes. \nPaying court judgments is not one of them. Current U.S. sanctions don't \nallow it.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  And under this bill, all U.S. sanctions are kept in effect, \nabsolutely no changes allowed, until Iran pays the full $46 billion.\n  So where would Iran get the money to pay the American claims?\n  The bill says: Iran, pay the claims, but you can't have any of the \nfunds to pay them. So it is a catch-22. And who does it hurt? Not Iran. \nIt hurts the victims. Not a single claim would be paid under this bill. \nSo, in my opinion, this bill offers nothing but false hope.\n  Now, I have heard some Members say, well, we can pay the claims by\n\n[[Page H6763]]\n\nseizing Iran's frozen assets, but that is really not the case. \nVirtually all of Iran's funds frozen under our sanctions are overseas, \nnot in the U.S. Though they are frozen by U.S. sanctions, they are \nbeyond the jurisdiction of our courts to seize them.\n  Another false promise: virtually all of Iran's assets will stay \noverseas. Under this bill, they would be required to be kept overseas \nbecause all U.S. sanctions would be kept in effect by law with no \nchange allowed.\n  So let's be honest. This bill is not really about helping these \nvictims. It is about exploiting their plight and their tragedy to make \na political splash.\n  Look, everyone here knows I am no fan of the Iran nuclear agreement. \nI voted against it, but the other side won. Whether you are for or \nagainst the deal, it is time to be realistic about what happens next.\n  In my opinion, there were two potential courses. The first is to do \neverything we can to strengthen enforcement of the agreement and hold \nIran to its commitments. We should double down on our support for \nfriends and allies in the region. We should crack down on Iran's \nsupport for terrorist organizations. We should push leaders in Tehran \nto release detained Americans and improve its abysmal record on human \nrights. That is the course I hope we will take. I will soon introduce \nlegislation to pursue those aims, and I will work with members of both \nparties to get these measures to the President's desk.\n  The other course would be doing to the Iran agreement what leaders on \nthe other side have tried to do to the Affordable Care Act, and that is \nwhat I am afraid of here: vote after vote after vote after vote, \nwhether we like it or not, on an issue that has already been voted on \nby this Chamber many, many times. I don't want the dispute on Iran to \nturn into the Affordable Care Act where we try to kill it 60 different \nways.\n  We should not be using this for political purposes. We should be \npassing legislation, which I know we can get out of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee in a collaborative way, that would really do something to \nhelp these victims, that would really do something to hold Iran \naccountable for all its reprehensible acts. So I hope that what we are \ndoing today is not the path we are going down not only now, but in the \nfuture with other things.\n  There was a measure in the Senate that was very similar to this, \nwhich tried to hold Iran to certain things and say that the funds \ncouldn't be released unless Iran did this or did that. We could do this \nanother 60 times; it would be counterproductive. Let's put our heads \ntogether. Let's figure out a way that we can continue to hold Iran \naccountable, and let's move on that way.\n  So I hope we can move past this bill and start working on measures to \nensure that the Iran agreement is implemented as strongly and \nstringently as possible. I hope we can get back to our regular practice \nin the Foreign Affairs Committee of which we have been so proud and \nfocus on making policy that leaves politics at the water's edge.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. The administration is arguing, Mr. Speaker, that although \nthe Iranian regime has access to over $20 billion and that this \njudgment is $43 billion, there isn't enough money there to make \npayment. In addition to the 20-some billion, Iran is in the process \nright now of negotiation and paying and supporting in transfers to \nother regimes.\n  For example, a report out this week says Iran is purchasing $21 \nbillion of airplanes and satellites from Russia. That is $21 billion. \nIran somehow has the money to do that, but it doesn't have the money \nfor this claim.\n  A report out about a month ago says that Iran's annual support for \nHezbollah is over $100 million per year. Somehow they have got the \nspending cash for that.\n  It is providing the Syrian regime, one estimate of one of the think \ntanks here in town is that they have provided them a little over $10 \nbillion a year.\n  So Iran somehow has the discretionary money for these other purposes, \nbut not for the purpose of the judgments won in U.S. court for over \n1,000 victims or family members of the victims of their attacks.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), chairman of \nthe Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and \nTrade.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Meehan for this \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Iranian ayatollah has preached and practiced ``Death \nto America'' since the 1970s.\n  Iran is a state sponsor of terrorism. Iran has been sued in Federal \ncourts by the families of the murdered victims. Iran is guilty of the \nmurder of 421 Americans in Beirut, Lebanon, in 1983. Iran is guilty of \nthe murder of 19 servicemembers and injuring 372 others in Saudi Arabia \nin 1996. Iran is guilty of murdering a thousand other Americans, \nincluding some in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Federal courts have awarded the victim and families over $40 billion \nfor these crimes, but Iran will not pay. It laughs at the death of the \ninnocent it has murdered. It laughs at American justice.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, it is about time for the long arm of American \njustice to hold Iran accountable for its sins--make them pay.\n  I don't understand why some appeasers are more concerned about the \nmurderous Iranian regime than they are about justice, justice for the \nvictims that were murdered by this regime.\n  Let the ayatollah know he cannot get a diplomatic pass or sanctions \nrelief until he pays for his crimes. The ayatollah has sown the seeds \nof murder, and now it is time for Iran to reap the consequences of \ntheir crimes.\n  It seems to me that the voices of the murdered cry out for us to do \nsomething for justice, justice for them that has been too long waiting. \nThis bill, in my opinion, will do it.\n  It is about time we have justice because justice is what we are \nsupposed to do in this country.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Ellison).\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I urge Members to vote ``no'' on this \nparticular bill.\n  You know, once we were able to secure this negotiation and once the \ndeal was put in place, the focus of our attention should shift to \nmaking sure that Iran lives up to its commitments, and we should use \nthis prior negotiation as a template for negotiating other issues, \nincluding the captives, including the interests of these victims talked \nabout here today.\n  What this bill does is it handcuffs the President and says that the \nPresident doesn't have any discretion to do his end of this bargain, to \nexercise his discretion to forward and help America and the P5+1 live \nup to our end of the bargain. That is the wrong way to go.\n  So I can credit the authors of this bill with having good intentions, \nbut I think that the method that they are going about it is just wrong.\n  Let's use the template that has been developed through the \nnegotiation process to go back and say, ``Okay, now we got other things \nwe want to talk to you about,'' rather than pass legislation on this \nfloor that will do nothing other than hamstring the President. It is \nthe wrong way to do it. It is a mistake, and it should be voted down.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. \nSmith).\n  Mr. SMITH of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, in 1983, 241 American \nservicemen in Beirut were killed and another 60 injured by a car bomb.\n  One of the Marines murdered was my constituent, Paul Innocenzi III, \nwho lived with his young family in my hometown of Hamilton. In my \nsecond term as Congressman, I joined mourners at his funeral. I will \nnever forget the agony and the sorrow of his family. Iranian terrorism \nkilled Paul Innocenzi and, over the decades, has killed or maimed \nthousands of other Americans.\n  A Federal court, Mr. Speaker, found that the 1983 bombing was \n``beyond question'' perpetrated by ``Hezbollah and its agent who \nreceived massive material and technical support from the Iranian \nGovernment.'' Later a three-judge Federal appeals court panel approved \n$1.75 billion in judgment against Iran for the 1983 bombing and some \nother Iranian acts of terror.\n  Today Iran is poised to get billions of dollars through so-called \nsanctions relief for an egregiously flawed comprehensive plan of \naction, money that will procure for Iran a significantly larger arsenal \nof sophisticated weapons\n\n[[Page H6764]]\n\nand an enhanced capability to terrorize, murder, and destabilize.\n  The chairman talked about Iran's $21 billion weapons purchase from \nRussia. Billions more to Iran will exponentially increase weapons buys. \nThe Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act authored by Pat Meehan \nsays not so fast.\n  The President has said he will veto this bill. That is wrong, Mr. \nSpeaker. That is uncaring, it is unacceptable, it is unconscionable. \nAnd does a grave disservice to American victims of Iranian terrorism.\n  Support court-ordered victim payments by the terrorist State of Iran. \nFundamental justice demands that this bill become law.\n  Mr. Speaker, what was previously unacceptable--an Iranian nuclear \nstate--is now inevitable under the terms and conditions of what is \nofficially known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action.\n  Tragically, the deal is riddled with serious flaws, gaps, and huge \nconcessions to Iran. Taken as a whole, this egregiously flawed deal \nposes an existential threat to Israel, our allies in the region--and \nposes significant risks to the United States.\n  Today Iran is poised to get billions of dollars through so-called \nsanctions relief--money that will procure for Iran a significantly \nlarger arsenal of sophisticated weapons and an enhanced capability to \nterrorize, murder and destabilize.\n  The Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act (H.R. 3457) authored \nby Pat Meehan says not so fast.\n  The bill prohibits the President from waiving sanctions until Iran \npays its more than $44.5 billion in court ordered damages to thousands \nof victims and survivors of Iranian terror attacks.\n  To date, the U.S. Department of State has refused to release funds \nordered by the courts to victims and surviving families in more than 80 \ncases despite clear authority to do so under the Foreign Sovereign \nImmunities Act (FSIA).\n  In 1983, 241 American servicemen in Beirut were killed and another 60 \ninjured by a car bomb. One of the Marines murdered was my constituent \nWO1 Paul Innocenzi III who lived with his young family in my hometown \nof Hamilton. In my second term as congressman, I joined mourners at his \nfuneral. I will never forget the agony and sorrow of his family. \nIranian terrorism killed Paul Innocenzi and over the decades, has \nkilled or maimed thousands of other Americans.\n  A federal district court found that the 1983 bombing was ``beyond \nquestion'' perpetrated by ``Hezbollah and its agents (who) received \nmassive material and technical support from the Iranian government''. \nLater a three judge federal appeals court panel approved a $1.75 \nbillion judgement against Iran for the 1983 bombing and other Iranian \nacts of terror.\n  The President has said he will veto this bill. That's wrong. That's \nuncaring, unacceptable, and unconscionable. Support court-ordered \nvictim payments by the terror state of Iran. Fundamental justice \ndemands that this bill becomes law.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. \nConnolly), our colleague on the Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from New York (Mr. \nEngel) for his leadership on the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  This bill prohibits any waivers, reductions, or other relief from \nU.S. sanctions on Iran until Iran pays all court-ordered damage claims \nto U.S. victims. Those claims total about $46 billion.\n  This bill would prevent the U.S. from implementing its commitments \nunder the Iran deal, which is really what my friends on the other side \nare trying to do. Not being able to win directly, let's get at it \nindirectly and let's cover it with the patina of respectability. But \nthe real issue is, cynically, how we use the plight of U.S. victims for \nanother partisan shot.\n  We all want to help American victims of Iran's terrorism and lack of \njustice, but this is not the way to help them. It would have the \nopposite effect by reducing the chance that any claims, in fact, would \nbe paid because, by freezing assets, Iran wouldn't have the wherewithal \nto do what this bill says it should do before sanctions are lifted.\n  Think about this: Iran owes $46 billion in U.S. claims, but it \ndoesn't have the money right now, even if it wanted to pay. Iran only \nhas access to about $20 billion of its own reserves.\n  Realistically, the only funds that could be used are the frozen funds \nunder U.S. sanctions held in banks around the world. Under this bill, \nthe frozen funds couldn't be used to pay the claims, and all the money \nremains frozen until Iran pays the claims. It is a catch-22 if there \never was one. It couldn't sell any oil to use to free up cash because \nthose funds, too, would be frozen.\n  Another clue about what is really behind this bill is that all of the \n76 sponsors are my friends on the other side of the aisle, not a single \nDemocrat.\n  Regardless of one's position on the Iran deal, a deal I probably \nsupported because it keeps Iran from becoming a nuclear state, opposing \nthis cynical bill is, in fact, the right vote if you care about the \nvictims of Iranian injustice and terrorism.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nMeehan), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means and author of this \nbill.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, $21 billion for Russian jets, but not a \npenny for the victims of their own acts of terror. That is what my \ncolleagues are trying to say? In fact, the President can negotiate it. \nLet him reach an installment plan, but let's make sure that these \ndollars are paid.\n  Look, this is a fundamental question: Should Iran receive relief from \nthe U.S. sanctions before it pays the victims of terrorism the $43 \nbillion that U.S. courts say these victims are owed?\n  When we say ``terrorism,'' what are we talking about? We are talking \nabout Iranian-backed assassinations, bombings, and attacks across time \nzones, from Paris to Jerusalem, to New York, to Beirut, to East Africa, \nto Buenos Aires.\n  I say not one cent.\n  These victims are United States citizens. They are wives, brothers \nand sisters, children who hail from all across the Nation, and they \nwere killed in hijackings and suicide attacks and bombings of buses and \nplanes and buildings and embassies and shopping malls and pizza \nparlors.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  In fact, I met with one of those victims this morning and yesterday, \nthe widow of Kenneth Welch and his child. They are here in Washington \ntoday. They have been waiting 30 years for the opportunity to see this \nissue addressed.\n  My friends, by voting against this legislation, you are saying that \nIran and the perpetrators of these atrocities deserve U.S. sanctions \nrelief before the victims deserve the court-ordered compensation. Let \nme say it again. By voting ``no,'' you are putting the interests of \nIran's terror machine before the American victims of that terror. I say \nnot 1 cent.\n  To those who say Iran can't afford to pay these damages, let me \nremind you of a few facts. Iran has a yearly gross domestic product in \nexcess of $1.3 trillion, and they just spent $21 billion on Russian \njets. The facts show that Iran has the money and will have much more if \nthe sanctions are lifted, money that our own administration freely \nadmits will go to finance even more terror.\n  I sat yesterday with Ken Stethem, the brother of Robert Stethem, the \nUnited States Navy diver who was executed on Beirut Flight 847. His \nbrother Ken, himself a retired Navy SEAL, said to me yesterday, ``If \nthe President doesn't take this opportunity and Congress doesn't take \nthe opportunity to hold Iran accountable for their terrorist acts now, \nI have to ask them when will they. Thirty years for one family, more \nthan 15 for another. When will they?''\n  He is talking to us. Let's answer him. Let's today stand up for the \nstandards of U.S. Navy Petty Officer Robert Stethem. Let's today vote \nas one House to say we will put Robert Stethem and the many victims of \nIran's terrorism before--before--the criminals who conspired to kill \nthem.\n  Until they pay these victims what they are owed, let's say no to \nIran, not 1 cent.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy in \npermitting me to speak on this issue. I listened to the impassioned \npleas from my friends on the other side of the aisle about horrific \nacts of the thugs who run Iran. Nobody disputes that, and nothing \nbefore us would take away the sanctions that we have against their \nterrorist activity.\n\n[[Page H6765]]\n\n  We are all committed to justice for those victims, but bear in mind \nwhat this legislation seeks to do is to unwind another critical \nobjective of the United States, of our allies, to prevent a nuclear-\narmed Iran.\n  That agreement was a signal achievement of diplomacy not just of the \nObama administration, but of Russia, China, Germany, France, Great \nBritain, working with us to secure the strongest agreement that we have \nseen to contain these thugs' nuclear ambitions. The world is united \nwith us to restrain a nuclear Iran.\n  Now, we have had testimony from our partners that, if the United \nStates walks away from that agreement, we are on our own. They are not \ngoing to continue to enforce nuclear sanctions against Iran, and, \nultimately, Iran will get its money and a free hand to develop nuclear \nweapons unencumbered by the allies that we have assembled and the \npressure that we have put on them.\n  Now, my friends, Mr. Engel and Mr. Connolly, are correct. The \nconstruct here is very difficult, even if this were to be approved, to \nactually work out on paper. But take it a step further. These elements \nhave been in place for years and have not resulted in any movement for \nthe victims.\n  We have had what the rest of the world thinks is a significant \nbreakthrough with Iran. We have got an area of cooperation, and the \nworld is united with us to keep the pressure on them. I would suggest, \nrather than throwing this agreement in the trash can and allow Iran to \ndevelop nuclear weapons and make them stronger--and, ultimately, they \nwill get their money because India and China are going to go ahead and \nstart buying oil from Iran again as the sanctions collapse. It will be \nthe United States against the world again.\n  We couldn't even sanction itty-bitty Cuba to change their regime. It \ntakes multinational efforts to be able to make changes. This agreement \nis an important first step, and I would suggest it gives us an \nopportunity to continue putting pressure on Iran to be able to obtain \nthe justice that we all want for those victims.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Frelinghuysen), a member of the Committee on \nAppropriations.\n  Mr. FRELINGHUYSEN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Mr. Meehan and Mr. \nRoyce for their leadership. I oppose the Iranian deal for many reasons. \nAmong the reasons is the over $100 billion windfall Iran will receive \nin unfrozen assets and sanctions relief.\n  The administration has acknowledged that some of this money will be \ncertainly distributed to the Iranian military, its global terrorist \nnetwork, and to the Quds Force, an organization with American blood on \nits hands.\n  We remember the marines and sailors killed in the bombing of the \nbarracks in Beirut in 1983 and civilians in that embassy in Beirut, the \nairmen who died in Khobar Towers in Saudi Arabia in 1995. And what \nabout the victims of the Iranian-financed attacks, like Alisa Flatow of \nWest Orange, New Jersey, who died in a bus bombing in Gaza in 1995 and \nSara Duker of Teaneck, New Jersey, who was murdered on a bus in \nJerusalem in 1996? Who speaks for them, for those innocents and their \nfamilies? This bill does.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Hurd), a member of the Committee on Homeland Security.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this \nlegislation. Justice is a powerful word. For those who have been \nwronged, justice can bring peace and closure. For those guilty of \nharming the innocent, justice is absolutely necessary to ensure the \nauthority of our laws. Without justice, truth becomes irrelevant.\n  If America is going to continue to be the greatest nation in the \nworld, it is imperative that we pursue justice. But the Iran nuclear \ndeal does the exact opposite. It rewards lawlessness and corruption. It \ntells Iran that they can be unjust to our own citizens and the current \nadministration will allow them to get away with it.\n  Iran is responsible for sponsoring terrorism that has led to the \ndeath of thousands of Americans. When the families of these Americans \nsought justice in the court, Iran was found guilty and ordered to make \nreparations. The family of Cyrus Elahi from Dallas, Texas, was awarded \nmore than $300 million after Cyrus was assassinated for criticizing the \nIranian Government.\n  Judgments like this have added up to billions of dollars that Iran \nowes the families of American victims. But is this administration \nforcing Iran to pay? Are they demanding justice for Americans like \nCyrus? No. Instead, this administration is handing over an estimated \n$100 billion to Iran. That is not justice. That is outrageous.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Ohio \n(Mr. Wenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, this bill would respond to one of many \nsignificant problems with President Obama's disastrous Iran deal, which \ngives Iran sanctions relief without requiring it to make reparations \nfor the crimes it has committed against Americans.\n  Anne Dammerell, who was born in Cincinnati near my district, was \nworking at the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983. A bomb exploded while \nshe was in the embassy cafeteria, breaking 19 of her bones. She \nreceived a judgment against Iran for $6.8 million because of the \nphysical and mental suffering she endured. Anne is one tragic story \namong many.\n  Over the past 15 years, U.S. courts have handed down 80 judgments \nagainst Iran, adding up to more than $43.5 billion in unpaid damages. \nIran refuses to pay. Yet, the President's nuclear agreement provides \nIran with $150 billion in sanctions relief. Those that have destroyed \ninnocent American lives, Iranian terrorists, are being chosen over the \nAmerican victims themselves.\n  This bill would prohibit the President from removing any sanctions in \nplace against Iran until the President has certified to Congress that \nIran has paid each Federal court judgment.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Meehan) for introducing this good bill. It is a compassionate \nbill. It is a bill that tells victims of terrorism that they are not \nforgotten.\n  I chair the task force in the House Committee on Financial Services \nto investigate terrorism finance, and we had a hearing specifically on \nthe joint plan of action, the so-called P5+1. That was back in July.\n  There was an attorney who testified at the hearing about the $43 \nbillion in judgments and how this deal, then not approved yet, was \nlikely going to sidestep the ability of victims who did all the right \nthings through the legal process, who hired lawyers, who went to court, \nwho got the judgments, legitimate judgments, how these judgments would \nnot be paid.\n  On July 29, I wrote a letter to Secretary Lew--Secretary of the \nTreasury--and Secretary Kerry of the State Department asking whether or \nnot they had addressed the issue as part of the negotiations. That was \nJuly 29. I have yet to receive a response from the Treasury Department, \nfrom the Department of State, in any way.\n  Mr. Speaker, the deafening silence of this administration has led me \nto believe that they completely overlooked the victims of terrorism.\n  What we are going to do is we are going to give the money to the \nIslamic Republic of Iran and not to American victims, and that is \nwrong. This bill is right. I urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the chair of the bipartisan Task Force to Investigate \nTerrorism Financing, I analyzed the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action \n(JCPOA) put forward by this Administration at length.\n  After numerous hearings and research, I opposed the deal for a number \nof reasons--not the least of which is because of its potential impact \non terrorism financing by Iran. At hearing after hearing, members heard \ndirectly from foreign policy experts about this threat and the danger \nof the influx of cash provided by this agreement finding its way to \nterrorist organizations threatening Iran's neighboring states as well \nas those planning strikes in the United States.\n  At a hearing specifically on this deal and its impact on Tehran's \nstate sponsorship of terror, one witness, a practicing attorney, \ntestified to\n\n[[Page H6766]]\n\nthe fact that American citizens and families who were victims of \nIranian sponsored terrorist attacks--including families in my district \nin Pennsylvania--are owed over $43 billion in compensation as awarded \nby United States.\n  Following the Task Force's fourth hearing I wrote this letter to both \nSecretaries John Kerry and Jack Lew asking if this nuclear deal would \nstrip victims of Iranian terrorism the right to this compensation.\n  That was July 29. I have yet to receive any sort of response from \neither the Treasury or State departments. The deafening silence from \nthe Administration has led me to believe they completely overlooked \nthese families when they rushed to finalize this bad deal with Iran.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is unconscionable to think that--as a nation--we \nwould allow the world's largest state sponsor of terror access to \nbillions of dollars in sanctions relief and unfreezing of held assets \nwhile victims of Iranian terrorism are left with nothing.\n  These victims are Americans from all around the country--from my home \nand yours. They've lost loved ones and suffered irreparable damages \nbecause of Iran's long, sordid history with terrorism. By failing to \ntake this situation into account throughout the negotiation process, \nthe administration has failed these victims and their families.\n  The Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act we are considering \ntoday rights that wrong. It says simply: Not one cent in sanctions \nrelief for Iran until these families are payed. That's not a partisan \ndemand--that's common sense.\n  I strongly support this legislation and ask for my colleagues to join \nme in standing up for our constituents impacted by Iranian terror and \npass this bill in the bipartisan fashion it deserves.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from North \nCarolina (Mr. Holding), a member of the Committee on Ways and Means.\n  Mr. HOLDING. Mr. Speaker, Iran is shortly set to receive over $100 \nbillion when President Obama uses his pen to lift our sanctions against \nthe world's largest sponsor of terrorism. At the same time, Mr. \nSpeaker, Iran owes U.S. victims of terror it sponsored and supported \n$43.5 billion.\n  One of these victims was Petty Officer 1st Class Michael Wagner of \nColumbia, North Carolina. He was serving in the American Embassy in \nBeirut in 1984 when a car bomb filled with explosives paid for by Iran \ndetonated outside his office, killing him and 23 other people. In the \ncase of Petty Officer Wagner and Tehran's other victims, our courts \nhave found Iran guilty and ordered Iran to pay restitution, but Iran \nhas not paid a penny.\n  Mr. Speaker, we should require Iran to pay every penny it owes to the \nvictims of terrorism before sanctions are lifted, period.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Harper), a member of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce.\n  Mr. HARPER. Mr. Speaker, I am and will remain opposed to the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action on Iran. It represents Iran's ability to \nbuild a nuclear weapon at a future date while reaping the financial \nbenefits of immediate relief from international sanctions. By removing \nsanctions, the agreement injects almost $100 billion into the Iranian \nregime.\n  Iran is the single largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world, \nfunding--even with sanctions in place--Hezbollah in Lebanon and Hamas \nin Gaza. Over $43 billion in judgments have been awarded to Americans \nwho have been the victims of Iranian terrorism. The agreement fails to \nclear those judgments.\n  The agreement, at best, delays Iran's ability to build nuclear \nweapons. At worst, it gives the regime more money to engage in more \nterrorism while providing no justice to Americans already harmed by the \nregime.\n  The Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act is timely. It is \nappropriate, and it should be supported by every member of this body \nwho believe in the validity of U.S. courts and the Federal Sovereign \nImmunities Act.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nArkansas (Mr. Hill), a member of the Committee on Financial Services.\n\n                              {time}  1130\n\n  Mr. HILL. I thank Mr. Meehan for his leadership on this, and I thank \nthe ranking member and the chairman for their opposition to the Iranian \nagreement, which I believe was ill-conceived and not enough time given \nfor those negotiations to bear true fruit. In fact, that is the whole \npoint of our debate today. The maximum amount of negotiating clout that \nthe United States had over these sanctions was during these \nnegotiations, before we released sanctions, before Iran gets access to \ntheir monthly oil flow and their $100 billion.\n  We have $44 billion and 85 judgments. The number of intelligence \nagents that have worked day and night to adjudicate these claims in \ncourt, the number of FBI agents involved, the Federal Government's \nobligation to generate awards for these victims, and yet this \nadministration has never raised it in public in regard to the Iranian \nagreement.\n  Under the 1996 and 2008 Federal Sovereign Immunities Act, the \nPresident of the United States is obligated to seek resolution for \nthese claims.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Graves of Louisiana). The time of the \ngentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. HILL. He is obligated to adjudicate these claims and seek \nrestitution for these victims under the Federal Sovereign Immunities \nAct. President Bush did his duty. When he had leverage over Libya, he \ngot the claims paid for the victims of terror in Libya.\n  For every day we come to work in this House and we ask, ``What can we \ndo to help this country? How can we right a wrong?'' today is that day.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support Mr. \nMeehan's outstanding bill. Let's right the wrong. Let's adjudicate \nthese claims. Let's get this money back for the victims of terrorism.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. A majority of this House thinks this \ndeal is bad, a majority of the Senate thinks this deal is bad, and a \nmajority of the American people think this deal is bad. We have not had \nany input, and the effort here today is to simply make a bad deal a \nlittle less bad.\n  The idea behind Mr. Meehan's bill is to provide restitution to \nAmerican victims. It is not just any American victims. It is the \nvictims of Iranian terror. $150 billion is going to flow to Iran. It \nseems to be common sense that the first $43 billion should instead be \npaid to the victims of Iranian terror.\n  Joseph Cicippio was one of those victims. He lived right outside my \ncongressional district. He spent 5 years in brutal captivity before \nbeing released in 1991.\n  A vote for this bill today is a vote for the victims of Iranian \nterror.\n  I also want to say Congressman Meehan's congressional district is \nright next to mine. I want to thank him for his thoughtful, creative \napproach and his leadership in this country and in this House on this \nbill.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nCoffman).\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, in 1982, I was with the United States \nMarine Corps off the coast of Beirut, Lebanon, waiting on orders to do \nevacuations of the U.S. Embassy and U.S. citizens and their families. \nOur assignment was done in August of 1982. We returned to the United \nStates. I finished my 2 years with the battalion.\n  The battalion went back out. This time, they took positions in the \nairport in Beirut, Lebanon. On October 23, 1983, a suicide bomber drove \na truck laden with explosives into the marine barracks; 241 marines \nwere killed that day.\n  To my friends who died there--First Lieutenant Bill Zimmerman, \nCaptain Bill Winter, Captain Joe Boccia, Master Sergeant Roy Edwards, \nCaptain Mike Haskell--today is your day. Today is your day for justice. \nGod bless you. God remember all of you.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Today is the day for justice for these marines--and \ntheir families--who were lost on that day by the Iranian-backed \nHezbollah bomber.\n  So I want to thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for bringing this \nmeasure forward. I urge my colleagues not to forget those who have died \nand\n\n[[Page H6767]]\n\nto remember this: when the Iranians say ``death to Americans,'' they \nmean death to Americans.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded to direct their remarks \nto the Chair.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. \nBishop).\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to join my \ncolleagues to support this legislation. I want to thank the gentleman \nfor his sponsorship. I am proud to be a cosponsor.\n  Thirty-one years ago, one Michigan family's sleepless worry became a \nheartbreaking reality. Their son, brother, and father, U.S. Army \nWarrant Officer Kenneth Welch, was one of two U.S. servicemen to lose \nhis life in the bombing in Beirut, Lebanon.\n  U.S. judgments later found that the act of terrorism was sponsored by \nthe Iranian regime. For its crimes, that regime was ordered to pay \ndamages to the family of Kenneth Welch. Not surprisingly, however, not \none dime has been paid to the family. Yet today, in this country, we \nfind ourselves dealing with an administration that wants to lift \nsanctions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am beside myself to think that this is the Nation that \nwe have become. America is built on bravery and freedom, and that is \nbecause of the unwavering strength and sacrifice of men and women in \nthe military. I am forever proud of our soldiers, and I know my \ncolleagues here today are, too. That is why we cannot let the Iran \nterror continue. We need to do whatever we can to address the victims \nlike Ken Welch.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. \nDold).\n  Mr. DOLD. I thank my good friend from California, the chairman, for \nyielding me the time. I also want to thank my good friend from \nPennsylvania for bringing this piece of legislation.\n  Supporting victims of Iranian terrorism is a cause that every single \nMember of this body should be able to support, regardless of where they \nstand on the Iranian nuclear agreement. Under no circumstances should \nwe be ignoring the victims of Iran's terrorism while simultaneously \nrewarding the greatest state sponsor of terror the world has seen.\n  Make no mistake, under this administration's agreement with Iran, \nIran will be receiving approximately $150 billion in sanctions relief--\nin new funding--almost immediately, while American victims of Iranian \nterrorism, whether it be bombings, kidnappings, murder, and the like, \nare basically going without resources.\n  Where are our priorities? Where are our priorities in this Chamber \nwhen the victims of Iranian terror are being ignored while Iran is \nbeing rewarded with new funds that will inevitably be used to fund new \nterror--Hezbollah, Hamas, and those around the globe?\n\n  Iran's terror proxies have killed Americans and continue to do so to \nthis day. This is a fact that cannot be ignored. I certainly hope that \nmy colleagues on both sides of the aisle will support this piece of \nlegislation.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nRothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. I thank my colleague, Mr. Meehan from Pennsylvania, for \nintroducing this very important piece of legislation.\n  The President's nuclear agreement with Iran provides them with \nbillions in frozen assets and sanctions relief. One needs only to look \nat recent history to know exactly what Iran will do with this financial \nwindfall.\n  While pursuing a nuclear bomb, Iran has been engaged in a decades-\nlong campaign of terror that resulted in the deaths of many, many \nAmericans. They continue to bankroll proxies like Hezbollah, Hamas, and \nthe Houthi rebels.\n  Atrocities like the Beirut marine barracks bombing, the murder of \nBobby Stethem on TWA flight 847, Khobar Towers, and the kidnapping of \nCIA Agent William Buckley, are just a small taste of what Iranian \nstate-sponsored terrorism has wrought.\n  This bill is about everyday Americans getting justice. Americans like \nthe family of Beaver County native Major John Macroglou, the highest \nranking officer killed in the attack on the Beirut marine barracks.\n  Victims of Iranian terrorism have successfully brought suit in U.S. \ncourts, yet billions in judgments remain unpaid. The Obama \nadministration failed to secure restitution for the victims of Iran in \nits negotiations with this country, but this legislation can rectify \nthis wrong.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much time is \nremaining.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California has 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from New York has 17\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. ENGEL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  In closing, let me say to my friends on the other side of the aisle, \nand they know this, no one has been more of an adversary of the Iranian \nregime than I have, but a number of us found the deal with Iran \nwanting. We voted ``no,'' but it didn't prevail, and now we have to \nfigure out the best way forward. The best way forward, I sincerely \nbelieve, is not to keep trotting out these bills.\n  No one is condoning anything that Iran has done, particularly with \nterrorism. It is a matter of how we combat it. The way I see it is that \nwe have two paths forward: we can choose to mirror what we did with the \nAffordable Care Act, voting and revoting on an issue that has been \nsettled to some degree, or we can choose the path that suits our \nNation's interests the best. This path includes doing everything we can \nto strengthen the enforcement mechanisms of this agreement.\n  The path also includes holding Iran accountable for its nefarious \nactivities that destabilize the region, as well as pushing Tehran to \nrelease detained Americans and improve their human rights records in \nthe interim, and, of course, taking care of the victims of terrorism \nand their families. This path requires the strengthening of bilateral \npartnerships and supporting our allies in the region, both of which \nhelp us in the long term.\n  This is the course I hope we take. We cannot let this opportunity go \nto waste. So that is why I won't be supporting H.R. 3457. After that, \nwe need to work together on measures that strengthen implementation of \nthe agreement as much as possible.\n  I hope we can do that in a bipartisan way, as we have for the past 3 \nyears in the Foreign Affairs Committee. This path promises to bring us \nback to making foreign policy rather than using political bills that \ndeflect from the important issues at hand.\n  I do not doubt the sincerity of anyone who spoke today. We all are \nsincere and we all feel the same way: Iran is a bad actor and must be \nheld accountable. But this bill is not the correct mechanism to do so, \nso I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, consider the case of Anne Dammarell, a USAID worker who \nwas posted in the U.S. Embassy in Beirut in 1983. At 1 p.m. on April \n18, a suicide bomber in a delivery van drove 2,000 pounds of explosives \ninto the front door of our U.S. Embassy and the blast demolished the \nfront of the building and caused the upper floors to collapse on top of \neach other.\n  When that went off, she was eating lunch in the Embassy cafeteria \nuntil suddenly she awoke outside, covered in cement, with 19 bones \nbroken. Sixty-three people were killed in that blast.\n  Now we have a moral obligation to ensure that these judgments for \nthese victims, which represent Iran's legal debt to the victims of its \nofficial policy of terrorism, are paid. There have been 90 such attacks \non Americans, and this legislation helps us fulfill that moral \nobligation we have to our constituents and to all Americans.\n  What I will share with you is that it is not going to work to release \nthe $100 billion first, because that $100 billion goes into the hands \nof the IRGC. They are the ones who have taken over the companies in \nIran as of 1979, and the Iranian Revolutionary Guard forces and the \nQuds forces are the ones that carried out these attacks.\n  So the only leverage we are going to have in this negotiation is if \nwe pass legislation that says, first, you have got $20 billion in \nreserves. Start the process of paying the victims of that attack.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  If we don't get them paid now, if we don't get the survivors and the \nfamily\n\n[[Page H6768]]\n\nmembers of those who were killed paid now, it will never happen later.\n  But more importantly, at least we would do this. If we are going to \ngive $100 billion out of escrow into the hands of the IRGC, what do you \nthink they are going to do with it?\n  They have already announced $20 billion in sales to Russia for \nfighter planes. They have already announced the money, $100 million, \nthat they are going to give to Hezbollah.\n  Why not at least get our own civilians paid the judgments that they \nearned up front?\n  That is exactly what we did with the Lockerbie agreement. We were \ngoing to lift the sanctions or allow the return of the escrowed money \nto Libya. Right?\n  $2.5 billion had to go to the victims and the family members killed \nin the Pan Am 103 bombing because of the judgment in U.S. courts.\n  This needs to be done under that procedure. That is why this \nlegislation is necessary.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to \nH.R. 3457, the ``Justice for Victims of Iranian Terrorism Act.''\n  If enacted into law, H.R. 3457 would prevent the United States from \nimplementing its sanctions relief commitments under the Joint \nComprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) reached between the P5+1 \ncountries, the European Union (EU), and Iran by tying the \nAdministration's ability to fulfill its commitments to non-nuclear \nissues that are outside the scope of the JCPOA.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill has absolutely no chance of becoming law \nbecause President Obama has already announced he will veto it if \npresented to him for signature.\n  And that is as it should be since this ill-considered and unwise bill \ncomes to floor without being vetted by any of the committees of \njurisdiction.\n  The bill was not considered by the Judiciary Committee or its \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, of which I serve as Ranking Member and which has \njurisdiction over issues federal lawsuits and compensation involving \nvictims of terrorist acts.\n  Nor was the bill considered by the Committee on Foreign Affairs, even \nthough that committee has held several hearings relating to violent \nextremism and terrorists acts.\n  In the month of September alone, the Committee on Foreign Affairs \nheld six hearings that addressed some aspect of terrorism and violent \nextremism, not one of which involved H.R. 3457 or the subject matter \nraised in the legislation.\n  Given its adverse impact on the JCPOA, one would have thought that \nthis legislation would have been fully vetted before being rushed to \nthe floor, and this lack of careful scrutiny is sufficient in itself to \nvote against this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me be clear: I am, and long have been, a strong \nsupporter and advocate for adequate compensation for victims of \nterrorism sponsored or supported by foreign states.\n  For example, I have fought for compensation for the victims of Boko \nHaram, the Lord's Resistance Army, ISIL and Al-Shabaab from Nigeria, to \nSyria, to Kenya, to name just a few.\n  I have requested the Attorney General of the United States to take \naction to secure relief for thousands of victims of terror from \ndifferent regions of the world.\n  But I have never advocated or supported actions to achieve this \nresult that puts the national security at risk.\n  And that is why I cannot support H.R. 3457.\n  By obstructing implementation of the JCPOA, H.R. 3457 would greatly \nundermine our national security interests and likely would result in \nthe collapse of the comprehensive diplomatic arrangement that \npeacefully and verifiably prevents Iran from acquiring a nuclear \nweapon.\n  This would in turn allow for the resumption of a significantly less \nconstrained Iranian nuclear program, lead to the unraveling of the \ninternational sanctions regime against Iran, and deal a devastating \nblow to America's credibility as a leader of international diplomacy.\n  This would have the collateral effect of jeopardizing both the hard \nwork of sustaining a unified coalition to combat Iran's destabilizing \nactivities in the region and America's ability to lead the world on \nnuclear non-proliferation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Administration supports efforts by U.S. terrorism \nvictims to pursue compensation, consistent with our national security.\n  It bears pointing out that nothing in the JCPOA prohibits or impedes \nthose efforts.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have called Iran untrustworthy because it has not \nalways lived up to its commitments.\n  What would it say about the United States and its reputation of being \nan honest broker and trustworthy partner if we reneged on a carefully \nand painstakingly negotiated agreement before the ink barely had time \nto dry?\n  The single and overriding purpose of the JCPOA was to address the \ninternational community's concern over Iran's nuclear program and the \nneed to verifiably prevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  This goal is achieved by the JCPOA this objective is undermined by \nH.R. 3457.\n  After all our hearings and thoughtful deliberations on the JCPOA, it \ndefies reason to collapse the historic and landmark diplomatic success \nthat created the framework for a peaceful and verifiable methodology to \nprevent Iran from acquiring a nuclear weapon.\n  For these reasons, Mr. Speaker, I strongly oppose H.R. 3457 and urge \nall Members to join me in voting against this unwise measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 449, the previous question is ordered on \nthe bill, as amended.\n  The question is on the engrossment and third reading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to House Resolution 449, I call \nup the conference report on the bill (H.R. 1735) to authorize \nappropriations for fiscal year 2016 for military activities of the \nDepartment of Defense, for military construction, and for defense \nactivities of the Department of Energy, to prescribe military personnel \nstrengths for such fiscal year, and for other purposes, and ask for its \nimmediate consideration.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 449, the \nconference report is considered read.\n  (For conference report and statement, see proceedings of the House of \nSeptember 29, 2015, at page H6337.)\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) \nand the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) each will control 30 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous material on the conference report to accompany \nH.R. 1735.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, the first and most important thing I can say today is \nthat this conference report is good for the troops and it is good for \nthe country, and nothing that I or anybody else is going to say in this \nnext hour is going to be more important than that one basic \nproposition.\n  Now, we may hear a variety of excuses, ifs, ands and buts about this, \nthat or the other thing, and I certainly don't agree with every \nprovision in this conference report.\n  But in pulling this bill together, I had to put aside personal \npreferences and party considerations and other things because getting a \nbill passed and enacted that is good for the troops and good for the \ncountry is more important than anything else.\n  The second point I want to make is that this bill is the product of \nwork from Members from both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nCapitol. About half of the amendments that were adopted in committee \nand on the floor were from Democratic Members.\n  Democratic conferees played a substantial role in shaping this final \nconference report. And if you look at the\n\n[[Page H6769]]\n\nsubstance of what is in the bill, you can see major contributions from \nboth sides.\n  As a matter of fact, we hear a lot these days about regular order. \nWell, this bill went through regular order through the committee, with \n211 amendments that were adopted on the floor, when 131 amendments were \nadopted through a regular conference, with a Senate-passed bill for the \nfirst time in years, and now it is back here for approval.\n  So after going through regular order and all that that entails, if \nthere is still partisan opposition, it leads some to ask why. Why \nbother?\n  The third point I want to make, Mr. Speaker, is just a reminder to \nMembers that this is a dangerous world, and it is getting more \ndangerous by the minute. Just look at the headlines that are in today's \npapers.\n  Russia has conducted airstrikes in Syria not against ISIS, but \nagainst the moderate opposition forces, and Russia is telling us, the \nUnited States, when and where we can fly our airplanes in Syria.\n  Meanwhile, the Palestinians have decided they are going to back away \nfrom all the agreements that they have with Israel.\n  Meanwhile, the Taliban is on the move in Afghanistan, and U.S. \nAmerican troops are sent in to help turn the tide. That doesn't even \ncount the things that are happening in Ukraine, North Korea, Iran, \nChina building islands out in the Pacific.\n  So the point of that is that this is no time for political games. \nThis is the time to come together and pass a bill that helps provide \nfor the country's security. I think that is exactly what this bill \ndoes.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill authorizes the exact amount of money that the \nPresident requested for national defense. Now, we did not agree with \nevery single program request.\n  We made some different judgments, like preserving the A-10, and it is \nbeing used today in the Middle East. We thought we needed not to retire \nsome of the ships that the President wanted to retire. So there were \nsome adjustments. But at the end of the day, the total is exactly the \namount the President asked for.\n  Now, some of those programs are under different labels. But, frankly, \nwhether you call it base funding, OCO funding, or pumpernickel--it \ndoesn't matter--it is money that goes to the troops.\n  If you are a U.S. soldier today on the ground in Iraq or Afghanistan \nor if you are a soldier, sailor, airman, or marine who are supporting \nthem from the United States or anywhere else, do you really care what \nthe label on the money is? What you care about is that the money to \nhelp for provide your operation and maintenance is provided.\n  Of course, there are many other parts of this bill, Mr. Speaker: \nacquisition reform, which is a significant first step to make sure the \ntaxpayers get more value for the money they spend; personnel reform, \nincluding a new retirement system.\n  Today 83 percent of the people who serve in the military walk away \nwith no retirement at all. That changes under this bill.\n  So Members who are going to vote against this bill are going to tell \n83 percent of the people who serve in the military: You are going to \ncontinue to walk away with nothing.\n  This bill requires the DOD and VA to have a joint formulary for sleep \ndisorders, pain management, and mental health issues. We have been told \nthose are some of the most important steps we can take.\n  It takes additional steps to combat sexual assault. It authorizes \ndefensive weapons for Ukraine. It gives the President more tools to \nbattle ISIS in Iraq, to provide weapons directly to the Kurds and Sunni \nforces.\n  We take steps to help defend this country against missiles.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  We take steps in this bill to help defend our country against missile \nattacks, which is particularly important now that Iran is going to have \na bunch more money to put into their missiles. But what we also do is \nsupport the Israeli missile defense program with more money than was \nasked for by the President.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, my point is this bill is good for the troops and it \nis good for the country, and that ought to override everything else. It \nshould be passed today.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  First of all, let me agree on two points with the chairman. There is \na lot that is good in this bill. There is no question about that. And I \nwant to thank the chairman for his leadership in making that happen.\n  I think the conference committee process was a model for how the \nconference committee is supposed to go. The minority was included. \nThere was robust debate about a large number of issues. There were \npoints when we thought we couldn't resolve them and we did. And I think \nthere is a lot that is good in this bill.\n  I also think, without question, without debate, that this is a very, \nvery dangerous time for our country. No doubt about it. The chairman \nlaid out some of the challenges--there are many, many more--with what \nis going on in the Middle East, certainly with Russia, with how we deal \nwith China. It is a very challenging time for national security, and we \nneed to be as strong as we possibly can.\n  But the one area where I disagree--and I think the chairman also \ncorrectly states the fundamental question: Is this good for our \ncountry? Is it good for our troops?\n  I don't believe that it is. It is not good for our country, and it is \nnot good for our troops. It does, in fact, matter where the money comes \nfrom for a couple of reasons.\n  First of all, by the budget gimmick that the Budget Committee in the \nHouse and the Senate put together, by using overseas contingency \noperations funds for things that are not overseas contingency \noperations funds--and this was all done as a dodge to get around doing \nwhat we need to do, which is to lift the budget caps. Because, you see, \nthe OCO funding, for some reason is not counted as real money. It is \nmoney. It is $38 billion.\n  But it enables the conservatives in the Republican Party to say that \nthey have maintained the budget caps while still spending $38 billion \nmore dollars, which is incredibly hypocritical and a terrible way to \nbudget.\n  But here are two reasons why that is bad for our country and bad for \nour troops. Number one, it does not lift the budget caps. These budget \ncaps are in place, I believe, for another 9 or 8 years. Unless we lift \nthose budget caps, we are harming our troops and we are harming our \ncountry.\n  This bill dodging that issue is precisely a national security issue \nbecause, until we lift those caps, the Department of Defense has no \nidea how much money they are going to have. All right?\n  OCO is one-time money. That is why it is not as good as lifting the \nbudget caps and giving the ability to do the 5- and 10-year planning \nthat they do, to do multi-year projects so that they can actually have \na plan going forward. That hurts national security.\n  The inability to raise the budget caps in this bill and \nappropriations process is a critical blow to our troops and to our \nnational security.\n  The second reason this is important is because the OCO funding that \nis in this bill is not going to happen; all right?\n  Part of it is because the President is going to veto it. But the \nlarger part of it is the Senate, as they have been unable to do for a \nnumber of years, has not passed any appropriations bills because they \nhave rejected their own budget resolution.\n  So this $38 billion in OCO funding that we are going to hear about, \nall this great money, is not going to happen because the appropriators \nhave said it is not going to happen.\n  So to have a national defense authorizing bill with $38 billion in \nimaginary money is not good for our troops and it is not good for our \ncountry. We need to lift the budget caps. We need to spend the money \nthat we need to spend on national security.\n  I will also say that there are other pieces of national security, \nbecause the budget caps remain in place for the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. They remain in place for the Department of Justice. They \nremain in place for the Department of the Treasury, three\n\n[[Page H6770]]\n\nagencies that play a critical role in national security for this \ncountry, in tracking the money of terrorists, in protecting the \nhomeland, in making sure that we can try and convict terrorists when we \ncatch them.\n  So it is not good for the country to maintain those budget caps, and \nthat is what this bill does. It also relies on money that simply isn't \ngoing to be there by having this imaginary OCO funding.\n  The second way I think this bill is not good for the troops and not \ngood for the country is something that the chairman alluded to, and \nthat is there are restrictions on what the Pentagon can do by way of \nsaving money.\n  The chairman mentioned the A-10, but there are a whole host of other \nthings the Pentagon has proposed as a way to save money and spend it \nmore efficiently, which, over the course of the last 2 or 3 years, we \nhave blocked almost every attempt, not every attempt.\n  On personnel savings, we have made changes in the retirement system. \nWe have made changes in the healthcare system. We saved no money for 10 \nyears. For 10 years we saved no money in personnel costs while the \nPentagon tells us that, to be able to properly train our troops to get \nthem ready to go to battle, they need personnel cost savings.\n  If we don't give them that savings, last year, next year, this year, \nin the future, they will not have the money for readiness that they \nneed to train and equip our troops. So that is not good for the \ncountry.\n  There are a number of other provision areas--well, BRAC would be a \nbig one. We have seen our Army and Marine Corps shrink substantially. \nWe have seen our entire military shrink substantially. We haven't \nclosed any bases. That is not good for the country, to not find savings \nthere so that we can spend it on training our troops.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  Over the course of the last 2 or 3 years, we have wound up \nauthorizing and appropriating here in Congress substantially less money \nfor readiness than the President, now, not this year, assuming you \nimagine that this OCO money is actually going to appear.\n  The bulk of the OCO money makes up for the readiness gap. But, again, \nthat OCO money isn't going to be there. So I don't think this bill is \ngood for our country or good for our troops.\n  I do agree with the chairman that that is the criteria on which it \nshould be judged. But I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Forbes), the chair of the Subcommittee on Seapower and \nProjection Forces.\n  Mr. FORBES. I thank the chairman for his hard work on this bill and \nbringing it to the floor.\n  Mr. Speaker, as we listen today, one of the things that you really \nwon't hear outside of this room is anybody challenging the substance of \nthis bill. In fact, the opponents of this bill time and time again say \nwhat a really good bill it is.\n  You won't hear anyone challenging the partisanship of this bill \nbecause they will praise Chairman Thornberry for the bipartisan product \nhe has brought to the floor.\n  You won't hear them saying it is not the right amount of money in \nhere, that it is too much or too little, because it is almost exactly \nthe dollar amount that the President requested.\n  And you won't hear them say that they took this money from another \npriority because they agree this is the amount of money that should be \nspent on national defense.\n  The sole reason this bill is being opposed today and the sole reason \nthe President is going to veto it is because he wants to use national \ndefense as a bartering chip to get everything he wants for the IRS, the \nEPA, and all of the other political agendas that he has.\n  Can you imagine, as Chairman Thornberry mentioned, how strong he \nlooks around the globe when he says America is going to be strong, yet \nhe vetoes the bill that authorizes the national defense of this country \nand gives him almost everything he wants.\n  The President and the opponents of this bill also need to realize \nthat, if they defeat this bill, they will also defeat the construction \nof three destroyers, two attack subs, three small surface combatants, \nan amphibious ship, and they will delay the Air Force bomber and tanker \nprograms.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time we stop using national defense as some kind \nof political poker chip that can be gambled away. It is time we pass \nthis bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  First of all, I very specifically challenge the substance of this \nbill. The OCO funding and the way it is funding is not good for \nnational security and not good for our troops. The substance of the \nbill is precisely the issue and what it does for defense or does not do \nfor defense. That is why using the OCO funding is the exact wrong way \nto go.\n  The other thing I will say is I am quite confident that we will get a \nbill. Because that is the interesting thing about this argument.\n  As I have pointed out, the appropriators in the Senate have already \nrejected the OCO funding. So this $38 billion that we have in here is \ngone, done, poof, not going to happen. All right?\n  We are going to have to have a further debate about that in the \nAppropriations Committee to actually fund any of the stuff that we are \ntalking about in this bill. I am confident that we will have that \ndebate. I wish I could be more confident that it will come out in a \npositive way.\n  We need to lift the budget caps. We actually need to pass \nappropriations bills and not shut the government down. We will see what \nhappens on December 11.\n  But when that happens, we can pass this bill. We are not going to not \npass the NDAA. We just need to pass it the right way so it actually \nhelps our country and actually funds the programs that we are talking \nabout.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think the gentleman from Washington really makes the \ncase when he talks about appropriations, OCO will not happen that way.\n  This is not an appropriations bill. He is exactly right. There is \nmore to do to figure all of that out. But that is not a reason to vote \nagainst this bill. This bill can't fix what he is complaining about. \nBut it does do something. My point is why not do what it can.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from South Carolina \n(Mr. Wilson), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful to support the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 and also thank Chairman Mac \nThornberry for his leadership and hard work in bringing this important \nbill and conference report to the floor with bipartisan support.\n  I appreciate serving as the chairman of the Emerging Threats and \nCapabilities Subcommittee to oversee some of the most important aspects \nof the Department of Defense. The subcommittee's portion of the bill \nrepresents a comprehensive and bipartisan product. For this reason, it \nis sad that some of our Democratic colleagues may vote against this \nbill and, worse, that the President is threatening a veto.\n  Mr. Speaker, a veto or a vote against this bipartisan bill is a vote \nagainst security for American families and a vote against every member \nof the armed services and its military families.\n  It would be a vote against authorizations that would strengthen our \ncyber defense capabilities. It would be a vote against counterterrorism \nprograms and resources for our special operations forces currently \nfighting overseas. It would be a vote against reform efforts and \nprograms that would ensure America maintains superiority in all areas \nof science and technology.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues across the aisle to support this \nbipartisan National Defense Authorization Act and for the President to \nsign this important piece of legislation that will soon cross his desk.\n  A vote or veto against this measure is, simply put, a vote \nendangering American families and a vote against the American-dedicated \nservicemembers who mean so much to our country.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield myself 1 minute just to make two \nquick points.\n\n[[Page H6771]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, we will have a motion to recommit that \ntakes the money out of OCO and puts it into the base budget. So this is \na problem that our bill could fix.\n  We didn't have to buy into the OCO dodge and put money in there that \nwe knew wasn't going to exist. Our motion to recommit will make that \nobvious. We will simply take it out of OCO. We will put it in the \nbase budget so that you can do long-term planning with it and so that \nwe actually get out from under the budget caps.\n\n  The second point that I will make is that the previous speaker said \nthat voting against the Defense bill was all of those bad things. Well, \npeople have voted against the Defense bill.\n  In 2009 and 2010, all but seven or eight Members of the Republican \nParty voted against the Defense bill. They voted against the defense \nbill because they didn't like Don't Ask, Don't Tell in one instance and \nbecause they didn't like adding LGBT people to hate crimes in the other \ninstance.\n  So they all were perfectly willing to vote against the troops and do \nall of the awful things that the previous speaker said for social \npolicy reasons that had nothing to do with defense.\n  So voting against the defense bill does not mean that you don't \nsupport the troops, and that is proof because most of the people who \nare now saying that it does have voted against the bill in the past.\n  I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer).\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is my 35th year in the Congress of the United \nStates. I don't know that I voted against, prior to this year, either a \nDefense Appropriation bill or a Defense Authorization bill.\n  I will vote against this bill. I regret that I will vote against this \nbill because I regret that we have not gotten ourselves on a fiscally \nsound path in a bipartisan way that makes this country more secure not \nonly on the national defense side, but secure on the domestic side as \nwell.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this conference report, which I \nbelieve does a disservice to our men and women in uniform and \nundermines our national security.\n  I do not believe this is the chairman's fault. I want to make that \nvery clear. The chairman has been dealt a hand, and he is trying to \nplay the best hand he can. I understand that.\n  I agree fully, however, with the ranking member, with his concerns \nand opposition to this bill not because of most of its substance, but \nbecause of the adverse impact it has on so much else.\n  This continues the Republican sequester sneak-around strategy. What \ndo I mean by that? My Republican colleagues historically--since I have \nbeen here--talk about spending money. What they don't like to do is pay \nfor things. That is, of course, what we do with taxes.\n  It is not for free: national security, education, health care, law \nenforcement. You have to pay for it. And if you want to put a level of \ndoing something, you need to pay for that or you pass it along to the \nnext generation.\n  This bill continues the sequester sneak-around strategy of blowing \nthrough their own defense spending cap by misusing emergency overseas \ncontingency operations funding for nonemergency base defense spending. \nThat is why the Pentagon is opposed to this. That is why the Joint \nChiefs believe this is bad policy fiscal policy for the military.\n  As our military planners and Secretary Carter have made clear, such \nan approach to funding undermines the Pentagon's long-term planning \nprocess, which is based on multi-year budgets and predictable funding \nstreams.\n  Unfortunately, the fiscal policies of the leadership of this House \nover the last 6 years have been anything but predictable.\n  We avoided a shutdown of government yesterday, notwithstanding the \nfact that 151 of my Republican colleagues voted not to fund government \ntoday. Only Democrats ensured the fact that we kept the government \nopen. Ninety-one Republicans voted with us, but that was far less than \nhalf of their caucus.\n  This proposal undermines the chances for a bipartisan budget \nagreement to replace the sequester before the CR we passed yesterday \nexpires on December 11. Mr. Speaker, 151 Republicans voted even against \nkeeping government open for a short period of time, approximately 2 \nmonths.\n  This approach included in this bill also harms fundamental national \nsecurity priorities by characterizing core defense items as part of \ncontingency operations. That is not true. It is not fiscally helpful.\n  This includes the Iron Dome missile defense program and all other \nU.S.-Israel joint missile defense programs that help Israel protect \ncivilians from Hamas and Hezbollah rockets.\n  Additionally, this report continues to prevent the administration \nfrom closing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, which remains a \nrecruiting tool for terrorists and undermines America's role as a \nbeacon of constitutional rights and freedoms around the world. \nMeanwhile, we are spending $2.4 million per detainee every year for \nthose we hold in Guantanamo.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. HOYER. The ranking member of the Armed Services Committee opposes \nthis bill strongly, as do members of that committee. The President has \nmade it clear he is going to veto this bill not because he is against \nnational security.\n  Ironically, Republicans have come to the number that the President \nproposed. There is a difference. The President paid for his number. He \ndidn't pass it along to our children.\n  We must recognize this conference report for what it is: a vehicle \nfor partisan messaging and an instrument for breaking with the Murray-\nRyan principle of parity in defense and nondefense sequester relief. It \nis not a bill that makes America safer and a stronger force for justice \naround the world. Therefore, I will oppose it.\n  I thank my friend, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Smith) once \nagain for his work in trying to improve this bill in committee, on this \nfloor and in conference, and for his untiring work in support of the \nmen and women of our Nation's armed services.\n  I thank the chairman of the committee for the same thing. He was \ndealt a bad hand. I understand the hand he has to play. It is not good \nfor our country.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``no.''\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would just make three brief points.\n  Number one, as this debate goes on, it is increasingly clear that the \nreal debate is about budget and appropriations, not about this bill.\n  Secondly, I am one of those who voted to continue to fund the \ngovernment because I think it is essential that we pay our troops and \nthat there be no lapse in that. Unfortunately, we have today the White \nHouse playing politics with national security, and I think that is what \nmakes an ultimate agreement harder.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, the President was short in funding Israeli \nmissile defense. We fully fund Israeli missile defense in this bill, \nand it should be supported.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nTurner), the distinguished chairman of the Tactical Air and Land Forces \nSubcommittee.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1735, what would \nbe the 54th consecutive National Defense Authorization Act.\n  What we have here today is, unfortunately, partisan politics at its \nworst. You have people who are coming down to the House floor \ncondemning a bill that they voted for, and now they are going to vote \nagainst it because the President has decided that he is going to veto \nit. He is not going to veto it because of what is in this bill. He is \ngoing to veto it because there is not enough spending on the \nbureaucracies of the IRS and the EPA. We know this because not only has \nthe President said it, even Defense Secretary Ash Carter has said it in \nfront of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Now, if this were such a bad bill, you would think that it would not \nhave come out of our committee with full, almost unanimous, support by \nboth sides of the aisle, bipartisan, unbelievable support for this bill \nin virtually\n\n[[Page H6772]]\n\nits same structure that is coming to this floor. Only when President \nObama stepped forward and said, I am going to veto it because you are \nnot funding the IRS and the EPA, did it suddenly lose its bipartisan \nsupport.\n  This is not an issue about Republicans and Democrats. This is an \nissue about this administration. This administration, the author of \nsequestration, President Obama, set forth a plan that has been \ndismantling our military and needs to be set aside. Now, what we have \nin this bill is a bill that fully funds national defense, even as \nMinority Leader Steny Hoyer said, that fully funds it at the level that \nis requested by the President.\n  Now, you can say there are gimmicks, you can say there are tricks, \nbut you can also say what is important; and as you go to the experts to \ndetermine whether or not this bill works, Chairman Dempsey of the Joint \nChiefs of Staff stood in front of our committee, and when asked the \nquestion of does the structure of this bill fully fund national \ndefense, he said, absolutely, that he could spend it and that it would \nbe the number that is necessary. He also said it was the lower jagged \nedge of what is necessary for national security.\n  Mr. Speaker, if Chairman Dempsey says in front of our committee--and \nhe certainly is the expert--that this works, it works. I urge everyone \nto support this bill. Set aside sequestration, set aside partisan \npolitics, and support our men and women in uniform.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished chair of the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee, for the purpose of a colloquy.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank you for your \nleadership in getting us here today. I would like to ask the chairman a \nquestion if I might.\n  Does the legislation provide the President the exact amount of money \nhe requested in his budget request?\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. The gentleman is correct. The total is exactly the \namount that the President asked for.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Thank you. That is what I thought.\n  Does the chairman recall who it was that testified that the amount \nrequested for fiscal year 2016 for the national defense is ``at the \nragged edge of manageable risk?''\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. As the gentleman from Ohio just said, it was the \nChairman of the Joint Chiefs that said that this is the lower ragged \nedge of what it takes to defend the country.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. And that individual is the President's senior \nmilitary adviser, isn't he?\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Yes, sir.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. That is what I thought.\n  Thank you, Chairman.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we have an easy choice here today: we can vote for a \nconference report that sends a bill to the President that provides him \nauthorized funding at exactly the level he requested, or we can send \nthe Nation below the ``ragged edge of manageable risk'' in its \nsecurity.\n  It is a bill that provides over a $320 million increase for our \nIsraeli allies on top of the $155 million in the President's request \nfor missile defense cooperation.\n  I would ask Members, especially those who supported the President's \nIran deal, to recall it is exactly this funding that the administration \nsaid was vital to Israel's security because of that deal and its \ntermination of multilateral sanctions on ballistic missile \nproliferation.\n  This is a bill that provides $184 million to fund an American rocket \nto end our reliance on Russian-made rocket engines. This is a bill that \nprovides the President's request of $358 million for Cooperative Threat \nReduction activities.\n  What does that mean? That is how we fight Ebola.\n  Mr. Speaker, my fellow Members, there are some tough votes that we \nhave to take around here from time to time. This is not one of them. \nVladimir Putin is bombing U.S.-backed anti-Assad forces in Syria. If \nyou want to make Putin happy, vote against this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, first of all, the reason that we are at the ragged edge \nof what defense needs is because of the budget caps. That is the issue. \nThat is the substantive issue and why this is important.\n  Tied into that is a regrettable fact. The chairman says repeatedly, \nlook, this is the authorizing bill. Don't talk to me about the budget. \nDon't talk to me about appropriations. The defense budget is over half \nof the discretionary budget. So, unfortunately, the defense bill is \nabout the budget and about the appropriations process.\n  As long as we have those budget caps locked in place, we will be at \nthe ragged edge of what we can do to protect our national security. We \nshouldn't be there. We should lift the budget caps. This NDAA locks in \nthose budget caps and uses the OCO dodge, which, as I have pointed out, \nthe Senate isn't agreeing to, so the $38 billion isn't going to be \nthere.\n  Even worse, what Secretary Carter has also said is that the OCO \nfunding simply perpetuates the 5 years of budget cuts and uncertainty, \nof CRs, of government shutdowns, of threatened government shutdowns, \nand of not being able to plan. Secretary Carter has been very clear. He \nopposes this bill because the OCO funding is not an adequate way to \nfund defense because it is 1-year money. It is a budget gimmick. It \ndoesn't give them the ability to plan and do what they need to protect \nour country and take care of our troops.\n  So opposing this bill because of the OCO funding is enormously \nimportant to our troops and is a substantive part of this. We cannot \nsimply dodge the budget issues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to respond briefly to the comment about the \ncommittee vote. We in committee said we didn't like the OCO funding and \nthat we needed that to be fixed. But we are coming out of committee. We \nare going to give it a chance to work its way through the process. No \nchanges were made, so we opposed it on the floor.\n  We didn't just wake up yesterday and oppose this. Democrats voted \nagainst this bill when it came through the House in the first place. \nThe critically important issue that we absolutely made a point of in \ncommittee was not fixed, so that is why we are opposing this bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Wittman), the distinguished chair of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to ask Congress to vote in \nfavor of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY16. I am proud \nthat this conference report takes significant steps towards rebuilding \nour military and readiness.\n  We prioritize training for our troops and maintenance and \nmodernization of our equipment and technology. This NDAA is critical to \ncarry out the military missions of this Nation effectively and \nsuccessfully in an increasingly dangerous world.\n  Recently, former Secretary of State Dr. Henry Kissinger proclaimed: \n``The United States has not faced a more diverse and complex array of \ncrises since the end of the Second World War.'' This statement holds \ntrue today as we combat ISIS in the Middle East, as Russia again tests \nour commitment to global leadership, and as China continues to increase \nits defense spending to record levels.\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress has a constitutional duty of providing for the \ncommon defense of our Nation. If Congress and the President fail to act \non the NDAA, we forgo our constitutional duty, and we weaken the \nsecurity of our Nation and ability to confront crises that occur around \nthe globe.\n  It is also important to point out that this is not the time to play \npolitical games with our national security or to hold hostage funding \nand authorization for the military for political gain. Our\n\n[[Page H6773]]\n\nNation and our men and women in the military deserve better, and they \ndeserve the proper support that Congress is under obligation to \nprovide.\n  As we have heard through testimony from our military leaders before \nthe committee, our military is approaching the ragged edge of being \nable to execute our Nation's defense strategy. By not passing this \nNDAA, or by allowing sequestration to continue to devastate our \nNation's military readiness, we place ourselves in a position where we \nwill be unable to defend against the threats we face today and in the \nfuture.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote in favor of the \nNational Defense Authorization Act of FY16.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with a lot of what the gentleman just said about \nhow critical national security is, yet the Republican majority insists \non maintaining those budget caps that are devastating to our national \nsecurity. They will not lift the caps that are causing precisely the \nproblems that were just described, and 151 of them voted yesterday to \ndefund the entire military by shutting down the government. So if we \nreally believe in all of those national security priorities, let's \nstart funding them. Lift the budget caps and actually pay for it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Davis).\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Speaker, I want to associate myself \nwith the ranking member because I think that we all work very, very \nhard on this committee, and I appreciate the work that our chairman has \ndone as well. I have to say I am speaking largely as someone who has \nnever not supported an NDAA. I actually did support it in committee, \nand I support it on the floor. But I think we are in a box, and \nsometimes when you get in a box, you have got to do something about it. \nYou can't just stay in there and sit. It means making some hard \ndecisions.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have listened in the committee when Secretary Carter \nwas there. I have to say I think he was a bit badgered in that \ndiscussion, but at the same time, he is a big boy and he can handle \nthat. Basically what he said is of course we support all those issues, \nof course we want a better budget for the men and women who serve our \ncountry because it is in the best interests of the United States of \nAmerica, but we also have to be concerned about the future, not just \nabout tomorrow. We have got to be able to do this for the men and women \nand for our country as we move forward.\n  That is what this doesn't do. We have got to give this a chance. \nThere has got to be a better chance. That is why I feel that I have \nbeen there. I have compromised; and there are a lot of members on that \ncommittee, honestly, who are not willing to compromise. We have tried \nto find that balance.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am really proud of the work that we have done on the \nMilitary Personnel Subcommittee. I am proud because we made some gains. \nWe have sort of shuffled some issues a little bit to be able to say to \nour leaders that we understand their concerns, we understand what \nreadiness means in this country, and we have got to deal with that. \nMaybe we can't deal with all these issues that we have tried to make \nsure we funded to the very, very highest limit that we could possibly \ndo.\n  We know there are some changes perhaps that are coming, and so we do \nit in an incremental way, in a slow way, and something that we think is \nin the best interests of the men and women and the country all at the \nsame time. We have got to do that. We have multiple global crises going \non in this country. So we can't just make a decision for today; it has \ngot to be down the line.\n  What is it that we need to do?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 30 seconds.\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. What is important? What was Secretary \nCarter talking about? Predictability. Not just for our folks at the \nPentagon to be able to make sure the men and women of this country are \nprovided with everything that they need, but we also need to be sure \nthat those who work with our country--we have a very strong contractual \nrelationship with the public-private sector in this country, and we \nneed to provide prediction for them as well. That is why I stand today. \nI believe it is in the best interests to go back and work this out.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has again \nexpired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. I work in a community of large numbers of \nmilitary families. And guess what, the military is no different from \nthe rest of our country. It is made safer and stronger by Homeland \nSecurity, by law enforcement, by environmental protection, and by \nstrong education programs. They care about all those things, so they \nwant us to stand up for their children and for their future.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can do this together. Let's take that chance. It is \nworth it.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the distinguished chair of \nthe Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I agree with the lady that we need to make hard choices, \nbut we don't need to do this in this bill. We can't solve the problems \nthat have been reiterated in this bill. This is a budget issue.\n  I serve on the Budget Committee as well, and I believe we need to \nundo sequestration for our national defense. We need to come up with a \ncomprehensive plan to address the cost drivers of our country that are \ncausing us to go into debt.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  We need to get our priorities back as a country and make sure we \nprovide for the common defense. We need to do that in the budget in a \ncomprehensive way.\n  But we don't need to hold our military hostage today by not approving \nthe expenditure of funds for the vital things that they need. That is \nwhat my colleagues are doing. I appreciate their intent. I look forward \nto working with them--many of us do--to solve this overall problem, but \ntoday our military need to know that we are standing behind them and \nthat we are going to authorize them with the things that they need.\n  This bill is full of the things that our country and our men and \nwomen in uniform need. As the chairman of the Oversight and \nInvestigations Subcommittee, we are doing an investigation dealing with \nthe transfer of detainees out of GTMO and what happened with Sergeant \nBergdahl and the Taliban Five. So I was especially proud of the part in \nhere that makes sure that the detainees are not removed from Guantanamo \nBay and brought into our local communities. In addition, we set up an \nadditional protocol so that the Secretary of Defense has to certify \nthat any detainees that go to a foreign country, that that country is \nable to detain them, keep them safe, and make sure that they don't go \nback into the fight and continue their terrorist activities.\n  This bill takes care of our troops. It addresses the threats facing \nus. We have so many. Whether it is what is going on in Ukraine and with \nRussia, whether it is dealing with ISIL, or whether it is a cyber \nthreat that we have, every day there are threats coming around us, and \nwe address them in this bill. That is why we need to pass it. It also \nprovides for the platforms that we need.\n  I urge my colleagues to do the right thing, to stand with our troops, \nto provide them with what they need, and to support this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck), the distinguished chair of the \nSubcommittee on Military Personnel.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Military \nPersonnel, I appreciate Chairman Thornberry's efforts to bring this \nconference report to the floor. His dedication to our Armed Forces, \ntheir families, and our veterans is commendable.\n\n[[Page H6774]]\n\n  Supporting the men and women who volunteer to pick up a weapon, stand \na post, and guard the freedoms and liberties that make our Nation great \nis a primary function of the Federal Government. Article I, section 8 \nof the Constitution, ``to raise and support Armies,'' ``to provide and \nmaintain a Navy,'' today with adoption of this conference report, we \nachieve that goal.\n  Included in the report are personnel provisions that will allow us to \nrecruit and retain the best and brightest, maintain an agile military \nforce, and ensure our brave men and women in uniform are given the \nbenefits they have earned and deserve.\n  The President has threatened to veto this conference report, even \nthough the report authorizes the amount he requested in his own budget, \nbecause he is not happy with the manner in which it is provided. He is \nusing our military men and women as political pawns to get increases in \nnondefense spending. I understand that he has urged some of my \ncolleagues to vote ``no'' today, and I want to make sure my colleagues \nknow some of the things they would be voting against:\n  A new retirement plan that provides options and portable retirement \nbenefits for individuals who serve less than 20 years, roughly 83 \npercent of the force;\n  A pay raise for our military men and women, along with many special \npays and bonuses, that are critical to maintaining the all-volunteer \nforce;\n  A joint uniform drug formulary between the Department of Defense and \nthe Department of Veterans Affairs so that transitioning servicemembers \nget to stay on the drugs that are working for them as they leave active \nservice; and\n  Enhanced protections for sexual assault victims to include expanding \naccess to Special Victims' Counsel, protecting victims from \nretaliation, and improving the military rules of evidence.\n  If the President follows through with his veto threat, servicemembers \nand their families will be deprived of these significant improvements \nto their compensation and quality of life.\n  I urge my colleagues to stand with our military men and women and \ntheir families and support this report.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire as to how much \ntime is remaining on each side.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Washington has 10 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 10\\1/2\\ minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  There was a comment earlier about the military being held hostage by \nthese other needs, and I think it is really important to understand \nthat, over the course of the last 5 years, what the military has really \nbeen held hostage to is the budget caps, one government shutdown, \nmultiple CRs, and multiple threatened government shutdowns. That is \nwhat is holding the military hostage.\n  If you talk to them about how they have tried to figure out what they \ncan spend money on and what they can't spend money on throughout that \nmadness--because we can't pass along a long-term budget, because we \ncan't lift the budget caps, because we can't pass appropriations--that \nis what is holding them hostage.\n  A 1- or 2-month delay in passing the NDAA--which, by the way, we have \npassed in December for the last 3 or 4 years--isn't going to hold them \nhostage at all. What is holding them hostage is that ridiculous budget \nprocess that I just mentioned.\n  And why do we have that ridiculous budget process? Because the \nRepublican majority insists on maintaining those budget caps. It is \nthose budget caps that are holding our military hostage. Unless we lift \nthem, we will not be able to adequately fund defense.\n  I heard a number of times over here that the only reason we oppose \nthis is because we want more spending on other programs. That is not \neven close to true, and it is obvious that no one has been listening to \nthe arguments that I have been making.\n  The reason we propose this is because it perpetuates our military \nbeing held hostage to budget caps, budget gimmicks, CRs, and threatened \ngovernment shutdowns. This bill has OCO funding in it. It does not have \nbase budget funding. It does not provide the same amount of money for \nthe President that the President's budget provides because it is not \nthe same money, and the type of money does matter. If you have actual \nbudget authority, if you have actual appropriations, you can spend them \nover multiple years because you know that they are going to be there.\n  It is absurd the way we have budgeted for the last 5 years, and what \nwe are doing in opposing this bill is standing up to that absurdity for \nmany reasons, I will grant you. Number one is to protect our national \nsecurity and the men and women who serve in the Armed Forces who have \nhad to live with that government shutdown, those CRs, those threatened \ngovernment shutdowns, and, most importantly, those budget caps that the \nmajority refuses to lift. Unless we lift those, the military is going \nto be in this situation in perpetuity, and that is unacceptable for our \nnational security.\n\n  It is all about national security. It is all about defense for why we \nare opposing this bill. We can't go on like this and have an adequate \nnational security. We have to lift the budget caps.\n  I will say one other thing. We have to raise taxes somewhere. In the \nlast 14 years, we have cut taxes by somewhere in the neighborhood of $7 \ntrillion. Now, granted, there are unquestionably places in the budget \nwe can cut, and we cut.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I yield myself an additional 2 minutes.\n  We have cut Medicare. I know we have cut Medicare because the \nRepublican Party ran all kinds of ads bashing us for cutting Medicare \nback in 2010. We found about $700 billion in savings that has extended \nthe life of the program and saved money, so we have saved money.\n  But the flat refusal to raise any revenue is what has got our \nmilitary with a hand around its throat, because, believe it or not, you \nhave to actually raise the money if you are going to spend it.\n  So as you stand up here complaining about all the things that we are \nnot funding in national security and then insist on maintaining the \nbudget caps and insist on not raising a penny in taxes, that is the \ngrossest hypocrisy I can imagine. If you are unhappy with how much \nmoney is being spent on the military, then have the guts to raise the \ncaps and raise the taxes to actually pay for it, or just stop talking \nabout it and accept it at that level.\n  We are opposing this bill because the budget process that we have \nbeen under is what is throttling our military. Until we break that \ngrip, until we get an actual appropriations process, until we get the \nbudget caps lifted, and until, I believe, we actually raise some \nrevenues to pay for it, we are not going to be doing adequate service \nto the men and women of our military.\n  I also want to say that I oppose this bill because it also continues \nto keep Guantanamo Bay open at the cost of nearly $3 million per \ninmate. In addition to being an international problem, it is \nunbelievably expensive and not necessary. We should shut Guantanamo. \nThis bill locks in place for another year that it will stay open and \ndoes not give the President any option or any flexibility in that \nregard.\n  So, again, don't tell me or anyone over here that we are voting \n``no'' for reasons that have nothing to do with national security. How \ncan you possibly look at the last 5 years of budgeting and the impact \nthat it has had on the Department of Defense and say that getting rid \nof the budget caps isn't absolutely critical to national security? I \nbelieve that it is, and that is why we oppose this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Speaker, I just want to make a couple of points. Number one is I \nshare a lot of the concerns about the effect of sequestration on the \nmilitary, but as this conversation continues, it is clearer and clearer \nthat the real problem here is budgets, and now we hear taxes.\n  This bill cannot solve either of those problems. We cannot rewrite \nthe Tax Code or raise taxes. We can't repeal ObamaCare. There are lots \nof things we can't do. But we can do some things, and we should do \nthat.\n  Secondly, a dollar of OCO is a dollar spent just as much as a dollar \nof base\n\n[[Page H6775]]\n\nis spent, and that is why I say I don't really think if you are on the \nground in Afghanistan you care about what the label put on the money \nis. And, by the way, the increase in the OCO account is operations and \nmaintenance money, which is only good for 1 year anyway.\n  Next point. In fiscal year 2013, Israel missile defense was funded in \nOCO, and yet we had Members on that side of the aisle, including some \nwho are complaining about that, vote for it. That is what we do \nsometimes.\n  Finally, this President signed into law the exact provisions on \nrestricting GTMO transfers.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield myself an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, this President signed \ninto law the exact restrictions on Guantanamo transfers that we have in \nthis bill. Now, is it all of a sudden such a big deal that he has \ndecided that he is going to veto the bill over it? I think that is a \nhard case to make.\n  Mr. Speaker, at this point, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot), the distinguished chair of the House \nSmall Business Committee.\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, the passage of an annual National Defense Authorization \nAct to lay out our Nation's defense and national security priorities is \none of our most important duties as Members of Congress.\n  This year is no different, especially given the very serious \nconflicts happening around the globe--in Eastern Europe, in the Middle \nEast, in the South China Sea--which have serious implications for our \nown security and for our allies.\n  This year's NDAA makes a number of positive changes to DOD small \nbusiness contracting policies to help ensure that small businesses \nthroughout the country can continue to perform the critical support \nfunctions that help make America's military still the best in the \nworld.\n  Mr. Speaker, having a small business industrial base means taxpayers \nbenefit from increased competition, innovation, and job creation. Since \n2013, we have lost over 25 percent of the small firms registered to do \nbusiness with the government--25 percent. That is over 100,000 small \nbusinesses. The reforms in this year's NDAA, the bill that we are \nconsidering now, takes steps to reverse that trend.\n  The White House has threatened to veto this bill. That is a shame \nbecause this bipartisan, bicameral bill defends small businesses and \nensures that the spirit of entrepreneurship is alive and well in our \nindustrial base. This isn't about political gamesmanship--at least it \nshouldn't be. This is about two of the most bipartisan issues in the \npolitical arena: the men and women in uniform and the small businesses \nthat employ half of our American workforce.\n  I sincerely hope that the President reconsiders and enacts this \nbipartisan, bicameral bill.\n  I want to thank a number of members of my committee who have \ncontributed to this year's bill, including Mr. Hardy of Nevada, Mr. \nKnight of California, Mr. Bost of Illinois, Mr. Curbelo of Florida, \nMrs. Radewagen of American Samoa, and Mr. Hanna of New York. I would \nalso like to thank a number of other Members and thank Mr. Thornberry.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup).\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Speaker, our military must always be available and \nable to ready, aim, fire at a moment's notice. The threats we face \naround the world today demand it; and as soldier and a veteran, I can \ntell you that ``ready'' in the military needs to be spoken as a \ncommand, not proposed as a question.\n  There is one crucial element: our military has to be ready to engage \nthe threats. This bill ensures our military readiness, and it ensures \nthat there is a plan for 2016.\n  From ISIS to Russia to North Korea, the threats we face are too \nserious to wait any longer. But in the same week that the President was \nsurprised by the Russians bombing U.S.-backed forces in Syria, he is \nthreatening to veto this National Defense bill.\n  Veto our national security, really?\n  I encourage the President to use his phone, and to paraphrase his own \nwords, to call the 1980s and ask for their foreign policy back because \nwe need it. That policy demands that our military must be backed by the \nfull confidence of this government now. This can't wait.\n  Pass this pay raise for our troops. Pass this to give our troops new \nretirement benefits. Pass this to keep our critical weapons systems at \nan operational level.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have been working on this legislation since the \nbeginning of this year. It is a good bill that adheres to the law, and \nit is the certainty our troops need.\n  Pass this bill. Our troops need it. They don't let you down. Don't \nlet them down.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York (Ms. Stefanik), the distinguished vice chair of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the conference \nreport to H.R. 1735, the fiscal year 2016 NDAA. I thank Chairman \nThornberry for his leadership, guidance, and tireless efforts on this \nimperative piece of legislation.\n  Just this past week, the major headline coming out of Afghanistan was \nthe Taliban's seizure of the prominent town of Kunduz. This serves as \nyet another reminder to us all that this region of the world remains \nunstable and brings about challenges to our national security. The \nfiscal year 2016 NDAA provides our Nation's Armed Forces with the \nresources they need to defend our national security.\n  Since September 11, the Army's 10th Mountain Division out of Fort \nDrum, which I am honored to represent, has been the most actively \nforward deployed division to Iraq and Afghanistan. Yet sadly, just this \npast month, Specialist Kyle Gilbert, a soldier from the 10th Mountain \nDivision, died in Afghanistan while serving our Nation.\n  In New York's North Country, our community and our military families \nunderstand what fighting for our Nation's liberties and freedoms truly \nmeans.\n  So when I express my support for the NDAA, the tools it provides and \nhow it enables our Armed Forces to defend our Nation from organizations \nwho create volatility and terrorism around the world, I am speaking for \nmy constituents, those servicemen and -women who are overseas right now \nin highly kinetic combat zones fighting to protect you and me, our \nfamilies, and our Nation.\n  Colleagues, the fiscal year 2016 NDAA allows for our Armed Forces to \nplan and operate according to what we as a nation have asked of them. \nWe must support the NDAA to maintain our readiness and provide for our \nmilitary.\n  As leaders here today, we know we cannot continue to task our troops \nwith doing more with less as defense sequestration cuts remain. The \nconference report to FY 2016 NDAA provides relief from these harmful \ndefense sequestration cuts, but more must be done.\n  Let me remind my colleagues across the aisle sequestration was \nproposed by this administration, signed into law by this President, and \npassed by a previous Congress.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman \nfrom New York.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. When the NDAA comes before the President's desk, I hope \nhe realizes a veto threat could threaten the safety of our Nation's \nservicemembers and our country's defense.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting and voting for the \nNDAA.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time.\n  I will go ahead and start with that last comment because it is a \npopular trope that is trotted out all the time about how sequestration \nwas the President's idea and, therefore, it is not our fault, which is \na fascinating argument because I was actually here when that\n\n[[Page H6776]]\n\nhappened, and I don't think it is clear exactly whose idea \nsequestration was.\n  What is clear is that the reason that we did the Budget Control Act \nand sequestration was because the Republican majority in the House was \nrefusing to raise the debt ceiling, refusing to allow us to borrow \nmoney at a time when we had to borrow it. How do we think that would \nhave impacted national security and our troops?\n  I voted against the Budget Control Act, but I have often said I don't \nhold anything against those who voted for it because they basically had \na gun to their head. The Budget Control Act was an awful piece of \nlegislation, but not raising the debt ceiling, not paying our debts, \nyou know, stopping the ability of the United States of America to \nborrow money, was clearly worse.\n  So this partisan argument that, oh, you know, sequestration was the \nPresident's idea so therefore it is not our fault is about as absurd an \nargument as I have ever heard. Number one, because like I said, the \nonly reason that that discussion was on the table was because it was \nblackmail for raising the debt ceiling, which had to be raised.\n  Number two, it has been a good 5 years since then. The Republicans \nnow control both the House and the Senate, and they had an opportunity \nto pass a budget resolution this year. They passed a budget resolution \nthat held those caps and sequestration firmly in place, and that is not \ngood for our troops and it is not good for our national security.\n  So let's move on to that appropriations process; get those budget \ncaps lifted for the sake of a whole lot of different issues. That \nbrings me back to the National Defense Authorization Act and the fact \nthat, by locking in the OCO, by accepting those budget caps, by using \nOCO funds, we are once again putting the Pentagon in a situation where \nthey don't know how much money they are going to have and they have no \npredictability whatsoever.\n  It is the OCO in this bill that is the reason that I oppose it and \nthe reason that most Democrats oppose it because that OCO is harmful to \nnational security. We need a real budget. We need real budget authority \nand real appropriations. Voting for a bill that puts in place the OCO \ninstead of that simply perpetuates the nightmare of the last 5 years of \nuncertainty. Like I said, we are going to have a motion to recommit \nhere in a moment that easily fixes this problem.\n  I agree with 95 percent of the rest of the bill. I don't agree with \nall of it. The chairman said, you know, we negotiated some things; they \nwere up, they were down. By and large, it is a good bill. But the 5 \npercent that is bad is so bad that it does justify a ``no'' vote \nbecause it perpetuates this bad budget situation and is a very easy \nfix.\n  Take the OCO out of it and put it in the base budget. It is very \nsimple. That is what we are going to propose in the motion to recommit. \nYou will see Democrats vote for that because we support funding this. \nWhat we don't support is maintaining the budget caps through an obvious \nbudget gimmick.\n  I had a fascinating conversation with a member of the Rules Committee \nyesterday on the other side of the aisle who said he was very, very \nproud of the Budget Control Act, said it was the best vote he had taken \nin Congress. Interesting that it was supposedly all the President's \nfault. But he really supported the Budget Control Act. He felt those \ncaps were absolutely necessary. And I said: Well, then you must oppose \nthe NDAA because it busts those caps by $38 billion. He said a lot of \nthings at that point, but he never answered my question.\n  So this dodge of saying that we are going to create sort of money \nthat really isn't money in order to, for one brief period of time, fund \nisolated programs within the Pentagon does not help national security. \nThe only thing that is going to help national security is by getting \nrid of the OCO dodge and budgeting honestly. So that is why we oppose \nthis bill.\n  Yes, I believe that budget caps should be raised for the other bills \nas well, in part, because I think a lot of those Departments are \nimportant to national security, as I mentioned: the Department of \nHomeland Security, the Department of Justice, the Department of the \nTreasury.\n  More than anything, we oppose this bill because of how bad it is for \nthe Pentagon. That is the reason the Secretary of Defense opposed it. \nThat is the reason all of the Joint Chiefs of Staff oppose it. They \nwant an actual budget. They want actual, dependable money, the way \nthings used to be before 2010 when we would actually pass \nappropriations bills and they could plan more than a month or two at a \ntime. If we pass this bill, we simply perpetuate that process.\n  We will pass an NDAA. We will resolve one way or the other our \nappropriations difference, and we will get it done, but passing this \nbill now simply perpetuates a bad situation that is bad for our troops \nand bad for national security. For that reason, I oppose it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to start with one of the points I made at the \nbeginning, and that is to thank the staff, especially on both sides of \nthe aisle, who spent a lot of hours, disrupted a lot of plans, put in \nincredible effort back and forth to come up with this conference \nreport. Members on both sides of the aisle and both sides of the \nCapitol contributed to the product that we are about to vote on.\n  Mr. Speaker, for 53 straight years Congresses of both parties have \npassed and Presidents of both parties have signed into law Defense \nAuthorization bills.\n  There were a handful of times--and it is exactly four--when a \nPresident vetoed a Defense Authorization bill, and every single time it \nwas because of something that was in the bill. So it came back to \nCongress, there were adjustments made, it went back to the White House, \nand he signed it into law.\n  Never before has a Defense Authorization bill been held hostage, not \nbecause of something that is in it, but trying to force Congress to \ntake action on some other matter. Now, we have talked a lot today about \nappropriations, about budget, even about taxes. None of those things \ncan happen with the Defense Authorization bill.\n  The reason it has never happened before is because it would be \nirresponsible to hold defense hostage to another domestic agenda, a \npolitical agenda, even a broader budget agenda. And it unnecessarily \nthreatens the national security of the United States. This is a first, \nand this first is happening at a particularly dangerous time.\n  There is nothing in this bill that could solve the problem that we \nhave heard so much about. It is an authorization bill. It is not \nappropriations. It is not budget. It is not a tax bill. It is a defense \npolicy bill.\n  We have heard from time to time the military opposes it. No. They \nsay, ``I would rather do it differently,'' and I would, too. But I have \nspecifically asked general after general, Would you rather have the \nmoney or not, and they always say they would rather have the money. \nEven though it is not an ideal way to do budgets, it is better to have \nthe money than not.\n  By the way, there is a provision in here so that if we can, as I hope \nwe do, reach a budget agreement in a different appropriations matter, \nthe authorizations are adjusted accordingly.\n  The bottom line is, if Members vote against this bill, they are \nvoting against everything in it. You may say you are for it, but you \nare voting against it.\n  So what I think our troops deserve and what the world needs to hear, \nespecially at this point in time, is that Washington can work. We may \nnot solve all the problems today, but we can do something that is good \nand that we are willing to stand up and take action to help defend \nourselves. That is what this bill is about.\n  I hope Members will support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, today I will vote against H.R. 1735, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 because it is a \nbudget gimmick, shamelessly hiding behind the guise of national \nsecurity. Make no mistake--America would be less safe were this bill to \nmove forward in its present form.\n  The President has already said--as he has been saying for months--\nthat he will veto this bill if it misuses Overseas Contingency \nOperation funds to evade the congressionally mandated budget caps. \nSadly, but not surprisingly, Congressional Republicans did exactly that \nand worse. They had an opportunity to avoid leaving our troops in the \nlurch by pursuing a\n\n[[Page H6777]]\n\nbalanced and fair budget deal that would unwind the reckless sequester \nfor the national security activities at non-defense agencies like \nState, Homeland Security, and the VA.\n  In addition, this Authorization contains a budget-busting time bomb, \nthe National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund, which is such a naked attempt \nto rob sister accounts to pay for pet projects that, for the third year \nin a row, Congressional appropriators have refused to fund.\n  The Sea-Based Deterrence Fund was created in the FY15 Defense \nAuthorization because the Navy could not afford to simultaneously build \nback up to a 300-plus surface fleet and procure 12 Ohio-class \nreplacement nuclear submarines. The Sea-Based Deterrence Fund didn't \nsolve their problem of how SSBN(X) would be paid for. It simply shifted \nthat burden onto the larger Pentagon budget. According to a recent \nCongressional Research Service report, the new ballistic missile \nsubmarine program is expected to cost $139 billion. Sadly, the account \ngrew worse in conference by expanding its use to also include attack \nsubmarines and aircraft carriers. This account is emblematic of a \nlarger problem, which is that this Defense Authorization marches our \ncountry towards a complete rebuild of our nuclear arsenal and triad, \nsomething that a Congressionally-appointed National Defense Panel \nestimated will cost up to $1 trillion.\n  While I cannot support this bill, I want to acknowledge the \nleadership taken by the House and Senate Armed Services Committee \nChairs and Ranking Members for tackling some tough issues in this \nAuthorization that previous efforts have ignored. This bill includes \nbipartisan acquisition reform aimed at containing defense spending, \ndifficult but necessary military retirement and benefit changes, and \nmakes strides towards rightsizing the Pentagon workforce.\n  Critically, it includes provisions that I championed to reform and \nextend the Afghan Special Immigrant Visa (SW) program for those brave \nAfghan men and women who risked their lives to aid our troops, but are \nnow in danger as a result of their courageous service. We cannot allow \nmore of our Afghan allies, and their families, to fall victim to the \nmerciless Taliban. Should this Defense Authorization succumb to a \nprotracted political fight, these provisions dealing with the Afghan \nSIV program should be broken off and moved through Congress as \nstandalone legislation. I am prepared to introduce and push such a \nbill, as I've done in the past.\n  Though some hard decisions were made in this Defense Authorization, \nthat leadership is overshadowed by continued budget gimmickry on \nOverseas Contingency Funds, the Sea Based Deterrence Fund, and harmful \npolicy riders such as the continued effort to prevent the \nadministration from rightfully closing Guantanamo Bay.\n  Both the House and Senate Ranking Members of the Armed Services \nCommittees could not support this bill. Nor can I. The president will \nveto it. That's because our men and women in uniform should not be \ntaken hostage in a budgetary circus. Just yesterday, 151 Republicans \nvoted to shutdown the government, including our military. America \ncannot be great if it's subject to one manufactured crisis after \nanother. We can get this right. All it would take is a little \nleadership and some common sense. Sadly, both are in short supply in \nthis process.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. All time for debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to House Resolution 449, the previous question is ordered.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at \nthe desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. I am.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Smith of Washington moves to recommit the conference \n     report on the bill H.R. 1735 to the committee of conference \n     with instructions to the managers on the part of the House \n     to--\n       (1) agree to section 1501 of the Senate amendment in lieu \n     of section 1501, as passed by the House;\n       (2) agree to section 1505 of the Senate amendment in lieu \n     of section 1504, as passed by the House;\n       (3) disagree to section 4303 in the conference substitute \n     recommended by the committee of conference; and\n       (4) insist that the conference substitute recommended by \n     the committee of conference be modified--\n       (A) by transferring the funding table in section 4303 to \n     appear after the last line of section 4301 so as to be \n     included in the funding table in section 4301;\n       (B) in section 1301(b), by striking ``section 1504'' and \n     inserting ``section 301'';\n       (C) in section 1301(b), by striking ``section 4303'' and \n     inserting ``section 4301''; and\n       (D) in section 1522(a), by striking paragraph (4).\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington (during the reading).

Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), the majority leader, for the purpose of inquiring about the \nschedule for the week to come.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, on Monday, no votes are expected in the House.\n  On Tuesday, the House will meet at noon for morning-hour and 2 p.m. \nfor legislative business. Votes will be postponed until 6:30.\n  On Wednesday and Thursday, the House will meet at 10 a.m. for \nmorning-hour and noon for legislative business.\n  On Friday, the House will meet at 9 a.m. for legislative business. \nLast votes of the week are expected no later than 3 p.m.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will consider a number of suspensions next \nweek, a complete list of which will be announced by close of business \ntomorrow.\n  In addition, the House will consider H.R. 3192, the Homebuyers \nAssistance Act, sponsored by Representative French Hill of Arkansas. \nThis bipartisan bill will provide relief to everyone who is doing their \nbest to comply with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's mortgage \nloan disclosure rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, the House will also consider H.R. 538, the Native \nAmerican Energy Act, sponsored by Representative Don Young of Alaska, \nwhich is necessary to expedite energy production on tribal lands.\n  And, finally, Mr. Speaker, the House will consider H.R. 702, \nsponsored by Representative Joe Barton of Texas. Oil exports are key to \ncreating American jobs and furthering America's energy renaissance.\n  Given the increased security threats facing the United States and its \nallies, the presence of more American oil in the global marketplace \nwill offer more secure supply options. This will provide America with \ngreater foreign policy influence as well as strengthening our economic \nand national security.\n  I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the gentleman for that information.\n  Mr. Speaker, the last 2 weeks have been filled with a lot of things \ngoing on in this House. But I know the majority leader would be \nprofoundly disappointed if I didn't ask him about one thing that \ndoesn't seem to be going on, but which I think is critically important.\n  I know the majority leader, Mr. Speaker, joins with me in not wanting \nto see American jobs lost overseas or American jobs not created here in \nAmerica for American workers because we are able to make products and \nsell them overseas.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I would ask the distinguished majority leader, \nknowing full well, as he does, that Jeff Immelt, the CEO of GE, was \nhere; and he spoke to both Democrats and Republicans. I know he talked \nabout 500 U.S. jobs going overseas because we have not yet reauthorized \nthe Export-Import Bank.\n  The Senate voted 64-29 to reopen the Bank. They voted in July. Almost \ntwo-thirds of the United States Senate.\n  As the majority leader is tired of hearing, I know, but I still \nbelieve there is a significant majority of Members in this House that \nwould vote for it.\n  Now, I want to tell you, Mr. Speaker, I was extraordinarily pleased \nto read--I didn't hear, but read--the majority leader's comments when \nhe was talking about the failure of the Senate to proceed on a vote of \ndisapproval or approval on the agreement with Iran on nuclear arms \ncontrol.\n  He said he was deeply distressed that ``so consequential that they \ndemand revisions to the Senate's procedures.'' And he went on to say \nthose revisions would be ``to let the people''--in this case, the \nSenate--``have a voice'' That was quoted in The Wall Street Journal \njust a few days ago.\n  I know the gentleman doesn't want us to lose jobs. I know he is \nquoted as saying that the people's voice ought to be heard. I know that \nhe shares with me that this is the people's House.\n  And I ask the gentleman: It is not on the schedule next week, but \ndoes the gentleman expect the Export-Import Bank to be voted on in this \nHouse before the end of this month?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman.\n  In honor of the late Yogi Berra, ``It's like deja vu all over \nagain.'' There is no action scheduled in the House on Ex-Im.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, that is the answer I expected. That is the \nanswer I have been getting. And, very frankly,\n\n[[Page H6781]]\n\nthat is the answer this House has been getting.\n  I know some of my Republican friends are very frustrated by that \nanswer, and I know all of our side is frustrated by that answer.\n  I will say respectfully to my friend I would certainly hope we could \nbring that bill to the floor.\n  Win or lose, whether you win or I win or Export-Import Bank is \nreauthorized or not, you are correct: the voice of the people should be \nheard on such a critical issue for jobs in this country.\n  Also, I know that we had marked up in committees reconciliation \nbills. Those reconciliation bills repeal provisions of the Affordable \nCare Act and defund Planned Parenthood.\n  The gentleman I think knows full well that the United States Senate \nvoted on the Planned Parenthood issue and only got 47 votes for it. So \nin the one instance, we have an issue that got three less than one-half \nof the United States Senate being proposed to come to this floor, and \nan issue that got 64 votes in the United States Senate, as the \ngentleman so correctly observed, is not yet scheduled.\n  Can the gentleman tell me whether or not these reconciliation \nprovisions are going to be brought to this floor, knowing full well \nthat they won't pass the Senate and, even if they did, the President \nwouldn't sign them and we would sustain that veto?\n\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Knowing the rules of reconciliation, I do believe it will pass the \nSenate.\n  The three committees that received reconciliation instructions from \nthe Budget Committee have marked up their portions, as the gentleman \nhas said.\n  I do expect the Budget Committee to meet in the near future to \ncomplete their work, and we will notify Members as soon as that is \nscheduled for the floor.\n  Mr. HOYER. Thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, we may have a difference of opinion, but perhaps we will \nsee who is right on whether it passes the United States Senate or not. \nI understand reconciliation only needs a majority, but we will see.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to also ask the majority leader: One of the \nissues that I know the majority leader has been working on--and I know \nthat all of us on this floor feel it to be very, very important to pass \nbefore October 30, when the highway bill authorization expires, and I \nknow the gentleman from California is a strong supporter of it. Clearly \nwe need to invest in infrastructure, again, to expand the economy.\n  Can the gentleman tell me what prospects we have on passing or at \nleast considering the highway bill?\n  I yield to my friend.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  As the gentleman knows, the hardest thing to do in this town is to \nfind pay-fors. But Chairman Ryan continues to have bipartisan \ndiscussions on ways to pay for the long-term highway bill.\n  I have had follow-up meetings with him today, and they are \nprogressing over in the Senate. I have met with Chairman Shuster even \ntoday as well, and I expect an announcement very shortly on committee \nmovement.\n  We will advise Members as soon as action is taken to schedule it for \nthe floor.\n  Mr. HOYER. I thank the leader.\n  I hope that optimism is realized and that we do have the opportunity \nto consider a highway bill. I would urge the majority leader to urge \nthose who are working on a resolution that the pay-fors, which are \ndifficult, as he observes, are pay-fors which can be supported in a \nbipartisan fashion.\n  I think that is important not only to pass the Senate, but to be \nsigned by the President. And we all, I think, share the view that this \nis a very, very important bill for us to get done.\n  With that, unless the majority leader may want to reconsider and tell \nme the Export-Import Bank is coming to the floor, which apparently he \ndoesn't, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/house-section/article/H6781-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6781]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n HOUR OF MEETING ON TOMORROW; AND ADJOURNMENT FROM FRIDAY, OCTOBER 2, \n                   2015, TO TUESDAY, OCTOBER 6, 2015\n\n  Mr. McCARTHY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate Johnstown, \nPennsylvania, for hosting the first-ever Kraft Hockeyville USA game \nthis week and the Pittsburgh Penguins for their 4-2 victory over the \nTampa Bay Lightning in the game.\n  The Kraft competition to choose America's Hockeyville was conducted \nin partnership with the National Hockey League Players' Association and \nthe National Hockey League. Towns across the country submitted stories \nshowing their passion for hockey, and more than 20 million votes were \ncast. But as the contest results revealed, few places in America love \nhockey like Johnstown does, and Johnstown rightly deserves the title, \n``Hockeyville, USA.''\n  Johnstown was the home of the fictional hockey team the Charleston \nChiefs in the 1977 movie, ``Slap Shot.'' Scenes from the movie were \nfilmed at Cambria County War Memorial Arena. We also can't forget the \nJohnstown Jets, who played here from 1950 to 1977 and won five Eastern \nHockey League championships from 1951 to 1962.\n  As Penguins coach Mike Johnston said after the Penguins' victory: \n``It's a great arena.

As a result of the \nSyrian civil war and continuing military operations against ISIL, over \n4 million people have been forced to seek refuge outside of Syria.\n  The Syrian crisis has quickly become an international crisis, and it \nrequires the attention and the assistance of every nation. Many may see \nthis crisis as a distant problem, but the reality is this is a global \nworld now and everyone is interconnected.\n  As each nation continues to resettle refugees, we must ensure that \nthey are provided the best resources, and this requires international \ncooperation. It is not just about providing financial assistance, but \nunderstanding that these refugees are people. They are people who have \nbeen forced out of their country, might have left their families, and \nare struggling to survive on a daily basis.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the U.S. is committed to accepting more refugees, I \nurge our country to have compassion and to commit to providing the \nnecessary resources to address this ongoing crisis.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/house-section/article/H6781-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6781-H6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           THE GENOCIDE OF CHRISTIANS ACROSS THE MIDDLE EAST\n\n  (Mr. ROHRABACHER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I join my colleague from Orange County, \nCalifornia, and her deep concern for what is going on in the Middle \nEast.\n  Today I rise to speak out about the genocide that is taking place in \nthe Middle East, that is being committed against Christians across the \nMiddle East. They are being victimized and targeted for genocide. \nViolent radical Islamists have targeted Middle Eastern Christians for \nextinction, killing them, forcing them from their homes, and burning \ntheir churches.\n\n[[Page H6782]]\n\n  Hundreds of thousands of Christians have been forced to flee. The \nUnited States needs to do what we can to save these Christian victims, \nas we have saved other refugees throughout our history\n  Mr. Speaker, all of us who believe in religious freedom and tolerance \nneed to stand up and state clearly that we won't sit quietly as a \ngenocide takes place on our watch. I ask my colleagues to join me in \ncosponsoring a resolution that I have here in my hand, that resolution \ndeclaring Middle Eastern Christians as targets of genocide and giving \nthem priority for immigration and refugee status.\n  We have been silent already for too long. It is time for this body to \nmake sure that our words are heard and our deeds are taken. This is a \ngood place to start, and I ask my colleagues to join me in this \nresolution which I will now submit to the United States House of \nRepresentatives.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/house-section/article/H6782-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          BUDGET NEGOTIATIONS\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE.

But this CR is only good until December 11, and it \nleaves out funding for a vital program like the Ex-Im Bank. In less \nthan 10 weeks, we will be right back here fighting against another \ngovernment shutdown.\n  Mr. Speaker, do we really want to fail our military veterans, our \nseniors, our families, and our voters?

Mr. Speaker, we are called the people's House for a \nreason. We are sent to Washington to be the direct voices of our \nconstituents back home. Last week, it was my honor to take action on an \nissue that was originally brought to my attention by one of my \nconstituents from Green Valley, Arizona.\n  Loren Thorson served in World War II as a Navy commander. When he saw \na report 5 years ago describing a little-known tax increase in the \nAffordable Care Act that is hurting families and is scheduled to hit \nseniors in 2017, he looked into it and knew something had to be done. \nHe has sent letters, made phone calls, written editorials, and done \nmuch more to raise the alarm about this little-known issue.\n  After hearing about this issue from him, my office has worked with \nMembers from both parties in the House and in the Senate to move the \nissue forward and fix it. Those efforts resulted in my introduction \nlast week of bipartisan legislation, with my lead, to repeal this tax \nhike and put Loren's ideas into action.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is how our government is supposed to work. I am \ngrateful for Loren's tireless efforts to protect seniors and middle \nclass families, and I will continue to work to advance his and my \nconstituents' ideas in Congress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "01"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/01/house-section/article/H6782-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6782]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mrs. BUSTOS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. BUSTOS. Mr. Speaker, for too long, this Congress has governed \nfrom one crisis to the next. Yesterday, when we were just hours away \nfrom another self-inflicted Washington wound, two news pieces were \npublished that I would like to share: number one, the CEO of Honeywell, \na company with a significant presence in my district, published an \narticle about the economic damage of Congress' failure to reauthorize \nthe Export-Import Bank; then Bloomberg published a story with the \nheadline, ``Boeing Risks Losing $1.1 Billion Jet Order on Ex-Im \nShutdown.''\n  Washington gridlock is putting the jobs of thousands of Americans at \nrisk. This includes hundreds of the people I serve in Rockford and the \nQuad Cities.\n  But today is a new day; it is a new month. Mr. Speaker, I urge all of \nmy colleagues to turn over a new leaf of bipartisanship.

Mr. Speaker, just a few minutes ago, I \ncast an affirmative vote for the National Defense Authorization Act for \n2016. However, I do have great concern over an important measure which \nwas all but removed from the legislation we voted on today.\n  Earlier this year, I authored the Medical Evaluation Parity for \nServicemembers, or MEPS, Act. The MEPS Act would improve military \nsuicide prevention by instituting a mental health assessment for all \nincoming military recruits, which can be used as a baseline for \nevaluations throughout their military careers. The conferenced version \nof the NDAA merely calls for the Department of Defense to continue to \nstudy such a screening.\n  Mr. Speaker, this issue has been studied thoroughly over the past \nseveral years. I strongly urge the Pentagon to act quickly to take \nsteps in better assessing the mental health of our servicemen and -\nwomen with a commonsense baseline evaluation.\n  A recent Army study found that nearly one in five Army soldiers enter \nthe service with a psychiatric disorder, and nearly half of all \nsoldiers who tried suicide first attempted it before enlisting.\n  I call on the Pentagon to stop studying to death the death of our \nsoldiers.
