The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, early in 2015, the Department of \nHomeland Security removed the TSA Director and Administrator after it \nwas revealed that banned items made it through screening in different \nparts of our airports throughout the United States.\n  This didn't happen once or twice, but it happened 67 times out of 70 \ntries. That is a 90 percent failure rate. Any business would be out of \nbusiness if it failed 90 percent of the time to do what it is supposed \nto do.\n  We are not talking about selling goods and services. We are talking \nabout security--American security. But TSA is a government agency, so, \nto me, accountability doesn't seem to be a priority.\n  After this fiasco in 2015, the Administrator was replaced with a new \nAdministrator. I don't know that security is better or not--maybe it \nis--but we do know that the lines are longer and TSA efficiency is \nquestionable.\n  To find that out, just go to any of our airports and try to travel. \nTravelers are faced with wait times in excess of 3 hours just to get \nthrough security. Flights are missed and flights are delayed because of \nthe security chokepoint. It is ironic that people wait in line longer \nthan it takes them to fly from point A to point B. Security lines \nshould not take longer than the flight itself, but that is happening in \nour airports.\n  The TSA Director blames the passengers for the delays. So it is not \nTSA's fault; it is the flying public's fault for the long lines and \ndelays?\n  The cost to American taxpayers for TSA is $7 billion a year. Are we \nsafer, better off, and more secure because of this massive government \nbureaucracy? Americans need to answer that question.\n  TSA must also work on its treatment of passengers. I constantly hear \nin my congressional office from people who travel about the way they \nare treated by government employees at TSA when they try to go through \nsecurity.\n  Now, I know a lot of TSA employees. Some of those in Houston are \nwonderful people. Yet some TSA employees are rude, demeaning, and \ndisrespectful to the travelers. That has got to stop. There is no \nexcuse for it. Flying has become torturous for some travelers because \nof TSA.\n  Homeland Security must figure out a better way to protect and serve \nthe people, the flying public, without causing people to miss their \nflights. Maybe TSA should use trained dogs before and after the \nsecurity points to help check for explosives--I am not sure the \nanswer--but change the current model because it is not working.\n  This issue must be fixed, and the issue is not to blame the fliers. \nThe issue is TSA needs to respond to this issue. There are airports all \nover the world that screen passengers. Maybe TSA could learn something \nfrom some of these other airports about efficiency and security. This \nproblem must be fixed, and the answer is not to blame the Americans who \ntravel and blame them for waiting in line for 3 hours to catch a plane \nthat flies only 1 hour.\n  Airports should strongly consider moving to private screeners. The \nlaw allows this to happen, Mr. Speaker, but the law requires that, if \nan airport wants to use private screening companies, they must get the \nDepartment of Homeland Security's approval to use that screening \ncompany over TSA. That is an issue in itself. But the answer is not to \ncontinue having the same issues and problems that we now face.\n  People who travel a lot and travel rarely, when they talk about their \ntraveling experience, one thing they seem to always mention is the way \nthey have to go through screening and the way they are treated by TSA. \nRemember, a 90 percent failure rate is not acceptable.\n  The security must be better, and people must be treated better, \nbecause that is just the way it is.\n\n[[Page H2432]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2432-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2432]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                     SPECIAL IMMIGRANT VISA PROGRAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, for over the last decade, I have been \nworking with a bipartisan group to deal with helping some of the \nforeign nationals in Afghanistan who helped Americans' mission be able \nto escape the tender mercies of the Taliban and others with long \nmemories. These are men and women who helped us as guides, as \ntranslators, people who provided on-base security, construction \nworkers, and truck drivers--a vast array of people who helped us with \nour vital mission. As we have scaled down and moved on, it has left \nthese people vulnerable. We have example after example where the \nTaliban and al Qaeda have threatened them, have attacked their \nfamilies, held them for ransom, tortured them, and, in some cases, \nkilled them.\n  We have implemented a Special Immigrant Visa program that has enabled \nover 8,500 people to get to safety to protect themselves and their \nfamilies. I have witnessed some of these tearful reunions where a guide \nreturned, was able to escape to the United States, and united with the \nperson, the soldier, whose life he saved. This happens time after time.\n  Unfortunately, the process is hopelessly tangled. It is slow, and it \nis bureaucratic. We have over 10,000 people still in the pipeline. \nEvery year we struggle to be able to have sufficient visas authorized \nto be able to help thousands more who are at risk.\n  We have the National Defense Authorization Act that is coming forward \nthat would pose another problem to help those who put their faith in \nus. This version would leave out all individuals who worked with the \nState Department and the USAID--critical parts of our mission in \nAfghanistan. It would leave off all the on-base staff who worked in \ndirect support of the Department of Defense, people who did \nconstruction, firefighters, on-base security, maintenance, and \nadministrative support, people whose services were vital and whose \nservice to the United States is well known and who are at risk.\n  We are hopeful that as this bill comes to the floor that the House \nwill be able to work with us to modify these unnecessary restrictions, \nto give more time to process and allow more people to come to safety.\n  We have a moral obligation to protect people who put their lives on \nthe line to support Americans in these troubled areas. I would hope \nthat we would, once again, be able to make necessary adjustments to be \nable to try and help more come to safety.\n  I have been working with my good friend Adam Kinzinger, who \nrepresents some of the newer Members of the House who actually served \nin theater, who are committed to helping people whom they saw help us.\n  I would hope, as the process comes forward, we can consider \namendments to be able to reduce some of these restrictions; and then I \nhope, as it works its way through the legislative process to the Senate \nthat does not have anything in their version of the bill speaking to \nthe Special Immigrant Visas, that we will be able to do our job to make \nsure that we are not having people at risk, their families threatened, \nand undermining the credibility of the United States.\n  Remember, around the world, foreign nationals help us with our \nmissions; and if we send a message that we are not going to stick with \nthem when the going gets tough, then they are going to be much less \nlikely to help us wherever it is in these trouble spots. America will \nbe more vulnerable as people who have already helped us are at risk. We \ncan do better.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2432-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2432-H2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        SUPPORTING OUR VETERANS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Zeldin) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ZELDIN. Mr. Speaker, as a nation, supporting our veterans must \nalways be one of our highest priorities. These brave men and women who \nwillingly and selflessly put their lives on the line while defending \nour country deserve the highest quality of life and care once they \nreturn home.\n  According to the Suffolk County Veterans Service Agency, there are \n83,254 veterans who live in my home county of Suffolk. With the highest \npopulation of veterans by county in New York State and one of the \nhighest populations in the country, there is a significant need for \nincreased care options for our veterans in Suffolk.\n  There are so many options of quality care for veterans, but too often \ntheir choices are limited. Quality care can also come at great expense.\n  In an effort to expand access to care for our veterans, I recently \nintroduced bipartisan legislation in Congress, H.R. 2460, which would \nensure that 70 percent or more service-connected disabled veterans are \nable to receive adult day health care, a daily program for disabled \nveterans who need extra assistance and special attention in their day-\nto-day lives. It comes at no cost to the veterans and their families \nbecause the program is defined as a reimbursable treatment option \nthrough the Department of Veterans Affairs. This legislation has strong \nbipartisan support in Congress, with over 45 cosponsors, including the \nentire Long Island congressional delegation. My bill would greatly \nexpand this great option of care for veterans on Long Island and across \nthe country.\n  Just last month, on April 20, 2016, the House Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee hosted a hearing of the Subcommittee on Health regarding my \nbill, and on April 29, 2016, the Health Subcommittee held a markup and \nfavorably forwarded my bill to the full committee for final \nconsideration before being sent to the House floor for a vote.\n  Working with my colleagues in the House and various veterans service \norganizations, I will continue pushing to get this bill passed out of \ncommittee in earnest to allow this bill to come to the House floor this \nyear.\n  While serving in the New York State Senate, I secured the funding \nnecessary to create the PFC Joseph P. Dwyer Program, a peer-to-peer \nsupport program for veterans suffering from post-traumatic stress \ndisorder and traumatic brain injury. PFC Dwyer, from Mount Sinai, New \nYork, received nationwide recognition for a photograph that went viral \nshowing him cradling a wounded Iraqi boy while his unit was fighting \nits way up to the capital city of Baghdad. Sadly, after returning home \nand struggling with PTSD, PFC Dwyer died in 2008. Created in his honor, \nthe Dwyer Program was initially launched in the counties of Suffolk, \nJefferson, Saratoga, and Rensselaer. Since 2013, the program has \nexpanded to over a dozen counties across New York.\n  Earlier this year, I introduced bipartisan legislation in Congress, \nH.R. 4513, that will expand the Dwyer Program on a national level so \nthat every veteran in the U.S. eventually has access to a peer-to-peer \nsupport group. This bill has strong bipartisan support, including the \nentire Long Island congressional delegation. I will continue working \ntogether with them and others in the fight to expand the Dwyer Program.\n  Additionally, on the east end of Long Island, working closely with \nthe Peconic Bay Medical Center and VA, I secured an east end healthcare \nfacility for veterans and their families at Peconic Bay's Manorville \ncampus.\n  After so bravely serving our country, this facility provides an \nimportant new option for veterans, increasing access to care for those \nwho live on Long Island's east end, while still allowing them to \ncontinue receiving other services and ongoing treatment at the VA \nhospital in Northport.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  There is so much more that Congress can do to improve the quality of \nlife for our veterans. I will continue working to ensure that my bills \nthat previously passed the House are signed into law, including H.R. \n1569, to protect the benefits of deceased veterans, and H.R. 1187, \nwhich would eliminate the loan limit that the VA can guarantee for a \nveteran.\n  Congress also must continue to reform the VA wherever it underserves \na veteran. A recent series of USA Today articles reported that VA \nsupervisors in multiple States instructed employees to falsify wait \ntimes. They must be held accountable. This is a slap in the face to our \nvets.\n\n[[Page H2433]]\n\n  Just last year the House took a step forward by passing the VA \nAccountability Act of 2015, H.R. 1994, legislation that I cosponsored \nthat would make important reforms to the VA system, which will provide \nthe necessary resources and the flexibility the VA needs to hold poor-\nperforming employees accountable.\n  While I believe that the VA has 99 percent of employees generally \ncaring about the work they do and want to help veterans, we must always \nensure that the other 1 percent of those who are not acting in the best \ninterest of veterans are held accountable. Our veterans deserve only \nthe highest quality of care at our VA facilities.\n  Fighting for our veterans who fought for us always has been and will \nalways be one of my top priorities. I will continue my work in Congress \nto improve our veterans' quality of care in any way that I can.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2433-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  RECOGNIZING KEY WEST FIRE DEPARTMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nKey West Fire Department on their Class 1 Insurance Service Office \nrating, the highest achievable rating that a fire department can \nattain.\n  They are 1 out of fewer than 200 departments in the Nation to receive \nthis score, which is based off of a multitude of factors, including \ntraining, response time, and how well they are equipped.\n  This rating also helps by providing residents with the lowest fire \ninsurance rates possible, something I am sure that all Key West \nresidents appreciate.\n  I commend Fire Chief David Fraga and the entire Key West Fire \nDepartment on their diligent work and their devotion to keeping \neveryone in Key West safe. We are very fortunate to have a strong team \nof firefighters protecting us.\n\n\n               Recognizing Florida Keys Marathon Airport\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise to congratulate the \nFlorida Keys Marathon Airport for officially becoming an international \nairport on April 20, 2016.\n  For 8 years the staff has worked to attain this clarification. It \ncomes as no surprise to me that they were able to achieve this feat. I \ncommend the Florida Keys Marathon Airport on receiving this well-\ndeserved designation. This airport will provide additional travel \noptions for the families living in our community and the millions of \ntourists who visit south Florida every year.\n  Congratulations to Mayor Senmartin, Vice Mayor Kelly, council members \nZieg, Coldiron, and Bartus, and city manager Chuck Lindsey and, also, \nformer Mayor Ramsey and former city manager Mike Puto, all who worked \nvery hard to make this a reality.\n\n\n                  Recognizing Officer Mario Gutierrez\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Miami-\nDade Police Department's own Officer Mario Gutierrez, who received the \nMedal of Valor, the highest decoration of honor given to public safety \nofficers in the United States.\n  In 2013, Officer Gutierrez was on a routine call when he noticed an \nindividual exhibiting strange behavior at a gas station near Miami \nInternational Airport. As Officer Gutierrez approached, the man \nattempted to light a gas pump on fire. In an attempt to disarm the \nassailant, who was holding a knife, Gutierrez received several stab \nwounds that nearly cost him his life.\n  Had the assailant been successful in causing a mass fire, many lives \nmay have been lost on that day. Officer Gutierrez went above and beyond \nthe call of duty to protect the members of our community. We thank him \nfor his service, his selflessness, and his bravery in the face of \ndanger.\n  Officer Gutierrez, thank you. You are a true hero.\n\n\n                      Recognizing Mr. Brian Reedy\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize Mr. \nBrian Reedy, a seventh grade visual arts teacher from Zelda Glazer \nMiddle School in my south Florida congressional district.\n  In 2014, Mr. Reedy became the visual arts instructor at Zelda Glazer \nand, in only 2 years, has propelled the program to national \nrecognition. Mr. Reedy has received numerous accolades for his work at \nZelda Glazer, with his fellow teachers referring to the work of his \nstudents as magnet quality. His classroom, however, does not require an \napplication to enter like many art magnet programs in south Florida. \nAny student can register.\n  Students have had their art pieces showcased from local shows in \nMiami all the way to the New York Scholastic Art Awards. What is even \nmore impressive is that Mr. Reedy works with a wide range of talents, \nincluding those just getting started to people who have been painting \nfor many years.\n  As a former Miami-Dade County School Board member, I always \nappreciate and support teachers who encourage our youth to explore \ntheir passions in life, and Mr. Reedy does just that. It is an honor to \nrecognize Mr. Reedy for his great work at Zelda Glazer. I look forward \nto both his and his students' future successes.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2433-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2433]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     HONORING NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Utah \n(Mr. Stewart) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. STEWART. Mr. Speaker, along with many of my colleagues, I rise \ntoday to honor National Police Week.\n  One of the favorite things that I get to do as a Member of Congress \nis to ride with police officers as they go about their duties, and from \nSt. George to Salt Lake City I have had the opportunity to do this.\n  Sadly, many in our society, particularly among the press, have become \nhighly critical of law enforcement officers. Now, I recognize that not \nall law enforcement officers are perfect. People make mistakes. We all \ndo. But we can't let the mistakes of a few tarnish the name of such a \nnoble and a brave profession.\n  Such criticism of police efforts doesn't come without a cost. It \nforces the officers to pull back, to become overly cautious, and to \nview every encounter that they may have through the prism of a lens of \na media event.\n  What is the result of this? We now know that crime rates have been \nrising across the country. Interestingly and sadly, they are rising in \nsome of the poorest communities, the communities that most need the \nhelp of an effective police force.\n  Now more than ever we need brave men and women who are willing to \nserve and to protect. As I have said, I have had the chance to go on \nseveral ride-alongs with several police departments. Again and again I \nhave been impressed with their hard work, their professionalism, and \ntheir willingness to put themselves at risk to protect other people.\n  There is a great example of this. I am reminded of the heroic actions \nof Officer Hone, a police officer who in the last year saved two young \ngirls in Salt Lake City. A disturbed man who had recently been released \nfrom prison and was on drugs broke into the home of two sisters, both \nof them college students. He began to viciously attack them. He took a \nknife and attempted to take their lives.\n  Fortunately, Officer Hone was in the area, heard the screams of these \nyoung girls, and just seconds before the intruder expected to take the \nlife of one of them, this heroic officer quickly diffused the \nsituation, literally saving her life.\n  Bree, the sister who was saved, said of this officer, ``He was so \nprofessional and calm. Right when we made eye contact, I knew I was \nsafe. It's a miracle that he had so much composure. He was our angel.''\n  This is just one example of the thousands of courageous police \nofficers we have in America. I am proud to live in a country where \nprofessionals are ready to put their lives at risk in order to serve \nand to protect members of their community.\n  Let us honor these police officers, their courage, their \nselflessness, and their dedication. Let us honor them not just this \nweek, but, frankly, all year round for the sacrifices they make for us.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2433-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2433-H2434]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING SALLY CLARK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor \nSally Clark, who was part of the class of 1963 at East High School in \nDes Moines, Iowa. I never knew her as Sally Clark because I knew her as \nSally Davis, my mother.\n  I am very appreciative that the class of 1963 allowed my mom to be \npart of a reunion in July of 1993 because my mom never graduated with \nthat class. Sally Clark dropped out of high school in 1962 and \neventually finished her degree much later by getting her general \nequivalency diploma with the help of my sister, who was the reason she \ndropped out of high school in 1962.\n  In looking at the program from that reunion in 1993, the fondest \nmemories my mom had of East High School were the friends she left \nbehind. In 1977, she left not only friends behind, but she left family \nbehind and moved our family to Taylorville, Illinois, where I grew up \nand where she inspired so many.\n  My mom passed away 17 years ago today. The reason I am here is \nbecause of the inspiration she was to me and to so many. I want to tell \nher what I couldn't tell her on Mother's Day: Your family is doing \ngreat. Your granddaughter, who you knew as a 2-year-old, just finished \nher freshman year of college. The grandsons you never met are doing \nfine as freshmen in high school. Mom, your whole family is doing well. \nAs a matter of fact, you have a great-granddaughter now that shares \nyour middle name. I am here on the House floor to fight to make sure \nthat we work in a bipartisan way to end the scourge of the cancer that \nkilled you and that has killed so many, young and old. We will never \nforget this fight and I will never forget that fight because of what \nyou meant to me and to so many. Mom, I love you and I miss you every \nday.

In fact, \nit was her idea to form the college where she had been a humanities \nprofessor for several years.\n  She was the first woman elected as president of the International \nCouncil of Fine Arts, and not only the first woman in Florida's first \nrotary club, the Rotary Club of Jacksonville, but she later became the \nfirst woman president of that club. She also became the first woman \nmember of a club in Jacksonville called the River Club. Again, the \nfirst woman member.\n  As you can tell, Dr. Fran Kinne was first in many ways and a role \nmodel to not only women in Jacksonville, Florida, but all across this \ngreat country. To those of us who know her well, she is also first in \nour hearts. A tireless advocate for education and young people, Fran \nKinne always reminded us that life is not about us, life is about \nothers.\n  She would tell her graduates each year to go out into the world and \nmake the world a better place. One of those graduates, Tim Cost, is now \nthe president of Jacksonville University.\n  So many of her students have made a difference not only in Florida, \nbut all across this great land. Last year, at the age of 98, she became \nthe Nation's oldest commencement speaker at a major college or \nuniversity.\n  The wife of an army colonel, Fran spent years overseas following \nWorld War II. She was in Germany, she was in Japan, and she was in \nChina. While her husband worked, so did Fran. She created postwar \neducation programs for children in Japan, and she went to class with \nyoung German students who accepted her as the caring American that she \nwas.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  She numbered among her friends Bob Hope, Winston Churchill, Charlton \nHeston, Billy Graham, and Steve Forbes. Fran Kinne brought Bob Hope and \nJack Benny together for their only joint appearance, and that was at \nJacksonville University. She is listed in over 25 ``Who's Who'' and \nsimilar publications, and six facilities in Iowa and Florida are named \nin her honor. Her autobiography is aptly named ``Iowa Girl: The \nPresident Wears a Skirt.''\n  Never intending to live in Florida, Fran came here with her husband, \nand, thankfully, for those of us in Jacksonville, she never left. She \nwas born in Iowa. She was educated at Drake University and graduated \nwith a bachelor's and a master's in music education. She remains a \nmember of the Board of Trustees at Drake University and is on the board \nof the Mayo Clinic in Florida. Since 1994, she has been the chancellor \nemeritus at Jacksonville University.\n  Her infectious enthusiasm for life and positive thinking goes on and \non. I visited her the other day, and she reminded me: If you laugh 100 \ntimes a day, that is the same thing as 20 minutes of physical exercise. \nShe would say: If you keep a positive attitude and if you smile a lot, \nthat will add 10 years to your life. Fran and I have always been good \nbuddies, and she has been a mentor to me just as she has been to \nthousands of her former students.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask you and Members of this House to join me in \ncelebrating the outstanding 99 years and counting of one of Florida's \nmost outstanding citizens: my good buddy, Dr. Frances Bartlett Kinne.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2434-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2434-H2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            CONGRATULATING DONNA EISENMAN ON HER RETIREMENT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Ros-Lehtinen) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I congratulate Donna Eisenman, who \nrecently retired after 40 years in working for American Airlines' \nWashington desk.\n  Donna Eisenman began her career as a flight attendant with Trans \nWorld Airlines in 1969. A year later, she transitioned to American \nAirlines for a position as a reservations agent in Philadelphia. In a \ntime before computers, Donna effortlessly sold airline tickets and \nhelped customers with travel arrangements.\n  In 1972, Donna moved to Washington, D.C., to start the next phase of \nher career. Donna spent the next 10 years working at the City Ticket \nOffice and at the ticket counter at Reagan National Airport. In 1982, \nshe transitioned to the Schedule Airline Ticket Office, which served \nDOD customers in northern Virginia.\n  Donna's efforts were so successful that she was asked to open a \ndifferent satellite office to assist Fort Belvoir travelers. Later, \nDonna was asked to reestablish a long-abandoned desk specifically \ndesigned to help government travelers. Donna accepted this challenge, \nand the American Airlines Washington desk was reborn.\n  For the next 28 years, Donna's unyielding commitment to customer \nservice and her natural sales ability provided government and frequent \ntravelers with the best experience in the industry. On March 25, Donna \nretired from American Airlines, and she is now spending time with her \nlovely family and is volunteering for the wildlife rescue causes that \nshe champions.\n  I thank Donna for her service and dedication.\n  Congratulations, Donna. I wish you all the best in your much-deserved \nretirement.\n\n\n                        Honoring Lourdes Sovedia\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, it is with great pleasure that I \nrecognize the outstanding career of Lourdes Sovedia. After 40 years of \nteaching, Lourdes will be retiring at the end of this school year.\n  Like me, Lourdes' family fled the oppressive Castro regime when she \nwas just a young girl in order to seek freedom and refuge in this \nwonderful Nation, the United States. She worked hard at learning the \nlanguage and the culture, and with inspiration from her mom, she \ndedicated her life to pursuing a career in education. After working her \nway through college, Lourdes made her American Dream a reality when she \nbecame a full-time teacher at Gesu\n\n[[Page H2435]]\n\nCatholic School in downtown Miami. Throughout the years, Lourdes has \ntaught at multiple schools and has earned many awards and deserved \nrecognition.\n  As a former Florida certified teacher, I recognize Lourdes' \ndedication, and I thank her for all that she has done for the students \nin south Florida throughout her impressive career.\n  Congratulations to Lourdes.\n\n\n Recognizing Joshua Williams and Joshua's Heart Foundation's Decade of \n                                Service\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize teen \nphilanthropist Joshua Williams of south Florida and the foundation that \nwears his heart on its sleeve--Joshua's Heart Foundation.\n  In 10 years of service to underserved communities in south Florida, \nJamaica, Africa, and India, Joshua's Heart Foundation has activated \nover 7,000 youths to collect and distribute food and personal items \nthat have helped 600,000 families in need. With the help of his \nsupportive mom, Claudia, Joshua began laying the foundation for \nJoshua's Heart's success when he was only 4\\1/2\\ years of age.\n  New JHF chapters are springing up all over the country, and I \nencourage everyone to check out the amazing work that Joshua's Heart \nFoundation is doing every day and to get involved in a charity or with \na volunteer organization that represents your own vision for the world \nin which you would like to live.\n  Congratulations to Joshua's Heart Foundation for a decade of service.\n\n\n        Celebrating the 75th Anniversary of Air Traffic Control\n\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate the 75th \nanniversary of the air traffic control at Miami International Airport, \nwhich is an area that I am so proud to represent.\n  This upcoming Thursday, May 19, the Federal Aviation Administration \nand the Miami-Dade Aviation Department will celebrate this \naccomplishment and honor the men and women who keep our skies and our \nairports safe.\n  Working around the clock, the air traffic controllers direct aircraft \nand minimize potential troubles in the sky, like the ones that come \nfrom severe weather patterns. I am very proud to know so many of these \ndiligent workers--individuals like Mitch Herrick, Jim Marinitti, Bill \nKisseadoo, and many others--who, in their professionalism, keep order \nin the airspace and protect our public.\n  Mr. Speaker, rerouting aircraft to avoid congestion and minimize \ndelays is not an easy task, especially at one of our Nation's busiest \nairports; but it is because of the controllers' dedication and \ncommitment that we can feel safe in arriving at our destinations.\n  Congratulations to my friends--all of the air traffic controllers at \nMiami International Airport.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2435-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2435]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PORTER RANCH GAS LEAK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise to report to this Congress on the \nPorter Ranch gas leak, the largest methane leak in the history of our \ncountry.\n  It began last October 23, and it lasted for, roughly, 5 months. The \namount of natural gas that escaped is measured in billions of cubic \nfeet. Some 8,000 families were evacuated for months. Our family, \nbecause we live just about as close as anyone to the leaking well, \nchose not to evacuate but, rather, to rely on filtration systems and \nthe fact that we spend much of our time in Washington.\n  So how should Congress respond?\n  We must say never again--not again in Porter Ranch, not again \nanywhere in this country--but it could happen again because this \nnatural gas storage facility was the fifth largest in the country. That \nmeans there are four other areas that could have an even larger natural \ngas leak. There are no Federal regulations for the safe storage of \nnatural gas, and State regulations are so minimal that they are \nincredibly minimal even in famously green California.\n  Currently, PHMSA, an agency of the Department of Transportation, \nacknowledges that it has the authority to write Federal regulations. \nThey have decided to do so, and my hope is that they will have them \nthis fall. This arises, in large part, because I had a chance to \ndiscuss this with the President of the United States back in January in \nfront of about 80 or 100 of our colleagues, and he made a commitment \nthat his administration would work to make sure this never happens \nagain. Not only is PHMSA working on the regulations, but the OMB has \nassured me that they will act promptly on approving those regulations \nonce they are finalized.\n  We in Congress are working on legislation that is designed to prod \nPHMSA into acting quickly, but it is important that we not pass \nlegislation that actually narrows the existing statutory power or gives \nsentences in statutory provisions that could be used by the oil and gas \nindustry to invalidate tough regulations.\n  That is why it is critical, for example, that any statute we pass, as \nthe Transportation and Infrastructure Committee's product provides, \nstates explicitly that we are not preempting higher, tougher State \nregulations and that the action taken in Congress will not make people \nless safe than their States would have them be.\n  Two issues confront SoCalGas, which is the utility that is \nresponsible for this leak.\n  The first is that they are going to try to get consumers to pay for \nthe cost of their negligence, using the phrase that they should pass \nthrough to consumers the ``reasonable cost'' of dealing with this \ndisaster; so the consumers around Los Angeles should pay for the cost \nof providing relocation assistance to 8,000 families, many of whom have \nbeen out of their homes for 5 months and longer; the ``reasonable \ncosts'' of plugging the leak should be passed through to consumers. The \nreasonable costs of repairing unreasonable negligence is never an \nordinary and necessary expense to be passed through to consumers.\n  This leak resulted from SoCalGas' negligence. There was a subsurface \nsafety valve on the well in question that was installed in the 1950s, \nthat was removed by SoCalGas in the 1970s, and was never replaced. This \nwell they used to inject and remove natural gas, not through the piping \nthat was intended or the tubing that was intended for that purpose, but \nthrough the casing that was never intended for that purpose; and the \npressure, which is the amount of gas crammed into the field, seems to \nbe inconsistent with the age of the wells--some going back 60-years \nplus--that were being used to inject and withdraw the natural gas. The \ncosts of this event must not be passed through to the consumers of Los \nAngeles.\n  Second, realizing they may have to bear the costs themselves, \nSoCalGas has decided to shortchange the residents who have evacuated. \nThey have decided they don't want to pay for the required cleaning \nprotocol that is necessary to make homes safe. That is in their release \nof just a couple of days ago. That is outrageous. The cleaning is \nnecessary to make the homes safe. LA County Public Health says so, and \nSoCalGas should pay that cost, too.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2435-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2435-H2436]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, each spring, a nationwide \nhigh school visual arts competition is sponsored by the Congressional \nInstitute and Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. Since the \nart competition was created in 1982, over 650,000 entries have been \nsubmitted.\n  The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to recognize and \nencourage the artistic talent of our Nation's bright and talented \nyouth.

Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I \nrise today to pay tribute to a very special event that will take place \nlater this month in my hometown of Indianapolis.\n  On May 29, the world's finest automobile racing teams will compete \nfor the very prestigious Borg-Warner Trophy at the 100th running of the \nIndy 500.\n  Mr. Speaker, every Memorial Day weekend since 1911, with the \nexception of a few years during World War I and World War II, the \nIndianapolis Motor Speedway has been the site of the greatest spectacle \nin racing. Over the last century, Mr. Speaker, the Indianapolis 500 has \nbecome the most attended single-day sporting event on the planet Earth, \nwith estimated crowds of over 400,000 people. Now, these fans add \nnearly $500 million to the central Indiana economy each year.\n  The race is also incredibly popular around the world, Mr. Speaker. \nWith millions of fans around the world, they have been listening to the \nrace on the Motor Speedway Radio Network and watching it on television.\n  Now, what very few people realize is that the Indy 500 has been a \nvery important influence in the development of passenger automobiles. \nRearview mirrors, four-wheel hydraulic brakes, color warning lights, \nand the first mandatory use of helmets can be traced back to the great \nHoosier State in the city of Indianapolis at the Indy 500. Now part of \nthe excitement of watching the race every year, Mr. Speaker, is seeing \nhow these high-tech automobiles have evolved and wondering which \ntechnology we will see on our roads in the near future.\n  I stand here today as a very proud Hoosier who is proud of our \nState's long racing heritage. I ask my colleagues, Mr. Speaker, to join \nme and to join the rest of the Indiana delegation in recognizing all of \nthose involved with the race over the last century, from the staff to \nthe pit crews, to the drivers, and especially the fans who come out to \nthe track each and every year.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the hardworking \nmen and women at the Nabisco Bakery\n\n[[Page H2437]]\n\non the southwest side of Chicago, once touted as the world's largest \nbakery.\n  These workers have faced daunting challenges in the past year as \ntheir plant was downsized and hundreds lost their jobs. Now they are \nworking without a contract and face the prospect of losing their \ncurrent pension plan.\n  For more than half a century, workers at this bakery have proudly \nmade Oreos, Chips Ahoy, Ritz crackers, and other iconic products. \nGenerations of families have been employed here and contributed to the \nlocal economy.\n  What is happening now is even more disappointing because taxpayers \nhave previously provided $90 million to Nabisco in return for a \ncommitment to expand and hire locally. The continued lack of a \nnegotiated agreement reflects the plight of middle class Americans \nacross the country, with workers facing eroding wages and benefits \nalong with job insecurity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge Mondelez to do right by its employees, use its \nprofits to reinvest in its American workforce, and grow good-paying \njobs in Chicago and across the Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2437-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         PRESIDENT NOT CORRECT\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, over the weekend, Iran \nheld another government-sponsored Holocaust cartoon contest in the \ncapital of Tehran. Their denial of the mass slaughter endured by \nmillions of men, women, and children during the Holocaust is yet \nanother example of this theocratic regime's irrational and \ncounterproductive conduct which hurts the citizens of Iran.\n  As he announced the dangerous Iran deal, the President claimed that \nit would help Iran become a more moderate regime, one that respects our \nallies. The President was not correct.\n  This is a nation that continually denies the genocide of the \nHolocaust, is a state sponsor of terrorism, tests missile development, \nand chants ``Death to America,'' ``Death to Israel.'' Sadly, the \nPresident continues to put faith in this dangerous regime.\n  I am grateful that, under the leadership of Chairman Ed Royce on the \nHouse Committee on Foreign Affairs, we are putting forth legislation to \ndeny Iran access to the U.S. dollar if they continue to promote \nterrorism to threaten American families with mass murder.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President by his \nactions never forget September the 11th in the global war on terrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2437-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        RECOGNIZING NAHLA KAYALI\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize Nahla Kayali. She is the founder and the executive director \nof Access California Services.\n  Access, as we call it, is a nonprofit organization in my hometown of \nAnaheim, California, that serves the Arab American, refugee, and \nimmigrant communities with culturally appropriate services, including \nEnglish as a second language, health and human services, employment \nassistance, and citizenship resources.\n  In 1998, she opened a small office and had two clients the first \nmonth. She initially helped people sign up for the California Healthy \nFamilies program. With only a high school diploma, Nahla has now \nexpanded Access California to serve over 11,000 Arab American, refugee, \nand other underserved community members in 16 different languages.\n  She works to foster a better understanding of the cultural needs of \nthe Arab American community, and, quite honestly, she is a living \nexample of what is the American Dream.\n  As we celebrated last month Arab American Heritage Month, I wanted to \nhonor and recognize her accomplishments, the accomplishments of Nahla \nKayali, and her continued work in supporting the Arab American \ncommunities and helping, in particular, refugees resettle and become \ncontributing citizens and leaders in Orange County.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2437-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          OFFICER DOUG BARNEY\n\n  (Mrs. LOVE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. LOVE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to honor National Police Week. We owe \na great deal of gratitude to the men and women who serve our \ncommunities by putting their lives on the line every day.\n  Utah has lost 139 police officers since 1853, most recently, Officer \nDoug Barney of Salt Lake County Unified Police Department. Officer \nBarney died in the line of duty on January 17.\n  Officer Barney was a dedicated 18-year veteran police officer, and \nloved every moment of his distinguished career. His kindness deeply \ntouched the families and the community and sometimes even the people he \narrested. He was known for his humor and compassion as well as his \ntoughness.\n  Ten thousand people attended his funeral. The State of Utah is truly \na kinder service-oriented place because of police officers like Doug \nBarney.

Mr. Speaker, recently a U.S. District Court judge \nruled that the administration's subsidy funding scheme for ObamaCare \nwas unconstitutional. This marked a major victory in citizens' efforts \nto stop the President's failed healthcare law. However, the ruling was \nignored by all three major news networks, leaving many Americans in the \ndark on the latest development involving ObamaCare.\n  Last year it was revealed that ObamaCare created or hiked at least 13 \ndifferent taxes. However, all three major networks also largely ignored \nthis increased burden on taxpayers.\n  It is no wonder that only 6 percent of Americans trust the media to \ngive them balanced news. Americans deserve all of the facts about the \nPresident's failed healthcare law. The liberal national media should \nnot ignore important information just because it conflicts with their \npolitical agenda.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2437-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2437]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS\n\n  (Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BROOKS of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, this week is National Police \nWeek, a time to thank and remember those law enforcement officers who \nhave paid the ultimate price, officers like Deputy Carl Koontz of the \nHoward County Sheriff's Department in Indiana.\n  Deputy Koontz was killed in March while serving a warrant well after \nhis shift had ended. He, like so many members of our law enforcement \ncommunity, showed dedication and commitment to his duties despite the \nrisks.\n  As a former deputy mayor of Indianapolis and a former U.S. attorney, \nI have witnessed firsthand the challenges faced by our law enforcement \nofficers and their remarkable families.\n  But, even more importantly, I saw again and again men and women in \nlaw enforcement display courage in the face of adversity, compassion in \nthe face of hardship, and an unending commitment to serve the \ncommunities in which they live.\n  Today I salute the men and women in uniform who every day unfailingly \nhonor the call to serve and protect. This week we must also renew our \ndaily commitment to support our heroic men and women in blue. Our \nthanks and prayers are with them and their families this week and every \nweek.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2437-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2437-H2438]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              SOVEREIGNTY\n\n  (Mr. LAMBORN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LAMBORN.

These \nfactors work to shape the laws that govern that nation.\n\n[[Page H2438]]\n\n  Without understanding and respecting these fundamental principles of \nsovereignty, nation-states would have their territorial integrity \ninfringed upon, be subordinated to outside imposed actions, or come \nunder threat from other hostile forces. That is why I cofounded the \nHouse Sovereignty Caucus here in Congress.\n  We must never forget that the supreme law of the land is the U.S. \nConstitution, Federal laws made pursuant to the Constitution and \ntreaties made under the Constitution's authority. Upholding this \nsupreme law is what makes America great.\n  Threats to U.S. sovereignty are being attempted every day. We must \nstay on guard against them, both from without and from within. We must \nuphold the supreme law of the land.

It is estimated that PICCC and \nits staff impact more than 15,000 people annually in Bedford, Blair, \nand Centre Counties.\n  During her time with PICCC, Cheryl has dealt with challenges, \nincluding the county's transition from being a manufacturing economy to \nbeing one that is more service driven. As evidence to PICCC's success \nand the good work of other organizations, the county regularly has the \nlowest unemployment rate in Pennsylvania.\n  Cheryl's good work in Centre County extends beyond PICCC, to \nvolunteer efforts with the United Way, Leadership Centre County, and \nthe Juniata Valley Council Boy Scouts of America.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, House Resolution 732 provides for the \nconsideration of H.R. 4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2017.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the most important thing this House will do this \nyear as it has been the most important thing this House has done for 54 \nstraight years--setting the policy for defending the American people.\n  The resolution provides for a structured rule and makes in order 61 \namendments. This is the first of the two rules the House will consider \non the NDAA. The Committee on Rules is continuing to work through the \nover 375 submitted amendments, and it will be making more amendments in \norder at this afternoon's meeting.\n  As a member of the House Committee on Armed Services, which is the \njurisdictional committee for this bill, I, like many others, have spent \nsubstantial time in working through this year's NDAA. A lot of work has \ngone into the bill to get us to this point, and I want to recognize the \nwork of Chairman Mac Thornberry, of Ranking Member Adam Smith, and of \neach of the subcommittee chairmen and ranking members. We should also \nrecognize the very capable Committee on Armed Services staff who has \ndevoted so much time to this legislation.\n  This process, as in years past, has been truly bipartisan. The bill \npassed out of the committee by a vote of 60-2. It is my sincere hope \nthat this bipartisan nature will continue here on the House floor as we \nconsider the most important thing we will do all year. Providing for \nthe common defense is the most important function of the Federal \nGovernment, and it is one we all take very seriously.\n  There are many different threats and challenges around the globe, and \nwe and the servicemen and -women who protect us need to be ready for \neach of those threats; so you will be hearing a lot about readiness \nover the next couple of days as we consider this bill because just \nhaving a soldier or an airman or a sailor is not enough--they have to \nbe ready to do the job that we assign to them. Readiness means that \nthey have been trained appropriately, that they have the equipment they \nneed, and that they have the support they need to carry out their vital \nrole.\n  Look around the world as we sit here today: North Korea is \nthreatening us with nuclear weapons. They say they have miniaturized \nthe nuclear weapon. They have the missile technology not only to shoot \nit from land, but to launch it from submarines.\n  China, every day, is pushing out further and further with these \nartificial islands in the South China Sea, claiming, virtually, the \nentire South China Sea as theirs that they can control and against the \nclaims of other countries in the region--a part of the world where over \n$5 trillion in trade moves to and fro, which is something that has a \ndirect impact on the well-being of the American people.\n  Look at what is happening in Europe. Russia has taken the Crimea. \nThey are involved in actions in the eastern part of Ukraine today. They \nthreaten NATO allies--countries with which we have an Article V \nobligation to defend if any country attacks them--and Russia is \nthreatening those countries today.\n  Then in the Middle East, as many of us know, we have a resurgent \nIran. After the deal that the President struck with Iran last year, \nIran now has access to tens of billions of dollars. As the major state \nsupporter of terrorism in the world, they are using that money to fund \nterrorist groups like Hezbollah and Hamas, which cause so much havoc \nand destruction and death. We have this terrible situation in Syria, a \ncontinually bad situation in Iraq, failed states in Yemen and Libya.\n  Our military--our defense forces--are called upon to address all of \nthose--to protect us, to protect the American people. That is why \ngetting this bill right is so important. That is why taking it \nseriously is so important. Whether it is fighting terrorism in Iraq or \nin Afghanistan, deterring Russian aggression in Europe, or projecting \nforce in the Pacific, our military has their hands full, and this bill \nis critical to ensuring that they are ready for what is coming to them \nand to us. Let us make sure we understand. Experts far beyond my \nbackground have said that the United States has never faced this \nlevel--this complexity--of threat to our national security since the \nend of World War II.\n  This bill is also an important oversight tool for Congress as we work \nto ensure accountability, efficiency, and effectiveness from our \nNation's military. The NDAA authorizes spending at a level of $574 \nbillion for national defense base requirements and an additional $36 \nbillion for overseas contingency operations. This matches the total \nfunding level of $610 billion that was requested by President Obama. \nThese spending levels are needed to make critical investments that will \nbegin to restore our military readiness.\n  It seems like every day a new and alarming report comes out about the \ndire situation our military is in: planes can't fly due to deferred \nrepairs; troops aren't adequately trained; there is a lack of naval \nvessels in critical theaters. These stories have begun the sad reality \nfor our military in recent years, and we are putting the lives of our \nservicemembers at risk.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  To be clear, none of these are the fault of our servicemembers who \ncontinue to rise to the challenge and do more with less. But we, as a \nCongress, have to fix this problem.\n  The NDAA will put us back on track by strengthening our commitment to \nour military men and women. It fully funds the 2.1 percent pay raise \nfor our troops and restores funding for training and maintenance \nprograms, while also helping rebuild crumbling facilities.\n  The bill is also reform oriented. You are going to hear a lot about \nreform over these next 2 days. It includes long-needed reforms to the \nacquisition process and the Uniform Code of Military Justice, as well \nas boosting healthcare programs to ensure high quality and access to \ncare. All told, there are five components of reform in this bill.\n  I also want to briefly touch on a few issues up front that I know my \ncolleagues will likely bring up. First, this rule self-executes an \namendment by Chairman Sessions of the Rules Committee that would strike \na provision of the bill relating to women and Selective Service.\n  This is an issue that the Armed Services Committee has not debated. \nNo hearings have been held. It was added\n\n[[Page H2440]]\n\nto the NDAA by an amendment in the dead of night. This rule removes \nthat provision and allows Congress to properly study the issue.\n  Wherever you stand on the issue of including women in the draft, the \nAmerican people should have the benefit of a full hearing, a full \nconsideration of that issue. Jamming this thing into this bill and \nconsidering it without going through that is not right for the American \npeople, whichever side they stand on. Making that the way this bill \nstands today is the right thing to do before we make a substantial \nchange.\n  I also know the President has some concerns about the way this year's \nNDAA funds our military. The bill funds the overseas contingency \noperation until April 2017, when a new President will have time to \nassess the security situation, and then they could submit a \nsupplemental budget request based on their priorities.\n  This is common for the first year of a new administration. Indeed, in \n2008, then-Senator Barack Obama, then-Senator John Kerry, and then-\nSenator Joe Biden all supported a similar strategy. So I find it very \nodd that they now oppose that same strategy.\n  The bottom line is that this bill adequately funds our military while \nmeeting critical needs for military readiness and supporting overseas \noperations. Let's not let politics get in the way here. There is enough \npolitical theater taking place in the Presidential election.\n  On this issue, this critical issue of national security, let's come \ntogether as Democrats and Republicans and show the American people that \nwe can work together on behalf of our military and our national \ndefense.\n  I urge my colleague to support House Resolution 732 and the \nunderlying bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \nthank the gentleman for yielding me the customary 30 minutes.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to the rule providing for \ngeneral debate on H.R. 4909, the NDAA, or National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  For 54 straight years, the United States Congress has come together \nin a bipartisan fashion to craft policies and recommendations for the \nUnited States Armed Forces and to put these into law. As has been \nindicated, of course, this is one of the most consequential and \nsubstantial items that we have. It is one of our responsibilities here \nin the United States Congress.\n  Personally, I have found objections to some of the policies in the \nbill. Of course, I commend the work of the men and women on the Armed \nServices Committee on this legislation. I am going to highlight some of \nthe problems that exist and why many of us on both sides of the aisle \nwill likely be opposing the legislation.\n  Many of my colleagues on the Armed Services Committee currently serve \nor have served in the Armed Forces. They are dedicated public servants, \nand they have worked hard on this bill. Of course, the bill includes \nthe rest of us as well.\n  Over 375 amendments have been offered to improve this bill. The Rules \nCommittee will be meeting this afternoon to determine how many of those \nwe make in order, and I hope that the Rules Committee makes in order a \ngreat number of these amendments. Of course, the first step under this \nrule is to make a few dozen amendments in order, and we will continue \nthat work in the Rules Committee shortly.\n  Mr. Speaker, for all the hard work that the Armed Services Committee \nhas done, what we have before us this week is, unfortunately, an \nargument that needs to be resolved in the Budget Committee.\n  What we have is effectively an accounting trick that drives us deeper \ninto debt and increases the budget deficit to pay for 1 year of \nincreased defense spending. To this point, I object to having this \nbudget debate even in the context of a defense bill.\n  But by disregarding the proper use of what is called the overseas \ncontingency operations account and by flouting the Budget Control Act \nagreed upon by Republicans and Democrats, unfortunately, this Armed \nServices bill has been overtaken by a debate on the Federal budget.\n  What we have before us is a bill that will increase the deficit and \nincrease the debt above and beyond the spending levels the Democrats \nand Republicans agreed to. The free-spending Republican Party continues \nto throw taxpayer dollar after taxpayer dollar.\n  Do they just intend to drive up the debt or do they intend to \nincrease your taxes? When we increase our deficit, it means increased \ntaxes. Effectively, this Republican bill is a tax increase on future \nAmerican families, like my kids.\n  So this week we see a debate about the inability of the Republicans \nto pass a budget or adhere to a budget when they do agree to one.\n  If the debate over our armed services was not such a serious topic, I \nwould say that this was a very clever, elaborate budget scheme. And it \nis clever. It is far too clever, more so than the traditional budget \ngimmicks that we have been presented with.\n  I am going to explain to you exactly what this tax-and-spend \nRepublican plan is. The bill authorizes $540 billion in discretionary \nbase budget authority that includes $523 billion for the DOD and $19.5 \nbillion for the Department of Energy's defense work.\n  But since the United States has been embroiled in conflict abroad \nsince 2001, several administrations have requested and Congress has \nalways granted another pot of money known as the overseas contingency \nfund.\n  This year the bill provides $59 billion for what we call overseas \ncontingency. Now, together with the $543 billion base, plus the $59 \nmillion in overseas contingency, that equals the President's budget \nrequest.\n  Now, as a reminder, the Republicans haven't actually produced a \nbudget this year; so, it is hard to make a comparison. All we can do is \ncompare it to the President's budget because there is no House budget \nand there is no Republican budget. We haven't even seen one to be able \nto act on it or have a debate.\n\n  Traditionally, we bring before the body several budgets and whichever \none gets the most votes is the budget of the House. There are usually \nseveral budgets from the Democratic side, several budgets from the \nRepublican side.\n  In years past, there have even been bipartisan budgets which I have \nbeen honored to support. This year, however, Republicans are not even \nallowing the House of Representatives to consider, no less pass, a \nbudget.\n  So what the NDAA does is it takes this overseas contingency account, \nwhich many consider to be a slush fund for Pentagon operations, and it \ntakes $18 billion of that to pay for base operations.\n  Some of that $18 billion goes to fund the Pentagon's unfunded \npriorities or what we might call their wish list or items that they \ncouldn't fit into the agreed-upon budget control number of $543 \nbillion.\n  So this busts through the deficit, increases the debt. It is a \nRepublican plan to tax and spend, tax and spend, tax and spend, like \nthey always do through accounting tricks that they are doing right here \nin the defense budget.\n  So the Pentagon gets more of the big-ticket items they want. \nTaxpayers are left paying the bill to the detriment of our economy, to \nthe detriment of job creation, so that our own kids have to pay future \ntaxes, putting our Nation deeper and deeper in debt, which I should \npoint out to my friends is a national security issue.\n  When we are economically beholden to other nations like China or \nSaudi Arabia, that is as great, if not greater, a national security \nthreat than the one we combat with the tanks and Armed Forces that this \nbill seeks to authorize. So it is very important to take that into \naccount.\n  If we look at what are the reasons that we defeated the Soviet Union \nduring the cold war, they overinvested in their defense relative to \ntheir GDP, which effectively hurt their economy and made their economic \nmodel unsustainable because they were allocating too much to defense to \ntry to keep up with where we were.\n  If we mortgage our future to the Chinese and Saudi Arabians, how are \nwe increasing our security, Mr. Speaker? In fact, we are decreasing our \nsecurity to fund current consumption for 1 year at the price of \nmortgaging our future to foreign adversaries.\n  By stealing $18 billion from the overseas contingency account, the \nNDAA guarantees that we run out of money\n\n[[Page H2441]]\n\nfor overseas operations sometime in April 2017. And, of course, this \nCongress would never let money run out for operations against ISIS and \nAfghanistan and elsewhere.\n  So, of course, when it comes down to it, this bill will come before \nCongress in April and Congress will make sure that we have the money we \nneed to fight ISIS because they looted from this bill the money that \nwas designed to fight ISIS to pay for items on the Pentagon's wish \nlist. So that is what is happening here.\n  Rather than appropriating money to combat ISIS and Afghanistan and \nother countries for the full year, they are just doing it for a few \nmonths. They are taking some of that money, putting it into the base, \nmortgaging our future, putting burdens on taxpayers, and making us \neconomically at risk of being dominated by the countries that we \ncontinue to borrow from.\n  Look, that is why the Secretary of Defense and that is why the \nPresident of the United States, the Commander in Chief, are completely \nagainst this way of budgeting. It is fiscally irresponsible.\n  As the ranking member of the Armed Services Committee testified at \nthe Rules Committee yesterday, this old gimmick probably violates the \nbipartisan Budget Control Act. When you do that, that is where the \nbudget debate gets going. Congress has set limits on how much we can \nspend on defense versus nondefense.\n  So when we run out of money next year under this NDAA plan, we are \ngoing to be forced to spend more. I mean, who before us is not going to \nspend the money we need to combat ISIS?\n  Of course Congress will spend more. This is a plan to set up Congress \nto spend more. Of course, Congress will spend more regardless of who \ncontrols Congress.\n  That is why budgets matter. That is why this arcane and esoteric \ngimmick in this bill matters. It is why we should have these debates in \nthe Budget Committee. It is why this Congress should pass a budget. It \nis why we should let the national defense bill be about defense rather \nthan mortgaging our future.\n  Look, if it wasn't enough to have this budget smoke-and-mirrors \ndebate in the defense bill, this year's NDAA also has a debate about \nwhether we should let taxpayer dollars subsidize discrimination and \nwhether we should encourage corporate misconduct.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am not going to dwell long on the subsidization of \ndiscrimination and encouraging corporate misconduct, but I can't fathom \nwhy there would be a place in this bill about national defense for \nprovisions that allow Federal contractors to discriminate against LGBT \nemployees. That is unacceptable, bizarre, and contrary to meeting the \nsecurity needs of our Nation.\n  Also included in this bill is an exemption from the President's Fair \nPay and Safe Workplace Executive Order. The place to debate that is in \nanother committee I serve on, the Education and the Workforce \nCommittee, not the national defense bill. Those need to be removed.\n  Of course, this bill also strikes the Selective Service registration \nfor women. The committee mark included women in Selective Service. \nPersonally, I cosponsor a bill with Representative Mike Coffman to \neliminate Selective Service that would save money. And, of course, in \nmy entire lifetime, there has not been a draft.\n  If we are going to have a Selective Service system, of course, it \nneeds to include women. Women serve in every single combat role. It \nneeds to include everybody so we can mobilize manpower and womanpower \nmost effectively. But, unfortunately, that has been stripped out of \nthis bill.\n  I believe we should take a hard look at doing away with Selective \nService entirely. Of course, at the very least, we should include both \nmen and women at the age of 18.\n  To move forward without any real debate on this issue and to strike \nthat section without meaningful floor debate is bad policy, bad \nprocedure. It is an offense to the committee which put it into the bill \nand yet another reason I plan on opposing the bill.\n  There are other pieces of this bill which I and many Democrats and \nRepublicans object to. There is a lot of time to go into those, which I \nwill do depending on how many speakers we have.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I was listening very carefully to my colleague, and I heard him talk \nabout what is being proposed in this bill as being accounting tricks \nand cover. I am going to repeat again that what this bill is doing is \nexactly what then-Senator Obama, then-Senator Kerry, then-Senator Biden \nvoted for in 2008.\n  There is nothing new here. We are going into another President, and \nwe are giving that President an opportunity to take a look at the \nsituation and come back to us and tell us what they want.\n  He said that this will drive up the deficit. It only drives up the \ndeficit if we are not willing to work together to cut in other places \nbecause national defense is more important than anything else we do.\n  If we don't want to drive up the deficit--and I sure don't want to \ndrive up the deficit--let's talk about some serious cuts to other parts \nof the budget that aren't nearly as important as national defense.\n  He called the overseas contingency account a slush fund. It is a fund \ndirectly requested by President Obama. It was requested by the \nPresident before him. It is something we have done for a while. It is \nadequately accounted for. There is plenty of oversight over it. So it \nis not a slush fund at all.\n  The gentleman from Colorado said that we should be careful about \noverinvesting as the Russians did relative to GDP. If you look at what \nthe defense spending is as a percentage of the American GDP, for the \nlast several years it has gone down. It is so much lower than it was \neven just a few years ago. In fact, we now know it is dangerously low \nbecause of what our adversaries--Russia, China, et cetera--are doing.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  He talked about that this bill somehow encourages corporate \nmisconduct. This bill has more reforms in it than we have seen in years \nthat are going to require more and more people to toe the line, as they \nshould when we are spending the taxpayers' money.\n  He said that there is something in this bill that might have \nsomething to do with LGBT discrimination. No, sir. Mr. Speaker, what is \nin this bill, what is going to be proposed for this bill, is something \nthat gets to people's religious freedom. We don't treat religious \nfreedom seriously enough in this body. We act as if it is somehow now a \nsecondary right. Well, it is a primary right. It has always been a \nprimary right, and we should always stand up for it in this body.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nLamborn).\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague from Alabama for his \ngood work on this rule and on this bill.\n  I want to talk about the critical part of the bill and an amendment \nthat was proposed and then withdrawn, and that has to do with Iran's \nheavy water production. The reason this amendment was withdrawn and \nwon't be under consideration in the Committee on Rules for discussion \nlater today is because it deserves to have stand-alone treatment. It is \nthat important.\n  Heavy water is used to produce weapons-grade plutonium. Its \ndistinctive properties make it a critical component in the production \nof nuclear weapons. Now, the nuclear deal that some of the Senators \nvoted for--not by two-thirds by any means--forbids Iran from \nstockpiling more than 130 tons of heavy water during the initial years \nof the deal, and they will be allowed to produce 90 tons later. But \nthey are required, under the deal, to redesign and rebuild their Arak \nfacility to support its ``peaceful'' needs and research.\n  So Iran did agree to keep pace with international technological \nadvancement trends and rely only on light water, not heavy water, for \nfuture nuclear power, yet they have been producing heavy water \nnevertheless.\n  The Wall Street Journal has exposed the proposed purchase of Iran's \noverproduced heavy water, stating that the administration is \nencouraging ``Tehran to stick to the nuclear agreement reached last \nyear.''\n  So apparently the administration is seeking to entice others to \npurchase\n\n[[Page H2442]]\n\nIran's overproduced heavy water by making the first purchase. U.S. \nEnergy Secretary Ernest Moniz said: ``That will be a statement to the \nworld: `You want to buy heavy water from Iran, you can buy heavy water \nfrom Iran. It's been done. Even the United States did it.' '' So we are \nenabling Iran to violate the terms of the deal, and we are going out \nand buying this, using taxpayer dollars nevertheless.\n  Now, if the Iranians cannot or simply will not keep the deal, we have \nto come up with a better deal, not bail them out of aspects of the deal \nthat they don't want to comply with. So this proposed purchase by the \nadministration violates the intention of the deal and the will of the \nAmerican people. We can't let this administration or the speech writer \nBen Rhodes or their fabricated echo chamber deceive us any longer.\n  By the way, this speech writer, Ben Rhodes, admitted in a New York \nTimes article published just the other day that they took things they \nknew not to be true and misled the American people on purpose to get \nthe deal passed.\n  We must not authorize funds to purchase heavy water from Iran. \nBecause this issue is so important, I will work with leadership to make \nsure that we consider this later as stand-alone legislation.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts (Ms. Tsongas).\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak against this rule \nthat repeals a provision that was added to the NDAA, the National \nDefense Authorization Act, after a bipartisan, recorded vote in \ncommittee which expands the Selective Service System to include women. \nThat provision was in line with the Secretary of Defense's decision to \neliminate the ban on women serving in direct ground combat positions \nand the recognition that women are much needed across all aspects of \nmilitary capability.\n  This rule precludes Congress from having an open and transparent \ndebate about this very important issue that impacts women's equality. \nIf we want a full hearing, is there no better place than on the floor \nof this House? This rule would prevent that.\n  Gender equality is achieved when women and men enjoy the same rights, \nopportunities, and responsibilities across all sectors of society, \nincluding military service, and when the abilities, aspirations, and \ntalents of women and men are equally valued. Including women in the \ndraft is a step toward that equality.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield an additional 30 seconds to the gentlewoman from \nMassachusetts.\n  Ms. TSONGAS. Mr. Speaker, this position is shared by both Army Chief \nof Staff Mark Milley and Marine Commandant Robert Neller.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject this rule that denies the current \nreality of military service, limits gender equality, ignores a \nbipartisan vote, and does not allow for an open and transparent debate \non the floor of the House.\n  Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I completely agree with my colleague who just spoke \nthat, if we are going to do this, we should have a full debate on it. \nBut we should also let the American people be heard.\n  Because of the way this happened in committee, there was no public \nhearing beforehand. There was no notice to the American people that \nthis was going to be considered. So the most important people we need \nto hear from on this haven't been heard from, and they need to be heard \nfrom.\n  The way to do that is for us to announce that we are considering \nthis; have full public hearings in committee; and then, after having \nfull public hearings, the committee makes a decision and brings \nsomething to this floor for us to debate. But for us to bring up an \nissue of that magnitude without having gone through the process of \nletting the American people be truly heard here, that is not \nappropriate.\n  So while I understand exactly what my colleague just said--I was \nthere for the committee meeting. I know that there was a vote on it. It \nwas a vote after we had no debate in committee, no hearings, no \nopportunity for the American people to be heard--if we are going to \ntake an issue like this and bring it to the floor of this House, we \nneed to do all of that or we wouldn't be doing our job. So I \nrespectfully disagree with her. I think the self-executing amendment by \nChairman Sessions is appropriate, and I would urge my colleagues to \nsupport that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would say in response to my friend that the committee \ndid a lot of work through the night and voted on a number of issues \nthat Members raised, and many of the items that they voted on were not \nsubject to their own hearings. What we are seeing here is a failure of \nSpeaker Ryan to follow through on his pledge for regular order.\n  What is regular order? There is a committee markup of the bill for \ngood or bad. Sometimes the chairman has things in that bill he or she \ndoesn't want. Other times it is exactly like they want it. That gets \nreported out to the Committee on Rules, and other Members have a chance \nto change it. If any Member of this body wanted to remove women from \nthe Selective Service, which was in the HASC markup, they would simply \noffer an amendment to do so. That is the normal process. There would be \ndebate and there would be a vote.\n  Instead of that process, there is a mysterious self-executing \namendment in the rule itself; so the rule, itself, controverts the \nactual bill that the HASC reported out. It actually changes the very \nbill that the committee worked on without a vote, without debate, and \nthat is the opposite of regular order, the opposite of the process that \nallows Members to fully debate and vet these issues.\n  This rule actually stifles the debate on this very issue that the \nHASC weighed in on. It is my understanding it is in the Senate bill, to \ninclude women in Selective Service as well. I think it will likely be \nin any conference report that comes out. But for whatever reason, \nrather than having the debate and vote on the floor, it is being hidden \nbehind a procedural trick in a self-executing rule.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nMoulton) to discuss the bill and the rule.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak on important \nprovisions contained within the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  I have said many times that too little attention has been given to a \nlong-term political strategy in our fight against ISIL. That is why I \nworked with colleagues from both sides of the aisle to include an \namendment now contained in the bill that requires the administration to \ndevelop an integrated political and military strategy to defeat ISIS. \nWithout this strategy, we risk repeating mistakes of the past.\n  We largely defeated al Qaeda in Iraq militarily in 2009 but failed to \nfollow through on the root causes and ensure the success of Iraqi \npolitics going forward. It created a political vacuum that ISIS grew \ninto. We cannot afford to make that mistake again.\n  Second, we should all be able to agree that our military personnel \nand veterans deserve the best health care in the world. That is why I \nam proud to report the bill also contains provisions I worked on with \nseveral Members to address the increased rates of suicide in our \nmilitary. Since 2012, suicide has been the leading cause of death in \nour military. In the past 3 years alone, the suicide rate has been \nnearly 50 percent greater than in the civilian population.\n  The Department of Defense needs to take an aggressive approach in \nsolving this crisis. My amendment included in the bill would identify \ntrends and instances of suicides and require better proactive and \nreactive mental health care for active personnel.\n  Finally, I want to call attention to the urgent need to continue the \nSpecial Immigrant Visa program for Afghans who worked for U.S. forces. \nA bipartisan amendment before the Committee on Rules now would remove \nthe unfortunate narrowing of eligibility requirements included in the \nmark, which would prevent hundreds of Afghans whose lives are at risk \nbecause of their work for our country from even being considered for \nresettlement in the United States.\n  The narrowing of eligibility intentionally excludes hundreds of \nAfghans who worked for the U.S. State Department, USAID, and U.S. \nsecurity contractors in a number of capacities,\n\n[[Page H2443]]\n\nmany of whom face well-documented death threats due to their work with \nour government, regardless of whether that was with frontline troops or \non an American base. By narrowing eligibility, the program would erode \nthe expectations of hundreds of Afghan staff whose lives remain in \ndanger because of their work for the U.S. mission and also make it more \ndifficult to hire and retain qualified Afghan staff who are essential \nto achieving our diplomatic and assistance goals. For that risk and \nsacrifice, the very least we can do is offer them a chance to stay \nalive, to keep living, rather than abandoning them to the same enemies \nthey united with us to destroy.\n  Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate my colleague from Massachusetts and all the \npoints that he has made. Indeed, there were a number of bipartisan \namendments that were added to the bill during that very long day and \nnight that we spent considering it, which just points out the \nbipartisan nature of what we are doing here.\n  On the committee, we try to work together to find the right way \nforward for the defense of America. When colleagues on either side of \nthe aisle offer something that is common sense and we think will work, \nwe work together to make sure it gets in the bill, and that is what he \njust alluded to.\n  He also alluded to an amendment that he hopes will be added as a \nresult of the Committee on Rules meeting this afternoon. We are going \nto be considering an awful lot of amendments this afternoon. There are \nover 60 amendments that we have made in order in this rule, bipartisan \namendments, so this is a very strong effort on our part to make sure \nthat this is a bipartisan bill; and as a bipartisan bill, it deserves \nbipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, it is particularly ironic that the gentleman \nis touting the bipartisan amendments. It is one of those bipartisan \namendments that adds women in the Selective Service that is stripped \nout of the HASC bill, of the committee's bill right here in this rule, \nthrough a self-executing amendment.\n  So this rule, if it were to pass--and I hope it doesn't. I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle vote ``no.'' This rule undoes one \nof those very bipartisan amendments that the gentleman is touting.\n  I yield 2\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Vermont (Mr. Welch).\n  Mr. WELCH. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman. I thank the Committee \non Armed Services for the hard work they did to produce this bill. I am \nnot going to support it.\n  The most important function that we have is to make certain that \nAmerica is secure. Our defense authorization bill is a major component \nof that, but I believe this bill fails in some fundamental respects.\n  Number one, the budget is very large. We are approaching $700 \nbillion. But throwing money at a problem does not solve a problem. What \nwe are doing as we throw more money at a problem without making hard \ndecisions is we generate and accept as inevitable an immense amount of \ninefficiency.\n  Number two, there is an overreliance on the OCO funding. First of \nall, OCO, off budget, should be debated, and it should be appropriated. \nIt should be subject to all budget caps. But to then begin using it not \njust for overseas contingency operations but to actually invest in \nmajor weapons systems is a gross mistake that is just going to lead to \na weaker budgeting system that is essential, in my view, to our \nnational security.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Of that OCO funding, money would be used for weapon systems like the \nF/A-18E Super Hornet and the F-35. The $35 billion in the OCO \nauthorization is for war requirements, including dollar amounts in the \nmillions.\n  Now, the other issue with respect to OCO--and another failure in this \nbill--is we are once again continuing to have military operations--this \ncountry is at war--without having any debate on an Authorization for \nUse of Military Force. That should be part of it.\n  Third, we have significant issues in NATO. As the Speaker and my \ncolleague, the chairman, know, NATO is absolutely essential to our \ndefense. But the time for the United States to be bearing as big a \nburden for that defense has come to a conclusion.\n  We will bear the majority of the expense, but the commitment on our \nNATO allies is to reach 2 percent of their gross domestic product in \ndefense spending. If our NATO allies are not doing that, we are asking \nthe American taxpayer to do it. These are mature democracies. They have \nstable economies. It is about time that we asked for this to absolutely \nhappen.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 30 \nseconds.\n  Mr. WELCH. The real fundamental question for us is whether or not in \nthis defense budget we are going to ask what are the fundamental \nstrategic necessities of the United States to be in a strong posture to \ndefend itself.\n  The approach of just throwing more money and maintaining weapons \nsystems that our military is not even asking for, of blinking on the \nquestion of personnel review--all of these things are just postponed \nfor another day. They need to be faced today.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I thank the committee for its work, but I will not \nbe supporting this bill.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Vermont. He and I and a \ngroup of Members of this body met recently with members of the German \nBundestag and the Russian Duma to talk about these very issues, and it \nwas a most enlightening trip for all of us. By the way, all of us went \nas American citizens, as Members of the United States Congress, not as \nDemocrats or Republicans.\n  One of the most troubling things that we learned from that trip is \nthat the Russians continue to invest at a significantly higher level \nthan we are in terms of their increases every year and their military \nactivities. That is why they have been so successful in Ukraine, why \nthey have been so successful recently in Syria. So this bill begins to \nturn back around so that we are investing properly.\n  If I thought that we were throwing money at the problem, if my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle and the Armed Services Committee \nthought we were just throwing money at the problem, this bill would not \nhave received a 60-2 vote in committee, I can tell you that.\n  The inefficiencies the gentleman talked about we are very concerned \nabout. That is why there is so much reform in this bill. There are five \ndifferent components that deal with reform. We can't expect American \ntaxpayers to pay for any part of the government that is inefficient, \nincluding our military.\n  He brought up the Authorization for Use of Military Force. We had a \nbig debate about this in committee, and I asked my staff: Why can't we \nconsider an Authorization for Use of Military Force in our committee? I \nthink we should.\n  I was told and we found out by reading the War Powers Act, a law \npassed by Congress in 1973, that, under that law, jurisdiction for the \nAuthorization for Use of Military Force is vested in the Foreign \nAffairs Committee, not in the Armed Services Committee, so we could not \nconsider that when it came before the committee.\n  And then, finally, as to his comments about NATO, I share a lot of \nhis concerns. I think many of us do. There is nothing wrong and \neverything right with expecting our NATO allies to meet their 2 percent \nobligation. Most of them are not doing that.\n  I do believe the administration is working with them to get them to \nthat point, but I don't think we should ever miss an opportunity to \nkeep the heat on them to do that. Ultimately, the defense that we \nprovide over in Europe through NATO is the defense of those countries.\n  So I think it is appropriate that the gentleman brought up that \npoint. I hope the administration will continue to do that, and I hope \nthat we will continue to back any effort that is taken by this \nadministration or the next to do that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to take some time to highlight some of the \nterrible\n\n[[Page H2444]]\n\nenvironmental provisions that run counter to our national security \nimperative to create a more sustainable society that are in this bill \nor that have been submitted as amendments to this bill.\n  For instance, there has been an amendment that would block \nimplementation of the collaborative Federal land use plans and prevent \nlisting of the sage-grouse under the Endangered Species Act for the \nnext decade.\n  We have had extensive hearings in another committee I serve on, the \nNatural Resources Committee. This has nothing to do with defense. In \nfact, we hold up the collaborative Federal land use plan as an example \nof how to avoid listing this species and, yet, make sure that we can \nmaintain a viable habitat.\n  I think it was a great success. I think it is ridiculous that we are \ntalking about amending a national defense bill to undo something that \nwe have had extensive hearings on in the Natural Resources Committee \nand is held up by all parties involved as a huge success.\n  In addition, there is going to be an amendment offered to sell off \nover 800,000 acres of the Desert National Wildlife Refuge in Nevada. It \nwould be transferred to the Air Force, which has not requested a \ntransfer. The Air Force has not requested this land for any military \nuse; yet, there is a bill to impose the management of these lands on \nthe Air Force.\n  It would represent a harmful public land sell-off precedent. It is \nimportant habitat for desert bighorn sheep, mule deer, mountain lions, \nand other wildlife.\n  As we mentioned, the Air Force has not requested the stewardship of \nthese lands. Of course, it would put a costly new burden on the Air \nForce to the detriment of our national security.\n  In addition, there are two provisions already in the NDAA that will \nremove or block Federal endangered species protections for the American \nburrowing beetle and the lesser prairie chicken.\n  Again, I am happy to have those debates. But what on Earth do they \nhave to do with national defense, and why are they in the committee \nbill?\n  Section 2866 would block ESA protections for the lesser prairie \nchicken for 6 years and then impose arbitrary restrictions on whether \nthe Secretary of the Interior can relist the lesser prairie chicken, \nregardless of its biological status, even if there is only a handful \nleft or it is nearing extinction.\n  Section 2866 would also immediately and permanently remove the \nburrowing beetle for protection under the Endangered Species Act and \nprevent it from receiving any protections in the future.\n\n  Our biodiversity is a source of strength. To somehow have a backdoor \nattempt--if you can't get these things through the proper regular order \nof the Natural Resources Committee, to somehow say that the burrowing \nbeetle has something to do with national defense is a great stretch of \nour rules of germaneness that we have here in the body of this House.\n  More perilously, more dangerously, there is language in the House \nNDAA bill that is a repeal of section 526 of the Energy Independence \nand Security Act of 2007. The purpose of this law is to reduce the \nDepartment of Defense's dependence on oil from hostile regimes of the \nworld.\n  So it is a disparate element of advanced lower carbon fuels to \npromote energy security. Repealing this provision is something the \nDepartment of Defense does not want. It would be unwise for our clean \nenergy future.\n  So this bill actually detracts from the current language in the \nrepeal of section 526. It reduces our energy security as a Nation, \nrenders us to be more reliant on foreign powers for our oil, just as \nthe budgetary tricks in this bill will force us to borrow more from \nChina and Saudi Arabia to spend this year.\n  Finally, there is some damaging language about aquatic invasive \nspecies, which, of course, cost billions of dollars annually when we \ndeal with the zebra mussels in lakes in Colorado, damaging shipping, \ndamage to industrial and government facilities. Invasive species cause \ngreat irreversible damage to coastal and inland waters, including some \nin my district.\n  Once a nonnative species invades a lake or river, it is basically \nimpossible to eliminate, as we know. S. 373, the Vessel Incidental \nDischarge Act, or VIDA, would discard the Clean Waters Act goal of \nstopping further invasive species and replace it with a law that would \ninstead put ineffective standards for removing invasive species from \nships' ballast water discharges that bear no relation to protection of \nwater quality.\n  So, again, this bill will strip out very important measures that \nwould prevent the dissemination of invasive species. Even in the lakes \nin my district, including in Grand County, we have had a devastating \nimpact of the zebra mussel invasive species both on local habitat as \nwell as directly on recreational ships and boaters.\n  There is not a direct military aspect to where we are, but, again, \nthis applies to both military and shipping and is a great cost to the \nAmerican economy when these invasive species threaten us.\n  Again, these are issues people may differ on. I am happy to have that \ndebate. In fact, it is a little bit of deja vu. I feel like I have had \nthat debate on the Natural Resources Committee. We have debated many of \nthese same things.\n  But instead of bills being reported out of that committee and coming \nto the floor, apparently, the NDAA is seen by some as a catchall to \nattack our environmental safeguards. That is wrong. That actually \ndetracts from our national security. It makes us more reliant on \nforeign oil. It is the wrong direction for the bill, the wrong \ndirection for national defense.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I wish we didn't have to deal with environmental issues \non the Armed Services Committee, but, unfortunately, we have military \nbases all across the United States where they are being limited in what \nthey want to do, what they could potentially do, by other Federal \nagencies that are using their powers to tell our defense folks that \nthey can't do things that are important to carrying out their military \nmission.\n  So I heard my colleague, and I know of his service on the Natural \nResources Committee and the good work of that committee. But when you \nhave those agencies beginning to impinge on our ability to deliver on \nnational defense, I think that is under the jurisdiction of our \ncommittee. We have gotten waivers to be able to take these issues up \nfrom those committees, including the Natural Resources Committee.\n  Look, I am not saying the sage-grouse or the beetle is not important, \nbut they are not more important than the defense of the United States \nof America. We have dealt with these issues in a responsible way. I \nhope and pray that the time will come when we won't ever have to talk \nabout that in the Armed Services Committee again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I still remain hard pressed to see how the burrowing beetle or the \nlesser prairie chicken are somehow a security issue that needs to be \naddressed in the National Defense Authorization Act.\n  Look, there are a number of other flaws with the bill. It greatly \noverfunds our nuclear weapons activities, which will cost taxpayers \nhundreds of billions over the next 10 years. I have offered an \namendment to reduce this.\n  This is for a stockpile of weapons that could be greatly reduced and \nstill maintain the capability of destroying the world many times over, \nhowever useful that capability may be.\n  I think it should be good enough that we have enough capability to \ndestroy the world three or four times instead of seven times. God \nforbid, we don't have enough capabilities to destroy the entire world \nand wipe out life.\n  This bill does not include, as had been mentioned, an Authorization \nfor Use of Military Force for our ongoing operations in Iraq, Syria, \nand elsewhere. Despite repeated calls to write an updated \nauthorization, despite the belief of many Members on both sides of the \naisle, the current war is illegal.\n  This Congress has taken zero meaningful action to date. We should \nchange that or at least debate changing that this week.\n  As I said before, when you have a national security bill that \nmortgages our future, makes us more reliant on foreign oil, you wonder \nat what point you\n\n[[Page H2445]]\n\nshould stop calling it a national security bill and start calling it a \nnational insecurity bill.\n  The vision that my constituents have, the vision that I have, for a \nsafe and secure America is not one with bloated budget deficits and \nborrowing from China and Saudi Arabia. It is not one where we cut off \nour own renewable energies program so we can rely more on foreign oil. \nIt is not one where we borrow more from our kids' future and mortgage \nthem. That is not the secure America that we should seek as a United \nStates Congress.\n  These are the kinds of questions that we should be debating in the \ndefense bill. But instead of focusing on these real questions of how to \nimprove our armed services and how to provide for the national defense, \nthe general debate we will see under this rule will dedicate a large \nportion to debate on the budget and the looting of this overseas \ncontingency fund, which Congress will have to come back and backfill in \nApril, therefore mortgaging our future and increasing our national debt \nto fund.\n  Instead of actually passing a budget, this Congress is having a \nbackdoor budget debate, debating it now. It is the wrong way to do \nthings.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we defeat the previous question, I will offer an \namendment to the rule that would shed light on the secret money in \npolitics.\n  The DISCLOSE Act, authored by Mr. Van Hollen, would require outside \ngroups to disclose the source of the contributions they are using to \nfund their campaigns.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Colorado?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' and \ndefeat the previous question. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on \nthe rule with the self-executing language which undoes the committee \nlanguage, in violation of regular order. Vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate and respect the gentleman from Colorado and \nhis earnestness and all of what he has said today; and I do agree with \nhim that there are many things that we need to debate on this floor and \nthat we will be debating on this floor over the next 2 days.\n  But let's make sure we don't lose sight of the central thing we are \nhere to do, and that is to protect and defend the people of the United \nStates.\n  Yes, there are going to be some extraneous issues, issues that we \nwish we didn't even have to talk about; but at the end of the day, we \nare going to come back to that central function, that most important \nfunction that we have, and that is defending the people of the United \nStates.\n  Because of things that have happened before today, the readiness of \nour Armed Forces, the people we charge with the direct responsibility \nof defending us, the readiness has come down steadily. Planes can't \nfly. Armed vehicles can't drive. Weapons don't function. We don't have \nenough training for our troops.\n  So we have listened to all of the uniformed commanders that have come \nbefore our committee and heard the dire circumstances we face all \nacross the national defense of this country, and this bill begins to \nturn that around.\n  It is not a big enough turnaround. We have got a lot of work to do to \nget back to where we need to be, but this begins that process of \ngetting our Armed Forces ready in a way that is meaningful and \nresponsible for them but also will create the actual effect of \nprotecting the American people.\n  We have put into this bill very important reforms, reforms that we \nhave been needing to look at for a long time, that will require our \nmilitary to be more efficient, save taxpayer dollars, but also make \nthem more effective in their jobs.\n  This bill does what we, as a House, are charged with doing, and that \nis setting responsible policy for defending the United States of \nAmerica.\n  I hope that everyone, as we debate the amendments and the underlying \nbill over the next 2 days, will keep central in their mind that that is \nwhat this is all about and that we will strive to do this in a \nbipartisan fashion, as we have done on the Committee on Armed Services \nand as we have done on the Committee on Rules.\n  This needs to be a bipartisan bill. This needs to be a bipartisan \nvote. If we really care about this country, if we really care about \nthose men and women in uniform, then it is important for us to \nunderstand that we have a bipartisan responsibility to make sure that \nwe provide for them and provide for the defense of the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support House Resolution 732 and \nthe underlying bill.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Polis is as follows:\n\n            An Amendment to H. Res. 732 Offered by Mr. Polis\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 5. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     430) to amend the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 to \n     provide for additional disclosure requirements for \n     corporations, labor organizations, and other entities, and \n     for other purposes. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the respective chairs and ranking minority \n     members of the Committees on House Administration, the \n     Judiciary, and Ways and Means. After general debate the bill \n     shall be considered for amendment under the five-minute rule. \n     All points of order against provisions in the bill are \n     waived. At the conclusion of consideration of the bill for \n     amendment the Committee shall rise and report the bill to the \n     House with such amendments as may have been adopted. The \n     previous question shall be considered as ordered on the bill \n     and amendments thereto to final passage without intervening \n     motion except one motion to recommit with or without \n     instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and reports \n     that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then on the \n     next legislative day the House shall, immediately after the \n     third daily order of business under clause 1 of rule XIV, \n     resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 6. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 430.\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n\n[[Page H2446]]\n\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. POLIS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

DOC. NO. 114-135)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message \nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  Section 202(d) of the National Emergencies Act (50 U.S.C. 1622(d)) \nprovides for the automatic termination of a national emergency unless, \nwithin 90 days prior to the anniversary date of its declaration, the \nPresident publishes in the Federal Register and transmits to the \nCongress a notice stating that the emergency is to continue in effect \nbeyond the anniversary date. In accordance with this provision, I have \nsent to the Federal Register for publication the enclosed notice \nstating that the national emergency with respect to Burma that was \ndeclared on May 20, 1997, is to continue in effect beyond May 20, 2016.\n  The Government of Burma has made significant progress across a number \nof important areas since 2011, including the release of over 1,300 \npolitical prisoners, a peaceful and competitive election, the signing \nof a Nationwide Ceasefire Agreement with eight ethnic armed groups, the \ndischarge of hundreds of child soldiers from the military, steps to \nimprove labor standards, and expanding political space for civil \nsociety to have a greater voice in shaping issues critical to Burma's \nfuture. In addition, Burma has become a signatory of the International \nAtomic Energy Agency's Additional Protocol and ratified the Biological \nWeapons Convention, significant steps towards supporting global non-\nproliferation. Despite these strides, the situation in the country \ncontinues to pose an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national \nsecurity and foreign policy of the United States.\n  Concerns persist regarding continued obstacles to full civilian \ncontrol of the government, the ongoing conflict and human rights abuses \nin the country, particularly in ethnic minority areas, and military \ntrade with North Korea. In addition, Burma's security forces, operating \nwith little oversight from the civilian government, often act with \nimpunity. We are further concerned that prisoners remain detained and \nthat police continue to arrest critics of the government for peacefully \nexpressing their views. For this reason, I have determined that it is \nnecessary to continue the national emergency with respect to Burma.\n  Despite this action, the United States remains committed to working \nwith both the new government and the people of Burma to ensure that the \ndemocratic transition is irreversible.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, May 17, 2016.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2446-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2446]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                ANNOUNCEMENT BY THE SPEAKER PRO TEMPORE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous materials on H.R. 897.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Ohio?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 897, the \nZika Vector Control Act.\n\n[[Page H2447]]\n\n  This summer, it is evident that the Nation will have to contend with \nthe outbreak of the known Zika virus. Like West Nile virus, it is \nspread to people primarily through the bite of an infected mosquito.\n  It has been a year since the first alerts of the Zika virus spreading \nto Brazil were issued. Since then, the virus has been spreading north, \nand with warmer months approaching, communities in the United States \nshould be given the tools necessary to stop Zika.\n  Many States, counties, and municipalities rely on mosquito-spraying \nprograms to protect public health, especially with the threats like \nZika, which is particularly harmful to pregnant women.\n  But protecting communities from Zika and other mosquito-borne \ndiseases has become difficult thanks to a burdensome and duplicative \nFederal regulation that requires more time and money to be spent on \ncompliance rather than protecting the health and safety of the American \npeople.\n  Congress cannot let this bureaucratic nonsense stand in the way of \npotentially preventing a public health crisis like the spread of the \nZika virus.\n  For 60 years, before the Clean Water Act was passed, the Federal \nInsecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, known as FIFRA, regulated \nthe use of pesticides in the United States. Even after the Clean Water \nAct was implemented, the Environmental Protection Agency believed that \nFIFRA was the appropriate regulatory authority for pesticides.\n  It was only after the decision by the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals \nin the case, National Cotton Council v. EPA, were permits under the \nClean Water Act required for pesticide use. This case vacated a 2006 \nEPA rule that codified their longstanding interpretation that the \napplication of a pesticide for its intended purposes, and in compliance \nwith the requirements of FIFRA, is not a discharge of a pollutant under \nthe Clean Water Act and, therefore, an NPDES permit is not required.\n  To put this in simple terms, the court's ruling cast aside Congress' \nintent in pesticide permits, and added another layer of bureaucracy for \nentities that work to protect the public health.\n  In vacating the rule, the Sixth Circuit Court simply reversed \nsensible agency interpretation, and instituted a new Federal policy by \njudicial decision.\n  In the process, the court undermined the traditional understanding of \nhow the Clean Water Act interacts with other environmental statutes, \nand expanded the scope of the Clean Water Act regulation further into \nareas and activities not originally envisioned or intended by Congress, \nand against longstanding EPA interpretation.\n  As a result of this court decision, EPA has been required to develop \nand impose a new and expanded NPDES permitting process under the Clean \nWater Act to cover pesticide use.\n  EPA has estimated that approximately 365,000 pesticide users, \nincluding State agencies, cities, counties, and mosquito control \ndistricts, water districts, pesticide applicators, farmers, ranchers, \nforest managers, scientists, and even everyday citizens that perform \nsome of the 5.6 million pesticide applications annually, are affected \nby the court's ruling. This substantially increases the number of \nentities subject to NPDES permitting.\n  With this ill-advised court decision, Federal and State agencies are \nexpending vital funds to initiate and maintain Clean Water Act \npermitting programs governing pesticide applications, and a wide range \nof public and private pesticide users are now facing increased \nfinancial and administrative burdens in order to comply with the new \nunnecessary permitting process.\n  Despite what the fear mongers suggest, all this expense comes with no \nadditional environmental protection.\n  NPDES compliance costs and fears of potentially ruinous litigation \nassociated with NPDES requirements are forcing States, counties, \nmosquito control districts, and other pest control programs to reduce \ntheir operations and redirect resources in order to comply with the \nregulatory requirements.\n  We know that routine mosquito prevention programs have been reduced \ndue to the NPDES requirements. Two anecdotal examples: In Orchard City, \nColorado, the city council decided to abandon their aerial mosquito \nspraying due to the new NPDES permits. The Colorado Aerial Applicator \nAssociation, which was certified, completely discontinued all aquatic \napplication services due to compliance of either the Colorado or NPDES \npermits.\n  In Utah, for the last 3 years, an Idaho-based NAA operator has been \ncontracted with a homeowner association north of Salt Lake City for \ntreatment of mosquitos. It was not uncommon for him to treat 17,000 \nacres in one night.\n  The NPDES permit makes it impossible for him to continue his services \nas he will be liable for noncompliance because the client/decisionmaker \ndid not require any sort of paperwork other than to substantiate that \nhis equipment was calibrated, thereby constituting noncompliance under \nthat Federal permit system.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  In 2012, this most likely increased the impact of the record-breaking \noutbreak of West Nile virus around the Nation.\n  In response to those West Nile outbreaks, many States and communities \nwere forced to declare public health emergencies, but this was only \nafter the outbreak of the West Nile virus. So what happens here when \nthey have an outbreak, an epidemic of West Nile in their community, \nthey can declare an emergency, and they don't have to get any permits. \nThey can just go out and spray to attack the epidemic.\n  So let's do this right and do it under the permitting process, but \nlet's have a process that works.\n  It is absolutely irresponsible to allow a public health crisis to get \nto this emergency stage, and then we have the ability to prevent it \nbefore removing a simple regulatory barrier.\n  H.R. 897 will enable communities to resume conducting routine \npreventive mosquito control programs without additional bureaucracy \ngetting in the way.\n  H.R. 897 provides a limited exemption for pesticides regulated by \nFIFRA and used under its product label--which is, by the way, approved \nby the EPA. Keep in mind, the pesticides necessary to combat Zika and \nstop the spread of mosquitos are already appropriately regulated under \nFIFRA. The red tape and compliance costs of an additional NPDES permit \nmake it more difficult for our applicator sprayers to stop the Zika \nvirus.\n  FIFRA regulation includes human health and environmental safeguards \nwhen pesticides are approved, including the rules of label use of a \npesticide. Adding an NPDES requirement is redundant and unnecessary.\n  H.R. 897 was drafted very narrowly to address only the Sixth Circuit \nCourt's decision and gives State and local entities that spray to \ncontrol mosquito populations the certainty and the ability needed to \nprotect public health. This commonsense legislation even received \ntechnical assistance from the EPA to achieve that goal safely and \neffectively.\n  Well over 100 organizations representing a wide variety of public and \nprivate entities and thousands of stakeholders support a legislative \nresolution of this issue. Just to name a few, these organizes include: \nthe American Mosquito Control Association, the National Association of \nState Departments of Agriculture, the National Water Resources \nAssociation, the American Farm Bureau Federation, the National Farmers \nUnion, the Family Farm Alliance, the National Rural Electric \nCooperative Association, CropLife America, the Biopesticide Industry \nAlliance, the Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment, the \nAgricultural Retailers Association, and the National Agricultural \nAviation Association.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shuster for his leadership on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee as well as Chairman Conaway \nof the Ag Committee and Ranking Member Collin Peterson of the \nAgriculture Committee for their leadership on this important public \nhealth issue.\n  This is a responsible, commonsense bill that will help ensure public \nhealth officials aren't fighting Zika with their hands tied behind \ntheir back. Mr. Speaker, I urge all Members to support H.R. 897.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n\n[[Page H2448]]\n\n  Well, Groundhog Day came a month earlier this Congress. That is how I \ndescribed this bill 2 years ago, July, because this is the third time \nthat we have considered this bill. Now, we must admit the rationale has \nchanged. Just last week--last week--it was named the Zika Control Act. \nBut before that, it was the Regulatory Burden Removal Act.\n  So the first time it was considered, it was H.R. 1749. That one, the \n109th Congress defeated. That was for West Nile virus--whoops. Then \nH.R. 872, last Congress, Reducing the Regulation Burdens Act, at the \nrequest of the American Farm Bureau because of a huge burden; and now \njust renamed last week, we are going to try and game a very serious \nthing, which is the potential spread of Zika, for which the Republicans \nthus far have appropriated zero dollars to help the States--zero. Now \nwe are going to pretend we are doing something here today about Zika. \nIt is not about Zika.\n  Now, this is pretty darn personal for me because the reason we have \nthis rule is because of a huge, massive fish kill in Oregon--a \nmisapplication of pesticide, an aquatic pesticide, into an irrigation \ncanal. We are talking about applications in or near water.\n  People drink water, fish swim in water, and other things are \ndependent upon water. We are talking about, no, we don't want to have \nthe EPA watch the pesticide operators who are putting pesticides in or \naround water. They should not be allowed to do that.\n  Now, 92,000 steelhead died in Oregon, and that was essentially the \nbeginning of this rule. Now they are saying this is horribly \nburdensome.\n  Well, first off, in my State, my one, little, isolated State, we have \n825 miles of rivers that are showing a significant level of pesticides, \n10,000 acres of lakes. Nationwide, it is hundreds of thousands of \nmiles, tens of thousands of miles and hundreds of thousands of acres.\n  We haven't been testing for pesticide residues in water, in drinking \nwater, until very recently. But now we don't want to do that anymore. \nWe don't want people to know. Let's just stop, because this is a \nhorrible burden.\n  Well, actually, not so much. This is controlled at two levels: the \nEPA and the States. Now, we just heard one anecdote about an aerial \napplicator in one State that just came up yesterday, unnamed, \nanecdotal, they suspended operations. Why? Who knows why? We don't know \nwhy. There are no facts behind it. But we should end the whole program \nnationwide because of one anecdote regarding one applicator who may \nhave been misapplying it in Colorado. We don't know.\n  So the committee asked the EPA and the States, how many people have \ncomplained and have had their operations interrupted? Interesting \nanswer: zero and zero. The 50 States say zero, except we now hear about \nan anecdote in Colorado, and the EPA says zero.\n  So now we are going to pretend this has something to do with Zika. \nThis has nothing to do with Zika. It has to do with whether or not \nsomeone is going to misapply a pesticide that is going to get in your \ndrinking water.\n  Now, we should become kind of sensitive about drinking water after \nwhat happened in Michigan, but, nah, we don't care. Get rid of those \nstinking regulators. Don't worry. No one would ever misapply a \npesticide. It won't get in your drinking water and won't kill fish--\neven though it clearly did that in Oregon. So this is really a kind of \ntransparent renaming and opportunistic approach to Zika.\n  How about considering a real bill to put some real money to partner \nwith the States to deal with this? By the way, they can spray wherever \nthey want because of a declared emergency, so it is automatically \ncovered.\n  But we are going to pretend that somehow we are going to facilitate \nthe spread of Zika if we don't wipe out the EPA's authority to keep \npesticides out of our water. This has been defeated twice before. Even \nthough it was creatively renamed in the last week, I would recommend \nthat my colleagues oppose it yet again.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Scalise), the majority whip.\n  Mr. SCALISE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of this Zika \nVector Control Act and want to commend Congressman Gibbs for his \nleadership in bringing this forward as we work here in the House to \ncombat Zika.\n  The House is doing a number of things this week. Number one, we are \nmoving legislation to reprioritize money so that there will be a total \nof $1.2 billion of moneys allocated to combat Zika.\n  But, in addition, while we are fighting Zika and giving not only \nFederal, but local agencies the resources they need to combat this \nterrible disease from spreading, we know, and CDC has told us, that it \nis spread by mosquitos. Mosquitos are the agents that spread Zika.\n  So here we have got Congressman Gibbs identifying a problem where the \nEPA is making it harder to actually kill mosquitos.\n  I come from south Louisiana. We have a lot of mosquitos in south \nLouisiana, and we don't like them. We actually spray using federally \napproved pesticides to kill mosquitos where they breed. Where do they \nbreed, Mr. Speaker? They breed by water. They breed by sources of \nwater. So you have got federally approved sprays and pesticides that \nare used to go and kill the mosquitos so that they can't spread Zika, \nand yet the EPA comes in and has a rule that makes it harder and more \nexpensive to actually go kill mosquitos.\n  All that Congressman Gibbs is saying is let's block that rule because \nlocal governments, by the way, still control this. It is our local \ngovernments, our parishes and counties, that are doing the spraying. \nThey understand how to comply with their own local laws. They are not \ngoing to do anything to jeopardize groundwater, but what they want to \ndo is kill mosquitos so that the mosquitos don't spread Zika to our \nconstituents.\n  If you look, this legislation actually was passed. It actually was \npassed in 2011 when we were responding to West Nile. So the House did \npass this legislation already, and it was good legislation then. In \nfact, it got a wide bipartisan vote. All of a sudden, some people want \nto politicize it. This isn't a political issue. This is about common \nsense.\n  Mr. Speaker, the EPA is just putting additional hurdles in place. It \nis not like they are saying don't spray these pesticides. They are just \njacking up the costs. It is an EPA money grab that makes it more \nexpensive and more difficult to actually go kill mosquitos.\n  So while we are debating whether or not to prioritize more money for \nZika--which we are doing, by the way, $1.2 billion worth--shouldn't we \nmake sure that the money can actually be used to effectively kill the \nmosquitos that spread Zika? If the EPA has got a rule that makes no \nsense and makes it harder to kill mosquitos, shouldn't we remove that \nrule and that barrier and allow and trust our local governments?\n  There are some people up here who think that Washington knows best, \nand if your local parish or county knows what they need to do to \ncontrol the mosquito population in their parish or county, shouldn't \nthey be able to do it? Or you don't trust them; you don't want to give \nthem the ability to go kill mosquitos.\n  Well, I do trust our local governments, and I want to give them the \ntools that they need to actually go and kill mosquitos at the source \nwhere they breed, and that is near sources of water. It is not in a way \nthat contaminates groundwater at all. In fact, EPA still gives these \npermits out, but it just costs a lot more money to go and kill the \nmosquitos. So let's remove that burden so we can kill more mosquitos \nand stop Zika from spreading.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is a really good, commonsense piece of legislation, \nand I urge its adoption.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the horrible burden the gentleman is talking about is a \nnotice of intent which says where and how something was applied. It is \nvirtually cost free. You can use a standardized form. But it is just \ngood to know where we are putting the pesticides and what pesticides \nare being used in case there are problems like the massive fish kill in \nOregon, which we were able to trace back to one misapplication by one \nprivate company, not by the local county or any other public entity.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Napolitano).\n\n[[Page H2449]]\n\n  \n\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I do rise in strong opposition to H.R. \n897, the Zika Vector Control Act.\n  The Clean Water Act in no way hinders, delays, or prevents the use of \napproved pesticides for pest control operations. In fact, the Clean \nWater Act permit provides a specific emergency provision to prevent \noutbreaks of disease, such as Zika.\n  Under the terms of the permit, pesticide applicators are \nautomatically covered under the permit, and spraying may be performed \nimmediately for any declared pest emergency situations. In most \ninstances, sprayers are only required to notify EPA of the spraying \noperations 30 days after the beginning of the spraying operation.\n  As I have noted before on similar bills, I have remained concerned \nthat this bill would mean that no Clean Water Act protections would be \nrequired for pesticide application to water bodies that are already \nimpaired by pesticides.\n  Most pesticide applications in the U.S. are done in accordance with \nthe Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act, FIFRA, which \nrequires proper labeling of pesticide products regarding usage. \nHowever, FIFRA labeling is no substitute for ensuring that we \nunderstand the volumes of pesticides that we seem to apply to our \nrivers, our lakes, and our streams on an annual basis.\n  According to a 2016 USGS report on pesticides, commonly used \npesticides frequently are present in streams and groundwater at levels \nthat exceed human health benchmarks and occur in many streams at levels \nthat may affect aquatic life or fish-eating wildlife.\n  In the data that the States provide the EPA, more than 16,000 miles \nof rivers and streams, 1,380 bays and estuaries, and 370,000 acres of \nlakes in the United States are currently impaired or threatened by \npesticides.\n  EPA suggests that these estimates may be low because many of these \nStates do not test for or monitor all the different pesticides that are \ncurrently being used. I am very concerned about the effect these \npesticides have on the health of our rivers, on our streams, and \nespecially the drinking water supplies of all of our citizens, \nespecially the most vulnerable, which are the young, the elderly, the \npoor and disenfranchised, who have no other protection.\n  I would also add that, if our true concern here is protecting the \nhealth of pregnant women in particular, we should focus on preventing \npesticide application directly or indirectly to drinking water sources.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have here a Federal report on how pesticides in \nCalifornia are a leading cause of impairments to water quality.\n  Currently in California, there are over 4,500 miles of rivers and \nstreams, 235,000 acres of lakes and reservoirs, and 829 square miles of \nbays and estuaries in my State that are impaired by pesticides.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  This is a significant concern in my home State, where every drop of \nwater needs to be conserved, reused, and cherished.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman and additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. We hear that pesticide application is already \nregulated under FIFRA and that the Clean Water Act review is not \nneeded. I understand the concerns about duplication of effort and the \nneed to minimize the impacts that regulations have on small business or \nbusiness at large.\n  However, I am still very concerned that these pesticides are having a \nvery significant impact on water quality and that we are creating this \nexemption from water quality protection requirements without \nconsidering the impacts to the waters that are already impaired with \npesticides, as they are in California.\n  This, in turn, costs our ratepayers, our water users, hundreds of \nmillions of dollars to filter these pollutants out of the water before \nit is potable. This is something I deal with on an ongoing basis, as \nthe ranking member of the Subcommittee on Water Resources and \nEnvironment.\n  We currently have aquifers that are contaminated by the continued use \nof pesticides and fertilizers. Millions of dollars have been spent on \nthe 15-year-long cleanup effort of a Superfund site in my area that has \npesticides as one of its contaminants.\n  We cannot and should not take away one of the only tools available to \nmonitor for adverse impacts of pesticides in our rivers, streams, and \nreservoirs. Over the past 5 years, this tool has been reasonable.\n  I oppose this bill.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to respond a little bit to the gentlewoman from California's \nconcerns about USGS studies. A lot of these studies are more than 10 \nyears old and do not reflect the current status of pesticide conditions \nand pesticide regulation today.\n  Many of the detections were what we call legacy pollution stemming \nfrom many years ago. Many of the detections were of pesticides that \nhave not been used in the United States for many years.\n  The vast majority of these detections that were in the more current \nstudies have found very low concentrations, which were at levels well \nbelow what they consider human health benchmarks. For example, \napproximately 99 percent of monitored water wells and greater than 90 \npercent of the monitored stream sites were below human health benchmark \nlevels.\n  Between 2002 and 2011--so before this court decision was in place--\nUSGS only found one stream where human health benchmarks exceeded \nlevels of danger. That is just one stream in the entire United States.\n  Because the USGS data is old, the data does not reflect improvements \nmade by the EPA made to its pesticide regulatory program under FIFRA \nover the past 10 years. This program has become more rigorous than it \nwas a decade or more ago.\n  The committee has also received testimony on how EPA uses its full \nregulatory authority under FIFRA to ensure that pesticides do not cause \nunreasonable adverse effects on human health and the environment, \nincluding our Nation's water resources.\n  In fact, EPA's pesticides and water programs both use the same risk \nassessment data, which helps to ensure that both programs are providing \nthe same level of protection against risk.\n  Pesticide usage patterns have changed, technologies have become more \nsophisticated, and pesticides are much more carefully applied, in part \ndriven by more elaborate label instructions and the high cost of \npesticides.\n  Consequently, to argue that the USGS reports show that regulating the \nuse of pesticides under the Clean Water Act is needed is nothing more \nthan just a red herring.\n  To address the issue that my good friend from Oregon raises about the \nfish kill, NPDES permitting is really a permit to discharge. If an \napplicator misuses that pesticide under the label, under FIFRA, that is \nillegal. They broke the law.\n  So not fixing this court decision doesn't have any effect on the \nunfortunate situation that happened in Oregon with the fish kill. \nNothing in the Clean Water Act will stop misapplication. It is already \nillegal under FIFRA. The person should be held accountable, prosecuted, \nand responsible for damages.\n  On the cost, there is more evidence out there of what is going on. \nThe California vector control districts came out with a report that \nestimated the cost is $3 million to conduct the necessary \nadministration for these permits. Just to conduct the administration, \nthe $3 million in California, that money could be used in other ways to \nfight and control mosquitos.\n  Also, as another example, Benton County, Washington's, Mosquito \nControl District calculated that their compliance with the NPDES permit \ncost them $37,334. They spent over $37,334 doing paperwork to secure \nthe Federal and State permits.\n  They spent this money updating maps to secure the permit. They spent \nthis money on permit fees. They spent this money on software to help \nwith the reporting requirements for the permit. They spent the money on \nlots of things associated with the permit, but they did not spend that \nmoney spraying for mosquitos.\n  Benton County estimates that, with that $37,334, they could have \ntreated 2,593 acres of water where mosquitos breed or they could have \npaid for over\n\n[[Page H2450]]\n\n400 West Nile lab tests or they could have hired three seasonable \nworkers. But Benton County got to spend their $37,334 to comply with a \nredundant Federal permit.\n  The National Agricultural Aviation Association, whose members perform \nover 17,000 public health and mosquito abatement applications every \nyear, estimates that, for one of their members with two planes and five \nemployees, compliance with the NPEDS permit requires one full-time \nemployee and $40,000 annually for one full-time employee to comply with \nthis additional permitting.\n  This permit is not simply ``the modest notification and monitoring \nrequirements are providing valuable safeguards against over-application \nof pesticides'' that my colleague is claiming.\n  It is an incredibly heavy-handed, expensive, time-consuming process \nthat takes dollars away from public health protection, putting it to \nmore paperwork and putting more people at risk and the health of our \ncommunities at risk.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains on each \nside?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Oregon has 10\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Ohio has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nMaryland (Ms. Edwards).\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the House \nconsideration of the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act that House \nRepublicans have incorrectly and misleadingly renamed the Zika Vector \nControl Act.\n  In the 113th Congress, this exact legislation with a bill number of \nH.R. 935 failed under suspension of the rules 253-148. At the time, \nRepublicans subsequently rescheduled it 2 days later under a closed \nrule to allow passage.\n  I was a Democratic manager of that bill under consideration in 2014. \nIn fact, since my statement laid out a real substantive concern with \nthe legislation, I include in the Record a copy of my remarks from that \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the 112th Congress, the Republican leadership moved \nsimilar legislation under the guise that, unless Congress acted, the \nprocess for applying a pesticide would be so burdensome, that it would \ngrind to a halt an array of agricultural and public health-related \nactivities.\n  Some may say that this may be a bit of hyperbole to describe the \nimpacts of the Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) pesticide \ngeneral permit.\n  However, if you were to compare the concern expressed before the \nagency's draft permit went into effect with the almost non-existent \nlevel of concern expressed after almost three years of implementation, \nyou would likely question why we are here this evening debating this \nbill.\n  Contrary to the rhetoric, EPA and the States have successfully \ndrafted and implemented a new pesticide general permit (PGP) for the \nlast two-and-a-half years that adopted several common-sense \nprecautionary measures to limit the contamination of local waters by \npesticides. And they do so in a way that allows pesticide applicators \nto meet their vital public health, agricultural, and forestry-related \nactivities in a cost-effective manner.\n  The sky has not fallen, farmers and forestry operators have had two \nsuccessful growing seasons, and public health officials successfully \naddress multiple threats of mosquito-borne illness, while at the same \ntime complying with the sensible requirements of both the Clean Water \nAct and the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide, and Rodenticide Act \n(FIFRA).\n  I say sensible because, as we should clearly understand, the intended \nfocus of the Clean Water Act and FIFRA are very different.\n  FIFRA is intended to address the safety and effectiveness of \npesticides on national scale, preventing unreasonable adverse effects \non human health and the environment through uniform labels indicating \napproved uses and restrictions.\n  However, the Clean Water Act is focused on restoring and maintaining \nthe integrity of the nation's waters, with a primary focus on the \nprotection of local water quality.\n  It is simply incorrect to say that applying a FIFRA-approved \npesticide in accordance with its labeling requirement is a surrogate \nfor protecting local water quality. As any farmer knows, complying with \nFIFRA is as simple as applying a pesticide in accordance with its \nlabel--farmers do not need to look to the localized impact of that \npesticide on local water quality.\n  So, why are groups ranging from the American Farm Bureau Federation \nto Crop Life America so adamantly opposed to this regulation?\n  One plausible answer is because these groups do not want to come out \nof the regulatory shadows that have allowed unknown individuals to \ndischarge unknown pesticides in unknown quantities, with unknown \nmixtures, and at unknown locations.\n  I wonder how the American public would react to the fact that, for \ndecades, pesticide sprayers could apply massive amounts of potentially-\nharmful materials, almost completely below the radar.\n  In fact, prior to the issuance of the pesticide general permit, the \nonly hard evidence on pesticide usage in this country came from a \nvoluntary sampling of the types and amounts of pesticides that were \npurchased from commercial dealers of pesticides.\n  No comprehensive information was required, or available, on the \nquantities, types, or location of pesticides applied in this country. \nBased on that practice, I guess we should not be surprised that, for \ndecades, pesticides have been detected in the majority of our nation's \nsurface and ground waters.\n  Which leads me to question how eliminating any reporting requirement \non the use of pesticides is protective of human health and the \nenvironment?\n  All this would do is make it harder to locate the sources of \npesticide contamination in our nation's rivers, lakes, and streams, and \nmake accountability for these discharges more difficult. If this \nlegislation were to pass, we would require more disclosure of those who \nmanufacture pesticides, than those who actually release these dangerous \nchemicals into the real world.\n  During the debate on Monday, several speakers questioned the \nenvironmental and public health benefits of the Clean Water Act for the \napplication of pesticides. However, many of these benefits are so \nobvious, it is not surprising they may have otherwise gone overlooked.\n  First, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires \npesticide applicators to minimize pesticide discharges through the use \nof pesticide management measures, such as integrated pest management. I \nfind it difficult to argue that using an appropriate amount of \npesticides for certain applications would be a problem.\n  Second, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires \npesticide applicators to monitor for and report any adverse incidents \nthat result from spraying. I would think that monitoring for large fish \nor wildlife kills would be a mutually-agreed upon benefit.\n  Also, it is the Clean Water Act, and not FIFRA, that requires \npesticide applicators to keep records on where and how many pesticides \nare being applied throughout the nation.\n  Again, if data is showing that a local waterbody is contaminated by \npesticides, I would think the public would want to quickly identify the \nlikely source of the pesticide that is causing the impairment.\n  Finally, and perhaps most important, I am unaware, despite repeated \nrequests to both EPA and States, of any specific example where the \ncurrent Clean Water Act requirements have prevented a pesticide \napplicator from performing their services. Despite claims to the \ncontrary, the Clean Water Act has not significantly increased the \ncompliance costs to states or individual pesticide sprayers, nor has it \nbeen used as a tool by outside groups or EPA to ban the use of \npesticides.\n  So, let me summarize a few points.\n  One, the Clean Water Act does provide a valuable service in ensuring \nthat an appropriate amount of pesticides are being applied at the \nappropriate times, and that pesticides are not having an adverse \nimpacts on human health or the environment.\n  Two, to the best of my knowledge, the pesticide general permit has \nimposed no impediment on the ability of pesticide applicators to \nprovide their valuable service to both agricultural and public health \ncommunities. In fact, most pesticide applications are automatically \ncovered by the pesticide general permit, either by no action or by the \nfiling of an electronic ``Notice of Intent.''\n  Three, Federal and state data make it clear that application of \npesticides in compliance with FIFRA, alone, as was the case for many \nyears, was insufficient to protect waterbodies throughout the nation \nfrom being contaminated by pesticides, so if we care about water \nquality, more needed to be done.\n  I can see no legitimate reason why we would want to allow any user of \npotentially-harmful chemicals to return to the regulatory shadows that \nexisted prior to the issuance of the Clean Water Act pesticide general \npermit. It has caused no known regulatory, administrative, or \nsignificant financial burden, and has been implemented seamlessly \nacross the country.\n  As was stated during the debate on Monday, this legislation is \nseeking to address a pretend problem that simply doesn't exist.\n  I urge a no vote on H.R. 935.\n\n[[Page H2451]]\n\n  In this Congress, this legislation was marked up early last year in \nthe Agriculture Committee as the Reducing Regulatory Burdens Act. The \ncommittee of primary jurisdiction, the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, has taken no action on the bill this time \naround; yet, here we are again on the House floor.\n  The Republican leadership has now changed the name of the bill to the \nZika Vector Control Act. A new name and the inclusion of a sunset date \nin 2018 are the only differences from previous iterations of this bill.\n  H.R. 897 is the exact same legislation that pesticide manufacturers \nand other special interests have been pushing for the past several \nyears. It would eliminate Clean Water Act safeguards that protect our \nwaterways and communities from excessive pesticide pollution.\n  The pesticide general permit targeted in this legislation has been in \nplace for nearly 5 years now, and alarmist predictions by pesticide \nmanufacturers and others about the impacts of this permit have failed \nto bear any fruit.\n  In fact, in March 2015, before the House Transportation and \nInfrastructure Committee, Ken Kopocis, Deputy Assistant Administrator \nof the Office of Water at the Environmental Protection Agency, \ntestified that:\n  ``We have not been made aware of any issues associated with the \npesticide general permit. Nobody has brought an instance to our \nattention where somebody has not been able to apply a pesticide in a \ntimely manner . . . There have been no instances.''\n  Yet, here we are. Since then, all across the country, pesticide \napplicators--usually utilities managing their rights-of-way--are \ncomplying with the Clean Water Act permits to protect water quality. \nThe public is getting information they need that we couldn't get before \nabout what pesticides are being sprayed into what bodies of water.\n  Congress should not and must not respond to outdated sky-is-falling \nproblems that history has shown has never occurred and weaken \nprotections for the water our children drink.\n  In past Congresses, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have \nchosen a public health emergency de jour as rationale to pass and enact \nthis legislation into law. At one time, they cited, as they have again \ntoday, West Nile virus. The next time it was the western wildland fire \nsuppression. Last Congress, it was the drought.\n  Now, in nothing less than a purely political move, Republicans are \nconsidering this bill on suspension, but this time under the guise of \ncombating the spread of Zika.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Ms. EDWARDS. Let us be clear. This bill has absolutely nothing to do \nwith Zika or trying to stop the threat of the Zika virus. Despite \nclaims made by my colleagues to the contrary, the permit already in \neffect allows spraying for Zika or other mosquito control programs.\n  H.R. 897 is simply another attack on the Clean Water Act as part of \nthe Republican's anti-environmental, deregulatory agenda. I urge my \ncolleagues to vote this legislation down.\n  And let's do something real to combat Zika. The President has asked \nfor $1.9 billion in emergency funding because it is an emergency. It is \na public health threat. If we did that now, then we would be fulfilling \nour duties and responsibilities.\n  But this legislation today fulfills no responsibilities, gets in the \nway of protecting clean water, and does absolutely nothing to combat \nthe Zika virus that, if you look at the map, is quickly spreading \nacross this country.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record the following letters \nof support:\n  A letter from nearly 100 organizations supporting H.R. 897, including \nthe National Association of State Departments of Agriculture, the \nNational Farmers Union, Ohio Professional Applicators for Responsible \nRegulation, the Pesticide Policy Coalition, and the National Council of \nFarmer Cooperatives;\n  The American Mosquito Control Association;\n  National Pest Management Association;\n  Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment; and\n  American Farm Bureau.\n\n                                                     May 17, 2016.\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Member of Congress: The nearly one hundred undersigned \n     organizations urge your support for HR 897, the Zika Vector \n     Control Act, which the House will consider today under \n     suspension of the rules.\n       Pesticide users, including those protecting public health \n     from mosquito borne diseases, are now subjected to the court \n     created requirement that lawful applications over, to or near \n     `waters of the U.S.' obtain a Clean Water Act (CWA) National \n     Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit from \n     the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) or delegated \n     states. HR 897 would clarify that federal law does not \n     require this redundant permit for already regulated pesticide \n     applications.\n       Under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide \n     Act (FIFRA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for \n     use with strict instructions on the EPA approved product \n     label. A thorough review and accounting of impacts to water \n     quality and aquatic species is included in every EPA review. \n     Requiring water permits for pesticide applications is \n     redundant and provides no additional environmental benefit.\n       Compliance with the NPDES water permit also imposes \n     duplicative resource burdens on thousands of small businesses \n     and farms, as well as the municipal, county, state and \n     federal agencies responsible for protecting natural resources \n     and public health. Further, and most menacing, the permit \n     exposes all pesticide users--regardless of permit \n     eligibility--to the liability of CWA-based citizen law suits.\n       In the 112th Congress, the same Reducing Regulatory Burdens \n     Act--then HR 872--passed the House Committee on Agriculture \n     and went on to pass the House of Representatives on \n     suspension. In the 113th Congress, the legislation--then HR \n     935--passed the both the House Committees on Agriculture and \n     Transportation & Infrastructure by voice vote, and again, the \n     House of Representatives.\n       The water permit threatens the critical role pesticides \n     play in protecting human health and the food supply from \n     destructive and disease-carrying pests, and for managing \n     invasive weeds to keep open waterways and shipping lanes, to \n     maintain rights of way for transportation and power \n     generation, and to prevent damage to forests and recreation \n     areas. The time and money expended on redundant permit \n     compliance drains public and private resources. All this for \n     no measureable benefit to the environment. We urge you to \n     remove this regulatory burden by voting ``YES'' on HR 897, \n     the Zika Vector Control Act.\n       Sincerely,\n       Agribusiness Council of Indiana, Agribusiness & Water \n     Council of Arizona Agricultural Alliance of North Carolina, \n     Agricultural Council of Arkansas, Agricultural Retailers \n     Association, Alabama Agribusiness Council, American Farm \n     Bureau Federation, Alabama Farmers Federation, American \n     Mosquito Control Association, American Soybean Association, \n     American Hort, Aquatic Plant Management Society, Arkansas \n     Forestry Association, Biopesticide Industry Alliance, \n     California Association of Winegrape Growers, California \n     Specialty Crops Council, Cape Cod Cranberry Growers \n     Association, The Cranberry Institute, CropLife America, \n     Council of Producers & Distributors of Agrotechnology.\n       Family Farm Alliance, Far West Agribusiness Association, \n     Florida Farm Bureau Federation, Florida Fruit & Vegetable \n     Association, Georgia Agribusiness Council, Golf Course \n     Superintendents Association of America, Hawaii Cattlemen's \n     Council, Hawaii Farm Bureau Federation, Idaho Grower Shippers \n     Association, Idaho Potato Commission, Idaho Water Users \n     Association, Illinois Farm Bureau, Illinois Fertilizer & \n     Chemical Association, Kansas Agribusiness Retailers \n     Association, Louisiana Cotton and Grain Association, \n     Louisiana Farm Bureau Federation, Maine Potato Board, \n     Michigan Agribusiness Association, Minnesota Agricultural \n     Aircraft Association, Minnesota Crop Production Retailers.\n       Minnesota Pesticide Information & Education, Minor Crops \n     Farmer Alliance, Missouri Agribusiness Association, Missouri \n     Farm Bureau Federation, Montana Agricultural Business \n     Association, National Agricultural Aviation Association, \n     National Alliance of Forest Owners, National Alliance of \n     Independent Crop Consultants, National Association of State \n     Departments of Agriculture, National Association of Wheat \n     Growers, National Corn Growers Association, National Cotton \n     Council, National Council of Farmer Cooperatives, National \n     Farmers Union, National Pest Management Association, National \n     Potato Council, National Rural Electric Cooperative \n     Association, National Water Resources Association, Nebraska \n     Agri-Business Association, North Carolina Agricultural \n     Consultants Association.\n       North Carolina Cotton Producers Association, North Central \n     Weed Science Society, North Dakota Agricultural Association, \n     Northeast Agribusiness and Feed Alliance, Northeastern Weed \n     Science Society, Northern Plains Potato Growers Association, \n     Northwest Horticultural Council, Ohio Professional \n     Applicators for Responsible Regulation, Oregon Potato \n     Commission, Oregonians\n\n[[Page H2452]]\n\n     for Food & Shelter, Pesticide Policy Coalition, Plains Cotton \n     Growers, Inc., Professional Landcare Network, RISE \n     (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment), Rocky \n     Mountain Agribusiness Association, SC Fertilizer \n     Agrichemicals Association, South Dakota Agri-Business \n     Association, South Texas Cotton and Grain Association, \n     Southern Cotton Growers, Inc., Southern Crop Production \n     Association.\n       Southern Rolling Plains Cotton Growers, Southern Weed \n     Science Society, Sugar Cane League, Texas Ag Industries \n     Association, Texas Vegetation Management Association, United \n     Fresh Produce Association, U.S. Apple Association, USA Rice \n     Federation, Virginia Agribusiness Council, Virginia Forestry \n     Association, Washington Friends of Farm & Forests, Washington \n     State Potato Commission, Weed Science Society of America, \n     Western Growers, Western Plant Health Association, Western \n     Society of Weed Science, Wild Blueberry Commission of Maine, \n     Wisconsin Farm Bureau Federation, Wisconsin Potato and \n     Vegetable Growers Association, Wisconsin State Cranberry \n     Growers Association, Wyoming Ag Business Association, Wyoming \n     Crop Improvement Association, Wyoming Wheat Growers \n     Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                             The American Mosquito\n\n\n                                          Control Association,\n\n                                   Mount Laurel, NJ, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Gibbs,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Congressman Gibbs: The American Mosquito Control \n     Association, in concert with mosquito control agencies, \n     programs and regional associations throughout the United \n     States, want to express our enthusiastic support for passage \n     of HR 897 the Zika Vector Control Act clarifying the National \n     Pollutant Discharge Elimination Systems (NPDES) permitting \n     issue facing our public health agencies.\n       Each year, over one half million people die worldwide from \n     mosquito-transmitted diseases. In the U.S. alone, the costs \n     associated with the treatment of mosquito-borne illness run \n     into the millions of dollars annually.\n       This amendment addresses a situation that has placed \n     mosquito control activities under substantial legal jeopardy \n     and requires ongoing diversion of taxpayer-supported \n     resources away from their public health mission. Though the \n     NPDES was originally designed to address point source \n     emissions from major industrial polluters such as chemical \n     plants, activist lawsuits have forced US Environmental \n     Protection Agency (EPA) to require such permits even for the \n     application of EPA registered pesticides, including \n     insecticides used for mosquito control. These permits are \n     mandated despite the fact that pesticides are already \n     strictly regulated by the EPA under the Federal Insecticide, \n     Fungicide and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA).\n       Currently, mosquito control programs are vulnerable to \n     lawsuits for simple paperwork violations of the Clean Water \n     Act (CWA) where fines may be up to $35,000 per day for \n     activities that do not involve harm to the environment. In \n     order to attempt to comply with this potential liability, \n     these governmental agencies must divert scarce resources to \n     CWA monitoring. In some cases, smaller applicators have \n     simply chosen not to engage in vector control activities.\n       Requiring NPDES permits for the discharges of mosquito \n     control products provides no additional environmental \n     protections beyond those already listed on the pesticide \n     label, yet the regulatory burdens are potentially depriving \n     the general public of the economic and health benefits of \n     mosquito control. This occurs at a time when many regions of \n     the country have seen outbreaks of equine encephalitis, West \n     Nile virus, dengue fever and the rapidly spreading new threat \n     of the Zika and chikungunya viruses.\n       This negative impact on the public health response and \n     needless legal jeopardy requires legislative clarification \n     that the intent of the CWA does not include duplicating \n     FIFRA's responsibilities. HR 897 seeks to achieve that goal \n     and we strongly encourage its passage via any legislative \n     vehicle that enacts its clarifying language into law.\n       Thank you for your strong leadership on this important \n     public health issue.\n       Adams County (WA) Mosquito Control District, American \n     Mosquito Control Association, Associated Executives of \n     Mosquito Control Work in New Jersey, Atlantic County Office \n     of Mosquito Control, Baker Valley Vector Control District, \n     Benton County (WA) Mosquito Control District, Columbia \n     Drainage Vector Control District, Davis County (UT) Mosquito \n     Abatement District, Delaware Mosquito Control Section, \n     Florida Mosquito Control Association, Gem County (ID) \n     Mosquito Abatement, Georgia Mosquito Control Association, \n     Idaho Mosquito and Vector Control Association, Jackson County \n     (OR) Vector Control District, Klamath Vector Control \n     District, Louisiana Mosquito Control Association, Magna \n     Mosquito Abatement District.\n       Manatee County (FL) Mosquito Control District, Matthew C. \n     Ball, Multnomah County (OR) Vector Control Program, New \n     Jersey Mosquito Control Association, North Carolina Mosquito \n     & Vector Control Association, North Morrow Vector Control \n     District, Northeast Mosquito Control Association, North Shore \n     Mosquito Abatement District (Cook County, Illinois), \n     Northwest Mosquito and Vector Control Association, Oregon \n     Mosquito and Vector Control Association, Pennsylvania Vector \n     Control Association, Philip D.

H.R. 897 is scheduled to be \n     considered by the full House of Representatives tomorrow, May \n     17. H.R. 897 would suspend the need to obtain unnecessary and \n     burdensome permits, allowing our industry to better protect \n     you from the mosquitoes that transmit the Zika virus.\n       Zika is an emerging mosquito-borne virus that currently has \n     no specific medical treatment or vaccine. Zika virus is \n     spread through the bite of infected mosquitoes in the Aedes \n     genus, the same mosquitoes that carry dengue fever and \n     chikungunya. The Zika virus causes mild flu-like symptoms in \n     about 20 percent of infected people, but the main concern \n     among leading health organizations is centered on a possible \n     link between the virus and microcephaly, a birth defect \n     associated with underdevelopment of the head and brain, \n     resulting in neurological and developmental problems. The \n     World Health Organization (WHO) recently declared Zika virus \n     a global health emergency.\n       Currently, pest management professionals who apply even \n     small amounts of pesticides in and around lakes, rivers and \n     streams to protect public health and prevent potential \n     disease outbreaks are required to obtain an additional, \n     redundant and burdensome National Pollutant Discharge \n     Elimination System (NPDES) permit prior to application. Under \n     the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act \n     (FIFRA), all pesticides are reviewed and regulated for use \n     with strict instructions on the U.S. Environmental Protection \n     Agency (EPA) approved product label. A thorough review and \n     accounting of impacts to water quality and aquatic species is \n     included in every EPA review. Requiring water permits for \n     pesticide applications is redundant and provides no \n     additional environmental benefit.\n       Pest management professionals are on the front lines of \n     protecting the public, using a variety of tools, including \n     pesticides. Requiring pest management applicators to obtain \n     an NPDES permit to prevent and react to potential disease \n     outbreaks wastes valuable time against rapidly moving and \n     potentially deadly pests. Water is the breeding ground for \n     many pests.\n       The pest management industry strongly urges you temporarily \n     remove this regulatory burden and help us protect people \n     throughout your community from mosquitoes that transmit \n     dangerous and deadly diseases, like Zika, by voting YES on \n     H.R. 897, the Zika Vector Control Act.\n           Sincerely,\n     National Pest Management Association.\n                                  ____\n\n                                        Responsible Industry for a\n\n\n                                            Sound Environment,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 17, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Gibbs,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Gibbs: Thank you for re-introducing the \n     H.R. 897. RISE (Responsible Industry for a Sound Environment)\n\n[[Page H2453]]\n\n     is a national not-for-profit trade association representing \n     producers and suppliers of specialty pesticides including \n     products used to control mosquitoes and invasive aquatic \n     weeds.\n       For most of the past four decades, water quality concerns \n     from pesticide applications were addressed within the \n     registration process under the Federal Insecticide, Fungicide \n     and Rodenticide Act (FIFRA) rather than a Clean Water Act \n     permitting program. Due to a 2009 decision of the 6th Circuit \n     U.S. Court of Appeals, Clean Water Act National Pollution \n     Discharge Elimination System Permits (NPDES) have been \n     required since 2011 for aquatic pesticide applications. NPDES \n     permits do not provide any identifiable additional \n     environmental benefits, but add significant costs and \n     paperwork requirements which make it more expensive to \n     protect people from mosquitoes that can vector the Zika \n     Virus, West Nile Virus, Dengue Fever and other viruses. \n     Permits also make it more expensive to control invasive \n     aquatic plants that over take our waterways and impede \n     endangered species habitat.\n       H.R. 897 would clarify that duplicative NPDES permits are \n     not needed for the application of EPA approved pesticides. \n     The elimination of these permits will speed response to \n     public health and other pest pressures, save resources for, \n     states, municipalities, and communities. We support this \n     legislation look forward to working with you and your \n     colleagues to advance this legislation.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Aaron Hobbs,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n  \n\n\n\n                              American Farm Bureau Federation,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 16, 2016.\n     Hon. Members,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Members of Congress: Later this week, the House will \n     vote on legislation that clarifies congressional intent \n     regarding regulation of the use of pesticides for control of \n     exotic diseases such as Zika virus and West Nile virus, as \n     well as for other lawful uses in or near navigable waters. \n     The American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) strongly supports \n     the ``Zika Vector Control Act of 2016'' and urges all members \n     of Congress to support this legislation.\n       AFBF represents rural areas nationwide that will be \n     impacted by the spread of dangerous exotic diseases like \n     Zika. The only control measure at this time is vector \n     control. Our members are aware that local mosquito control \n     districts face tight budgets and are concerned with the \n     operational disruptions and increased costs associated with \n     unnecessary and duplicative permitting requirements. Any \n     disruption in vector control will expose a large portion of \n     Farm Bureau members to mosquitos that may carry diseases like \n     Zika and West Nile virus.\n       We urge all committee members to vote in favor of the \n     ``Zika Vector Control Act of 2016.''\n       Thank you very much for your support.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Zippy Duvall,\n                                                        President.\n\n  Mr. GIBBS. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. McDermott).\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, I come down here to oppose this bill. I \nam not on the committee, but I was sitting in my office and it made me \nangry to hear people down here talking about H.R. 897.\n  You put out a title that says Zika Vector Control Act. That sounds \nlike a good thing. People ought to be happy we are going to control the \nspecter that is out there. But it is a lie.\n  This does nothing about Zika. It doesn't do anything with the \nresearch that the President has asked the money for. What it does \nsimply is turn the applicators and the pesticide manufacturers loose on \nthis country again.\n  I have been here long enough to remember all of the problems with the \nbird eggs that had soft shells and the birds were dying. All these \nanimals were dying all over the place because of DDT and all of the \nthings that happen with that kind of application freely in this \nsociety.\n  One of the things that you have to think about and what I would \ncaution my congressional friends in the Republican Caucus of is that \nyou ought to learn from history. Philadelphia was once full of malaria. \nPhiladelphia was a malaria city. You kept the windows closed at night \nbecause you didn't want to get malaria.\n  Now, what we are seeing today because of global warming is that \nmoving north from the equator are the organisms that create disease.\n  I heard somebody from Louisiana say: Oh, my God. We have got malaria. \nWe have got all kinds of problems in Louisiana.\n  You are going to have them. You can find evidence everywhere that \nthese organisms are there. But the answer is not to let there be \nunrestricted and uncontrolled application of pesticides.\n  That doesn't solve the problem because what it does is it creates \nanother set of illnesses related to the effects of pesticides on human \nbeings and on animals and on reproduction.\n  So what you are doing is you are saying: Well, if you spread this \nstuff out on the ground and all over the water and people are going to \nget in contact with that water, there is no question about it, directly \nor indirectly, and you are going to have the other diseases that come \nfrom this.\n  I won't give a whole long lecture on the effects of pesticides on \npeople, but I will remind Members about something called Agent Orange.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Guys like me who were around during the Vietnam war saw that stuff \nbeing sprayed all over the trees. People said: Oh, that doesn't do \nanything. It is just that the leaves drop off.\n  Then we had an epidemic of physical illnesses that were secondary to \nAgent Orange. We told veterans for years: It is not a problem. It is \nnot a problem. It was not that Agent Orange that got you.\n  Then we found out that, in fact, it was, and we have been paying and \npaying and paying.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. So this is one of those issues where you put it on \ncheap, but you are going to pay for it in the long term.\n  Now, some of you over there, clearly, don't care. As for the guy in \nMichigan who made the decision that they use that dirty river water and \ninflict that on the children of Flint and the lead poisoning and the \nlead effects on their heads, that is the kind of mentality we are \ndealing with with the people who run this bill every 2 years from the \ncompanies that make this stuff. It came in 2011, 2013, 2014, 2015. Here \nit is again this year. It will be back. This bill isn't done. They are \ngoing to keep trying to convince the American people that you can just \nspread chemicals everywhere, and it doesn't have effects on people, but \nit does. That is what environmental health is all about.\n  That is why this bill is a step backward to about 1950, when we \ndidn't really know what pesticides did to people. Now we do. We are \nabsolutely right in voting against this bill, and the President ought \nto veto it if it gets through. The Senate, as bad as they are, won't \neven let this bill through.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Costello of Pennsylvania). Members are \nreminded to direct their remarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Boy, talk about fear mongering. Comparing responsible pesticide use \nin protecting the environment and in protecting human health to Agent \nOrange is just really over the top.\n  I do agree with one thing the previous gentleman spoke about, which \nis that we have to do more for Zika, and we are going to do more in the \nHouse this week. This is one tool in the toolbox to address this.\n  As for this bit about spraying pesticides uncontrollably all over the \nplace, as a farmer, I have heard that all of my adult life, and it is \nreally bizarre because pesticides cost a lot of money. It is really \nbizarre in this case because to use these pesticides, you have to be \ncertified by the State and the EPA, and you have to be applying it by \nthe label that the EPA has already approved. This goes through rigorous \ntesting and regulation, so it is not uncontrollable. It is under FIFRA, \nwhich is the law the Congress set up many, many years ago to control \nthis. This is not an uncontrolled application of pesticides that is \ncontaminating our water bodies. As I said, the recent geological \nstudies document that we are not contaminating our water bodies.\n  I will make this clear that this is not uncontrollable and that we \nhave laws in place that are called FIFRA. If you break that law, you \nbreak the law, and you should be punished and held accountable.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The problem here is that FIFRA doesn't require recordkeeping. It is a\n\n[[Page H2454]]\n\nlabel, and you are supposed to follow the label. There is an even more \nrecent problem in Oregon--we talked about the fish kill earlier--which \nis the overflight spraying of an herbicide on forestlands, which was \napplied, and then it drifted into occupied areas and streams.\n  Now, without the EPA's requirement that you record and report, we \nwouldn't know that that had happened; but now we do, and the people who \nare complaining about health effects have some recourse since they know \nwhat was applied, when it was applied, and who applied it.\n  If we do away with that requirement and say, Oh, well, the States \nmight still require something, well, they might not. Therefore, it \nwould be: Are you going to follow the label or not? How are you going \nto find out if they followed the label? How are you going to find out \nwhose plane that was? How are you going to find out what they sprayed?\n  You won't be able to. If you get an impaired body of water, we are \nnow mapping things.\n  The EPA says: Wait a minute. Wait a minute. That body of water is \nalready impaired with this particular herbicide or pesticide. We should \nlimit more applications in that area.\n  No, we don't want to know about that. We don't want to know about \nthat.\n  That is the bottom line here. We are talking about recordkeeping and \nreporting after the fact: What did you use? Where did you put it? So if \nsomeone is injured or if we find out their water supply is impaired, \nthey can figure out how it happened, but not if we do away with this \nrequirement, with this Groundhog Day bill.\n  Again, it was pest management, it was forest health, then it was \nreducing regulatory burdens; but now it has been reborn in the last \nweek as Zika control because it is, as the gentlewoman from Maryland \nsaid, the cause du jour. It has nothing to do with Zika.\n  I was really pleased to see the majority whip say that they were \ngoing to put $1.2 billion into Zika because, as of the publishing of \nthe appropriations bill, it was only $622 million, which is a third of \nwhat the President asked for; so now they are up to 66 percent. That is \ngreat. I hope that is right because we haven't seen that in writing \nyet.\n  The bottom line is we need to partner with the States to deal with \nthe threat of Zika just like we did with West Nile--none of which is \ngoing to be impaired by a little recordkeeping--so that we know where, \nhow, what was applied so that citizens of the United States, private \nproperty owners, will have some recourse.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GIBBS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  First of all, the gentleman from Oregon talked about the \nrecordkeeping. There are additional burdensome records on this \nrequirement, the MPDS, but a certified pesticide applicator under FIFRA \nhas to keep records. They have to keep records on what they applied, \nhow they applied it, when they applied it, what the wind speed was, and \nwhat the temperature was--all of that--so that there is a record there. \nI wanted to correct his information as he was inaccurate on that.\n  We talked about West Nile. In 2012, we had a crisis in this country \nof the West Nile epidemic. Dallas, Texas, had to declare an emergency. \nThey probably weren't doing what they needed to do because of the MPDS \npermits. If they declare an emergency, they can spray without a permit.\n\n  That is why we put a sunset provision in this bill. On September 30, \n2018, this bill sunsets. The reason we put that in there is to address \nthis towards Zika. Zika will probably run its course. Hopefully, in 2 \nyears, we will forget about it like we have done with Ebola. The \nproblem is that we need to do everything we can to mitigate the problem \nin the interim. We saw last week there were 103 pregnant women in the \nUnited States who had the Zika virus. Today, I heard there were 113. \nThat number is jumping up. It is going to jump up fast because we are \nin mosquito season. When these mothers start delivering those babies \nand when we have all kinds of problems, it is not going to be a \npleasant experience; so we need to do everything we can. That 2-year \nsunset provision in there will really target and address this issue.\n  We need to give our States and local communities the tools they need, \nand we are going to do more this week. We are going to give them the \nresources, the dollars, they need; but we also have to make sure they \ncan spend that money, like in the example I gave of the $37,000. \nInstead of spending it on administrative paperwork, they can spend it \non killing the larvae and the mosquitos. It is easier to kill the \nmosquito population if you kill the larvae before they hatch. The risks \nare high, but we need to make sure we do this.\n  I reiterate that FIFRA is already in place to make sure that we don't \nhave bad actors out there who are polluting our water bodies. If they \ndo, they are going to be held accountable, and the EPA can step in and \ninvestigate those and do that. The EPA has all of the authority they \nneed because they approve the label, they approve the pesticide \ncertification, they approve the applicators. They can go back to every \napplicator and ask for their records. They can go into my local farm \nco-op and ask: When did you apply? What did you apply? What date did \nyou apply? And all of those records are there for our regulators to \nsee. They can do that.\n  All this bill does is fix the bad court decision that it has a \nregulatory burden. We need to support this bill and let our communities \nand our States do their jobs to protect the public health.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support of the bill, and I yield back the balance \nof my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to speak in opposition to H.R. \n897, the ``Zika Vector Control Act,'' because this bill was not written \nwith the intent to control Zika carrying mosquitoes, but rather to \nallow higher amounts of rodenticides, fungicides, and insecticides in \nwater.\n  The title for H.R. 897, two days ago was the ``Reducing Regulatory \nBurdens Act of 2015.''\n  I am very interested in doing everything I can to address the threat \nof Zika Virus, but I am not supportive of tricks or misguided \nstrategies to get legislation to the House floor in the name of Zika \nprevention that was conceived with no thought of the Zika Virus in \nmind.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, which \nhas a core mission of emergency preparedness of state and local \ngovernments to be equipped to react to emergencies make me acutely \naware of the potential for the Zika Virus to be a real challenge for \nstate and local governments during the coming months.\n  I thank President Obama for his leadership in requesting $1.9 billion \nto address the threat of the Zika Virus.\n  The 18th Congressional District of Texas, which I represent has a \ntropical climate and very likely of having to confront the challenge of \nZika Virus carrying mosquitoes before mosquito season ends in the Fall.\n  Houston, Texas, like many cities, towns, and parishes along the Gulf \nCoast, has a tropical climate hospitable to mosquitoes that carry the \nZika Virus like parts of Central and South America, as well as the \nCaribbean.\n  For this reason, I am sympathetic to those members who have districts \nalong the Gulf Coast.\n  These areas are known to have both types of the Zika Virus vectors: \nthe Aedes Aegypti [A-up-ti] and the Asian Tiger Mosquito, which is why \nI held a meeting in Houston on March 10, 2016 about this evolving \nhealth threat.\n  I convened a meeting with Houston, Harris County and State officials \nat every level of responsibility to combat the Zika Virus to discuss \npreparations that would mitigate its.\n  The participants included Dr. Peter Hotez, Dean of the National \nSchool of Tropical Medicine and Professor of Pediatrics at Baylor \nCollege of Medicine and Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County \nPublic Health Environmental Services Mosquito Control Division who gave \nstrong input on the critical need to address the threat on a multi-\npronged approach.\n  Dr. Dubboun, Director of the Harris County Public Health \nEnvironmental Services Mosquito Control Division stressed that we \ncannot spray our way out of the Zika Virus threat.\n  He was particularly cautious about the over use of spraying because \nof its collateral threat to the environment and people.\n  We should not forget that Flint, Michigan was an example of short \nsighted thinking on the part of government decision makers, which \nresulted in the contamination of the city's water supply.\n  The participants in the meeting represented the senior persons at \nevery, state and local agency with responsiblity for Zika Virus \nresponse and they agreed we need plan to address the Zika Virus in the \nHouston and Harris County area that will include every aspect of the \ncommunity.\n\n[[Page H2455]]\n\n  The collective wisdom of these experts revealed that we should not \nlet the fear of the Zika Virus control public policy.\n  Instead we should get in front of the problem then we can control the \nZika Virus from its source--targeting mosquitoes.\n  The consequences of too much insecticide, rodenticides or fungicides \nin water are known--to kill aquatic life and cause real damage to the \nfood chain upon which fish and larger sea life rely.\n  Along the Coast of the United States, many habitat restoration \nefforts are centered on the reduction of chemical run off from urban \nareas, not increasing insecticide pollutants in their waters.\n  The real fight against the Zika Virus will be bottled neighborhood by \nneighborhood and will rely upon the resources and expertise of local \ngovernment working closely with State governments with supported of \nfederal government agencies.\n  The consensus of the experts related to H.R. 897, the Zika Vector \nControl Act, is that we cannot rely heavily on spraying techniques to \ncontrol Zika Virus carrying mosquitoes.\n  Yes, spraying can reduce the population of mosquitoes, but it cannot \neliminate the threat and we can reach a point where the presence of \nchemical insecticides is in fact more harmful than helpful.\n  The Aedes Aegypti mosquito is the greatest threat to people has \nevolved to be near people.\n  These mosquitoes fly close to the ground, enter homes or stay nearby \nplaces where people live.\n  The spraying that this bill permits is on an industrial scale using \nproducts that are not found in a local grocery or home supply store.\n  The most important approach to control the spread of Zika Virus is \npoverty and the conditions that may exist in poor communities can be of \ngreatest risk for the Zika Virus breeding habitats for vector \nmosquitoes.\n  It is the illegal dumping of tires; open ditches, torn screens, or no \nscreens at all during the long hot days of summer that will \nunfortunately create a perfect storm for the spread of the virus.\n  Zika Virus Prevention Kits like those being distributed in Puerto \nRico will be essential to the fight against Zika Virus along the Gulf \nCoast.\n  These kits should include mosquito nets for beds.\n  Bed nets have proven to be essential in the battle to reduce malaria \nby providing protection and reducing the ability of biting insects to \ncome in contact with people.\n  Mosquito netting has fine holes that are big enough to allow breezes \nto easily pass through, but small enough to keep mosquitoes and other \nbiting insects out.\n  Bed nets that are not pre-treated with insecticide are effective and \nthey can be treated with DEET products after purchase.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no need to be alarmed, but we should be \npreparing to do what we can to prevent and mitigate the Zika Virus in \ncommunities around the nation.\n  We know that 33 states have one or both of the vector mosquitoes.\n  Dr. Peter Hotez said that we can anticipated that the Americas \nincluding the United States can expect 4 million the Zika Virus cases \nin the next four months and to date there are over a million cases in \nBrazil.\n  The most serious outcome the Zika Virus exposure is birth defects \nthat can occur during pregnancy if the mother is exposed to the Zika \nVirus.\n  Infections of pregnant women can result in: still births; the rate of \nMicrocephaly based on Zika Virus exposure far exceeds that number.\n  Microcephaly is brain underdevelopment either at birth or the brain \nfailing to develop properly after birth, which can cause: difficulty \nwalking; difficulty hearing; and difficulty with speech.\n  I call on my colleagues to pass the President's request for the $1.9 \nbillion in emergency supplemental appropriations.\n  I urge my colleagues to reject H.R. 897, and support the President's \nrequest to fight the Zika Virus threat.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Gibbs) that the House suspend the rules and \npass the bill, H.R. 897, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution 732 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 4909.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Idaho (Mr. Simpson) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1455\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 4909) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for \nmilitary activities of the Department of Defense and for military \nconstruction, to prescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal \nyear, and for other purposes, with Mr. Simpson in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Smith) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am honored to bring to the House today H.R. 4909, the \nNational Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  The House Armed Services Committee reported it favorably 3 weeks ago \nby a vote of 60-2. The only way a vote like that is possible is that \nmembers are willing to work together for the best interests of the \ncountry.\n  I want to start by thanking my partner on this committee, Mr. Smith, \nfor his work, his insight, and his commitment to work together to try \nto do the right thing for our servicemembers and for the good of the \nNation.\n  Now, I am sure that he does not agree with everything in this bill, \nnor do I. It is the product of difficult choices, of compromise, of \ninput from many members of this body.\n  But, as a whole, I think this bill is good for the troops, good for \nthe country, and is faithful to the constitutional responsibilities \nthat we have on our shoulders to provide for the military of the United \nStates and defend the country.\n  I want to thank all the members of the committee as well as the \nstaff. We had a compressed schedule this year. At the same time, the \ncountry is facing national security challenges that are growing more \ncomplex and more dangerous and we are still dealing with the \nconsequences of defense budget cuts.\n  Coupled with an ambitious reform agenda, all of those things meant \nthat our job was not easy, but members on both sides of the aisle put \nin the hours, attended the briefings and hearings, and contributed to \nthis product.\n  This bill was built from the ground up. We started with about 2,000 \nlegislative provisions that were suggested by members of our committee. \nWe then received many additional requests from members who are not on \nour committee through testimony, letters, and other forms of \ncommunication.\n  For example, some members of the Small Business Committee all came \ntogether with a package of proposals to help small businesses \ncontribute to our defense efforts.\n  We had subcommittee markups and then a full committee markup that \nlasted about 16 hours and considered 248 amendments.\n  Now we have more than 370 amendments that have been filed with the \nRules Committee, and many of them will be considered over the next 2 \ndays on this floor.\n  Mr. Chairman, I think that is the epitome of a regular legislative \nprocess and is particularly appropriate for this bill because providing \nfor the common defense is the first job, I believe, of the Federal \nGovernment.\n  I would add that servicemembers here and around the world deserve to \nknow that we in this body are doing our job and that we support them \nand are actually trying to do our job, inspired by the courage and \ndedication and selfless sacrifice that they exhibit in doing their \njobs.\n  I want to just highlight two primary thrusts of this bill in addition \nto fulfilling our constitutional responsibilities. Those thrusts are \nreadiness and reform.\n  The term ``readiness'' is often used by the military. It is sometimes \nnot understood by those who are not in the military. Readiness involves \nthe preparation and support required to successfully accomplish what \nthe political leadership asks the military to do.\n\n[[Page H2459]]\n\n  \n\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  It means having the right number of people for a mission, each of \nwhom is fully trained, has appropriate equipment, and is able to carry \nout their mission.\n  Now, we have got severe readiness problems today in the United States \nmilitary. We have pilots who are getting less than half the minimum \nnumber of training hours they are supposed to get in order to stay \nproficient in their airplanes. We are cannibalizing some aircraft just \nto keep other aircraft flying.\n  We have significant shortages of people in key areas, such as pilots \nand aircraft mechanics.\n  I could go on with examples and statistics which point toward, \nunfortunately, the kind of hollow military that our country has seen in \nthe past. Certainly there is a high level of frustration among many of \nour servicemembers.\n  Now, we do not fix all of those problems in this bill, but we start \nto turn them around. And to truly turn them around, it means not only \nproviding more resources for operations and maintenance and training \naccounts, it means we have to deal with personnel accounts, and we have \nto deal with modernization accounts.\n  This bill authorizes spending at the same level as requested by the \nPresident, $610 billion, when you add it all together.\n  Now, personally, I would prefer a higher number, but last year we saw \nmilitary funding used as a hostage to get more domestic funding. In \nfact, the President vetoed this bill once last year to force more \ndomestic spending, the first time that has ever been done. Once an \nagreement was reached, he signed the exact same bill into law with the \nfunding adjustments.\n  I think using the military as a hostage for domestic political \nleverage is deplorable, but I also want to avoid a repeat of that since \nPresident Obama is still in the White House. So we used the exact same \nnumber, the exact same top line as requested by the President.\n  Mr. Chairman, it would also be irresponsible for us to turn away and \nignore the severe readiness problems that are coming to the fore, so \nthis bill authorizes funding for several items that the President \nrejected in the budget proposal that he sent to us.\n  For example, it restores a full cost-of-living adjustment for our \nmilitary. It prevents further cuts in the number of people serving. It \nbegins to repair facilities. It adds funds for training and for \nmaintenance, and it makes some progress on replacing outdated weapons \nsystems.\n  So this bill provides full funding for the base requirements for the \nfull year, as was agreed upon in last year's balanced budget agreement.\n  It then provides a bridge fund to pay for the overseas deployments \nfor about half of the new fiscal year. That gives the new President, \nwhoever he or she may be, the opportunity to look at the deployments \nthat President Obama has begun, look at the funding that he has \nrequested, make adjustments however they think it needs to be adjusted, \nand then come back to Congress with their conclusions.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is exactly the approach that was used the last \ntime we transitioned between administrations. In June of 2008, this \nbody, under Democratic leadership, did exactly what I have described \nwith a bridge fund to get into 2009. We are following the same approach \nthis year.\n  Now, this bill also contains major reforms. In fact, there are five \nmajor reform packages in it, all of which are the work of bipartisan \nwork on the committee, and consultation with the Department of Defense.\n  Those areas, just briefly, are:\n  Acquisition reform to try to ensure that we are getting more value \nfor the money we spend, and that we get modern technology into the \nhands of the warfighters faster.\n  Military health care to modernize the system, provide better care, \nand ensure that the emphasis is where it is supposed to be, and that is \nmilitary health care for our warfighters.\n  Commissary reform to put domestic commissaries on a self-sustaining \ntrack while maintaining the benefit for our servicemembers, their \nfamilies, and for retirees.\n  Organizational reform, including the changes to the 30-year old \nGoldwater-Nichols law, and replacing the Quadrennial Defense Review, \nthe QDR, with something that is less costly and more useful.\n  Reform of the Uniform Code of Military Justice, long overdue and \nmodernization spurred by a review that we required in this committee \nthat was prompted by the sexual assault allegations of recent years.\n  So, Mr. Chairman, there is a lot here. There is a lot of substance, \nand there is a lot of reform, and it is all focused towards two goals. \nOne is to support the men and women who volunteer to risk their lives \nto protect us. And secondly, to preserve and protect the national \nsecurity of the United States of America in a very dangerous world.\n  I believe this bill deserves the support of all Members.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 5 minutes.\n  I want to thank the chairman and all the staff members and members of \nthe committee for their excellent work in pulling this bill together.\n  As always, I think it is a fine example of how the legislative \nprocess should work around here, and too often doesn't. We had a bill \nbefore committee. We had many, many hearings to discuss the issues \naround it. Then we had a long markup with amendments offered and \ndebated, and we put together a bill in a bipartisan fashion that I \nthink was done quite well.\n  I also agree with the chairman that there is a lot of good in this \nbill. There are a lot of efforts at reforming the way we do procurement \nand other things in the Department of Defense to try to get the most \nout of the money we spend.\n  More than anything, the good in this bill is that it continues to \nprovide for the men and women of our services who are fighting for us \nand protecting our national security, and I think it does a very \ncomprehensive job of that, and that is an important issue right now. I \nwill also agree with the chairman that we face as complex a threat \nenvironment as we have probably faced, gosh, in the history of the \ncountry. We have certainly had great national security challenges \nthroughout our history, but now they are coming at us from all \ndirections.\n  Certainly, we have the asymmetric threat of terrorism from groups \nlike al Qaeda and Daesh and all that goes with that.\n  We have a newly belligerent Russia that is creating problems in \nEastern Europe and elsewhere. We have Iran, which continues to pose \nchallenges to us in the Middle East and also elsewhere; North Korea, \nthat is acting in a very belligerent manner; and China, that is \nexpanding its territory by creating islands in the South China Sea and \nchallenging the territorial integrity of other nations.\n  All of those things require us to be prepared and to have a robust \nnational security policy. I think this bill does a good job of it.\n  Now, we are facing a reckoning, coming down the road here, in that \nall of those national security challenges that I just mentioned are \ngoing to be tough to meet under any budget.\n\n  One of the things that I would urge us to do is to work more closely \nwith partners throughout the globe, as we have in some instances, to \nmeet our national security challenges, because the sheer cost of them \nis going to be difficult. But on the whole, I think this bill does a \ngood job of meeting our national security concerns.\n  There are just two problems that I do want to point out. Number one, \nwe don't really make as many tough choices as we should make in this \nbill. The chairman has pointed out how this bill prioritizes readiness, \nand to some degree that is true; but this bill also still has $11 \nmillion less in money for readiness than the President's budget that \nwas proposed because we support a wide range of other programs.\n  If you look over the course of the next 10 years at all of the \nprograms that we are funding and planning on buying, and then you look \nat how much money we are likely to have, the two don't add up. We have \nto start making some difficult choices about what we are going to fund \nand what we are not going to fund.\n  Related to that is the second problem, the one the chairman alluded \nto, and that is the fact that while this\n\n[[Page H2460]]\n\nbudget sticks to the $610 billion number that was agreed to in the \nbudget resolution last year, it takes $18 billion out of the overseas \ncontingency operations fund and puts it into the base budget, which \nmeans that 6 months into the fiscal year our troops in Afghanistan and \nIraq and elsewhere will not have the money to support those overseas \noperations unless a supplemental is passed.\n  Now, the chairman is quite correct: this was done in 2008. But in \n2008, we did not have the Budget Control Act. We did not have the \ncomplete unwillingness of this Congress to lift the Budget Control Act. \nI don't see that changing in the next 6 months.\n  Which brings us to the other issue, and that is the issue of \n``holding the defense bill hostage for other spending priorities, for \ndomestic spending priorities.''\n  Well, that is one way of looking at it. The other way of looking at \nis a budget is a series of choices that you have to make. And if we do \nspend an additional $18 billion on defense, over and above what the \nbudget agreement of last year agreed to, then that money has got to \ncome from somewhere.\n  Either, one, it adds to a $19 trillion debt that I think most people \nfeel is too high and that we need to eventually get to the point of a \nbalanced budget.\n  It requires new revenue which, of course, is--you know, I should be \nstruck down by lightning in this Chamber for even mentioning the words \n``new revenue.'' That is, apparently, verboten and not going to happen.\n  However much we may claim to support the men and women who served in \nour Armed Forces, we are not prepared to raise taxes for what they need \nto do.\n  Then you have got the domestic choices, and those domestic choices \nare not irrelevant. We have a crumbling infrastructure in this country \nthat is way behind, massively unfunded.\n  We have other priorities. We have the Department of Homeland \nSecurity. We have Intel priorities. All of those priorities are shoved \nbackwards if we take an additional $18 billion for defense.\n  So we are not holding defense hostage. We are arguing about what our \nbudget priorities should be.\n  Should we go and take the $610 billion agreement we had for defense \nand effectively up it to $628 billion at the expense of all these other \npriorities, or shouldn't we? That is what we have to balance.\n  I will look forward to the debate. There are a lot of interesting \namendments coming up. I am not sure at this point how I am going to \nvote on this bill. I think it is incredibly important. We need to get \nit done.\n  But those budget priorities are very real. And if we take an extra \n$18 billion for defense, that does shortchange other areas, given our \nunwillingness to raise revenue to pay for it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the distinguished majority \nleader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to take one moment. Very seldom do we see a bill \nof this significance come to the floor in such a bipartisan manner. \nThat takes leadership, it takes experience, and I want to thank the \nchairman for that. He knows that I trust his judgment, but more \nimportantly, whenever we are talking about national security, he is the \nfirst one that I call. But I am not the only one who calls him: those \naround the world do as well.\n  I want to take a moment to thank the ranking member as well. The vote \nto come out of this committee was 60-2. That shows the leadership on \nboth sides that when America looks at national security, they want \nRepublicans and Democrats alike to work together.\n  Both of you have shown that leadership, and I want to congratulate \nyou for that, bringing it to the floor in that manner.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is indisputable that our national security has \ndeclined under President Obama's watch. Terrorists are attacking us \nright here at home. Europe is under siege. And, yet, the President is \nmore focused on closing Guantanamo Bay and releasing detainees than he \nis on the real threats to American security.\n  Afghanistan is increasingly unstable, and the Taliban and al Qaeda \nare gaining ground. Yet, President Obama remains committed to \nwithdrawing our troops while constraining their ability to take the \nfight to the enemy.\n  These are just two examples, and I don't need to go through the whole \nlist. Just look at the map of the world, and what do you see?\n  Allies that have been slighted, enemies that have been appeased, \nregions that have fallen into conflict and chaos.\n  The Obama administration is not the direct cause of every problem, \nbut the President's inadequate responses, naive beliefs, and failures \nof leadership have put American interests at risk and made our country \nless safe.\n  Now, House Republicans have always been and remain committed to a \nstrong American military, an active foreign policy, and continued \nAmerican leadership in the world.\n  We must counter the terrorist threats forcefully. We must reaffirm \nand strengthen our strategic alliances, like NATO. We must engage and \nprevent, not retrench and respond.\n  This National Defense Authorization Act demonstrates our commitment \nby prioritizing funding to support more troops, better defenses, and \nbetter equipment.\n  Most importantly, this bill works to improve readiness, and ensures \nthat our men and women are prepared to go into battle.\n  The President has fought this approach and has said he will veto this \nbill as it currently stands. That is despite a 2.1 percent pay raise \nfor our troops, better resources for the warfighter, an aggressive \nstance against Russian expansion, and funding for Israel's missile \ndefense.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  This is the height of irresponsibility. With this bill, the House \nmakes it clear that we intend to reinvigorate the Department of \nDefense, take care of our men and women in uniform, stand with our \nallies, and make every possible effort to defeat global extremism.\n  The President should share these goals and sign this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Ms. Loretta Sanchez), the ranking member \nof the Tactical Air and Land Forces Subcommittee.\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman \nThornberry, Ranking Member Smith, and all of our staff for tirelessly \nworking on this very incredibly important bill. Also I would like to \nthank Mr. Turner. For the past 4 years, he has been the chairman and I \nhave been the ranking member of the Subcommittee for Tactical Air and \nLand Forces. It has been a pleasure.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act, of course, is a must-pass \nbill. We have passed it for the past 53 years, and I am really honored \nto have been part of it for the past 20.\n  The NDAA is the annual piece of law that puts the necessary resources \nand funding to ensure that our servicemembers are fully equipped and \ntrained to defend our country here and abroad. All of our military \nsystems--air, land, water, and space--are authorized by this \nlegislation. It provides new opportunities for the Department of \nDefense to engage in innovative research and development to ensure that \nAmerica has the most technologically advanced military. Of course, that \nalso bleeds over into the civilian world with all of our new \ntechnologies.\n  The NDAA makes sure that servicemembers and their families are \nprovided with the necessary support and resources as they sacrifice \ntheir lives to defend their country. Just last Friday, I had the \nopportunity to be in Erie, Pennsylvania, where our son was commissioned \nas a second lieutenant and officer into the U.S. Army artillery. So I \nam pretty excited to continue to support our military families because \nwe are one.\n  This bill also provides provisions to support women in the military--\nmaking equipment that actually fits them, for example--and we put in \nlanguage for parental leave for our servicemembers for up to 14 days.\n  It increases funding for nuclear nonproliferation, something which I \nam an adamant supporter of, trying to eliminate nuclear threats for the \nfuture, for our grandchildren and their children.\n\n[[Page H2461]]\n\n  It increases funding for K-12 STEM education because, again, we have \nto invest in our future, and the future of education is equal to our \nnational security. The legislation also provides funding and resources \nto counterterrorism, including those threats from ISIL.\n  On our particular subcommittee, we included some significant \noversight legislation. Everybody thinks about passing laws, but the \nreality is that one of the main things that we have to do as Members of \nCongress is to oversee what is really happening in programs and with \nthe money of our taxpayers. So we included the F-35 Joint Strike \nFighter's software oversight, the F-18 Super Hornet oxygen system, and \na multiyear procurement authority for the Army's helicopters.\n  However, the successful passage of this important legislation is at \nrisk because, first, it doesn't comply with the Republicans' Budget \nControl Act because it is $18 billion over the budget caps. Secondly, \nit includes a number of discriminatory provisions, such as language \nthat would allow government contractors to discriminate against the \nLGBT community.\n  There are many things that we need to do to ensure that this bill can \nbe, in a bipartisan way, passed by this House.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Forbes), the chairman of the Subcommittee \non Seapower and Projection Forces.\n  Mr. FORBES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  I want to first commend the leadership of Chairman Thornberry in \nbringing this bill to the floor. His leadership has been instrumental \nin tackling many of the tough issues this committee has had to address.\n  I am particularly impressed with the chairman's leadership to make \nsure that this Congress provides the required equipment and readiness \nthat will begin to turn some disconcerting trend lines with our \nnational security.\n  For example, Navy aviation has only 3 in 10 Navy jet aircraft that \nare fully mission capable; aircraft carriers are not available in \nsufficient quantities, and our Nation had a carrier gap of almost 3 \nmonths in Central Command last year; Navy ship deployments have \nincreased almost 40 percent, and submarine demand continues to outpace \navailability, with the Navy projecting they will meet only 42 percent \nof the combatant commanders' demand, and this is before we reduce \nanother 20 percent of our submarines by the end of the 2020s.\n  As to the Air Force, our B-1 fleet was pulled back from the Arabian \nGulf this year because of engine maintenance issues and replaced with \nB-52s that are over 50 years old; and in the last 4 years, we have \nreduced our tactical airlift by 20 percent.\n  I think everyone would agree that these are disturbing trends. It is \ntime we invest in these capabilities. This bill goes a long way to \nreversing this trajectory and authorizes funds to meet the 350-ship \nNavy that our Nation needs. I believe it is a national security \nimperative to arrest the decline of our projection forces.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Rhode Island (Mr. Langevin), the ranking member of the \nEmerging Threats and Capabilities Subcommittee.\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry, Ranking Member \nSmith, and my fellow colleagues on the committee this year for many \nimportant issues within the committee's jurisdiction which we found in \nthis bill, on which I have been proud to work with my colleagues.\n  As ranking member of the Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nSubcommittee, I especially want to thank my subcommittee colleagues, \nparticularly my colleague Joe Wilson, the chairman of the subcommittee. \nIt has been a pleasure to work with him.\n  I also want to take this opportunity to recognize members of the \nstaff who worked so hard on this bill, without whom we wouldn't be able \nto move legislation of this magnitude forward.\n  The legislation, Mr. Chairman, before us today continues to address \ncritical priorities and programs at the strategic, operational, and \ntactical levels when it comes to emerging threats and capabilities.\n  In particular, I am pleased with many provisions relating to game-\nchanging technologies, such as language addressing how to properly \noperationalize directed energy technologies, electromagnetic rail gun \nmount funding, electronic warfare capabilities, strategy requirements, \nand a point person within DOD for directed energy systems.\n  This legislation goes on also to prioritize the readiness of the \nCyber Mission Force and fully supports U.S. Cyber Command while \nelevating this critical entity to its own combatant command. This \neffort enhances our superiority in the cyber domain, and I am glad the \ncommittee recognized the need to take this vital step.\n  I am also pleased with the approach we took toward enhancing \ncapabilities and extending authorities to defeat nonstate actors like \nISIL and al Qaeda.\n  I am also pleased with the continued support of our Special \nOperations Forces and their families who are under the responsibility \nof the subcommittee, and those forces which are always at the pointy \ntip of the spear.\n  Although this bill moves the ball forward on policies vital to our \nnational defense, of course, it is far from perfect. We must continue \nto address funding issues in other areas of concern as we move forward \nin the process.\n  In closing, I want to thank all the members of our subcommittee, as \nwell as the members of the full Armed Services Committee, for their \nsupport during this markup.\n  I again commend Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith for \ntheir leadership. I look forward to our continuing to work together to \ncraft a final product with the Senate that provides further support for \nour men and women in uniform, our military families, and further \nstrengthens our national security.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson), the chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for \nhis efforts to promote peace through strength.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to support H.R. 4909, the National \nDefense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, which I believe \nfaithfully sets forth a path to recover and strengthen our military \nreadiness.\n  As chairman of the Subcommittee on Emerging Threats and Capabilities \nof the House Armed Services Committee, I am particularly appreciative \nto oversee some of the most innovative aspects of the Department of \nDefense.\n  A few key areas of the subcommittee's contributions to this \nlegislation are providing robust and resilient cyber capabilities and \nauthorities to improve our cyber readiness and ensure resiliency for \nDepartment of Defense networks and weapons systems. We support \ninnovative science and technology programs and authorities to meet \nfuture challenges. We fully resource and support our Special Operations \nForces, who remain at war and globally postured, supporting our \nnational security in the global war on terrorism. We extend vital \ncounterterrorism authorities while improving congressional oversight in \nthis very important area.\n  Again, I would like to thank Chairman Mac Thornberry for his \nsteadfast leadership as well as the subcommittee ranking member, Mr. \nJim Langevin of Rhode Island, who has been an energetic partner on \nthese issues with an extraordinary subcommittee staff.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support this bill and vote \n``yes'' on H.R. 4909.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Guam (Ms. Bordallo), the ranking member of the \nReadiness Subcommittee.\n  Ms. BORDALLO. Mr. Chairman, I commend Chairman Thornberry, Ranking \nMember Smith, and the committee staff who have worked many, many long \nnights on the FY17 National Defense Authorization Act. I worked with \nMr. Smith and members on the committee, particularly the Readiness \nchairman, Mr. Rob Wittman, to include a number of provisions that will\n\n[[Page H2462]]\n\nimprove our military readiness and continue to support the Asia-Pacific \nrebalance, allowing crucial infrastructure projects to move forward and \nrequiring the Navy to report on land usage on Guam that will have \npositive impacts for our posture in this region.\n  The bill provides critical funding to the Long Range Strike Bomber \nprogram as well as adds additional funding to keep the fielding of the \nMQ-4 program on track.\n  I especially want to thank Ranking Member Smith for working to get a \nprovision mandating a review of distinguished Asian American and \nPacific Islander veterans who may have been unjustly overlooked in the \nMedal of Honor consideration included in the chairman's mark. It is \nimportant that we appropriately recognize the contributions of our \nbrave men and women in uniform.\n  While I am proud of these and other provisions, this bill is far from \nperfect. There are, once again, numerous damaging environmental \nprovisions; and, more broadly, I am disappointed that the majority has \nagain created a bill that circumvents budget caps, a maneuver that \nplays politics with our servicemembers in the field--particularly \nreckless in this environment.\n  I look forward to working with my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle to address these and other concerns, and I hope common sense will \nprevail as this process continues.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Turner), the subcommittee chairman on Tactical \nAir and Land Forces.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  As the chairman has indicated, the President has issued a veto threat \non this bill claiming criticism that the bill uses overseas contingency \noperations funds for base requirements. This is a hypocritical attack \nby the President because the President, in his own bill, included $5 \nbillion in overseas contingency operations funding to be used for base \nrequirements as part of the President's budget for 2017.\n  The reality is that $5 billion is not enough to address the readiness \ncrisis that is facing our military, and it does not ensure that our \ntroops are ready to deploy and are fully prepared. The military, in \nfact, submitted $22 billion in unfunded requirements for fiscal year \n2017 alone.\n  I want to thank Chairman Thornberry for his leadership as he begins \nthe process of rebuilding our military and restoring readiness back \ninto the future. As the chairman said, this bill came out of our \ncommittee, 60-2. It is the same bill that is going to come to this \nHouse floor.\n  I certainly hope we are not in the situation, as we were last year, \nwhere we had Democrats on the committee who actually voted for the bill \nin committee and then voted against the bill on the House floor. This \nis a bill that deserves passage. It deserves the support for our men \nand women in uniform.\n  In my subcommittee, the bill authorizes almost $6 billion in \nadditional funds to address critical unfunded requirements, a benefit \nprovided by the military services.\n  I want to also thank Chairman Thornberry, in this bill, for reversing \nthe President's proposed cuts to our end strength, our numbers of those \nserving in the Army and the Marine Corps. He has incorporated the \nPOSTURE Act, which was first introduced by Representative Chris Gibson.\n  The bill also includes funds for the European Reassurance Initiative, \nwhich is incredibly important as we move to respond against Russian \naggression.\n  Additionally, this bill calls for continued action to eradicate \nsexual assault in the military, and I appreciate the chairman's support \nfor those provisions.\n  The bill provides greater transparency in the military criminal \njustice system, acknowledges the need for intensive treatment for male \nvictims of sexual assault, and continues to address the critical issue \nof retaliation.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Before I conclude, I want to thank our subcommittee's ranking member, \nMs. Loretta Sanchez, for her support in completing the markup of this \nbill as well as that of other Members, and I want to thank Loretta \nSanchez for her long service on the Armed Services Committee.\n  I ask everyone to support this bill.\n  The CHAIR. The Chair would remind Members to refrain from engaging in \npersonalities toward the President.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Connecticut (Mr. Courtney), the ranking member of the \nSeapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Chair, I enthusiastically support the seapower \nportion of the defense bill, which is a strong bipartisan boost to our \nsecurity on, below, and above the seas.\n  The Seapower and Projection Forces Subcommittee worked hard this year \nexamining the President's budget as well as the larger strategic \nmaritime context that we are considering these programs in.\n  We have determined the following, that the demand for our naval fleet \nis higher than ever and so is the strain on the force. A casual review \nof the headlines explains why.\n  China's navy is militarizing the South China Sea, threatening good \norder and commerce on the world's seaways, completely in violation of \ninternational maritime law.\n  Russia's navy is recapitalizing its fleet, particularly its undersea \nfleet, and operating at a level not seen since the cold war.\n  These are just two examples of the up-tempo challenges that the Navy \nfaces every single day. In this strategic context, the seapower portion \nof our bill builds on the work done by the Navy, the Obama \nadministration, and this Congress to put us on a path to a 308-ship \nNavy within the next 5 years.\n  That is good, but it is clear we need to do more to ensure that we \nhave the capability to keep pace with the growing and changing threats \naround the world. That is why this bill adds three new ships to the \nseven ships in the President's budget, a third littoral combat ship, \nfunding to complete a third DDG-51 destroyer, and resources to add an \nadditional amphibious ship.\n  Our bill also has another area of good bipartisan work. It is in the \narea of our undersea forces. Our bill not only sustains the two-a-year \nbuild rate of our advanced Virginia-class submarines, but also includes \na measure that I pushed for to continue that build rate through the \n2020s to provide the undersea capabilities our military leaders are \npleading for.\n  Our bill also fully funds our Nation's top strategic priority, the \nOhio replacement submarine. We also continue our bipartisan work to \nstrengthen the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund to support this \ncritical program outside of the regular shipbuilding account.\n  We provide this fund with new authorities to save additional funds \nduring the course of building the Ohio class program--perhaps as much \nas 10 percent on components like missile tubes--on top of the billions \nin savings that already existing authorities in the fund were shown to \ngarner by the CRS and the Congressional Budget Office.\n  The bipartisan seapower mark is a down payment on the additional \nnaval capabilities and capacity that we will need to keep pace with the \nfast-changing security challenges around the globe. I am confident that \nit will emerge in the final enactment of the 2017 NDAA.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nAlabama (Mr. Rogers), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee on \nStrategic Forces.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the \ndistinguished chairman of the House Armed Services Committee for his \nleadership in bringing what I think is a very good NDAA bill to the \nfloor. This is the 55th consecutive NDAA.\n  This is not an easy bill to manage. We have a critical set of funding \nchallenges as the administration's budget submission for FY 2017 broke \nthe deal negotiated in 2015 to achieve the Bipartisan Budget Act of \n2015.\n  Because of this failure, we in Congress must exercise our \nconstitutional duty to provide for the men and women in uniform and we \nmust provide much-needed oversight of the Department of Defense and the \nDepartment of Energy.\n  This bill includes a number of key provisions that were authored by \nthe\n\n[[Page H2463]]\n\nSubcommittee on Strategic Forces that I lead, including:\n  Consolidating and strengthening the Air Force's organization \nregarding our nuclear command and control and missile warning systems;\n  It enhances the authority for the Department of Defense and, also, \nthe Department of Energy to mitigate threats from unmanned aircraft at \nits most sensitive nuclear facilities;\n  It prohibits the DOE funding for Russia and for Secretary Kerry's \nunilateral disarmament initiative concerning retired U.S. nuclear \nwarheads;\n  It tackles the significant and growing foreign counter space threat \nthat our space systems are suffering by providing the necessary \nresources to build up our space security and defense capabilities and \nby ensuring the Department is organized properly and has the \nauthorities it needs to maintain our space advantage long into the \nfuture;\n\n  It makes clear that replacement of the RD-180 in a reasoned, prudent \ntimeline is the primary goal of the Department of Defense to maintain \nassured access to space while protecting the taxpayers and ending our \nreliance on Russian rocket engines;\n  It requires the Army to do a better job for its soldiers than \ndelaying the procurement of a modern radar until 2028 at the earliest; \nand\n  Most significantly to me, in this bill we have recommended to the \nchairman a significant increase of over $400 million for the Missile \nDefense Agency, focusing on R, and full funding of the request of our \nallies in Israel, $600.7 million, for codevelopment and coproduction of \nIron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow 3.\n  I want to thank the chairman for his leadership, and I want to thank \nmy good friend and colleague from Tennessee, Mr. Jim Cooper, for his \nsupport, counsel, and thoughtfulness. I couldn't ask for a better \nranking member.\n  I urge support of the bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Tennessee (Mr. Cooper), the ranking member of the \nStrategic Forces Subcommittee.\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Washington. I thank \nalso the chairman of the full committee from Texas and my particular \nfriend, the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).\n  All the members of the subcommittee contributed greatly to the final \nproduct. It is not to all of our liking, but we are making progress.\n  We agree on so many of the fundamental provisions having to do with \nnational security. For example, I am thankful that our safe, secure, \nand effective nuclear deterrent is fully funded and we are also \nproviding full support for our nuclear nonproliferation efforts as well \nas providing for nuclear cleanup. Those are all very important efforts.\n  The bill also provides a very robust missile defense, including not \nonly protecting the homeland, but also our allies and partners, such as \nthe $600 million for Israeli missile defense.\n  The mark fully funds national security space programs and makes some \nvery important adjustments, including ensuring that we adequately \nsupport acquisition of satellite communication services.\n  There are a few provisions in the bill that I strongly oppose, such \nas restricting dismantlement of obsolete and unneeded nuclear weapons.\n  Also, I think it was a mistake to mandate a poorly-thought-out, \nunaffordable, and unrealistic missile defense policy, including plans \nfor a space-based missile deterrent. I also plan to continue to oppose \nthese provisions in conference.\n  I would like to reiterate my thanks to Chairman Rogers, my friend \nfrom Alabama. It is a pleasure to work with him and our other \nsubcommittee members.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Wittman), the distinguished chairman of the Subcommittee \non Readiness.\n  Mr. WITTMAN. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank Chairman Thornberry, \nRanking Member Smith, and the ranking member on the Readiness \nSubcommittee, Madeleine Bordallo, for all of their efforts.\n  Chairman Thornberry over the last few months has highlighted the \nsignificant readiness challenges and budget choices we are facing. The \nreality is that these decisions we make here will affect the strength \nof our national security for years to come.\n  The American people are concerned. And why shouldn't they be? The \nreadiness obstacles that we face force our military leaders to choose \nbetween providing adequate training and equipment for troops at home \nand supporting our men and women who are already fighting on the front \nlines.\n  We have heard verified media reports, for instance, that aircraft \nmechanics have taken drastic measures, even attempting to strip parts \nfrom museum pieces, to keep our fighters and bombers flying.\n  We have heard testimony from each of our service branches about how \ncritical it is for us to address our military readiness shortfalls. \nWhat we have heard has been sobering, to say the least.\n  Today we are called to address these maintenance, sustainment, and \nreadiness issues. That is our constitutional duty. I believe that this \nbill will move us toward that end goal of restoring full-spectrum \nreadiness.\n  This bill, for example, prohibits the Department from implementing \nanother round of base realignment and closure in the absence of an \naccurate end strength assessment and it streamlines the Department of \nDefense's civilian hiring practices so that critical manpower \ncapability gaps can be filled.\n  Most importantly, this bill also includes more than $5 billion in \nadditional funds for, among other things, ship and aircraft depot \nmaintenance, aviation training and readiness, and long-neglected \nfacility sustainment, restoration, and modernization accounts.\n  Our military, an overruling force for good, is supported by the \nfinest men and women in the world. They deserve our support in return.\n  At the same time, I would like to note that these recommendations \ndon't fully alleviate my concerns about our readiness shortfalls. Here \nin Washington we need to make sure that we fully understand what is at \nstake and how the choices we make affect those who serve and sacrifice \non our behalf.\n  We have to continue to focus on restoring readiness in the years to \ncome and make sure that we properly man, train, and equip our forces so \nthat they can meet the challenges on the horizon with the confidence \nand superiority we have come to expect.\n  I ask the Members of the House to support this National Defense \nAuthorization Act and vote ``yes'' on H.R. 4909.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, may I inquire as to how much \ntime each side has remaining?\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 13\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Texas has 11 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 4 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from California (Mrs. Davis), ranking member of the \nMilitary Personnel Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. DAVIS of California. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Dr. Heck and \nthe committee staff for working in a bipartisan manner to develop this \nbill and particularly recognize Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member \nSmith for their leadership during this process.\n  The bill includes many provisions that will provide the military \nservices flexibility to recruit and retain members of our Armed Forces \nand to continue our commitment to taking care of military families.\n  One provision that we have expands parental leave for military \nmembers to 14 days as well as expanding adoption leave for dual \nmilitary couples to 36 days to be split between them.\n  It also requires DOD to study flexible maternity and paternity leave \nsharing for all of our dual military couples.\n  This bill includes reforms that will put the commissary on a \nsustainable path while protecting the benefit for our servicemembers, \nretirees, and their families. It also begins to reform and modernize \nthe military healthcare system.\n\n  Although we would all agree it is not perfect, this bill is long \nneeded to start ensuring that our servicemembers, retirees, and their \nfamilies continue to receive the best health care in the world through \nefficient and economical means.\n  Important issues were addressed in this bill. I support many of the \nreforms\n\n[[Page H2464]]\n\nand all of the hard work that went into them. However, I am extremely \nconcerned with how this bill is funded.\n  I applaud Chairman Thornberry's desire to increase funds for end \nstrength, modernization, and the operations and maintenance accounts. \nBut the $18 billion required comes from the Overseas Contingency Fund \nand cuts short resources required for our troops in harm's way.\n  This will require the next Congress to pass a supplemental before \nMay, and that assumes current operations don't increase over the next \nyear. What programs do we cut midyear to find that level of funding?\n  This gimmick creates a hollow force. It will require the military \nservices to hedge their bets that the funding to maintain the increased \nend strength authorized will be available in fiscal year 2018 when \nsequestration hits.\n  The world we know is very dangerous in many places, and the pace of \ncombat operations will most likely not diminish in the near future.\n  In light of these dangers, I do not disagree that the Army may need \nmore soldiers. But the Army has not provided us with the requested \nnumber, nor have they told Congress how they would create the \nappropriate force structure to use these additional soldiers.\n  Lastly, this NDAA passed out of committee continued to expand on \nCongress' efforts to increase opportunities for women to serve our \nNation by requiring women to register for the Selective Service. This \nwas only possible because the Department of Defense, after several \nyears of intense review, opened the last remaining combat arms \npositions to women earlier this year.\n  Unfortunately, the rule for the NDAA strikes the provision without \ndebate. I understand that we are not always going to be in agreement, \nand that is why we debate and vote issues on the House floor. But to \nresort to gimmicks to hide debate is unconscionable. This is a national \nissue that Congress must debate and vote on.\n  I certainly look forward, Mr. Chair, to continuing to work with the \nchairman and the rest of the committee to ensure we resource our \nmilitary services in a responsible manner so that we can face the \nchallenges of today and tomorrow.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the chair of the Subcommittee on \nOversight and Investigations.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of our national \ndefense. There are some stark realities we must face in today's world \nof increased and emerging threats from around the globe combined with \ndecreased military readiness from arbitrary and reckless cuts to our \nnational defense.\n  In the face of these challenges, we have a choice: either continue to \nlet our military capabilities wither as our adversaries grow stronger \nor we can recognize that ever-changing global landscape and make sure \nour troops are prepared with the resources and training they need to \nkeep Americans safe against today's threats and tomorrow's.\n  The latter, Mr. Chair, is what this defense authorization does. From \naddressing the strike fighter shortfall with 14 additional F-18s that \nthe Navy needs, to providing for maintenance of equipment and \nfacilities so that museum aircraft do not have to be cannibalized for \nspare parts, to fully funding our troops' pay raise, which they have \nrightly earned, we have listened to the services and our commanders.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  They know what they need to do their jobs, to keep us safe, and to \nretain their people, and we have acted on their priorities.\n  This bill also addresses shortfalls in training and provides for the \nmodernization of critical national security programs. It makes sure \nsoldiers are prepared at all of our bases, including at the Army's \nManeuver Support Center of Excellence at Fort Leonard Wood, in my \ndistrict. It ensures aircraft like the B-2 at Whiteman Air Force Base \ncan continue to project power and the spirit of America around the \nglobe.\n  Mr. Chair, this authorization takes care of our troops, ensures the \nsafety of the American people, and fulfills our constitutional \nobligation to provide for the common defense.\n  I commend Chairman Thornberry, my House Armed Services colleagues, \nand the HASC staff for all of their hard work and leadership.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this responsible \nauthorization.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from Nevada (Mr. Heck), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nMilitary Personnel, who is both a doctor and a general in the Reserves.\n  Mr. HECK of Nevada. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4909, \nthe National Defense Authorization Act of 2017.\n  This bill contains significant policy and funding initiatives that \ncontinue our commitment to maintain military personnel and family \nreadiness and address important issues for our troops.\n  To that end, this bill:\n  Establishes a fully funded pay raise for all of our servicemembers. \nAfter 3 years of executive action that has provided lower-than-by-law \ncalculated pay raises, it is time we give our troops and their families \nthe pay increase they deserve;\n  Stops the reductions in the active end-strengths of the Armed Forces, \nthereby increasing readiness while reducing the stress and strain on \nthe force and their families;\n  Reforms the Military Health System to ensure the system can sustain \ntrained and ready healthcare providers to support the readiness of the \nforce and provide a quality healthcare benefit valued by its \nbeneficiaries;\n  It also modernizes the Uniform Code of Military Justice to improve \nthe system's efficiency and transparency while also enhancing victims' \nrights. This includes establishing several new offenses, including an \noffense prohibiting retaliation and prohibiting inappropriate \nrelationships between military recruits or trainees and a person in a \nposition of special trust;\n  Reforms the commissary system in a way that preserves this important \nbenefit while also improving the system so it remains an excellent \nvalue for the shoppers and a good value for the taxpayer;\n  Includes an increase in parental adoptive leave for dual military \ncouples in recognition of the importance of bonding time between \nparents and their newly adopted children.\n  In conclusion, I thank the ranking member, Mrs. Davis of California, \nand her staff for their contributions to the mark and support in this \nvery bipartisan process. We were joined by an active and informed and \ndedicated group of subcommittee members, and their recommendations and \npriorities are clearly reflected in this bill. Additionally, I \nappreciate the dedication and hard work of the subcommittee staff.\n  I urge my colleagues to support our military men and women and their \nfamilies and to support this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine), who is a member of the committee and who \nalso continues to be active in the Air National Guard.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. I thank the chairman.\n  Mr. Chair, this defense authorization makes a huge down payment on \nthe readiness of our forces.\n  As a combat veteran, I have participated in the inter-deployment \ntraining cycles that are getting ready to deploy. I have seen the force \nregeneration process. I have seen it during good times, and I have seen \nit during bad times.\n  Personally, as a Navy reservist, most recently, I saw a very steep \ndecline in readiness when my squadron got eliminated. The VAW-77, the \nNightwolves, got completely eliminated when I was a Navy reservist. We \nbusted about $2 billion worth of cocaine every year on the high seas. \nNow that cocaine comes into the country, and $2 billion worth of cash \nfunds transnational criminal organizations in northern Mexico and in \nCentral and South America. That is what happens when we have defense \ncuts the way we have had recently.\n  In fact, I will tell you that our remaining forces still face \nsignificant shortfalls and disruptions to time-tested training and \ndeployment cycles. The OPTEMPO back home is almost more intense than an \noverseas deployment,\n\n[[Page H2465]]\n\nbut the resources are simply not available. Pilots are flying the bare \nminimum flight hours to stay qualified, and our maintainers and our \ndepots can't keep up. As a warfighter, I can attest that this will \nbreak our force.\n  The important thing about this bill, this defense authorization--and, \nMr. Chairman, it is why I am so grateful for your leadership and the \nbipartisan support that we had from the ranking member, Mr. Smith--is \nit makes a huge down payment on the readiness that is required to make \nsure that the force we have remaining is not hollow, which is \ncritically important to the national security of this country.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik), the vice chairman of the \nSubcommittee on Readiness.\n  Ms. STEFANIK. Mr. Chair, I am proud of the bipartisan work of the \nHouse Committee on Armed Services on the FY17 National Defense \nAuthorization Act.\n  This legislation takes important steps to strengthen our defense \ncapabilities, and it gives our Armed Forces the resources they need to \nkeep us safe. Importantly, this bill works to stop the funding gaps \nthat are harming our military's readiness, and it includes a much-\ndeserved pay raise for our troops.\n  This bill contains an important initiative to ensure our land forces \nwill not be depleted as well as including some of my own initiatives--\nthe creation of a DOD social media cell to counter radical online \nrecruitment and maintain the edge in a 21st century battlefield. It \nalso includes the development of joint directed energy capabilities \nbetween the United States and Israel.\n  I am proud to support this legislation, which passed in committee by \na bipartisan vote of 60-2, and I urge my colleagues to vote in favor of \nthis vital bill on the floor.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from Washington has 10 minutes remaining, \nand the gentleman from Texas has 4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n\n  I want to reiterate some of the points that were made during the \ndebate in the beginning of how important this bill is.\n  We do have many national security needs. I know you see the size of \nthe Department of Defense's budget, and there are certainly ways we can \nsave money. I think we have done that with acquisition reform and with \nsome of the other reforms that are contained in this bill.\n  It is also important to understand the threats that we face in the \nworld--the continuing threat of terrorism and the continuing threats \nfrom nations like Russia, Iran, North Korea, and China. We need to be \nprepared to counter those threats if we are going to have a peaceful \nand stable world.\n  Nonetheless, I think we still have the budget problem that I alluded \nto earlier, and that is that we do not have the money that we would \nlike to have. It is not just for defense; it is for a lot of domestic \npriorities as well. In the way this bill is set up, it creates the \npossibility that we will take an additional $18 billion for defense.\n  How does that balance against our other priorities?\n  We have to figure out how to make our budget balance and meet the \npriorities domestically while also meeting the national security \npriorities because our infrastructure is critical to our national \nsecurity as well. We have to remain strong economically as a country.\n  In addition to that, it is not just the Department of Defense that \nprovides for our security. There is the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, certainly, in the intelligence budget; the Department of \nTreasury; the Department of Justice. A lot of pieces to that puzzle are \nnecessary, and they all get shortchanged if we don't take into account \ntheir needs as well.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  As usual, I largely agree with many of the comments made by Mr. \nSmith. I think he is exactly right when he discusses the many complex, \ndangerous threats that face the United States at this point. I think he \nis also right that we all have to put the Federal budget--but \nespecially the military budget--on a more stable, predictable footing. \nI absolutely agree with him on those points.\n  At the same time, we have an immediate need, one in which lives are \nat stake. Mr. Chair, let me just offer the fact that the Air Force is \ncurrently short 4,000 maintainers and more than 700 pilots.\n  Another fact: in fiscal year 2015, the Navy had a backlog of 11 \nplanes in depot. In fiscal year 2017, they are going to have 278 planes \nbacklogged in the Navy depots. Less than one-third of the Army is now \nready to meet the requirements of the defense strategic guidance.\n  We can't just turn away and say: Oh, we don't like this budget \napproach, so we are willing to live with all of those problems.\n  We have to deal with them. That is what this bill tries to do.\n  Mr. Chair, by the way, if we take away the $18 billion that we try to \nput to readiness issues, then a lot of the things that the Members have \nasked for go away.\n  I have before me, for example, a letter that has been signed by a \nnumber of House and Senate Members who ask for new Black Hawks this \nyear. The fact is the President did not request any Black Hawks in his \nbudget request. Currently, too many of our military folks are flying \nBlack Hawks that were made in 1979. They can't get the parts for them. \nThey can't even fly them in a lot of the circumstances because of the \nrestrictions on these helicopters. So we look to the Army's unfunded \nrequirements' list of the things they would like to have had that were \nstripped out by the administration, and we put into this bill 36 new \nBlack Hawks. That is the way you deal with a lot of these readiness \nproblems, is you replace the 1979 helicopter with a 2016 helicopter. We \ndo that in this bill, but if we take away the approach that we have \nhere to meet the readiness requirements, all of those Black Hawks go \naway.\n  I also have letters from Members who ask for the third littoral \ncombat ship. We were only able to do that because of the $18 billion. I \nhave a letter signed by a number of Members to increase the U.S.-\nIsraeli cooperative missile defense. Again, if our approach is not \nused, which some people on the other side are critical of, that funding \ngoes away. It doesn't just come out of the air.\n  Mr. Chair, my point is we have an immediate problem. This bill tries \nto deal with the immediate problem that is affecting the men and women \nwho serve our country today. Is it perfect? Of course not, but I have \nyet to hear of a better alternative that meets these needs and can pass \nthe House.\n  Mr. Chair, just to reiterate, the other point is this is exactly the \nsame approach that was used in the last administration. It is curious \nto me that some people who wanted to give President Obama a chance of a \nfresh look of the deployments which he found when he came into office \nnow want to deny the same possibility for the next President, whoever \nhe or she may be. We take exactly the approach that was used under \nSpeaker Pelosi and Majority Leader Harry Reid in 2008, and we apply it \nto the next transition. I think that is what makes sense because that \nis what enables us to deal today with the readiness problems that \nthreaten our military. I hope all Members will support this bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I ask that the following exchange of \nletters be submitted on H.R. 4909:\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                   Washington, DC, April 28, 2016.\n     Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services, House of \n         Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Thornberry: I write concerning H.R. 4909, the \n     National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017, as \n     amended. There are certain provisions in the legislation that \n     fall within the Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure.\n       However, in order to expedite this legislation for Floor \n     consideration, the Committee will forgo action on this bill. \n     This, of course, is conditional on our mutual understanding \n     that forgoing consideration of the bill does\n\n[[Page H2466]]\n\n     not prejudice the Committee with respect to the appointment \n     of conferees or to any future jurisdictional claim over the \n     subject matters contained in the bill or similar legislation \n     that fall within the Committee's Rule X jurisdiction. I \n     request you urge the Speaker to name members of the Committee \n     to any conference committee named to consider such \n     provisions.\n       Please place a copy of this letter and your response \n     acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the committee \n     report on H.R. 4909 and into the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of the measure on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      Committee on Armed Services,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2016.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. \n     4909, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year \n     2017.

Mr. Chair, I rise to speak on House consideration of \nthe National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2017.\n  I thank Chairman Thornberry and Ranking Member Smith and the Armed \nServices Committee for their work on the National Defense Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2015.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I \ntake our role in Congress as stewards of our nation's security \nseriously.\n  I offer my thanks and appreciation to the men and women of the armed \nservices who place themselves in harm's way each day for the safety and \nsecurity of our nation's people.\n  The National Defense Authorization Act's purpose is to address the \nthreats our nation\n\n[[Page H2467]]\n\nmust deal with not just today, but into the future. This makes our work \nvital to our national interest and it should reflect our strong \ncommitment to ensure that the men and women of our Armed Services \nreceive the benefits and support that they deserve for their faithful \nservice.\n  This is the 54th consecutive National Defense Authorization Act, \nwhich speaks to the long term commitment of the Congress and successive \nAdministrations to provide for National Defense.\n  This bill encompasses a number of initiatives designed to confront \nthe military challenges posed by violent extremism, terrorists engaging \nin ground wars, making more efficient the work of protecting America, \naddresses the medical health needs of men and women in the armed \nservices, and extends economic and education opportunity to small \nminority and women owned businesses.\n  We do live in a dangerous world, where threats are not always easily \nidentifiable, and our enemies are not bound by borders.\n  Boko Haram, ISIL, and Al Shabaab remind us of how fragile our \nnation's security could be without a well trained and equipped \nmilitary.\n  I appreciate the House Armed Services Committee's continued support \nof our national defense and support a number of provisions in H.R. \n1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year (FY) 2016, \nsuch as authorities that support ongoing operations.\n  The Administration also appreciates much of the work of the \ncommittee, but is expressing strong objections because the bill: \nRedirects $18 billion in funding intended for use in defeating ISIL to \nbase budget programs; Extends operations at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba; \nIncreases costs of the TRICARE administration; Prohibits the retiring \nor inactivation of Ticonderoga-Class cruisers or dock landing ships; \nReduces by $250 million the Counterterrorism Partnership Fund; Bars the \nadministration from making sure that companies that break United States \nlabor laws are not rewarded; Prohibition on the use of funds for \nCountering Weapons of Mass Production; and Eliminates for the \nDepartment of Defense's Joint Urgent Operational Needs Fund.\n  Although the Administration points out areas of agreement with the \nCommittee, the Administration strongly objects to several provisions in \nthe bill.\n  The opportunity to amend the bill will offer an opportunity to \naddress these and other Administration concerns that will improve the \nbill.\n  Congress should authorize sufficient funding for our military's \npriorities, and avoid using the Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) \nfunding in ways that leaders of both parties over the years have made \nclear is inappropriate.\n  The final bill considered by the Congress should adopt many of the \nneeded force structure and weapons system reforms that have been \nidentified by military leaders and experts.\n  As written the President's senior advisors would recommend that he \nveto this bill.\n  It is my hope that the Rules Committee will make in order a number of \nperfecting amendments for consideration under the Rule for H.R. 4909.\n  I have amendments that have been offered for consideration of H.R. \n4909.\n  Let me discuss briefly the amendments I offered that were adopted by \nthe House and included in the final version of the bill.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 1 calls for increased collaboration with \nNIH to combat Triple Negative Breast Cancer.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 2 provides authorization for $2.5 \nmillion increase in funding to combat post-traumatic stress disorder \n(PTSD).\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 3 condemns the actions of Boko Haram and \nurges the Commander-in-Chief to ensure accountability for crimes \nagainst humanity committed by Boko Haram against the Nigerian people.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 4 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \nwork with local security partners in facilitating the provision of \nsecurity at civilian nuclear research centers in educational \ninstitutions to ascertain that nuclear weapons do not end up in the \nhands of terrorists, in promotion of the United States' and its allies' \nsecurity interests.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 5 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \nwork with local and international security partners, innovators, law \nenforcement, and other civil society organizations in the provision of \ntechnical assistance for the creation, facilitation and implementation \nof a technological app designed to enable the location, protection and \ntracking of missing persons, refugees, returnees and internally \ndisplaced persons.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 6 directs Secretary of the Navy to \nsubmit report to Congress on the feasibility of applying desalinization \ntechnologies to provide drought relief in areas impacted by sharp \ndeclines in water availability for both military as well as civilian \npurposes.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 7 authorizes the Secretary of Defense to \nprovide technical assistance to local and international security \npartners in the provision of security and protection for activists and \ncivil society organizations advocating for and promoting freedom of \nreligion, education, press expression and personal expression.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 8 directs Secretary of Defense to \nconduct study and submit to Congress report regarding the awarding of \nsecret and top secret security clearances to better understand the \nprocess for awarding clearances in effective and fair.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 9 requires outreach for small business \nconcerns owned and controlled by women and minorities required before \nconversation of certain functions to contractor performance.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 10 expresses the sense of Congress \nregarding the importance of increasing the effectiveness of the \nNorthern Command (``NORTHCOM'') in fulfilling its critical mission of \nprotecting the U.S. homeland in event of war and to provide support to \nlocal, state, and federal authorities in times of national emergency.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 11 requires the Government \nAccountability Office to include in its annual report to Congress a \nlist of the most common grounds for sustaining protests related to bids \nfor contracts.\n  Jackson Lee Amendment Number 12 directs the Secretary of Defense to \nreport to Congress on the Department's ability to support the rapid \ndevelopment, production and deployment of vaccines or treatments of \nemerging tropical diseases, like the Zika and Ebola viruses, to protect \nthe men and women of the armed forces and their families.\n  We must continue to direct our efforts as a body to ensure that our \ntroops remain the best equipped and prepared military force in the \nworld. They are not just soldiers they are sons and daughters, husbands \nand wives, brothers and sisters--they are some of the people we \nrepresent as members of Congress.\n  Support of our men and women in uniform is a sacred obligation of \nCongress both to those who are at risk on battle fields and serving as \nthe guard against threats around the world, but they are also those who \nhave returned home from war.\n  I look forward to the inclusion of the Jackson Lee Amendments and \nothers that will improve the underlying bill.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Committee on Armed Services, printed in the bill, an amendment in \nthe nature of a substitute, consisting of the text of Rules Committee \nprint 114-51, modified by the amendment printed in part A of House \nReport 114-569, shall be considered as adopted.\n  The bill, as amended, shall be considered as the original bill for \nthe purpose of further amendment under the 5-minute rule and shall be \nconsidered as read.\n  The text of the bill, as amended, is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4909\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON GOLDWATER-NICHOLS REFORM.\n\n       It is the sense of Congress that the following principles \n     should be adhered to in any reform of the Goldwater-Nichols \n     Department of Defense Reorganization Act of 1986:\n       (1) Civilian control of the military and the civilian chain \n     of command must be preserved.\n       (2) The role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff \n     in providing independent military advice, as the principal \n     military advisor to the President and the Secretary of \n     Defense, must be preserved.\n       (3) Any changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 should \n     be rooted in a clear identification and understanding of the \n     issues and the objectives and ramifications of any changes.\n\n[[Page H2507]]\n\n       (4) Any changes to the Goldwater-Nichols Act of 1986 should \n     enhance the capabilities of the United States Armed Forces.\n       (5) Each Geographical Unified Command has its own distinct \n     area of emphasis and expertise, as well as requirements and \n     responsibilities. Combining Northern Command and Southern \n     Command, or combining European Command and Africa Command, \n     would severely degrade mission effectiveness, but would \n     provide only marginal increased efficiency. Additionally, \n     consolidating Geographic Unified Commands would cause \n     unacceptable risk to both global strategic influence as well \n     as regional capability, and would exacerbate already \n     significant capacity challenges.\n       (6) The emphasis on strategy and planning in the Goldwater-\n     Nichols Act must be sustained.\n       (7) Complex security challenges will become increasingly \n     transregional, multi-domain, and multi-functional.\n       (8) Therefore, the Department of Defense, including \n     streamlined headquarters staffs, must be more agile and \n     adaptive.\n\n     SEC. 902.

SENSE OF CONGRESS REGARDING CONNECTICUT'S \n                   SUBMARINE CENTURY.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress makes the following findings:\n       (1) On March 2, 1867, Congress enacted a naval \n     appropriations Act that authorized the Secretary of the Navy \n     to ``receive and accept a deed of gift, when offered by the \n     State of Connecticut, of a tract of land with not less than \n     one mile of shore front on the Thames River near New London, \n     Connecticut, to be held by the United States for naval \n     purposes''.\n       (2) The people of Connecticut and the towns and cities in \n     the southeastern region of Connecticut subsequently gifted \n     land to establish a military installation to fulfil the \n     Nation's need for a naval facility on the Atlantic coast.\n       (3) On April 11, 1868, the Navy accepted the deed of gift \n     of land from Connecticut to establish a naval yard and \n     storage depot along the eastern shore of the Thames River in \n     Groton, Connecticut;\n       (4) Between 1868 and 1912, the New London Navy Yard \n     supported a diverse range of missions, including berthing \n     inactive Civil War era ironclad warships and serving as a \n     coaling station for refueling naval ships traveling in New \n     England waters.\n       (5) Congress rejected the Navy's proposal to close New \n     London Navy Yard in 1912, following an impassioned effort by \n     Congressman Edwin W. Higgins, who stated that ``this action \n     proposed is not only unjust but unreasonable and unsound as a \n     military proposition''.\n       (6) The outbreak of World War I and the enemy use of \n     submarines to sink allied military and civilian ships in the \n     Atlantic sparked a new focus on developing submarine \n     capabilities in the United States.\n       (7) October 18, 1915, marked the arrival at the New London \n     Navy Yard of the submarines G-1, G-2, and G-4 under the care \n     of the tender U.S.S. OZARK, soon followed by the arrival of \n     submarines E-1, D-1, and D-3 under the care of the tender \n     U.S.S. TONOPAH, and on November 1, 1915, the arrival of the \n     first ship built as a submarine tender, the U.S.S. FULTON \n     (AS-1).\n       (8) On June 21, 1916, Commander Yeates Stirling assumed the \n     command of the newly designated Naval Submarine Base New \n     London, the New London Submarine Flotilla, and the Submarine \n     School;\n       (9) In the 100 years since the arrival of the first \n     submarines to the base, Naval Submarine Base New London has \n     grown to occupy more than 680 acres along the east side of \n     the Thames River, with more than 160 major facilities, 15 \n     nuclear submarines, and more than 70 tenant commands and \n     activities, including the Submarine Learning Center, Naval \n     Submarine School, the Naval Submarine Medical Research \n     Laboratory, the Naval Undersea Medical Institute, and the \n     newly established Undersea Warfighting Development Center.\n       (10) In addition to being the site of the first submarine \n     base in the United States, Connecticut was home to the \n     foremost submarine manufacturers of the time, the Lake \n     Torpedo\n\n[[Page H2519]]\n\n     Boat Company in Bridgeport and the Electric Boat Company in \n     Groton, which later became General Dynamics Electric Boat.\n       (11) General Dynamics Electric Boat, its talented \n     workforce, and its Connecticut-based and nationwide network \n     of suppliers have delivered more than 200 submarines from its \n     current location in Groton, Connecticut, including the first \n     nuclear-powered submarine, the U.S.S. NAUTILUS (SSN 571), and \n     nearly half of the nuclear submarines ever built by the \n     United States.\n       (12) The Submarine Force Library and Museum, located \n     adjacent to Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton, \n     Connecticut, is the only submarine museum operated by the \n     United States Navy and today serves as the primary repository \n     for artifacts, documents, and photographs relating to the \n     bold and courageous history of the Submarine Force and \n     highlights as its core exhibit the Historic Ship NAUTILUS \n     (SSN 571) following her retirement from service.\n       (13) Reflecting the close ties between Connecticut and the \n     Navy that began with the gift of land that established the \n     base, the State of Connecticut has set aside $40,000,000 in \n     funding for critical infrastructure investments to support \n     the mission of the base, including construction of a new dive \n     locker building, expansion of the Submarine Learning Center, \n     and modernization of energy infrastructure.\n       (14) On September 29, 2015, Connecticut Governor Dannel \n     Malloy designated October 2015 through October 2016 as \n     Connecticut's Submarine Century, a year-long observance that \n     celebrates 100 years of submarine activity in Connecticut, \n     including the Town of Groton's distinction as the Submarine \n     Capital of the World, to coincide with the centennial \n     anniversary of the establishment of Naval Submarine Base New \n     London and the Naval Submarine School.\n       (15) Whereas Naval Submarine Base New London still proudly \n     proclaims its motto of ``The First and Finest''.\n       (16) Congressman Higgins' statement before Congress in 1912 \n     that ``Connecticut stands ready, as she always has, to bear \n     her part of the burdens of the national defense'' remains \n     true today.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution \n     to the Navy and submarine force by the people of Connecticut, \n     both through the initial deed of gift that established what \n     would become Naval Submarine Base New London and through \n     their ongoing commitment to support the mission of the base \n     and the Navy personnel assigned to it;\n       (2) honors the submariners who have trained and served at \n     Naval Submarine Base New London throughout its history in \n     support of the Nation's security and undersea superiority;\n       (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and \n     workforce of Connecticut in designing, building, and \n     sustaining the Navy's submarine fleet; and\n       (4) encourages the recognition of Connecticut's Submarine \n     Century by Congress, the Navy, and the American people by \n     honoring the contribution of the people of Connecticut to the \n     defense of the United States and the important role of the \n     submarine force in safeguarding the security of the United \n     States for more than a century.\n\n     SEC. 1090.

Tyndall, who received the U.S. Air \n     Force flying ace designation for his service in the First \n     World War.\n       (3) Tyndall Field became an important center for aerial \n     gunnery training during the Second World War, hosting \n     training missions using aircraft including A-33, 0-47, AT-6, \n     Martin B-26 Marauders, and B-17 bombers.\n       (4) On January 13, 1948, Tyndall Field became Tyndall Air \n     Force Base and was an active site for air training and \n     defense throughout the Cold War.\n       (5) Tyndall AFB is now home to the First Air Force as well \n     as the 325th Fighter Wing Headquarters and their F-22 \n     Raptors.\n       (6) The 325th Fighter Wing has been instrumental to \n     national security at such crucial junctures as the Cuban \n     Missile Crisis, throughout the Cold War, and more recently in \n     intercepting unidentified aircraft and supporting anti-\n     smuggling efforts.\n       (7) On July 20, 1945, the Navy Mine Countermeasure Station \n     was established in Panama City.\n       (8) The Navy Mine Countermeasure Station developed into the \n     Naval Support Activity Panama City (NSAPC), which has \n     faithfully carried out its mission since its inception and \n     continues to support the crucial efforts and important \n     research of tenant command organizations such as the Naval \n     Surface Warfare Center: Panama City Division (NSWC PCD) and \n     the Navy Experimental Diving Unit (NEDU).\n       (9) Research performed at NSWC PCD has been integral to \n     equipping the Navy with the personnel and technology \n     necessary to maintaining its status as the world's greatest \n     and most technologically advanced.\n       (10) NSWC PCD's newest facility, the Littoral Warfare \n     Research Facility, is one of the Navy's major research, \n     development, test, and evaluation laboratories and where \n     standards for weapons integration on Littoral Combat Ships \n     are often developed.\n       (11) NEDU is a global hub of research, development, and \n     testing for undersea operations.\n       (12) During the Second World War, the Wainwright Shipyard \n     in Panama City built over 100 vessels for the war effort and \n     employed over 15,000 people.\n       (13) Panama City's shipbuilding legacy continues as home to \n     one of today's most prolific domestic shipbuilders, Eastern \n     Shipbuilding.\n       (14) The Department of Defense is the largest employer in \n     Panama City, where many of the residents and their relatives \n     have proudly served in the Armed Forces for generations.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--Congress--\n       (1) commends the longstanding dedication and contribution \n     to the Armed Forces by the people of Panama City, both \n     through the legacy of naval shipbuilding and through their \n     ongoing commitment to support the mission of Panama City's \n     military installations and the personnel assigned to them;\n       (2) honors the members of the Armed Forces who have trained \n     and served at the several military installations in and \n     around Panama City;\n       (3) recognizes the contribution of the industry and \n     workforce of Panama City to naval shipbuilding; and\n       (4) encourages the recognition of the importance of Panama \n     City to the history of the\n\n[[Page H2520]]\n\n     Armed Forces by Congress, the Air Force, the Navy, and the \n     American people by honoring the contribution of the people of \n     Panama City to the defense of the United States.\n\n     SEC. 1094.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON UNITED STATES POLICY AND \n                   STRATEGY IN AFGHANISTAN.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The United States continues to have vital national \n     security interests in ensuring that Afghanistan is a stable, \n     sovereign country.\n       (2) President Obama signed a Strategic Partnership \n     Agreement and a Bilateral Security Agreement with the \n     President of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan, which \n     commits the United States to the long-term security of, and \n     defense cooperation with, the Government of Afghanistan and \n     designates Afghanistan as a ``major non-NATO ally''.\n       (3) The unity government in Afghanistan, led by President \n     Ghani and Chief Executive Abdullah, should be applauded for \n     their continued leadership and commitment to Afghanistan's \n     stability and security.\n       (4) Stability and security in Afghanistan reinforces \n     stability and security in the region.\n       (5) The best long-term guarantor of stability and security \n     in Afghanistan is a stable unity government and a capable \n     Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF).\n       (6) The President's current policy is to draw down from \n     9,800 to 5,500 United States troops by January 1, 2017. As \n     the recent commander in Afghanistan, General John Campbell, \n     testified to the Senate Armed Services Committee, ``the 5,500 \n     [U.S. troops] plan was developed primarily around \n     counterterrorism. There's very limited train-advise-and-\n     assist...in those numbers.

It is now in order to consider \namendment No. 11 printed in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle B of title IX, add the following new \n     section:\n\n     SEC. 9__. REFORM OF NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The National Security Council has increasingly \n     micromanaged military operations and centralized \n     decisionmaking within the staff of the National Security \n     Council. The size of the staff has contributed this problem.\n       (2) As stated by former Secretary of Defense Robert M. \n     Gates, ``It was the operational micromanagement that drove me \n     nuts of White House and [National Security Council] staffers \n     calling senior commanders out in the field and asking them \n     questions, second guessing commanders'', and by another \n     former Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta, ``[B]ecause of that \n     centralization of that authority at the White House, there \n     are too few voices being heard in terms of the ability to \n     make decisions and that includes members of the cabinet.''.\n       (3) Gates stated, ``You have 25 people working on a single \n     military problem... They are going to be doing things they \n     shouldn't be doing,'' and Panetta noted, ``The National \n     Security Council has grown enormously, which means you have a \n     lot more staff people running around at the White House on \n     these foreign policy issues.''.\n       (4) Press reports indicate that National Security Council \n     micromanagement has included selecting targets in ongoing \n     military operations, specifying detailed parameters and \n     limitations on military operations, and managing military \n     planning and the execution of plans.\n       (5) As stated in section 101(a) of the National Security \n     Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021(a)), the ``function of the \n     Council shall be to advise the President with respect to the \n     integration of domestic, foreign, and military policies \n     relating to the national security so as to enable the \n     military services and the other departments and agencies of \n     the Government to cooperate more effectively in matters \n     involving the national security''.\n       (6) As stated in the November 1961 staff reports and \n     recommendations on ``Organizing for National Security'' \n     submitted to the Committee on Government Operations of the \n     Senate by the Subcommittee on National Policy Machinery, \n     ``The Council is an interagency committee: It can inform, \n     debate, review, adjust, and validate... The Council is not a \n     decisionmaking body; it does not itself make policy. It \n     serves only in an advisory capacity to the President, helping \n     him arrive at decisions which he alone can make.''.\n       (7) As noted in the 1987 Report of the President's Special \n     Review Board (commonly known as the ``Tower Commission \n     Report''), ``As a general matter, the [National Security \n     Council] staff should not engage in the implementation of \n     policy or the conduct of operations. This compromises their \n     oversight role and usurps the responsibilities of the \n     departments and agencies.''.\n       (8) As noted in the ``Addendum on Structure and Process \n     Analyses: Volume II - Executive Office of the President,'' \n     accompanying the February 2001 U.S. Commission on National \n     Security/21st Century (commonly known as the ``Hart-Rudman \n     Commission''), ``[T]he degree to which the [National Security \n     Council] gets involved in operational issues raises a \n     question of congressional oversight. Today there is limited \n     congressional oversight of the [National Security Council]... \n     Assigning the [National Security Council] greater operational \n     responsibility would likely result in calls for more \n     congressional oversight and legislative control...''.\n       (9) According to analysis from the Brookings Institution's \n     National Security Council Project, the size of the National \n     Security Council staff from the early 1960s to the mid-1990s \n     remained consistently under 60 personnel. Since then, it has \n     grown significantly in size.\n       (10) As former National Security Advisor, Zbigniew \n     Brzezinski, wrote in ``The NSC's Midlife Crisis'' in Foreign \n     Policy, Winter 1987-1988, ``There is no magic number, but it \n     would appear that for successful strategic planning and \n     policy coordination 30-40 senior staff members are probably \n     adequate. However, to ensure effective supervision over \n     policy implementation as well, the size of the staff should \n     be somewhat larger. An optimal figure for the senior staff \n     probably would be about 50 senior staff members.''.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) the function of the National Security Council, \n     consistent with the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. \n     3001 et seq.), is to advise the President as an independent \n     honest broker on national security matters, to coordinate \n     national security activities across departments and agencies, \n     and to make recommendations to the President regarding \n     national security objectives and policy, and the size of the \n     staff of the National Security Council should be \n     appropriately aligned to this function;\n       (2) the President is entitled to privacy in the Office of \n     the President and to a confidential relationship with the \n     National Security Advisor and the National Security Council; \n     and\n\n[[Page H2678]]\n\n       (3) however, a National Security Council, enabled by a \n     large staff, that assumes a central policymaking or \n     operational role is no longer advisory and should be publicly \n     accountable to the American people through Senate \n     confirmation of its leadership and the activities of the \n     Council subject to direct oversight by Congress.\n       (c) Amendments to National Security Act of 1947.--Section \n     101 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021), is \n     amended--\n       (1) in subsection (a)--\n       (A) in paragraph (5), by striking ``and'';\n       (B) in paragraph (6), by striking the period at the end and \n     inserting ``; and''; and\n       (C) by adding after paragraph (6) the following new \n     paragraph:\n       ``(7) the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs.'';\n       (2) in subsection (c), by striking ``shall receive \n     compensation at the rate of $10,000 a year.'' and inserting \n     ``shall report to, and be under the general supervision of, \n     the Assistant to the President for National Security \n     Affairs.'';\n       (3) by redesignating subsections (d) through (l) as \n     subsections (e) through (m), respectively; and\n       (4) by inserting after subsection (c) the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(d)(1)(A) Except as provided by subparagraph (B), the \n     Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs \n     shall be appointed by the President.\n       ``(B) If the staff of the Council exceeds 100 covered \n     employees at any point during a term of the President, and \n     for the duration of such term (without regard to any changes \n     to the number of such covered employees), the Assistant to \n     the President for National Security Affairs shall be \n     appointed by the President, by and with the advice and \n     consent of the Senate.\n       ``(2)(A) Beginning on the date on which the staff of the \n     Council exceeds 100 covered employees, the person appointed \n     as the Assistant under paragraph (1)(A), the person nominated \n     by the President to be appointed the Assistant under \n     paragraph (1)(B), or any other person designated by the \n     President to serve as the Assistant in an acting capacity, \n     may serve in an acting capacity for no longer than 210 days.\n       ``(B) If the person nominated by the President to be \n     appointed the Assistant under paragraph (1)(B) is rejected by \n     the Senate, withdrawn, or returned to the President by the \n     Senate, the President shall nominate another person and the \n     person serving as the acting Assistant may continue to \n     serve--\n       ``(i) until the second nomination is confirmed; or\n       ``(ii) for no more than 210 days after the second \n     nomination is rejected, withdrawn, or returned.\n       ``(3) The President shall notify Congress in writing not \n     more than seven days after the date on which the staff of the \n     Council exceeds 100 covered employees.\n       ``(4) In this subsection, the term `covered employees' \n     means each of the following officers and employees (counted \n     without regard to full-time equivalent basis):\n       ``(A) Officers and employees occupying a position funded by \n     the Executive Office of the President performing a function \n     of the Council.\n       ``(B) Officers, employees, and members of the Armed Forces \n     from any department, agency, or independent establishment of \n     the executive branch of the Government that are on detail to \n     the Council performing a function of the Council.''.\n       (d) Conforming Amendment.--Section 3(12) of the \n     International Religious Freedom Act of 1998 (22 U.S.C. \n     6402(12)) is amended by striking ``section 101(i)'' and \n     inserting ``section 101(l)''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Thornberry) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment goes to an issue that relates to the \nability of Congress to do its job under the Constitution and the \nappropriate balance of powers because I think everybody agrees that a \nPresident ought to have advisers, and that there ought to be a zone, a \nprotected zone for those advisers to offer advice to the President.\n  But the problem is when those advisers do more than advise, when they \ndirect, and when they, in fact, get into the operational military chain \nof command, that is a problem.\n  What we have seen in recent years is a tremendous increase in the \nnumber of staff at the National Security Council. And what we have also \nseen is an astonishing increase in micromanagement and direction of \nmilitary forces that come from these NSC staffers.\n  In effect, they insert themselves into the military chain of command \nand, yet, they are not confirmed by the Senate, nor is their \nsupervisor, and they never have to come testify to us about the \ndirection they give the military.\n  That is the reason that there has developed an imbalance in the \nbalance of powers as constructed under the Constitution.\n  Every previous Secretary of Defense in the Obama administration has \ncomplained about this. Typical are the comments of Secretary Gates: It \nwas the operational micromanagement that drove me nuts of the White \nHouse and national security staffers calling senior commanders out in \nthe field second-guessing commanders.\n  Secretary Panetta and Secretary Hagel have said similar things, as \nhas former Under Secretary Michele Flournoy.\n  So my amendment does not tell the President how many people he can \nhave. He can have 10,000 if he wants, but if he goes above a certain \nnumber, they are not just advising, they are directing, and the \nNational Security Adviser must then be confirmed by the Senate.\n  This will not affect President Obama. It is the next President. But \nthe next President will have a choice. Do you have a relatively small \nor the historically average number of advisers? If you do more, you \nhave to get confirmed by the Senate.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition to \nthe amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 2 minutes.\n  The problem is--just two quick points here--first of all, as we have \ndiscussed throughout the conversation about the Department of Defense \nauthorization bill this year, the threat environment has grown much \nmore complex, and the rise in the size of the national security staff \nis a reflection of that, of the various different challenges that are \nthroughout the world.\n  They have tried to find expertise in all of these different areas, \nand limiting them to 100, at this point, given the responsibilities \nthat they have, would basically take it all the way down to the point \nwhere the admin staff would be the most that they could put in place. \nThey have needs for the number of people that they have.\n  Now, the second problem that Mr. Thornberry points out, I think, is a \nvery legitimate problem. The thing is, whether you have 100 or 400, the \nPresident's NSC staff can do the same thing; they can not pay attention \nto the Department of Defense to the degree that they should. That has \nnothing to do with how many people there happen to be at the NSC. I \nagree with Mr. Thornberry that that has been a problem.\n\n  Certainly we would like Commanders in Chief to be more in touch with \nthe Department of Defense and with the commanders in the field, and not \nbe overridden by the NSC, but that is a problem that exists, regardless \nof the numbers or even what you call the President's staff.\n  So I think this amendment would significantly hamper the ability of \nthe National Security Council to do the job that it was appointed or \ncreated to do, which is to keep the President advised of all the \nvarious different threats that are out there. And to give them the \nability to do that, they are going to need more than 100 people.\n  So I will oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nUtah (Mr. Chaffetz), the distinguished chairman of the Committee on \nOversight and Government Reform.\n  Mr. CHAFFETZ. Mr. Chair, I stand in whole support of what Chairman \nThornberry is proposing.\n  Section 101 of the National Security Act of 1947 says: ``The function \nof the Council shall be to advise the President . . . ''\n  Obviously, we want the President to get the best advice possible, \nbut, historically, the National Security Act designated--they had \nbetween 50 and 60 people between the 1960s and the mid 1990s. But now \nit has grown to hundreds of people. We are talking about literally 400 \npeople, by some counts, and we have got an NSC that is now not \nnecessarily accountable. I would like to see the Senate confirmation if \nit moves about 100.\n  What we see is the NSC is not only engaging in direction on the \nfield, but also engaging in public relations battles and doing things \nwell outside, I think, the scope that was originally put forward.\n\n[[Page H2679]]\n\n  Mr. Chairman, today we had a hearing. We had called Ben Rhodes to \ncome testify to this hearing. But then, claiming executive privilege, \nNeil Eggleston, the General Counsel, said this person could not come.\n  Ben Rhodes goes and talks to the media, he talks to his echo chamber. \nBen Rhodes will go out and do public speaking. He will do everything \nexcept come testify in front of Congress, and then hides behind this \nshield that does not allow for openness and transparency.\n  We want an NSC that helps make policy and direct operations and \nshould be publicly accountable, if that is what they are going to be \ndoing.\n  The President has a choice. Keep the NSC small and advisory to \nmaintain the status quo. That is what it was originally intended to do, \nbut it has gone far more than that. It has become a public relations \nmachine. It has become something that is problematic at every level.\n  I think Chairman Thornberry is exactly right. I think all of our \ncolleagues should support this amendment. It is the right thing to do, \nand I stand in whole support of it.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Connolly).\n  Mr. CONNOLLY. Mr. Chair, H.L. Mencken once said that for every human \nproblem there is a solution that is simple, neat, and wrong.\n  I have a lot of sympathy for Mr. Thornberry's amendment and for what \nis behind it.\n  He talks about micromanagement. Micromanagement goes back to the very \nfounding of the National Security Council. You think that Richard \nNixon's Secretary of State and Secretary of Defense didn't think Henry \nKissinger micromanaged when he was the National Security Adviser?\n  He surreptitiously altered the U.S. policy to China, on his own, with \nhis staff at NSC.\n  There is a long tradition of micromanagement and interference, and I \nhave no doubt that Mr. Thornberry is right. Every Secretary of Defense \nand every Secretary of State would have a similar complaint. Of course \nthey would, and they might be right.\n  To elevate this job over 100 people, to Senate confirmation, actually \naggravates the problem. Now you are going to codify the \nmicromanagement. You are actually going to make this a policymaking \napparatus, in direct competition with the very department you are \ntrying to help, the Department of Defense and the Department of State. \nIt is the wrong answer to the growing size of an NSC.\n  I don't remember Republican complaints about the growth of the NSC \nunder the previous administration, and maybe we can work together in \nthe future to try to make sure that we have a more manageable size.\n  I applaud, certainly, the fact that the current NSC administrator has \nreduced the NSC by 12 percent. I know we can do better. But I don't \nthink this amendment is the way to do it, respectfully.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I would inform the gentleman that I \nhave no further speakers and am prepared to close on this side if the \ngentleman is.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of \nmy time just to reiterate the argument.\n  The National Security Council was formed for the very specific \npurpose of allowing the President to have that type of confidential \nadvisement where people could speak frankly and give the President the \nadvice that he needs to make decisions on matters of national security. \nRegrettably, our national security environment has grown more complex.\n  I will point out that the current National Security Adviser has \nactually shrunk the size of the National Security Council since she \ntook over. It was 411, and it is now down to 365. So they are making \nefforts to get that under control. But to shrink this to 100 and, as \nMr. Connolly pointed out, to make it subject to Senate confirmation \nwould simply lock it in as a competing force to the very entities that \nthe sponsor of this amendment would like to see have a greater voice, \nand therefore it would be counterproductive and would not achieve its \ngoal even though, again, I certainly agree that there should be greater \ntransparency.\n  I don't think there is a Member of Congress who has not complained at \nsome point throughout the history about the lack of transparency \nbetween the White House and Congress on matters of national security. \nThat battle will continue whether this amendment passes or not. I don't \nthink this amendment will advance the interests of national security, \nand, therefore, I oppose it.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment does not require any President to do \nanything. There is a choice, and the choice that any President will \nface is, if you go above a certain number, then I think common sense \ntells us that these folks are doing more than advising; they are in \noperations.\n  As a matter of fact, the former Under Secretary of Defense for Policy \nin the Obama administration Pentagon, Ms. Flournoy, has testified that, \nas the staffs grow, they tend to get more into operational details and \ntactical kinds of oversight. Historically, when you have had smaller \nnational security staffs--for example, the Scowcroft era--they had a \nvery clear understanding of what their role was.\n  This is a matter of common sense. Absolutely, there are no \nguarantees. You might have one person who would try to direct; but, \ngenerally, the more people you have got, the more stuff they are going \nto try to micromanage.\n  So I don't prevent a President from doing anything with this \namendment. I simply say that it is a choice. You can have 100 people or \nfewer and not go before the Senate. If you have more than that, you \nhave got to get Senate confirmed like the Director of OMB is now. I \nthink that is what makes sense. I hope Members will support the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Nadler\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 1032 and 1033.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Nadler) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment would strike sections 1032 and 1033 of \nthe bill, which prohibit the use of funds to transfer detainees from \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, to the United States or to construct or expand \nany facility in the U.S. to house any individual currently detained at \nGuantanamo.\n  Simply put, the section is designed to prevent the closure of the \ndetention facility at Guantanamo and to make it as difficult as \npossible to transfer detainees to a different facility. My amendment is \nintended to do the opposite and to finally bring to a close a shameful \nchapter of American history.\n  The President's Statement of Administration Policy says the \nfollowing: ``The administration strongly objects to several provisions \nof the bill that relate to the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, \nCuba. As the administration has said many times before, operating this \nfacility weakens our national security by draining resources, damaging \nour relationships with key allies and partners, and emboldening violent \nextremists. In February, the administration submitted a comprehensive \nplan to safely and responsibly close the detention facility at \nGuantanamo Bay, Cuba, and to bring this chapter of our history to a \nclose. Rather than taking steps to close the facility, this bill aims \nto extend its operation. Sections 1032 and 1033 would continue to \nprohibit the use of funds to transfer Guantanamo detainees to the\n\n[[Page H2680]]\n\nUnited States or even to construct or modify any facility in the United \nStates to house detainees. These restrictions would limit the ability \nof the executive branch to take the steps necessary to develop \nalternative locations for a detention facility, and from fulfilling its \ncommitment to close the facility at Guantanamo.''\n  Mr. Chairman, it is truly astonishing that in 2016 the United States \ncontinues to hold people indefinitely who have not been charged, let \nalone convicted, of any crime and who, in some cases, have been judged \nnot to pose any threat to the United States. By continuing to hold \nprisoners indefinitely without charging them and without trial is \ninconsistent with our professed support of liberty.\n  Now, I know some will say the detainees are dangerous terrorists, and \nsome undoubtedly are. But some of them are not. They are merely people \nwho were captured in some way but who have not been charged or judged \nas terrorists. Some of them are simply victims of the fact that the \nUnited States paid bounties to people in Afghanistan years ago to turn \nin people who they said were terrorists. The Hatfields turned in the \nMcCoys because--why not? We were giving them a bounty of a few thousand \ndollars a head.\n  For the truly dangerous, we ought to prosecute them and, if \nconvicted, punish them appropriately. We have, for those who need it, \nsupermax prisons in the United States from which no one has ever \nescaped. There is no reason to spend so much money in Guantanamo and \nhave this continuing shame on the reputation of the United States.\n  Speaking of money, GTMO is the world's most expensive prison by far. \nWe are spending about $2.9 million annually per prisoner. It costs us \nless than $35,000 per prisoner to hold someone in a supermax facility \nin the United States. Frankly, they don't deserve the spending. We \nshould be spending that money here in the United States, not on \nterrorists, but on teachers or maybe on defense. No one will argue that \nthat money could not be spent better somewhere else.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, I include in the Record a letter signed by \nmore than 30 retired generals urging the Congress to responsibly close \nthe detention facility at Guantanamo. They quote President George Bush \nwhen he said that the facility had become a ``propaganda tool for our \nenemies.''\n\n                                                    March 1, 2016.\n     Senator John McCain,\n     Chairman, Senate Armed Services Committee, Russell Senate \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n     Senator Jack Reed,\n     Ranking Member, Senate Armed Service Committee, Russell \n         Senate Building, Washington, DC.\n     Representative Mac Thornberry,\n     Chairman, House Armed Services Committee, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n     Representative Adam Smith,\n     Ranking Member, House Armed Services Committee, Rayburn House \n         Office Building. Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairmen and Ranking Members: For over seven years we, \n     a group of retired flag and general officers of the United \n     States Armed Forces, have advocated the responsible closure \n     of the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. We have done \n     this because it is what is best for our country. It is in our \n     national security interests, and above all, it is about \n     reestablishing who we are as a country.\n       Last week the administration presented its plan for closing \n     the Guantanamo Bay detention facility. As the chairmen and \n     ranking members of the House and Senate Armed Service \n     Committees, yours is a solemn responsibility. We write to \n     encourage you to use this plan as a foundation to come \n     together and find a path to finally shutter the detention \n     facility. This should not be a political issue. Former \n     President George W. Bush determined that Guantanamo should be \n     closed because, in his words, ``. . . the detention facility \n     had become a propaganda tool for our enemies and a \n     distraction for our allies. I worked to find a way to close \n     the prison without compromising security.'' The current plan \n     similarly seeks to achieve that objective, following the \n     advice of our nation's top military, intelligence, and law \n     enforcement leaders.\n       Closing Guantanamo will not be easy, but it is the right \n     thing to do, and we call on you to work together to \n     accomplish it. We take heart that our nation has elected \n     people who will exercise their conscientious judgment, but \n     who will not allow politics to obscure courage. Compromise \n     for the common good is the true exercise of leadership and \n     courage.\n           Sincerely,\n       General Charles Krulak, USMC (Ret); Vice Admiral Richard H. \n     Carmona, USPHS (Ret.); Lieutenant General Robert G. Gard, \n     Jr., USA (Ret.); Lieutenant General Richard L. Kelly, USMC \n     (Ret.); Lieutenant General Charles Otstott, USA (Ret.); \n     Lieutenant General Keith J. Stalder, USMC (Ret.); Major \n     General Eugene Fox, USA (Ret.); Rear Admiral John D. Hutson, \n     JAGC, USN (Ret.); Major General Michael R. Lehnert, USMC \n     (Ret.); Major General Eric T.

Xenakis, USA (Ret.).\n\n  Mr. NADLER. So, again, for all these reasons--it weakens our \nsecurity, it drains our resources, it emboldens our enemies, and it is \ncontrary to liberty and everything that we stand for--I urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment and to lift these restrictions on \nclosing the detention facility at Guantanamo Bay. If people must be \nkept in prison, then they can be kept here a heck of a lot more cheaply \nand without subjecting us to the continued propaganda against \nGuantanamo.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman \nfrom Indiana (Mrs. Walorski), a distinguished member of the Armed \nServices Committee.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to take particular issue with a point made by \nthe gentleman from New York. He is saying we can't afford to keep \nGuantanamo open. I stand here today and declare to you that we can't \nafford to close it.\n  Let's look at the numbers. According to SOUTHCOM, which runs the \ndetention facility, the annual operating cost is just over $100 \nmillion. However, according to this administration's own figures, the \ncost to renovate a facility in the United States is nearly half a \nbillion dollars, not including the annual operating costs.\n  Mr. Chairman, what is the life of an American worth? Is the gentleman \nfrom New York willing to stand here and have that conversation? I don't \nthink so.\n  This is a misguided amendment that would not make Americans safer. It \nis in the best interests of our national security to keep Guantanamo \nBay open, and, as the numbers show, it is also in the best interests of \nthe American taxpayer.\n  I just also want to respond to another quick comment over here where \nhe talked about some of those people are just merely detained. I just \nwant to remind us in this Chamber that these are the worst of the \nworst. These are the most hardened terrorists the world has ever seen, \nand, more importantly, they have the blood of Americans on their hands \nand should be kept in a safe facility where they are.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues reject this amendment.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n\n[[Page H2681]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from New York has 1 minute remaining.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have heard again the mantra from the other side: \nThese people are the worst of the worst. They have American blood on \ntheir hands.\n  Some of them may, but many of them don't. They have not been tried. I \ndon't know with what authority you say they are the worst of the worst; \nthey have American blood on their hands. True of some, not of others.\n  What kind of system is it for the United States to simply take \npeople, not try them, not accuse them, and hold them indefinitely \nbecause somebody says that they are the worst of the worst? On what \nauthority and on what proof?\n  As for the funding, it costs between $3 million and $5 million--$2.9 \nmillion here in 2013, closer to $5 million now--per person per year. It \ncosts $35,000 to hold someone in a supermax facility. I don't know why \nwe have to build new supermax facilities, but if we do, we should. The \npoint is it is incredibly expensive to keep them there for no reason.\n  Again, some of those people ought to be tried and sentenced to life \nimprisonment or whatever, some of them ought to be freed. Some of them \nhave been judged not to be, have already been found not to be a danger \nto the United States. Simply repeating over and over again that they \nare all the worst of the worst, they all have American blood on their \nhands, when it is simply not true--some of them yes, some of them no--\ndoes not make the case.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Ohio (Mr. Wenstrup) of the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. WENSTRUP. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Nadler \namendment because the amendment would allow detainees currently housed \nat Guantanamo to be transferred to the United States. Why? Why do you \nwant to do that, to endanger our communities? That is what I ask, Mr. \nChairman.\n  I served at Abu Ghraib prison in Iraq. We were attacked three, four \ntimes a week. Why? To try to release these prisoners. We have seen that \nour enemy is capable of planning and, in some instances, launching \nattacks within the United States.\n  Currently, this move is not allowed. We asked the President for \ndetails on a plan. It was said that it was comprehensive. It didn't say \nwhere they would be housed or what the housing would entail or how much \nit would cost the taxpayer. This was not a serious plan.\n  What we do need, however, is a consistent policy on how to deal with \nfuture terrorist detainees. I would agree with that. Guantanamo remains \nour best option right now. It is a safe and appropriate location to \nhold detainees. It is secure and distant from our homeland.\n  Guantanamo also provides humane conditions for the detainees. They \nhave appropriate access to health care, the same as our troops have \nthere. They have recreational activities, culture, and religious \nmaterials.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Kansas (Mr. Pompeo), who serves on the Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  Mr. POMPEO. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the Nadler \namendment as well. These are, in fact, the worst of the worst. The \ndetainees that remain now, well under 100, are not cooks and bottle \nwashers, but serious men who meant to do serious harm to the United \nStates.\n  I want to spend the time that I have talking about a particularly \npernicious argument that has been made in favor of closing this \nfacility. It is an argument that says that these men attacked America \nbecause of the existence of Guantanamo Bay. It is inaccurate, it is \nfalse, and the facts don't support that claim.\n  Indeed, we have evidence, 34 translated messages from al Qaeda, from \nterrorists, talking about the reasons for their attacks, and only 7 \ntimes was Guantanamo Bay ever mentioned. It was mentioned in each case \nas a glancing issue. Iraq, Afghanistan, and even the Crusades were \nmentioned hundreds of times, but Guantanamo Bay is not the reason that \nthey attacked America.\n  I can tell you that we wrote a letter to the Director of National \nIntelligence, Mr. Clapper. He, too, confirmed that this is not a \nmotivation for the attacks. We should remember that these attacks began \nwell before the existence of Guantanamo Bay.\n  The fact that Guantanamo Bay acts as an agent to promote terrorism is \nfalse and must be rejected, as must this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Colorado (Mr. Coffman), who is a member of the House \nArmed Services Committee.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong opposition to this \namendment. The Obama administration's efforts to close the prison at \nGuantanamo Bay are both irresponsible and dangerous.\n  A report from January of this year by the Office of the Director of \nNational Intelligence indicates that the number of Guantanamo detainees \nreleased by the Obama administration and suspected of returning to the \nbattlefield has doubled since the last recidivism report in 2015.\n  Those who remain in Guantanamo Bay are the worst of the worst; so it \nis safe to presume that, if released, an even higher percentage of them \nwould remain a threat to our national security. These are not U.S. \ncitizens. They are foreign, unlawful enemy combatants that have \ndirectly supported hostilities against the United States and our \nallies.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. Chairman, I have and will continue to oppose any attempt to \ntransfer these detainees to my home State of Colorado or to any other \nState. They must be kept at Guantanamo Bay.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. I yield the gentleman an additional 10 seconds.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Congress has a responsibility to the American people to \nensure that these unlawful enemy combatants are not brought to the \nUnited States. Mr. Chairman, these congressional restrictions must \nremain in place.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, how much time does the other \nside have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas has 45 seconds remaining.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield the balance of my time to the \ngentlewoman from Missouri (Mrs. Hartzler), the chair of the Oversight \nand Investigations Subcommittee.\n  Mrs. HARTZLER. Mr. Chairman, it is reckless to propose this \namendment. Not only does it allow them to come here on our own shores \nand live in our own neighborhoods, but the administration has estimated \nit would cost potentially $475 million just to move them here.\n  It also removes the prohibition that these detainees could be \ntransferred to Somalia, Libya, and Syria. We do not want these \nterrorists released back onto the battlefield where they could kill our \nsoldiers.\n  This is a reckless amendment. It needs to be defeated. We need to \nkeep them at GTMO, use our taxpayer dollars wisely, and ensure the \nsafety of our neighborhoods.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Nadler).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from New York \nwill be postponed.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 13 Offered by Mrs. Walorski\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 13 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle E of title X, add the following:\n\n[[Page H2682]]\n\n  \n\n\n     SEC. 10__. APPLICATION OF THE FREEDOM OF INFORMATION ACT TO \n                   THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 552(f)(1) of title 5, United \n     States Code (commonly referred to as the Freedom of \n     Information Act), is amended by inserting ``and the National \n     Security Council'' after ``the Executive Office of the \n     President''.\n       (b) Effective Date; Application.--\n       (1) Effective date.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall take effect on the date on which the first Assistant to \n     the President for National Security Affairs is appointed by \n     the President, by and with the advice and consent of the \n     Senate, pursuant to section 101(d)(1)(B) of the National \n     Security Act of 1947 (50 U.S.C. 3021(d)(1)(B)), as added by \n     title IX of this Act.\n       (2) Application.--The amendment made by subsection (a) \n     shall apply with respect to any record created by the \n     National Security Council on or after the date specified in \n     paragraph (1).\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentlewoman \nfrom Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today to offer an amendment which addresses both the \nincredibly important role played by the President's National Security \nCouncil, but also the concerning trend of consolidation of authority in \nthe White House.\n  Over the past two administrations, the NSC has transformed from \nsimply a coordination and advisory body to something else entirely.\n  We recently heard from President Obama's three former Secretaries of \nDefense--Gates, Panetta, and Hagel--each outlining the challenges they \nfaced in trying to manage the Defense Department and combat operations \nin the face of a more intrusive NSC.\n  Most notably, Secretary Gates said: ``It was the operational \nmicromanagement that drove me nuts of White House and NSC (National \nSecurity Council) staffers calling senior commanders in the field . . . \nsecond guessing commanders.''\n  The NSC was never intended to operate in this manner. It was intended \nto be an advisory body and interagency coordination center for the \nPresident. However, its size has exploded from roughly 100 staffers \nunder President Clinton, to 200 under President Bush, and now 400 under \nPresident Obama.\n  Moving decisionmaking away from the departments undermines the \nauthority of Secretaries and General officers who have been confirmed \nby the Senate and concentrates power with unelected, unconfirmed, and \nunaccountable bureaucrats who care more about optics and narratives.\n  This is best illustrated in the recent profile of Deputy National \nSecurity Advisor Ben Rhodes, who has a master's in creative writing and \nno practical experience in foreign policy.\n  Mr. Chairman, the National Security Council has moved far beyond its \noriginal advisory role to one in which NSC staffers make critical \noperational decisions.\n  My amendment simply restores accountability to this operational \norganization by requiring the NSC to participate in the Freedom of \nInformation Act, or FOIA, upon coordination of the National Security \nAdvisor by the Senate.\n  Bringing the NSC under FOIA is not without precedent. The NSC \nactually maintained a FOIA program and complied with requests under \nPresidents Ford, Carter, Reagan, Bush, and Clinton. However, a 1996 \ncourt case ruled that, since it was an advisory body, it did not need \nto participate.\n  The NSC is not simply an advisory body anymore. It is time to bring \nit back under FOIA and shine light on its activities.\n  This amendment fits well into Chairman Thornberry's broader NSC \nreform efforts. I thank him for making this a priority in this year's \nNDAA.\n  As the chairman outlined earlier, these provisions will make it clear \nto future administrations that the NSC cannot continue to just grow in \nsize and mission without consequential oversight measures.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry), the \nesteemed chairman of the House Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, the gentlewoman makes the point very well that, at a \ncertain point, you get enough people that the institution of the \nNational Security Council staff takes on different characteristics.\n  When it has those different characteristics, then you have to comply \nwith FOIA, then you have to be confirmed by the Senate, and then you \nhave to be able to come before Congress and justify the decisions that \nyou have made.\n  That is the point with both of our amendments, that there comes a \npoint that basic nature changes and there are implications of that, \nincluding the one that is related to the gentlewoman's amendment.\n  I support her amendment, and I hope Members will support it.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his strong \nsupport.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Montana (Mr. \nZinke), my friend and colleague on the Armed Services Committee.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to support my colleague from \nIndiana's amendment.\n  The amendment is simply about restoring public accountability and \ntransparency to the National Security Council.\n  As a former Deputy Commander of Special Operations in Iraq, I have \npersonally seen what happens. Oftentimes, our rules of engagement that \ndictate how we fight are politicized and it diminishes our ability to \nfight. I have seen it. It is time to change.\n  If they move out of an advisory role to a role where they are \ncommanding and interpreting commands, then we need FOIA. America \ndeserves accountability. America deserves our ability to look at who is \ncalling the shots and why.\n  This is not a hit on the administration. This is an American issue. \nWhen a role is advisory and comes from advisory to command, then that \ncommand needs to be held accountable. That is what we do.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Montana.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, none of what has been said really \nchanges under these amendments. What all this really is is an argument \nto get rid of the NSC, to say that this group of folks should not \nexist. As we argued before, the reason the National Security Council \nwas created was to offer the President close and confidential advice.\n  Now, that National Security Council, as was pointed out by other \npeople who have made arguments about this, has consistently been \ncriticized by the other Departments, going all the way back, I imagine, \nto when the NSC was formed. Whether there is 100, 200, or 300 of them, \nthat really doesn't change that basic conflict.\n  Do you believe the President needs these confidential advisers? If \nyou do, then you should oppose these amendments. They should get rid of \nthe NSC. If you are going to take away the advice and their ability to \ndo that, then we should just have the DOD and the President shouldn't \nhave these advisers.\n  But there is a reason the NSC was created in the first place, to give \nthe President those close advisers. Further restricting it in this \nmanner effectively eliminates the NSC.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, this is absolutely not an amendment to \nget rid of the NSC. This just simply brings accountability and \ntransparency into a very important agency, into a White House that has \ntaken this to no longer just an advisory agency role on behalf of the \nAmerican people who we serve.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n      Amendments En Bloc No. 2 Offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, pursuant to House Resolution 732, I \noffer amendments en bloc.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendments en bloc.\n\n[[Page H2683]]\n\n  Amendments en bloc No. 2 consisting of amendment Nos. 19, 28, 29, 30, \n31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, and 38 printed in part B of House Report \n114-569, offered by Mr. Thornberry of Texas:\n\n\n         amendment no. 19 offered by mr. calvert of california\n\n       At the end of title XI, add the following new section:\n\n     SEC. 1112. REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE CIVILIAN WORKFORCE \n                   PERSONNEL AND CONTRACTORS.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) A large, disproportionate, and duplicative civilian \n     work force coupled with bureaucratic, structural \n     inefficiencies has detracted from the Pentagon's production \n     of combat power and its ability to modernize.\n       (2) The recent uniformed military drawdown has not been \n     accompanied by an equivalent reduction of either the civilian \n     or contractor work force. Right sizing the civilian workforce \n     must be statutory in number but implemented with executive \n     discretion. Across-the-board cuts to the defense civilian \n     workforce are not the answer.\n       (3) Spending on contract services is over 50 percent of all \n     Department of Defense purchases even as the total defense \n     budget has dropped.

Mr. Chairman, each of these amendments have been \ncoordinated with both sides of the aisle. I urge Members to support \nthis en bloc package.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Costa).\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for yielding me the \ntime in today's debate.\n  Mr. Chairman, as part of the Department of Defense's Innovative \nReadiness Training, a mission that provides military training and \nresources and supports local communities throughout the country, there \nare four National Guard teams that are currently practicing the fine \nart of well drilling in the United States prior to deploying abroad. \nClearly, we know in parts of the Middle East having the water resources \navailable to support our troops is absolutely essential.\n  My amendment has the potential to help areas, though, in our country \ntoday as part of this training program. Regions throughout the country \nhave experienced devastating droughts. Those in the area that I \nrepresent, the San Joaquin Valley of California, have experienced a \nloss of drinking water supplies as a result of these serious drought \nconditions they have had to face.\n  In California alone, there have literally been thousands and \nthousands and thousands of households that have been without access to \ndrinking water.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. COSTA. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman.\n  This amendment would try to respond to those thousands of households \nthat have lost their source of drinking water. This amendment would \nrequire the Department of Defense to provide a report to Congress on \nthe well drilling capabilities of military units and the feasibility of \nrotating their training locations so that they can do their training in \nareas where the devastating droughts have impacted to the greatest \ndegree, primarily in western States.\n  I think this is a commonsense amendment. I ask that it be adopted.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chair, I rise to note my reservations about \nthe characterization of civilian employees in the Calvert amendment to \nthe Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act. Although I \nbelieve it is important that we have a good assessment of the number \nand location of our civilian and contractor personnel who work at the \nDepartment of Defense, I believe it is also important that we \naccurately reflect the critical role that our federal civilians play in \nensuring the military readiness of our nation.\n  I have the distinct privilege of representing Hill Air Force Base in \nOgden, Utah and serving on the House Armed Services Committee, \nSubcommittee on Readiness. As such, I have had a front row seat \nreviewing our nation's combat power and the role played by the civilian \nworkforce in generating and supporting combat power. I can tell you \nthat our civilian workforce does not detract from combat power, but \nserves as a force multiplier and as part of the backbone of military \nreadiness. Without the men and women who serve at the Ogden Air \nLogistics Complex at Hill Air Force Base, as well as the other Air \nLogistics Complexes and military depots around the country in all of \nthe services, we would have mission failure in any number of military \naircraft on a daily basis, failing our warfighters, and costing lives. \nIt is time that we stand up and salute our nation's federal civilians \nwho work at the Department of Defense. Their work is valuable and their \ncontributions are numerous.\n  I think we need to tread very carefully in asserting Congressional \nfindings that would cast a wide-net of negative aspersions on thousands \nof defense civilians who directly support the war fighter, and often \nmake substantial sacrifices to do so. I am concerned that they are not \nunfairly pegged as being wasteful or superfluous to readiness. Yes, \nlet's conduct oversight and study the defense civilian workforce, but \nlet's hold off making such findings until after the facts are in and \nthe defense committees have had adequate time to review and analyze the \nresults. To do otherwise puts the cart before the horse, and is frankly \nunfair to thousands of my constituents who have suffered under this \nAdministration's illegal decision to direct furloughs of working \ncapital fund employees without pay. We cannot continue to treat our \ndepot civilians in this manner without profound negative consequences \nto hard working families and ultimately to the warfighter.\n  Mr. COLE. Mr. Chair, I rise to express my concern with only certain \naspects of the Calvert amendment that is included in part of the second \nen bloc of amendments to the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense \nAuthorization Act. I respect my colleague from California and his \nattempt to catalogue the numbers of civilians and contractors \nperforming work for the Department of Defense; however, I object to the \ncharacterization of civilian employees and their role in the military \nstructure.\n  I have the great privilege of representing the men and women who \nserve our nation at Tinker Air Force Base and Fort Sill. There is no \nfiner group of people anywhere in the world. They are patriots. And \nthey serve as the backbone of military readiness for the U.S. Air Force \nand for the United States military. Without the work performed at \nTinker, located in Oklahoma City, many of our most complex aircraft \nsimply would not be mission ready. The aircraft could not be flown and \nour nation's defense would be greatly degraded. Therefore, to find that \nour civilian workforce is disproportionate, duplicative and is \ndetracting from combat power is incorrect. Civilian employees are \nessential to the operations and readiness of our military. We simply \ncannot do the mission without them.\n\n[[Page H2685]]\n\n  I agree with the finding that across-the-board cuts to the defense \ncivilian workforce are not the answer. However, it is important to \nnote, that all areas of the workforce do not need additional cuts. For \nexample, depots had already taken a greater percentage cut than the \nmilitary and now we find ourselves in the unfortunate position that for \nmilitary readiness purposes--for the absolute necessity of supporting \nour warfighter--we are in the position of requiring some of our Air \nLogistics Complexes to hire over 1,000 additional personnel per year \nfor a 2 year period. In fact, this bill contains a provision which will \nprovide direct hire authority so that the services can hire the people \nthey need, quickly and efficiently. Sometimes in our zeal to limit or \ncut our civilians, we lose sight of the mission and make assumptions \nthat are not rooted in fact.\n  Again, I want to commend and thank our outstanding civilian workforce \nand particularly those who live and work in the great State of Oklahoma \nfor their skill and their dedication to the military mission. Their \ncontributions to our great country should be acknowledged and \ncommended.\n  Mr. CALVERT. Mr. Chair, Chairman Mac Thornberry, and Ranking Member \nAdam Smith, I rise in support of Rules Amendment Number 161 to H.R. \n4909, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal year \n2017. However, I would first like to thank you for your thoughtful \napproach in writing this year's bill; it was not an easy task. The \nparticular focus on end-force readiness restoration is to be commended; \nwe cannot ask members of the armed forces to defend their country and \ndemocracy without adequately outfitting and training the soldier, unit \nand force. Additionally, I am pleased to see the NDAA's approach toward \nmuch needed acquisition reform, healthcare reform, Goldwater Nichols \nreform and more.\n  However, as we debate today it is incumbent on us as Members of \nCongress to continue the discussion about the right mix of active duty, \ncivilian and contractors at the Department of Defense.\n  The recent uniformed military drawdown has not been accompanied by an \nequivalent reduction of either the civilian or contractor work force as \nin drawdowns in the past.\n  A large, disproportionate, and duplicative work force coupled with \nbureaucratic, structural inefficiencies has detracted from the \nPentagon's production of combat power and its ability to modernize.\n  Right sizing the civilian workforce must be multifaceted, statutory \nin number, and implemented with executive discretion. Across the board \ncuts to the defense civilian workforce are not the answer.\n  Spending on contract services is over 50 percent of all Department of \nDefense purchases even as the total defense budget has dropped. \nExpenditures in service contracting lack appropriate oversight, \naccountability, and scrutiny.\n  However, no proper approach to addressing the civilian workforce may \nbe accomplished without first understanding who these civilian workers \nare, where they are located, and what jobs they are performing. My \namendment, Rules Committee Number 161, seeks a report by the Department \nof Defense on the total civilian workforce picture. In the past, \nreports have been requested but are fragmented in nature. The report I \nam requesting will require a projection from fiscal years 2017 through \n2020 of Full Time Equivalent (FTE) and contractor employees broken down \ninto several sub-categories including location, job function, General \nSchedule (GS) level, and date of when the job was created.\n  As we debate the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization Act \n(NDAA), it is incumbent on us as Members of Congress to continue the \ndiscussion about the right mix of active duty, civilian and contractors \nat DoD.\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I rise to express my concern with certain \naspects of the Calvert amendment that is included in part of the en \nbloc amendments to the Fiscal Year 2017 National Defense Authorization \nAct that we will pass by voice vote. My colleague from California has \nevery right to attempt to catalogue the quantity of civilian and \ncontractors within the Department of Defense. But I must object to his \ncharacterization of our civilian defense employees' roles.\n  I am lucky enough to represent nearly 80,000 federal employees, many \nof whom work at the Pentagon, Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall, Fort \nBelvoir, or one of the myriad Department of Defense installations \naround Northern Virginia. This includes ground breaking work at the \nDefense Advanced Research Projects Agency, important work to keep us \nsafe at Defense Threat Reduction Agency, and the jobs supplying our \nmilitary with the tools it needs at the Defense Logistics Agency. Our \nnation, its people, and its defenses would not by possible without the \ndedicated work of these individuals.\n  Mr. Calvert's effort to categorize these civilian defense employees \nas disproportionate or duplicative undermines the incredible work they \ndo every day to keep our military running. The ability to produce \ncombat power, modernize, and keep our troops healthy and safe are \ncritical functions at the Department of Defense. Moreover, they are \ncritical functions performed by highly intelligent, accomplished, and \ndedicated civilian employees.\n  Our civilian workforce has already weathered years of uncertain \nbudgets, pay freezes, a government shutdown, and sequester furloughs. \nWe should not further demean the important work they do with this \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

REQUIREMENT RELATING TO TRANSFER OF EXCESS \n                   DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE EQUIPMENT TO FEDERAL AND \n                   STATE AGENCIES.\n\n       Section 2576a of title 10, United States Code, is amended \n     by adding at the end the following new subsection:\n       ``(g) Preference for Border Security Purposes.--(1) In \n     transferring the personal property described in paragraph (2) \n     under this section, the Secretary of Defense may give first \n     preference to the Department of Homeland Security and then to \n     Federal and State agencies that agree to use the property \n     primarily for the purpose of strengthening border security \n     along the southern border of the United States.\n       ``(2) The personal property described in this section is--\n       ``(A) unmanned aerial vehicles;\n       ``(B) the Aerostat radar system;\n       ``(C) night-vision goggles; and\n       ``(D) high mobility multi-purpose wheel vehicles (commonly \n     known as `humvees').''.\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas (during the reading). Mr. Chair, I ask unanimous \nconsent that the modification be considered as read.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the modification?\n  There was no objection.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I thank the chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. Chair, this amendment is very similar to amendments that have \nbeen on this House floor before, presented by me and others, and is \nsimilar to an amendment that passed unanimously in the FY 2015 NDAA. It \nis called the SEND Act. It addresses the process of sending excess \nmilitary equipment, which is not being used, to our border security \nfolks to help them secure the border. That is the purpose of previous\n\n[[Page H2686]]\n\namendments and legislation that started all the way back in 2011.\n  One way that the Department of Defense helps the Border Patrol is \nthrough the transfer of equipment that it deems to be in excess to its \nneeds. Under current law, the transfer of this excess equipment gives \nsome preference to counterdrug, counterterrorism, and some border \nsecurity activities.\n  This amendment simply takes that preference a step further, giving \nborder security preference for a few specific pieces of equipment which \nare particularly useful for border security applications: unmanned \nsurveillance vehicles, including aerostat blimps that are now being \nused, night vision goggles, and Humvees.\n  The Border Patrol, as we all know, is the first and last line of \ndefense against criminal gangs that come into the United States. In my \nhome State of Texas, I have been to the border numerous times, and we \nhave the same issue that other border States have with the criminal \ndrug cartels, which are involved in not only bringing drugs into the \nUnited States, but in trafficking humans for sex slavery, labor \nslavery, and other purposes.\n  After talking with them about many, many issues, we found out the \nsituation on the border regarding equipment. A Texas ranger once told \nme that the drug cartels outman, outgun, out-finance, and out-equip the \nBorder Patrol and those who are on the border who are trying to protect \nus from those criminal gangs that are coming into the United States.\n  One of the issues the last time I was down at the border 2 or 3 weeks \nago was that the Border Patrol was actually excited about these \naerostats that are being used. That is a blimp that they put up in the \nsky, and it helps in surveillance along the border. They need more of \nthose on the border. Of course, this amendment does exactly that. It \ngives a preference to those specific items that are mentioned in the \namendment for the Border Patrol to use for border security purposes.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the gentleman's \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield myself 3 minutes.\n  This amendment is a solution in search of a problem. In fact, I think \nit will exacerbate some of the security problems we already have.\n  As the gentleman knows, the border security agencies can already \napply for this excess military equipment, but I ask those \nrepresentatives who represent the people who live on the U.S. side of \nthe U.S.-Mexico border--cities like San Diego, California; Nogales, \nArizona; El Paso, Laredo, and Brownsville, Texas--whether they want \nUAVs, or unmanned aerial vehicles, which could also be MQ-9 Reapers, \nflying over their homes, their schools, their neighborhoods, prying \ninto their backyards each and every day.\n  This is at a time when we are already spending $18 billion a year to \nsecure our border with Mexico and when we are seeing less than zero \nmigration from Mexico itself. In the year 2000, we had 1.6 million \napprehensions. This last year, we didn't even reach 400,000 \napprehensions.\n  Of any border of which we are told by the Director of the National \nCounterterrorism Center, by the Director of the FBI, by the Secretary \nof Homeland Security that there has never been nor is there now a \nterrorist, a terrorist organization, or a terrorist plot that is \nseeking to exploit the border with Mexico, what this does is further \ntakes our eye off the ball where we have known risks and known threats \nto this country and to the homeland. It stokes fear and anxiety and, in \nsome cases, hatred towards our neighbor to the south, towards those \ncommunities on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico border--communities \nlike my own El Paso, Texas, which happens to be the safest city in the \nUnited States today.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment that \ndoes not solve any problems and, I argue, would make some of the \nsecurity issues that we already have worse.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, the first thing is that this amendment \ndoes not include the MQ-9 Reaper that the gentleman mentioned. It does \nnot make a preference for that. I also take exception to the ``hatred'' \ncomment that was made here.\n  Look, the border security in the United States has issues. The Border \nPatrol says we need to help find those illegal gangs that are coming \ninto the United States. This is not about the surveillance of Americans \nand spying on Americans. It is on the border.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nCuellar), who represents part of the Texas border, the city of Laredo.\n  Mr. CUELLAR. Mr. Chair, I do support Mr. Poe's amendment.\n  With all due respect to my good friend, we do want to secure the \nborder. We just want to do it in the right way.\n  While some people are talking about securing the border with a wall--\na 14th century solution--I think if we use the aerostats, we can \nprovide coverage and surveillance to make sure that we secure the \nborder. In fact, in south Texas, including in my district, we have five \nof those aerostats right now. The communities support them. The Border \nPatrol certainly supports them. In fact, in appropriations, I am asking \nfor five new aerostats so we can go ahead and secure the border. Each \naerostat covers about 20 miles. So if you want to cover the border--\n1,954 miles of border--divided by 20, with about 97 or 98 aerostats, \nminus the 5 that we already have in place, we will secure the border in \nan electronic way.\n  This also helps us secure the border on the Mexico side. In talking \nto the Border Patrol, they have used some of that information because \nthey can go 20 miles into Mexico, and already we have coordinated some \nof those activities with the Mexican law enforcement officials to stop \nthose drug gangs before they come over to the U.S. You turn the camera \n20 miles into Mexico, and with about 97 aerostats, we can secure the \nwhole border.\n  Again, I support this amendment, and I thank the gentleman very much \nfor yielding.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I inquire as to how much time remains on my \nside.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. O'Rourke) has 3 \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in opposition to the Poe amendment.\n  This amendment would expand the military's authority under the 1033 \nprogram to flood our streets with surplus battle-ready military \nequipment straight from the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Specifically, this amendment would allow the Defense Department to \ntransfer equipment, such as the MQ-9 Reaper drone, to Federal and State \nlaw enforcement agencies. This is a cynical attack, cloaked in the name \nof border security on President Obama's executive order, that limits \nthe proliferation of military equipment within the borders of America.\n  Typically, the 1033 program feeds more than $4.3 billion in surplus \nmilitary grade weaponry, including armored vehicles and tanks, into the \nUnited States annually. Now we have Republicans looking to expand the \ntype of weaponry that is distributed to law enforcement under the 1033 \nprogram to include military drones.\n  While border security should remain at the forefront of our political \ndiscourse, the use of Grim Reaper drones and other military equipment \nto track and hunt down human beings is not the answer. An increase in \nmanpower, training and facilities, not MQ-9 Reapers, is the way that we \nshould go about our efforts in protecting our borders without \nsacrificing our values of respect for basic human rights and dignity.\n  Moreover, allowing military equipment, such as predator drones, into \nAmerica's airspace puts Americans at risk. Federal agencies have \nalready lost hundreds of guns and grenade launchers that have been \ndonated to police departments, and many of these weapons have shown up \nfor sale on eBay or have been reported stolen. I don't want to see this \nhappen with equipment, such as military drones, being doled out to \nborder security.\n\n[[Page H2687]]\n\n  Further, the militarization of our State and Federal border security \nagencies will make the border more volatile and not safe. Therefore, I \nrise in opposition, and I ask my colleagues to support me in my \nopposition.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, how much time remains on my side?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe) has 30 seconds \nremaining.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, the gentleman from Texas says that the MQ-9 \nReaper is not specifically addressed in this amendment. However, UAVs \nare--unmanned aerial vehicles--and the MQ-9 is one of them.\n  The point that I am trying to make is that we do not need to further \nmilitarize the border at a time when it is safer than it has ever been \nand when, in fact, U.S. cities on the U.S. side of the U.S.-Mexico \nborder are far safer than the average city in the interior of this \ncountry. If we need to send surplus military equipment elsewhere, let \nit be prioritized based on need, based on known threat. When we send \nsecurity resources where we don't have proven threats, we take them \naway from where we do. That makes this country less safe.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote against this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  The government already has a plan to send excess equipment to law \nenforcement. What this bill does is prioritize that equipment to the \nBorder Patrol. For those concerned about national spying that takes \nplace in the United States, which they claim, they would support this \nbecause its priority is to the border. It is not to other agencies.\n  The gentleman from Laredo said it best. Mr. Chair, believe it or not, \nwe cooperate with the Mexican Government, and they get information from \nus when we use those aerostats over the border, and they capture the \nbad guys before they come into the United States.\n  We need to support this amendment, prioritize it, and give them the \nequipment that they need.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chair, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment, as modified, offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas will be postponed.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 16 Offered by Mr. Kelly of Pennsylvania\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 16 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 462, after line 13, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. ___. LIMITATION ON AVAILABILITY OF FUNDS FOR DESTRUCTION \n                   OF CERTAIN LANDMINES AND REPORT ON DEVELOPMENT \n                   OF REPLACEMENT ANTI-PERSONNEL LANDMINE \n                   MUNITIONS.\n\n       (a) Limitation.--Except as provided in subsection (b), none \n     of the funds authorized to be appropriated by this Act or \n     otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 for the \n     Department of Defense may be obligated or expended for the \n     destruction of anti-personnel landmine munitions before the \n     date on which the Secretary of Defense submits the report \n     required by subsection (c).\n       (b) Exception for Safety.--Subsection (a) shall not apply \n     to any anti-personnel landmine munitions that the Secretary \n     determines are unsafe or could pose a safety risk if not \n     demilitarized or destroyed.\n       (c) Report Required.--\n       (1) In general.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Defense shall \n     submit to the Congress a report that includes the following:\n       (A) An assessment of the current state of research into \n     operational alternatives to anti-personnel landmines.\n       (B) Any other matter that the Secretary determines should \n     be included in the report.\n       (2) Form of report.--The report required by paragraph (1) \n     shall be submitted in unclassified form, but may include a \n     classified annex.\n       (d) Anti-personnel Landmine Munitions Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``anti-personnel landmine munitions'' \n     includes anti-personnel landmines and sub-munitions as \n     defined by the Convention on the Prohibition of the Use, \n     Stockpiling, Production and Transfer of Anti-Personnel Mines \n     and on their Destruction, as determined by the Secretary.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of \namendment No. 16, to prohibit the use of funds to dismantle the U.S. \nstockpile of anti-personnel landmines, APLs, unless the Secretary of \nDefense submits a report to Congress on the operational alternatives to \nAPLs.\n  Further, my amendment contains an exception for the destruction of \nAPLs that would be unsafe to store. This amendment would effectively \nrenew the ban that was passed by the full Congress and signed into law \nby the President in Public Law No. 114-92, the National Defense \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016.\n  Mr. Chair, our military commanders have spoken clearly regarding the \nvalue and the need for APLs. On March 6, 2014, the United States' \nhighest ranking military officer, Martin Dempsey, the Chairman of the \nJoint Chiefs of Staff, called anti-personnel landmines an important \ntool in the arsenal of the United States.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  When he was head of the U.S. European Command, General Wesley Clark \nagreed, saying that ``our field commanders count on APLs to protect the \nforce, influence, maneuver, and shape the battle space, and mass combat \npower for decisive engagement.'' He also added that the need for APLs \nwas increasing.\n  Furthermore, two major studies, one conducted by the National \nResearch Council and the other by NATO, have concluded that APLs \nprovide crucial tactical advantages on the battlefield.\n  Yet on September 29, 2014, President Obama announced that outside of \nthe Korean Peninsula, the U.S. would not use APLs in order to \n``underscore its commitment to the spirit and humanitarian aims of the \nOttawa Convention.'' The President's actions were, by his own \nadmission, taken to move the U.S. towards full compliance with a \ntreaty, commonly known as the Ottawa Convention, to which the Senate \nhas not given its advice and consent. Moreover, this was created by an \nNGO-led process that openly sought to ``push aside the central feature \nof state sovereignty.''\n  The process that created the treaty was bad. The treaty has not been \napproved by the Senate, not signed by the President, and our senior \nmilitary officials state that it would deprive us of an important \nweapon. Yet the Obama administration seeks to move us forward in \ncompliance with it.\n  The U.S. has taken action on APLs. We give more funding for APL \nclearance than any other nation in the world. We are party to amended \nProtocol II to the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, the CCW, \nwhich requires U.S. APLs to be designed to deactivate or self-destruct.\n  Our APLs meet those standards. U.S. APLs are not killing civilians. \nLike all weapons, APLs can be used rightly or wrongly. When used \nresponsibly, as U.S. APLs are, they protect our forces, the forces of \nour allies, and civilians alike.\n  Landmine opponents, like the administration, state that the Ottawa \nConvention ``shows our leadership'' and that it is reducing the threat \nof landmines around the world. That is simply not true. Many IEDs, \nlegally speaking, are APLs. From February 2015 to January 2016, the \nPentagon's own Joint Improvised-Threat Defeat Agency recorded over \n50,000 worldwide casualties as a result of IED attacks.\n  The Ottawa Convention isn't solving the landmine problem; it is \nsimply disarming the good guys. In this environment, we need weapons \nthat can protect camps, cities, roads, and bases\n\n[[Page H2688]]\n\nfrom insurgent attack. Today, one of those weapons is the APL.\n  Unless we have an alternative to APLs that is equal to or better than \nAPLs at keeping our troops safe, we should not, and dare not, get rid \nof our stockpile of APLs. The safety of our sons and daughters in \nuniform is of the utmost importance.\n  Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Chairman Thornberry and his staff for \nworking with my office on this important issue.\n  I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in \nopposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Hultgren). The gentleman is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I oppose this amendment because it restricts, the President \nrestricts, the Department of Defense from taking actions that they feel \nare necessary in the best interest of the national security of our \ncountry by prohibiting their ability to get rid of the landmines that \nthey wish to get rid of.\n  The problem with landmines and the reason there was such an \ninternational outcry is, after conflicts, they tend to be left in the \nareas of conflict; and throughout the world, many innocents have wound \nup being killed by these landmines that are left over. They are a \nweapon that can indiscriminately hit civilians.\n  I think the IED example is an excellent example of how pernicious \nthese weapons are. They do attack, indiscriminately, civilians and \nmilitary personnel alike.\n  What the President is attempting to do is to get us to the point we \nare in compliance with the treaty that was reached. It has not been \nconfirmed by the Senate, that is true. But as Commander in Chief, the \nPresident has the authority to decide what weapons we should or should \nnot have.\n  And it is important that they do maintain the exception of Korea, \nwhere we have the very specific threat from North Korea, to make sure \nthat we preserve that option. Outside of that, the President and our \ncommanders at the Department of Defense have determined that this \noption is not one that we need to provide for national security, and it \nis one that the international community has condemned.\n  We have had attempts--the Geneva Convention and others--at limiting \nthe carnage given by warfare. One of the ways to limit that would be to \nlimit the amount of landmines that are available. That is what the \nPresident is attempting to do. This amendment, I believe, would \nunfairly restrict him in his ability to do that. He has the ability, as \nCommander in Chief, to make those decisions in consultation with the \nDOD. This restricts him in a way that I do not support, and I urge this \nbody to oppose the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KELLY of Pennsylvania. Mr. Chair, I respect the gentleman's \nopinion. I understand the President is the Commander in Chief, but I \nalso understand that the APLs, the ones that we use, protect our \nforces, our friends, and our allies.\n  As far as the danger of them, we lead on landmine clearance, and we \nhave lived up to all the international obligations we have accepted. \nThe landmine ban treaty disarms us, not our enemies. Dismantling our \nAPLs is not showing leadership. Instead, it would be the height of \nirresponsibility.\n  I know that sometimes in this House we get to the point where \npolitics takes precedence over policy. If, at the end of the day, this \nHouse can't do everything possible to protect our daughters and sons in \nuniform and our allies and friends around the world--we are the most \nresponsible user of APLs. We are doing more than anybody else to disarm \nIEDs.\n  The problem comes down to where does the United States stand. We need \nto stand, and we need to be resolute behind our Armed Forces. That is \nwhy I stand strong on this amendment.\n  Make sure the APLs stay in place.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime to close.\n  We are going to make the responsible decisions about what is best to \nprotect our Armed Forces, and I believe the President will do that. \nThis restricts him in one specific area that has not been shown--yes, \nwe are the most responsible users of landmines, but that is not exactly \na high bar to jump over. No matter how you use them, no matter where \nyou use them--yes, we are trying to clear them, and I think that is \ngreat. But if we didn't put them out there in the first place, we \nwouldn't have to worry about, then, going in there and clearing them.\n  What has been determined by the Department of Defense and by the \nPresident is that there are other, better ways to protect our troops \nthat do not unnecessarily endanger civilian populations. That is why \nthe President is going down the path that he is going down. I think he \nis right to do it, and I think we should reject this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Kelly).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 18 Offered by Mrs. Walorski\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 18 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the appropriate place in title X, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 10__. REQUIREMENT FOR MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING \n                   REGARDING TRANSFER OF DETAINEES.\n\n       Section 1034(b) of the National Defense Authorization Act \n     for Fiscal Year 2016 (Public Law 114-92; 129 Stat. 969; 10 \n     U.S.C. 801 note) is amended--\n       (1) by striking ``and'' at the end of paragraph (3);\n       (2) by striking the period and inserting ``; and'' at the \n     end of paragraph (4); and\n       (3) by adding at the end the following new paragraph:\n       ``(5) the United States Government and the government of \n     the foreign country have entered into a written memorandum of \n     understanding regarding the transfer of the individual and \n     such memorandum of understanding has previously been \n     transmitted to the appropriate committees of Congress.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentlewoman \nfrom Indiana (Mrs. Walorski) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Indiana.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  My amendment is very common sense. It is as simple in its concept as \nit is in requirements. My amendment simply increases the transparency \nand accountability surrounding transfers from Guantanamo Bay by \nrequiring the U.S. and the foreign government receiving the detainee to \nsign a written memo of understanding outlining the terms of the \ntransfer and to provide copies of that memo to Congress. These \ntransfers are too significant and the stakes are too high for a simple \nhandshake or verbal agreement.\n  As Paul Lewis, the President's own Special Envoy for Guantanamo \nDetention Closure, recently confirmed, detainees that were released \nhave returned to the battlefield and killed Americans. The \nadministration, itself, estimates the recidivism rate of detainees at \nnearly one out of three.\n  In my 4 years on the Armed Services Committee, I have consistently \nbeen disappointed by the lack of transparency surrounding these \ntransfers. In its plan for closure of the Guantanamo Bay detention \nfacility that was released in February, the administration insisted it \nreceived security assurances and humane treatment assurances from \ncountries receiving detainees. This includes travel restrictions, \nmonitoring, and information sharing. However, in December last year, \nreports began surfacing that a detainee who was released to Sudan in \nJuly 2012 was now in Yemen operating as a senior leader of al Qaeda in \nthe Arabian Peninsula, AQAP.\n  Setting aside the fact that a dangerous terrorist was transferred to \nSudan in the first place, a state sponsor of terrorism, I requested a \nclassified briefing to find out exactly what type of assurances the \nadministration received from the Sudanese Government that they would \nkeep an eye on this detainee and what punitive measures they took \nagainst the Sudanese\n\n[[Page H2689]]\n\nwhen it was discovered they let him out of their sight. Mr. Chairman, I \ncame away from that briefing with more questions than answers.\n  That is why I am offering this amendment today. A written memo of \nunderstanding between the U.S. and the foreign country receiving the \ndetainee will provide a greater degree of transparency and \naccountability than exists right now.\n  Mr. Chairman, one American casualty is too many. We must do more to \nensure that every precaution is taken if and when individuals are \ntransferred from GTMO. By providing this memo to the relevant oversight \ncommittees of this body, we take one more step toward real \naccountability for both the administration and for the foreign nation \naccepting these detainees.\n  I would like to thank the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke) for his \ncosponsorship. I would also like to commend the Senator from Arkansas \n(Mr. Cotton) for his work in offering this same requirement in the \nSenate bill.\n  I include in the Record the letters I sent to the administration \nrequesting information on the transfer of detainees, which are the \nbasis for this amendment.\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                Washington, DC, December 15, 2015.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama:  I write with grave concerns about \n     statements you made regarding the detention facility at \n     Guantanamo Bay, Cuba during a recent interview with Yahoo \n     News. In particular, I was troubled by your comments on \n     recidivism and on the process for selecting detainees for \n     release.\n       In the interview, you said of released detainees re-\n     entering the fight: ``Out of four-, five-, six-hundred people \n     that get released.. .a handful of them are going to be \n     embittered and still engaging in anti-US activities.'' \n     However, the Director of National Intelligence identified 196 \n     former detainees as either being confirmed or suspected of \n     returning to the battlefield in its September 2015 Report on \n     the Reengagement of Detainees Formerly Held at Guantanamo \n     Bay, Cuba. That's a recidivism rate over 30 percent--this is \n     hardly a handful.\n       At the heart of the issue, however, is not the rate of \n     recidivism, but rather its intensity. One of the 196 is \n     Ibrahim al-Qosi. He was released in July 2012 to his home \n     country of Sudan, a country designated as a State Sponsor of \n     Terrorism by the State Department. Since his release, he has \n     become a senior leader of al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula \n     (AQAP), which took credit for the attack on Charlie Hebdo in \n     Paris in January 2015. A month later, Vincent Stewart, the \n     Director of the Defense Intelligence Agency, testified before \n     Congress that AQAP ``remains committed to attacking the \n     West.'' We may disagree over what constitutes a handful, but \n     we cannot underestimate the difference another set of hands \n     can mean to these terrorist organizations.\n       The fact that al-Qosi was released to live in a US \n     government-designated State Sponsor of Terrorism is troubling \n     enough, but comments you made in the interview concerning the \n     release vetting process prompts more questions than it \n     answers. On that topic, you said:\n       ``The judgment that we're continually making is: are there \n     individuals [in Guantanamo] who are significantly more \n     dangerous than the people who are already out there who are \n     fighting? What do they add? Do they have special skills? Do \n     they have special knowledge that ends up making them a \n     significant threat to the United States?''\n       Accordingly, I would like to request a classified briefing \n     on how the administration has been evaluating the remaining \n     detainees for release. Specifically, I would like the \n     briefing to address:\n       1. What criteria, quantifiable or otherwise, are used to \n     determine if a detainee is more or less dangerous than those \n     currently on the battlefield\n       2. The groups or specific individuals currently on the \n     battlefield that detainees are being compared to in order to \n     make those determinations\n       a. If the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS) or its \n     leaders are part of this set, please also detail how the \n     weight given to the threat they pose has changed since \n     January 2014\n       3. Flow the special skills and knowledge are defined and \n     quantified\n       4. Any additional scrutiny given to detainees being \n     released to State Sponsors of Terror\n       It is disturbing that your administration seems to continue \n     underestimating the danger posed by former Guantanamo \n     detainees returning to the fight. One more terrorist on the \n     battlefield is too many because one more terrorist can be all \n     it takes to cause more death and destruction. I strongly urge \n     you to reconsider such consistent downplaying of this threat \n     and I look forward to your timely response.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jackie Walorski,\n     Member of Congress.\n                                  ____\n\n                                    Congress of the United States,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, March 1, 2016.\n     President Barack Obama,\n     The White House,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear President Obama: I am writing to follow up on a letter \n     I sent on December 15, 2015 regarding your policy on the \n     detention facility at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba and questions \n     surrounding the problem of recidivism. I am extremely \n     disappointed that, two-and-a-half months later, I have not \n     received any response. I am also troubled by the lack of \n     detail in your recent Plan for Closing the Guantanamo Bay \n     Detention Facility released last week, which provided no \n     clarity on the issues raised in the letter either.\n       Last week alone, Hamed Abderrahaman Ahmed, a former \n     detainee that was transferred to Spain, was arrested on \n     Tuesday, February 23 for recruiting fighters for the Islamic \n     State in Iraq and Syria (ISIS). Two days later, Ibrahim al-\n     Qosi, a former detainee that was transferred to Sudan, \n     released a message on Thursday encouraging jihad in Somalia. \n     He had also urged his followers to carry out attacks on New \n     Years Eve celebrations, particularly in New York City and \n     Paris. Recidivism is clearly a very real issue, but seems to \n     be underestimated by your administration.\n       In my December 15 letter, I had specifically raised the \n     case of Ibrahim al-Qosi who is now a senior leader of al \n     Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula (AQAP), which took credit for \n     the attack on Charlie Hebdo in Paris in January 2015. He was \n     also, curiously, transferred to a country that is designated \n     as a State Sponsor of Terrorism by the U.S. State Department.\n       The recently-released Plan for Closing the Guantanamo Bay \n     Detention Facility states that the U.S. government obtains \n     security assurances and humane treatment assurances from a \n     country before transferring a detainee. Among the security \n     assurances are restrictions on travel, monitoring of the \n     detainee, and periodic information sharing. However, al-Qosi \n     is currently operating out of Yemen. Obviously, there was a \n     breakdown in these security assurances.\n       Thus, I want to reiterate my request for a classified \n     briefing that covers the questions raised in my December 15 \n     letter, which I am enclosing. I would also like the briefing \n     to address these additional questions:\n       1. Security assurances your administration received from \n     the government of Sudan before the transfer of Ibrahim al-\n     Qosi\n       2. The frequency and type of monitoring agreed to by the \n     government of Sudan on Ibrahim al-Qosi and measures taken by \n     the U.S. government to verify that this monitoring was taking \n     place\n       3. The frequency and type of information shared by the \n     government of Sudan on Ibrahim alQosi, his whereabouts, and \n     his activities after his transfer\n       4. The date that the government of Sudan informed the U.S. \n     government that Ibrahim alQosi was no longer in Sudan\n       5. Any punitive measures taken against the government of \n     Sudan or members of the government in connection with its \n     failure to live up to its commitments regarding the transfer \n     of Ibrahim al-Qosi\n       6. Humane treatment assurances your administration received \n     from the government of Sudan, whose head of state, Omar al-\n     Bashir, has an arrest warrant pending with the International \n     Criminal Court for war crimes and crimes against humanity, \n     before the transfer of Ibrahim al-Qosi\n       7. Questions 1, 2, 3, and 6 as they pertain to the two \n     other detainees your administration transferred to Sudan: \n     Noor Uthman Muhammed and Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris\n       8. Questions 4 and 5 as they pertain to Noor Uthman \n     Muhammed and Ibrahim Othman Ibrahim Idris if they are no \n     longer in Sudan\n       9. Any extra security and humane treatment assurances your \n     administration seeks from countries that are on the U.S. \n     State Department's list of State Sponsors of Terrorism\n       10. Any ongoing negotiations with the governments of Iran \n     and Sudan regarding future transfer of Guantanamo detainees\n       Transferring Guantanamo detainees--known terrorists--to \n     countries that are State Sponsors of Terrorism is an \n     incredibly dangerous and misguided policy. No reasonable \n     person should trust these governments to follow through on \n     any promises they make to ensure detainees do not rejoin the \n     battle. I strongly urge you not to complete any future \n     transfers to these countries and I look forward to your \n     timely response to my request for a briefing.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                  Jackie Walorski,\n                                               Member of Congress.\n\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  There are 80 detainees left at Guantanamo. A number have been \ntransferred. Of those 80, I could be wrong, but I believe it is \nsomewhere in the neighborhood of 34 of them have been cleared for \ntransfer, basically deemed not to be\n\n[[Page H2690]]\n\nrisks to the United States. Restricting their ability to be transferred \nsimply drives up the cost of Guantanamo unnecessarily.\n  We have transferred a great many detainees out of Guantanamo. The \nstatistics cited go all the way back to the Bush administration when, \nregrettably, we did let people go without proper vetting.\n  We, through this bill, in past years, have put a number of provisions \nin place that require national security certifications that the people \nbeing transferred are not a risk to the United States. That is already \nrequired. This simply makes it more difficult to do that for no good \nreason.\n  The recidivism in recent years has been drastically lower. It has \nbeen less than 10 percent, nowhere near the 33 percent figure cited. \nAnd the ones that are left to be transferred, like I said, are ones \nthat have been determined not to be a risk.\n  Now, we take our time in transferring these people to make sure that \nwe have a place to transfer them, that it is safe and secure, willing \nto accept them and all of that. There are already multiple provisions \nin law to try and make sure that we don't take any chances.\n  Unfortunately, when you release people, there are always risks; but \ndetaining people forever without charge and after you have determined \nthat they are not a risk is also a risk. Basically, it goes against the \nvery values of the United States of America. We could just never \nrelease anyone from prison in the United States under these standards, \nunder the fact that, well, they might commit another crime. And they \nmight. So why don't we just lock them up forever?\n  We have a process, a very careful process, that has been worked out \nin a bipartisan fashion to determine who needs to be held and who can \nbe released. Then, after we determine they can be released, even then, \nwe go through a process of where they are released to and work with the \nhost country and try to determine what the best and safest available \nalternative is. This piles on to the bureaucracy and makes it more \ndifficult to do transfers that are in the best interest of the national \nsecurity of our country.\n  I oppose the amendment for those reasons.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nMontana (Mr. Zinke), a cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chair, well, how soon we forget why they are there. \nHow soon we forget.\n  Why are they there? Go to New York and look at the names engraved of \nthe ladder men, the commercial pilots, the innocent.\n  I did a lot to put them there. I don't remember reading Miranda \nrights or warrants. Yet some people want to bring them back to the \nUnited States under U.S. law where rules of evidence and Miranda rights \nwould apply. Yet that is ignored.\n  Now we are asking for tighter controls overseas because one-third go \nback to the battlefield. Is it a risk we should incur? The answer is \nno. Why? Because what is left is the bottom. These are the guys that \nare not hanging around evil. These are the guys that are evil. They are \nabsolutely evil, and we have seen it.\n  So putting more controls, more restrictions to protect American lives \nis what we must do in Congress. This is not a Democratic or Republican \nissue. This is an American issue.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Mr. SMITH of Washington. Mr. Chair, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I think that is the question: Why are they there? In the case of 26 \nof them, they are there because mistakes were made in picking them up. \nThis happened with many people at Guantanamo, particularly in the early \ndays, and these people have been there for a long time, where we \nbasically weren't taking any chances on whom we picked up. We threw out \na wide net and brought people in.\n  Now, there are estimated to be 44 of the folks there who are the \nbaddest of the bad, who we have direct connections to active terrorism, \nwho we know are a threat to the United States of America, and I am not \nproposing whatsoever that we should release those.\n  But the question of why are they there is absolutely right, and it is \nnot for the reasons that the previous gentleman stated in the cases of \nat least 26 of these inmates. They are there through a combination of \nmistakes, misidentification, misinformation, many different reasons why \nthey were picked up, and the problem is, now: How do we transfer them \nout? How do we find a home country to send them to?\n  I totally agree, if you are talking about incredibly dangerous people \nwho have done what the previous speaker said, we have got to keep those \npeople to protect America, but that is not the case with some of the \ninmates at Guantanamo. That is why we have been working to return these \ninmates to countries where they can be safely returned.\n  It is not everybody at Guantanamo who falls into that category. That \nis the reason I oppose this amendment.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, how much time do I have remaining?\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentlewoman from Indiana has 1\\1/4\\ minutes \nremaining.\n  Mrs. WALORSKI. Mr. Chairman, I guess in answer to the questions that \nhave been asked here, again, back to the fact that I think this is a \nvery commonsense amendment, this is talking about transparency and \naccountability.\n  How did a detainee go from Sudan to Yemen? Because the rules are too \nloose.\n  Let's just bring accountability and transparency into this issue so \nthe American people can see and so there is some accountability in this \ncountry on where these people end up.\n  These are the worst of the worst. They have American blood on their \nhands. The ones we are talking about from this point forward continue \nto have unbelievable issues, unbelievably dangerous criminal attached \nto their title. I am just simply asking for accountability and \ntransparency.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Indiana (Mrs. Walorski).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendments En Bloc No. 3 Offered by Mr. Thornberry\n\n  Mr. THORNBERRY.

SENSE OF CONGRESS ON JULY 2016 NATO SUMMIT IN \n                   WARSAW, POLAND.\n\n       (a) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\n       (1) The North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has been \n     the cornerstone of transatlantic security cooperation and an \n     enduring instrument for promoting stability in Europe and \n     around the world for over 65 years.\n       (2) NATO currently faces a range of evolving security \n     challenges, including Russian aggression in Eastern Europe, \n     and instability and conflict in the Middle East and North \n     Africa. In the face of these varied challenges, NATO must \n     deter threats and, if necessary, defend NATO member states \n     against adversaries.\n       (3) Since NATO's 2014 summit in Wales, NATO member states \n     have made progress in implementing a Readiness Action Plan to \n     enhance allied readiness and collective defense in response \n     to Russian aggression. However, much work remains to be done.\n       (4) NATO's solidarity is strengthened by the bolstering of \n     NATO's conventional and nuclear deterrence, increased defense \n     spending by NATO member states, and continued enlargement of \n     the Alliance.\n       (b) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that--\n       (1) at the July 2016 NATO Summit in Warsaw, Poland and \n     beyond, the United States should--\n       (A) welcome Montenegro's accession to NATO;\n       (B) continue to work with aspirant countries to prepare \n     them for entry into NATO;\n       (C) continue supporting a Membership Action Plan (MAP) for \n     Georgia;\n       (D) encourage the leaders of Macedonia and Greece to find a \n     mutually agreeable solution to the name dispute between the \n     two countries;\n       (E) seek a Dayton II agreement to resolve the \n     constitutional issues of Bosnia and Herzegovina;\n\n[[Page H2691]]\n\n       (F) work with the Republic of Kosovo to prepare the country \n     for entrance into the Partnership for Peace (PfP) program;\n       (G) take a leading role in working with NATO member states \n     to identify, through consensus, the current and future \n     security threats facing the Alliance; and\n       (H) take a leading role to work with other NATO member \n     states to ensure the alliance maintains the required \n     capabilities, including the gains in interoperability from \n     combat in Afghanistan, necessary to meet the security threats \n     to the Alliance;\n       (2) in Warsaw, NATO member states should build upon the \n     progress made since the 2014 Wales Summit, by committing \n     additional resources to NATO's Readiness Action Plan and \n     related measures to enhance allied readiness and deterrence;\n       (3) NATO member states should review defense spending to \n     ensure sufficient funding is obligated to meet NATO \n     responsibilities, including to allocate at least 2 percent of \n     Gross Domestic Product (GDP) to defense spending, and to \n     devote at least 20 percent of defense spending to defense \n     modernization and new equipment;\n       (4) the United States should commit to maintaining a robust \n     military presence in Europe as a means of promoting allied \n     interoperability, providing visible assurance to NATO allies, \n     and deterring Russian aggression in the region; and\n       (5) the United States reaffirms and remains committed to \n     the policies enumerated by NATO member states in the \n     Deterrence and Defense Posture Review, dated May 20, 2012, \n     and the Wales Summit Declaration of September 2014, including \n     the following statement: ``Deterrence, based on an \n     appropriate mix of nuclear, conventional, and missile defence \n     capabilities, remains a core element of our overall \n     strategy.''.\n\n\n           amendment no. 24 offered by mr. hanna of new york\n\n       In the table of contents for bill, insert after the item \n     pertaining to section 1867 the following:\n\nSec. 1868.

Mr. Chairman, each of these amendments in this en \nbloc package has been worked on both sides of the aisle. I believe this \npackage deserves Members' support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Beyer).\n  Mr. BEYER. Mr. Chair, I would like to thank the chairman from Texas \nfor adding my amendment to this en bloc.\n  Mr. Chairman, my amendment today would require the Defense Department \nand FAA to study the impact of military helicopter noise in the \nnational capital region and to develop recommendations to reduce the \neffect of noise on people and property.\n  The airspace around Washington, D.C., is more restricted and more \nhighly congested than in any other part of the country. On average, 144 \nhelicopter operations take place here every day, 75 percent of which \nare military, encompassing all types of military aircraft. One recent \naddition to our airspace is the V-22 Osprey, a hybrid helicopter and \nairplane with the width of an 8-story building. It has been deployed to \nwar zones in Iraq and Afghanistan, rescue missions in Haiti and the San \nJuan Mountains, and now the peaceful communities of northern Virginia.\n  As most of my colleagues probably know, the Osprey can transition \nfrom a turboprop plane to a conventional helicopter, all while hovering \nat a low altitude. This noisy transition takes place directly over the \nFairlington neighborhood in my district in Arlington, Virginia.\n  Mr. Chairman, the communities in my district are realistic about the \nnoise helicopters generate and are sensitive to the operational needs \nof the military, but the routes and altitude caps dictated by the FAA \nfollow best practices for public and private aircraft, not military \naircraft designed for a conflict zone.\n  A total quieting of the skies in northern Virginia is not possible or \neven practical; but given the military's insistence on using such \nheavy, loud aircraft, it is only right that they work with the FAA to \nreexamine the existing route structure and offer some possible \nsolutions.\n  I urge my fellow Members to support this amendment en bloc.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I would inform the gentleman that I \nhave no speakers on this amendment at this point, so I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I have no speakers at this time.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to yield 1 minute to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. McGovern).\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I thank the chairman for his graciousness.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in favor of the McGovern-Pompeo amendment, which is \npart of this en bloc, to create a medal honoring the service of atomic \nveterans or their surviving family members.\n  Between 1945 and 1962, over 200,000 servicemembers conducted hundreds \nof nuclear weapons tests and were exposed to dangerous levels of \nradiation. Sworn to secrecy, they couldn't even tell their doctors.\n  Presidents Bill Clinton and George H. W. Bush recognized their \nservice by providing specialized care and compensation, but this isn't \nenough.\n  Joe Mondello, a constituent of mine from Shrewsbury, Massachusetts, \nand other atomic veterans helped bring this issue to my attention. It \nis long past time to honor their service.\n  Last year, with the help of the chairman, in the DOD authorization \nbill we included this amendment, but then the Department of Defense \ninsisted the Senate remove it. Their explanation? We don't have a medal \nand don't want to create one. Congress should find another way to honor \nthese veterans. That is no excuse. In fact, that is insensitive, it is \ndismissive, and it is ungrateful. We should be appalled.\n  Tragically, many of these atomic veterans have already died without \nreceiving recognition. They kept a code of silence that likely led to \nmany of them passing away too soon. We must right this wrong. Support \nthis amendment. I urge the Senate to do the same thing.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I have no further speakers.\n  I urge adoption of the en bloc package.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, this additional en bloc package No. 4 \nconsists of a number of amendments that have been worked with both \nsides of the aisle. I believe that this en bloc package deserves the \nsupport of all Members.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, at this time I do not have a speaker, so \nI reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Chairman, there are a number of subjects that are covered in this \nen bloc package, and I think it exemplifies the work that goes into \ncreating this defense authorization bill.\n  If you look at the size of the bill, it is very large. As a matter of \nfact, it is over 1,200 pages when you look at the legislation. Of \ncourse, one of the reasons this bill is so large this year is that it \nincludes five major packages of reforms, including: acquisition reform, \nhealthcare reform, commissary reform, organizational reform, and \nUniform Code of Military Justice reform.\n  All of these things have been worked with Members on both sides of \nthe aisle. I understand that not all Members may agree with every \nprovision. I certainly don't. But the point is this bill supports the \nmen and women who risk their lives to serve our country, so that is the \ntime when all of us should put aside whatever differences we have with \nthis provision or that or this approach or that and come together on \nwhat has been for 54 years, and continues to be this year, a bipartisan \nproduct.\n  For all of the amendments that are included in this en bloc package, \nI believe they deserve the support of the House. I hope they will be \nadopted.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Judy Chu).\n  Ms. JUDY CHU of California. Mr. Chairman, the Small Business \nAdministration's, or SBA's, Women's Business Centers, the WBCs, fill a \ncritical gap in our economy.\n  Despite being more than 50 percent of the population, women own just \n30 percent of all businesses, and the same obstacles that keep some \nfrom starting a business keep others from growing theirs.\n  By providing specialized resources, Women's Business Centers are \ndesigned to make sure women-owned businesses succeed. That is why it is \nimperative that female entrepreneurs are able to access these resources \nin a convenient way.\n  The reality is that in large, densely populated areas, the need for \nthese centers is greater due to the higher concentration of women \nentrepreneurs. In fact, Los Angeles County was home to more women-owned \nbusinesses than any other county in the entire country in 2012, yet \nsome women had to wait weeks or months or were forced to travel long \ndistances in order to visit a WBC because the center closest to them \nwas unable to meet the demand.\n  My amendment would address this reality by ensuring that the SBA \nconsiders the population density of the area to be serviced when \nreviewing and selecting eligible organizations for the Women's Business \nCenter grants. We must continue to work to ensure that these centers \nare convenient and accessible for all women because, when women \nsucceed, America succeeds.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself 1 minute.\n  Mr. Chairman, among the amendments in this en bloc package is one by \nMr. Nolan of Minnesota that prohibits funding for the Syria Train and \nEquip programs to recipients that the Secretary of Defense has reported \nas having misused that training or equipment.\n  This amendment comes from a Democratic Member, but I think it is very \nimportant for all of us to do what we can to ensure that training and \nweapons provided to forces we are assisting in Syria not be misused, \nthat they not get in the hands of terrorists. Just to take that one \nexample, where I believe a good amendment has been accepted by both \nsides of the aisle, that helps ensure that the goals we all share--in \nthis case, for the Syria Train and Equip program--are met. That is an \nexample of the bipartisan nature of this bill.\n  Similarly, there is an amendment here by Mr. Aguilar of California \ncreating a pilot program to improve the ability to recruit cyber \nprofessionals, a new domain of warfare, an enormous challenge for the \ngovernment to compete with Silicon Valley, the Austin-San Antonio \ncorridor, and other places that are recruiting cyber professionals, but \na good and valued step. Those are examples of the amendments in this en \nbloc package.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chair, I have no other speakers on this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendments en bloc offered \nby the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Thornberry).\n  The en bloc amendments were agreed to.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n\n          Amendment No. 25 Offered by Mr. Larsen of Washington\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 25 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mr. LARSEN of WASHINGTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 995, line 2, strike ``to be new and emergency in \n     nature'' and insert ``will significantly reduce the nuclear \n     threat''.\n       Page 995, line 9, insert ``and'' after the semicolon.\n       Page 995, strike lines 13 through 17.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman \nfrom Washington (Mr. Larsen) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Washington.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, this amendment aims to remedy \na provision in the base text that could unnecessarily hamstring the \nvital work of preventing terrorists from obtaining nuclear material.\n  Section 3115 of the NDAA prohibits collaboration with Russia on \natomic energy defense activities, but provides the Secretary of Energy \nwith waiver authority.\n  However, the Secretary of Energy can only exercise the waiver if \nthere is a new emergency and if we completely eliminate the backlog of \nphysical security maintenance work at DOE defense nuclear sites in the \nU.S.\n  I stand with my colleagues in opposition to Russian aggression in \nCrimea,\n\n[[Page H2696]]\n\nUkraine, Syria, and threatening activity in the Baltics and elsewhere.\n  However, I believe that the terms of this waiver are wrong and would \nbe, frankly, impossible to execute. If we give the Secretary of Energy \na waiver, it should be achievable.\n  That is why my amendment improves the standard to a simple one: the \nSecretary must certify that this cooperation will significantly reduce \nthe nuclear threat.\n  It is no secret that nuclear material in Russia is vulnerable to \ntheft and smuggling. According to Harvard University's Managing the \nAtom project, Russian nuclear material is at risk from both insiders \nand outsiders. Nuclear material stolen in Russia does not have to \nremain in Russia and, therefore, could be a threat to the homeland.\n  Currently, we do not do any nuclear threat reduction work with \nRussia. If the opportunity presented itself and it was in the interest \nof national security, why not at least have that option?\n  So I encourage Members to support my amendment so our government can \nprotect Americans from nuclear terrorism, regardless of where that \nmaterial originates.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge people to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the points raised by the distinguished \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen).\n  As a matter of fact, I remember very well that one of my early \nspeeches on the floor of the House was on a motion to recommit--\nsupporting a Democratic motion, actually--regarding our efforts to help \nthe Russians get control of their nuclear material. That certainly has \nbeen an important priority.\n  It is also true that, since I was in the well in the mid-1990s on \nthat, things have changed. What we see is Russia spending an incredible \namount of money modernizing a variety of weapons systems, including \ntheir nuclear weapons. It includes submarines and bombers and a whole \nvariety of things, but it includes new nuclear weapons.\n  Yet, on the other hand, we have enormous backlogs of deferred \nmaintenance, we call it, in our nuclear infrastructure, in our nuclear \nweapons complex.\n  Deferred maintenance is a euphemism, Mr. Chairman, because even in my \nown district we have folks working in deplorable conditions. We are \ntalking about engineers and others working in conditions that no one \nshould have to work in because we have neglected our infrastructure \nthroughout the nuclear complex.\n  So I think the purpose of the underlying provision is that we \nshouldn't spend money doing what Russia has the money to do for itself, \nespecially when our own nuclear infrastructure is in such disrepair.\n  Now, there is a waiver provision. If there is something crucial, \nthen, obviously, another arrangement can be made. But the basic premise \nis Russia has changed. They are behaving not only more aggressively, \nbut modernizing their military. Meanwhile, we have neglected ours. It \nis time for us to catch up.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LARSEN of Washington. Mr. Chairman, I agree with the \ndistinguished gentleman from Texas that Russia has changed. The threat \nof loose nuclear material has not changed. Nuclear material in Russia \nis far more vulnerable than in the United States, and stolen nuclear \nmaterial anywhere is a threat to Americans.\n  Now, on a bipartisan basis, this committee has increased funding for \ndomestic physical security improvements. However, at current funding \nlevels, that backlog will exist for years.\n  If Congress is going to establish a waiver process, it should be an \nachievable one. Right now we do not do any of this work in Russia, but \nwe have the opportunity to reduce the nuclear threat, and we should \nkeep that option available. I would ask this body to support my \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, again, I appreciate the importance that \nthe gentleman places on securing nuclear material. I share his view. I \nstill am very concerned, for example, that terrorists will obtain--and \nwe know they would use--nuclear material if they have the opportunity.\n  The concern here is that we are doing things for Russians with \nAmerican taxpayer dollars so they need not do it for themselves. In \nfact, what they do for themselves is build more capability that \nthreatens us. We can't continue down that road.\n  I oppose the amendment, and I urge Members to do likewise.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. Larsen).\n  The amendment was rejected.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 26 Offered by Mr. Rogers of Alabama\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I offer a simple amendment to \ndefend congressional prerogatives and ensure Congress is getting full \ninformation from the administration regarding one of our Nation's \nhighest priority defense missions: nuclear deterrence.\n  Several years ago the Secretary of Energy tasked the Nation's nuclear \nweapons labs to produce a study on the future of nuclear deterrence. \nThat study was finalized in August of 2014, almost 2 years ago.\n  The Secretary made a personal commitment to senior members of the \nArmed Services Committee that he would send over the report resulting \nfrom that study. Now, 2 years later, we still have not received that \nreport.\n  This amendment will ensure DOE acts to fulfill the Secretary's \ncommitment to provide this report to Congress, ensure Congress can \nconduct appropriate oversight and has visibility into matters as \nimportant as the future of nuclear deterrence, which the Secretary of \nDefense has called the Nation's highest priority defense mission, and \nit fences only a couple million dollars in administrative funds within \nthe Office of the Secretary. This will be enough to ensure we receive \nthis report and will not impact the DOE's mission at all.\n  I urge my colleagues to vote ``yes'' on this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Tennessee is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate my friendship with the gentleman \nfrom Alabama, but I think this amendment goes way too far.\n  To fence half the funds of the Office of the Secretary of Energy is \noverkill.\n\n[[Page H2697]]\n\nSecretary Moniz has done an excellent job. This is really a punishment, \nthough, that will go to the next Secretary, a man who is not in any way \nresponsible for this delay.\n  Has there been a delay? It is my information that the chairman of the \nfull committee has had access to this report. Access to this report has \nbeen offered to the gentleman from Alabama and to myself.\n  Without having read the report, we do not know what issues of \nclassification or bureaucracy are involved in this. But this is among \nthe Nation's most precious and most classified secrets. To me, to use a \nsledgehammer like this against a good person and against that good \nperson's successor, whoever that may be, is really a crude way to \nhandle a breakdown in communications.\n  Surely there is a better way to solve this problem. His office is \njust down the street. We get along with him just fine. He has been \nfully communicative and extremely able in every aspect. But to have a \ndelayed report merit a sanction like this is pretty extraordinary.\n  So I would urge my friend, the gentleman from Alabama, to reconsider \nand not have what I consider to be a staff-driven tiff escalate into \nsomething much greater than it should be.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate my friend's \nremarks, and I agree. I like Mr. Moniz. I think the Secretary is a fine \nman and he is trying to do the right thing.\n  I have had a conversation with the ranking member earlier today, but \nI haven't had a chance to follow up with him. I have been on the floor \ndoing a lot.\n  The only problem I have with withdrawing the amendment is we need \nthis report between now and the time we go to conference to take what \nis yielded from it and visit with the appropriators.\n  Just me reading the report with you in private would not give me the \ndocumentation to take what it says--what I believe it says--and produce \nsome policy that will deal with what the report says is a threat to our \ncountry.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  For that reason, I would like to urge my colleagues to vote for the \namendment, and reassure my friend and the Secretary that if, in fact, \nthe report is forthcoming, and we are going to have a few months \nbetween now and the time we go to conference, I will be happy, in \nconference, to ask that this provision be withdrawn.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COOPER. Mr. Chair, I thank the gentleman from Alabama. I would \njust urge that both he and other Members not use this in any way as a \nprecedent. It is one thing to fence an appropriate amount of money over \na worthy disagreement, but this is overkill in this case, at least in \nmy opinion.\n  So we probably will not prevail on the vote, but we need to establish \nprecedents that will work for the strongest possible defense for that \ncountry, and a minimum of bureaucratic conflict.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from \nTennessee, and I urge my friends in the House to vote ``yes.''\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alabama (Mr. Rogers).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 60 Offered by Mr. Zinke\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 60 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-569.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 16__. REQUESTS FOR FORCES TO MEET SECURITY REQUIREMENTS \n                   FOR LAND-BASED NUCLEAR FORCES.\n\n       (a) Certification.--Not later than five days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff shall certify to the congressional defense \n     committees that the Chairmans has approved any requests for \n     forces, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, of a \n     commander of a combatant command to meet the security \n     requirements of land-based nuclear forces.\n       (b) Limitation.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 \n     for the travel and representational expenses of the Secretary \n     of Defense, not more than 75 percent may be obligated or \n     expended until the date on which the Secretary certifies to \n     the congressional defense committees that there is a \n     competitive acquisition process in place to ensure the \n     fielding of a UH-1N replacement aircraft in fiscal year 2018.\n\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent that amendment No. \n60 be modified by the form that I have placed at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will report the modification.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n\n    modification to amendment no. 60 offered by mr. zinke of montana\n\n       At the end of subtitle D of title XVI, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 16__. REQUESTS FOR FORCES TO MEET SECURITY REQUIREMENTS \n                   FOR LAND-BASED NUCLEAR FORCES.\n\n       (a) Certification.--Not later than five days after the date \n     of the enactment of this Act, the Chairman of the Joint \n     Chiefs of Staff shall certify to the congressional defense \n     committees that the Chairman has approved any requests for \n     forces, as of the date of the enactment of this Act, of a \n     commander of a combatant command to meet the security \n     requirements of land-based nuclear forces.\n       (b) Limitation.--Of the funds authorized to be appropriated \n     by this Act or otherwise made available for fiscal year 2017 \n     for the travel and representational expenses of the Under \n     Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and \n     Logistics, not more than 75 percent may be obligated or \n     expended until the date on which the Under Secretary \n     certifies to the congressional defense committees that there \n     is a competitive acquisition process in place to ensure that \n     a UH-1N replacement aircraft is under contract in fiscal year \n     2018.\n\n  Mr. ZINKE (during the reading). Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent \nthat the reading be dispensed with.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Montana?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the original request of the \ngentleman from Montana?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 732, the gentleman \nfrom Montana (Mr. Zinke) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Montana.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer an amendment that will \nensure that our servicemembers in the nuclear security forces have the \nability to do their job.\n  Each and every day, these men and women are tasked with the \nprotection of our nuclear weapons. This is not a mission that we can \nfail, and, thankfully, they have performed their mission successfully \nfor over half a decade.\n  Unfortunately, despite the gravity and importance of this mission, \nthese men and women must use Huey helicopters, UH-1s, that are in the \nVietnam-era. They must be able to respond anywhere in a 32,000-square-\nmile area, larger than the State of Maine, while using these \nhelicopters that are over 50 years old.\n  Air Force demonstrations performed at Minot Air Force Base have shown \ntime and time again that critical security shortages exist using these \nHueys, and they are problematic in mission success.\n  The Air Force and the Department of Defense have known this for over \na decade but, unfortunately, have consistently kicked the can down the \nroad.\n  My amendment ensures the replacement of the Huey aircraft is done \nnow. The mission of protecting our forces is too important to delay yet \nagain, and the Air Force and DOD, by their own tests, have proven its \nvulnerability.\n  This amendment ensures a full and open competition, but does not \nallow the Air Force to further delay replacement.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment, although I am not opposed to it.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. O'ROURKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Arizona (Mr. \nSchweikert).\n\n[[Page H2698]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SCHWEIKERT. Mr. Chairman, we had a technical issue earlier, and \nwe had reached out to my friend's office. I congratulate your staff. \nThey understood the mechanical issue. It was a procurement timing. It \nhas been taken care of with the amendment to the amendment, and so I \nwant to make sure anyone that is listening, that the concerns that were \nbeing brought up from my office have been dealt with.\n  We now are fully in support of the gentleman's amendment.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I yield to the gentleman from Alabama (Mr. \nRogers).\n  Mr. ROGERS of Alabama. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment, and I am as \nfrustrated as anybody that we are having to be here today.\n  Secretary Carter has often said, and I agree with him completely, \nthat the nuclear deterrent priority is our number one national security \nmission. But, unfortunately, that rhetoric has not matched up with the \ndecision on this issue coming from the Secretary's office.\n  The UH-1N fleet that is used by the Air Force Security Forces for the \nICBM field security consist of Vietnam-era helos.\n  The UH-1N program is a case study in a failed DOD acquisition \nprocess:\n  The first move to replace the helos was in 2004. The Joint Staff \nvalidated a military requirement in 2010;\n  The Air Force canceled the replacement program in 2011;\n  And the SecDef recently overruled the SecAF in conducting a sole \nsource replacement program, proposing instead a competition in 2018.\n  Admiral Haney, Commander, USSTRATCOM, stated in February, 2016: \n``Maintaining the security of our nuclear weapons requires a modern \nhelicopter with sufficient capabilities to counter both today's and \nfuture threats. The UH-1N does not fully meet the current ICBM complex \nsecurity requirements as outlined by DOD and USSTRATCOM.''\n  We have been warned, colleagues. Let me be clear. This is the \nsecurity of nuclear weapons here at home. There is no higher priority. \nIf we are going down the path of competition, that is fine; but we have \nno more time to waste.\n  I want to urge the gentleman's amendment be adopted.\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Chairman, I would like to say thank you to everyone \nfor working on this bill and doing slight amendments to ensure that we \nhave a fair and open competition but yet not delay the problem.\n  I think we can all understand that we need to replace the Hueys. The \nHueys are inaccurate. They have been inaccurate for a long time. The \nacquisition process yet again, as we have identified, is broke.\n  So I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to place this \nin importance. Our nuclear weapon and our arsenal needs to be \nprotected. We face an asymmetrical enemy, and ensuring that they are \nsafe at all times is part of what this Congress should be doing.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment, as modified, \noffered by the gentleman from Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  The amendment, as modified, was agreed to.\n  Mr. THORNBERRY. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nZinke) having assumed the chair, Mr. Hultgren, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 4909) to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2017 for military activities \nof the Department of Defense and for military construction, to \nprescribe military personnel strengths for such fiscal year, and for \nother purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "17"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/17/house-section/article/H2698-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2698]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.
