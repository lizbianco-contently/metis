HEROIN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, today on our calendar we have got about 10 \nbills dealing with a very serious issue in America: opioids and heroin. \nThis is an awful problem we have in our Nation. There is more and more \nuse of opioids and heroin and death resulting from it than at any time \nthat I can recall in the past.\n  I had a young friend a few years back who died of a heroin overdose. \nI have known of other promising young people in Memphis who have died \nof heroin overdoses. This is a problem all over the country, but \npredominantly in the northeast and predominantly in Caucasian areas. It \nhas become an issue, as it should, of importance. But none of the bills \nthat we are going to deal with today--all of which are good, and all of \nwhich I will support--deal with the real problem; and that is, the \nrecognition in our country that we treat all drugs as a law enforcement \nproblem, a criminal problem, and not as a health problem; and that we \ntreat most all drugs on the same level and give law enforcement the \nsame incentives to arrest dealers and/or users for any drug and not \nencourage them and give them reasons--besides public safety--to \nemphasize their enforcement on opioids and heroin.\n  In the drug schedules which we have in our country that lay out the \norder in which we think drugs are the most serious, Schedule I is at \nthe top; and in that classification are heroin, LSD, ecstasy, and \nmarijuana.\n  I ask you each not to answer reflexively which of those four don't \nfit. Marijuana does not fit.\n  Our laws should show that heroin is a serious problem and that \nmarijuana is not as serious a problem; that users should be dealt with \nin ways that don't put them in jail and, in the case of marijuana \npossession, don't cause them to lose scholarship opportunities, housing \nopportunities in Federal facilities, or jobs later on.\n  We also shouldn't have law enforcement, through asset forfeiture, get \nmoneys from people they arrest; fund their activities by making \narrests; and have it be presumed in law that moneys and/or properties \nthat are involved in the transactions of those drug deals are involved \nand that law enforcement gets to keep those items. It gives law \nenforcement a reason to go after marijuana--which is easier to find and \nmake money--rather than heroin.\n  We need to study marijuana to see what its medical uses are. We don't \nneed to use it to incarcerate and cripple for the future jobs for young \npeople. We need to encourage young people not to do any drugs at all, \nnot to do alcohol, not to smoke cigarettes, and to take their time as \nyouths to be youths, to be young, to learn, and to fill their minds \nwith knowledge for a better life later. But if, as a youth or as an \nadult, they should use an illegal substance, they should be dealt with \nas having a problem and not be given a scarlet letter that stays with \nthem for the rest of their lives.\n  So my work has been and will continue to be to try to make more sense \nof our drug laws; to see that the scheduling is smarter, that heroin \nand opioids continue to be at the top, and that marijuana is not in \nthat listing; and to do things that encourage law enforcement to arrest \npeople that are dealing in and selling heroin and opioids, which cause \ndeath and cause people to be addicted to the point where they will \ncommit crimes to secure moneys to keep their habit going, and to not \nhave equal incentives to go after marijuana that does none of those \nthings.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2161-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2161-H2162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        BABY BODY PARTS FOR SALE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Pitts) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. PITTS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to bring attention to the \nresearch that the Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives is \nconducting. I encourage everyone to examine the exhibits from the \nSelect Investigative Panel on Infant Lives' investigation on their Web \nsite: energycommerce.house.gov/select-investigative-panel.\n  On April 20, 2016, Chairman Marsha Blackburn held a hearing on the \n``Pricing of Fetal Tissue'' and found\n\n[[Page H2162]]\n\nbroad consensus among witnesses that Federal law may have been violated \nwhen abortion clinics profited from the sale of baby body parts.\n  This grave circumstance has caused considerable concern because one \nof the underpinnings and so-called safeguards of the statute that \nallowed for the donation of fetal tissue for transplantation and \nresearch was that this tissue would not be sold.\n  The author of the statute, former Congressman Henry Waxman, stated \nduring floor debate in 1993:\n  This amendment would enact the most important safeguards to prevent \nany sale of fetal issue for any purpose, not just the purpose of \nresearch. It would be abhorrent to allow for a sale of fetal tissue and \na market to be created for that sale.\n  Yet this is what is happening today.\n  As seen on Exhibit B2, the ``Procurement Business''--the name is \nredacted--markets itself in its brochure as a way for clinics to make \nadditional income by allowing procurement business technicians to \ncollect fetal tissue and organs from aborted babies immediately after \nan abortion is completed. The brochure uses the words ``financially \nprofitable,'' ``fiscally rewards,'' and ``financial benefit.''\n  The Select Investigative Panel on Infant Lives' investigation \nrevealed that the procurement business technician performs every \nconceivable task in the harvesting process immediately after an \nabortion occurs. However, procurement businesses--essentially the \nmiddlemen between the abortion clinics on the one hand and the end \nusers, the experimenters or researchers, on the other--still pay \nabortion clinics a fee, even though the clinics are not incurring any \nadditional costs in the process.\n  Exhibit D1 shows the abortion clinic charged the middleman $11,365 \nfor harvested baby parts--called POCs--and blood.\n  Exhibit D2 shows the abortion clinic charged the middleman, again, \nthis time $9,060 for harvested baby parts, or POCs, and blood, even \nthough the clinic did not incur any additional expense in the \nharvesting process. After obtaining the organs from the clinic, the \nmiddleman then made it easy for end users to purchase baby body parts.\n  Exhibit C3, the procurement business order form, or drop-down menu, \nfor baby organs, illustrates just how easy this is. On the left side of \nthe menu, one can choose: What type of tissue would you like to order? \nAnd under a multitude of options--a few of which are listed on the \nright--one could choose up here at the top, brains. These are little \nbaby brains. Next you must select the number of specimens. And I \nsuppose one could say six baby brains. Continuing down the list of \nquestions, gestational range from start to end? One can select 16 to 18 \nweeks.\n  Then it asks: Add another tissue type? One could answer yes and \nscroll through the numerous options and have the opportunity to pick, \nfor instance, female reproductive system and ovaries. You could then \nask for five of those at 15 to 16 weeks. Then you could add, down at \nthe bottom here, tongue.\n  So these are the options.\n  For crying out loud, this is the Amazon.com of baby body parts, a \nmarket for baby body parts. It is repulsive, outrageous, and I urge you \nto go to the Web site to see the exhibits.\n  This is a market for baby body parts where you get what you pay for.\n  This is utterly repulsive. Absolutely outrageous. Each one of these \nbaby tongues or baby brains belongs to a little human baby. This \nbusiness is nothing more than a fetal corpse market. How can anyone \ndefend such an abhorrent practice?\n  These exhibits illustrate that, in both intent and practice, these \nclinics make money well above any actual costs they incur. They are \nmaking a profit. Go to the Select Panel's website \nenergycommerce.house.gov/select-investigative-panel and see for \nyourself the revealing exhibits that show how these organizations may \nhave broken the law and profited from this gruesome, inhumane practice \nof baby body part harvesting and trafficking.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2162-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2162]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              URGING BOEING NOT TO SELL AIRPLANES TO IRAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Roskam) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ROSKAM. Mr. Speaker, I am very concerned about some news that has \ncome to my attention and to the attention of the House recently, and \nthat is that there is an iconic American aviation company--that is, the \nBoeing Company--that that has entered into preliminary talks with Iran. \nAnd the thinking is for Boeing to sell planes to Iran.\n  I guess when you first hear about that, you say: Well, what is the \nbig deal? Why is everybody so uptight about this? Why can't everybody \nrelax and just let some commerce happen?\n  Here is what is the big deal; here is why we ought not relax; and \nhere is why Boeing shouldn't be in these discussions; and, ultimately, \nit is my sincere hope, Mr. Speaker, that Boeing does not sell planes to \nthe Iranians:\n  The entire Washington foreign policy establishment; that is, the \nHouse of Representatives, the Senate, the United States State \nDepartment, and the administration all agree on one thing. They all \nagree that Iran is still the world's leading state sponsor of terror.\n  There is no credible organization; there is no credible voice today \nthat says: No, no, no. That is not true anymore. In fact, the President \nhas acknowledged this; the Secretary of State has acknowledged this; \nthe national security adviser has acknowledged this.\n  And if that is true--and it is true--how can someone, how can a \ncompany, how can an American institution say, we are going to do \nbusiness with them? And how can it be true that we are going to sell \nsomething that can be easily converted for the use of terrorism?\n  You see, planes are fungible. Airplane parts are fungible. Unless we \nthink that only Boeing is beginning these sorts of discussions--we know \nwhat Airbus is doing. Airbus has made a decision to go in and do \nbusiness with this terrorist regime.\n  Why I am urging these companies--and particularly Boeing, as an \niconic American company, as a company that has come to symbolize what? \nAmerican strength, American innovation, and American greatness. And \nthen to be complicit with the Iranians and the sheer possibility and, I \nwould argue, probability that those airplanes will be converted to \nwarplanes.\n  Now, just so I am clear, I am not making an argument nor a suggestion \ntoday that Boeing is doing anything illegal. I am not making that \nargument.\n  But here is my point: just because something is legal doesn't make it \ngood; just because something is legal doesn't make it right.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  There are some people who are saying: Well, look, other manufacturers \nare selling into that marketplace. And let me ask you this, Mr. \nSpeaker. When has history ever been kind to the excuse: Well, somebody \nelse was doing it, so I decided to do it too? History, Mr. Speaker, is \na merciless judge and disciplinarian against that sort of argument.\n  So what is the problem? Here is the problem. It is the Islamic \nRevolutionary Guard Corps that completely dominates the Iranian \neconomy, and they certainly completely dominate the aviation sector of \nthe economy. Iran Air was recently taken off the terrorist watch list \nby the State Department. Most people think that it was an agreement \nthrough the Iran nuclear deal and that it wasn't really deserved, but \nthey were only recently on it. Regardless, the fungibility of these \nproducts can easily move into other areas of the sector.\n  There are some people that say: Look, it is an emerging market and we \nought to be selling American products there. No, Mr. Speaker. What we \nought to do is recognize that there are things that are more important \nthan American profits, and that is the integrity of American businesses \nnot to be complicit in this shameful activity and to sort of draw a \nblind eye towards this activity to say we can somehow sell these \nproducts and they won't end up in the hands of terrorists. It is naive, \nit is a wrongheaded move, and I urge Boeing in the strongest possible \nterms not to be complicit in this activity.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2162-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2162-H2163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          HONORING BILL KNAPP\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Iowa \n(Mr. Young) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Iowa. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor of the U.S. House \nof\n\n[[Page H2163]]\n\nRepresentatives to recognize and honor the accomplishments of an \nindividual who exemplifies what it means to be an Iowan, to be an \nAmerican.\n  Bill Knapp is being honored by the Van Meter High School Booster Club \nand American Legion Post 403 as an Iowa hero and legend, and it is for \ngood reason. Bill has given much to the community. He spent his life \ngiving back. Throughout his life, his career, and his philanthropic \nefforts, he has demonstrated, and continues to demonstrate, a \ncommitment to our State and our country, to people.\n  Bill was born in 1926 and grew up on a farm in Allerton in southern \nIowa. Growing up in Allerton was where Bill first learned the value of \na hard day's work, of an earned day's pay. He learned the value of \nmaking do with less, anticipating the needs of others, and helping \nthose less fortunate. He learned self-sacrifice, honesty, and \nintegrity. He has carried with him these Iowa values throughout his \nlife.\n  Bill turned 17 in 1944. Observing World War II from quite a distance \nin Iowa, this young man heard the call to serve our country. He did not \nignore that call; he answered it. He convinced his parents to sign off \non his enlistment into the United States Navy.\n  In the spring of 1945, Bill took part in the Battle of Okinawa as a \ncoxswain on the USS Catron. Alongside many others from across the \ncountry, Bill bravely served. And unlike many of these gentlemen who \nwere with him who didn't come back, Bill returned home.\n  After 2 years in the U.S. Navy and the end of the Second World War, \nBill returned to Allerton. He took business courses, took to real \nestate, rolled up his sleeves, got to work, and soon formed Iowa \nRealty. Under Bill's leadership, Iowa Realty grew, prospered, and \nbecame the largest real estate company in Iowa.\n  Bill has had some tremendous successes, but he has never forgotten \nhis Iowa values. Instead, he continues to embody what it means to be an \nIowan. His selflessness and willingness to give back is evident in \neverything that he continues to do. He is known statewide. He is known \nnationally for his philanthropic efforts, as well as his special \ncommitment to Iowa. He has placed a strong emphasis on helping to turn \nIowa's capital city, beautiful Des Moines, into the thriving metropolis \nwe see today.\n  I imagine I speak for many when I say how incredibly grateful I am \nfor Bill's donation of land to our State, which was used for Iowa's \nfirst and only veterans cemetery in Van Meter. Thanks to Bill's \ngenerosity, our veterans in Iowa, who have so selflessly served our \ncountry, have a final resting place. It is truly hallowed ground. We, \nas Iowans, have a place to honor our country's heroes.\n  But his generosity to Iowa's veterans didn't stop. He was \ninstrumental in the creation of the Veterans Reception Center in Van \nMeter, where families and friends gather and pay their respects \nfollowing the burial of a loved one or friend. It has helped bring the \ncommunity of Van Meter, my hometown, together.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is an honor to represent Iowans like Bill in the \nUnited States Congress. He is generous, he is thoughtful, he doesn't \nforget where he came from, and he has spent a lifetime embodying Iowan \nvalues. He has given so much, he continues to give selflessly, and he \nputs others before himself in ways that we will probably never know. \nBut that is okay if we don't know. He gives because it is the right \nthing to do. He is a humble soul with a big heart.\n  I ask that my colleagues in the United States House of \nRepresentatives join me in honoring Bill, an Iowa hero and legend.\n  Thank you and congratulations, Bill. We are proud of you.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2163-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2163]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

It is this body \nthat brings us together as a Congress to act to protect Americans in \ntheir moment of greatest need. Yet, Republicans in Congress fail to do \ntheir job.\n  My bill, the Families of Flint Act, would provide relief evenly \ndivided between the Federal and State government. No hearings in \ncommittee, no votes on the floor of the House of Representatives. The \nAmerican people deserve a Congress that will do its job and will act on \ntheir interests.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask that we immediately take up my bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2164-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               HOUSTON FIRE DEPARTMENT ANSWERS THE ALARM\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, last Thursday, a chemical warehouse in \nmy Texas district exploded into a startling inferno. Fiery containers \nof chemicals shot into the air like rockets. The smoke and heat were \nintense. But the Houston Fire Department quickly answered the alarm.\n  Mr. Speaker, over 200 firefighters from 32 fire stations responded to \nthe hellish inferno. Spring Branch Elementary and nearby homes were \nevacuated. But the smoke and fire were conquered. The school and homes \nwere saved. Not one person was injured.\n  Mr. Speaker, firefighters are a special breed. They risk their lives \nto save our lives. They restore order from chaos. These firefighters \nare to be thanked and appreciated. Firefighter courage and dedication \nto protecting us is part of what makes them a special breed.\n  While others flee in haste of impending danger, the firefighter, with \nsirens, red lights, horns, red and white trucks, charge into the jaws \nof heat, smoke, and fire to defeat and conquer danger.\n  Mr. Speaker, Houston firefighters answered the alarm--they always \nanswer the alarm.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2164-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                SALUTING HOUSTON MAYOR SYLVESTER TURNER\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise to salute a caring mayor, the \nmayor of the city of Houston, Mayor Sylvester Turner.\n  Over the last couple of months, which is the first of his term, many \nchallenges have confronted his administration, one of which was the \nterrible, devastating floods of mid-April when so many thousands, many \nof them mothers and children, were displaced in my congressional \ndistrict. Because of those terrible storms, $400 million of cars were \nlost, people lost their jobs, and businesses were destroyed.\n  Mayor Turner continued to be that caring, steady hand working across \npolitical lines, working with the county judge, working with council \nmembers, and the Federal Government. One thing that he steadily did was \nlisten to the council and the advice of his staff as I sat in meetings, \ntaking ideas, establishing a relief fund, joining now with the Osteens \nin Lakewood, and having this wonderful concert to continue to provide \nrelief, but yet showing the caring and loving nurturing of a father.\n  In the midst of all of this, he lost a dear brother, a Vietnam vet. \nBut steady, strong, and determined, he continued to nurture those who \ncould not help themselves.\n  What a pleasure to be able to work with a mayor, one who is ready to \nlisten and to be able to answer the concerns of a constituency, but \nmake hard decisions.\n  I salute you, Mayor Turner, as someone who cares about our city, and \nworks with all of us to make their lives better and our city the best.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2164-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2164]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              ONLY 6 PERCENT OF AMERICANS TRUST THE MEDIA\n\n  (Mr. SMITH of Texas asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. SMITH of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Americans' confidence in the \nnational media continues to erode.\n  A Media Insight Project poll found that only 6 percent now say they \nhave a great deal of confidence in the media. Americans are rightfully \nskeptical of the news they receive, as they believe it is riddled with \ninaccuracies and bias.\n  Nearly 90 percent say it is important for the media to get their \nfacts correct in their news reports, which they often do not. Many said \nthe media coverage of a particular event was one-sided. One respondent \ncommented that, ``I'm also a bit scared for what other things they have \ngotten wrong or only given half-truths to.''\n  Media bias is both real and unfortunate.

SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Fallen Heroes Flag Act of \n     2016''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``Capitol-flown flag'' means a flag of the \n     United States flown over the Capitol in honor of the deceased \n     individual for whom the flag is requested;\n       (2) the terms ``chaplain'', ``firefighter'', ``law \n     enforcement officer'', ``member of a rescue squad or \n     ambulance crew'', and ``public agency'' have the meanings \n     given such terms in section 1204 of the Omnibus Crime Control \n     and Safe Streets Act of 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3796b);\n       (3) the term ``immediate family member'', with respect to \n     an individual, means--\n\n[[Page H2165]]\n\n       (A) the spouse, parent, brother, sister, or child of the \n     individual or a person to whom the individual stands in loco \n     parentis; or\n       (B) any other person related to the individual by blood or \n     marriage;\n       (4) the term ``public safety officer'' means an individual \n     serving a public agency in an official capacity, with or \n     without compensation, as a law enforcement officer, as a \n     firefighter, or as a chaplain; and\n       (5) the term ``Representative'' includes a Delegate or \n     Resident Commissioner to the Congress.\n\n     SEC. 3. PROVIDING CAPITOL-FLOWN FLAGS FOR FAMILIES OF FALLEN \n                   HEROES.\n\n       (a) In General.--At the request of an immediate family \n     member of a firefighter, law enforcement officer, member of a \n     rescue squad or ambulance crew, or public safety officer who \n     died in the line of duty, the Representative or Senator of \n     the family may provide to the family a Capitol-flown flag, \n     together with the certificate described in subsection (c).\n       (b) No Cost to Family.--A Capitol-flown flag provided under \n     this section shall be provided at no cost to the family.\n       (c) Certificate.--The certificate described in this \n     subsection is a certificate which is signed by the Speaker of \n     the House of Representatives and the Representative, or the \n     President pro tempore of the Senate and the Senator, \n     providing the Capitol-flown flag, as applicable, and which \n     contains an expression of sympathy for the family involved \n     from the House of Representatives or the Senate, as \n     applicable.\n\n     SEC. 4. REGULATIONS AND PROCEDURES.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 30 days after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Architect of the Capitol shall \n     issue regulations for carrying out this Act, including \n     regulations to establish procedures (including any \n     appropriate forms, guidelines, and accompanying certificates) \n     for requesting a Capitol-flown flag.\n       (b) Review.--The regulations issued under subsection (a) \n     shall take effect upon approval by the Committee on House \n     Administration of the House of Representatives and the \n     Committee on Rules and Administration of the Senate.\n\n     SEC. 5.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Nugent) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous matter in the Record on the consideration of this \nbill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of S. 2755, the Fallen Heroes \nFlag Act. The bill before us would allow Members of Congress to honor \nour heroes with a United States flag flown over this Capitol. These \nbrave individuals include firefighters, law enforcement officers, and \nmembers of rescue squads and ambulance crews. The measure gives us the \nopportunity to express our Nation's gratitude towards those who have \nanswered the call to serve and protect our communities.\n  Our Nation's flag flown in their honor would also include a \ncongressional certificate signed by both the Speaker of the House and \nthe individual's Representative or the President pro tempore of the \nSenate and the Senator who is providing the flag for the family.\n  When most people are running away from danger, our Nation's first \nresponders run towards it. Whether it is a firefighter rushing into a \nburning building, an EMT responding at high speed to save someone's \nlife, or a police officer pursuing a routine traffic stop, the job puts \nthese individuals in harm's way on a daily basis.\n  As our local communities know all too well, in far too many cases, \nbrave men and women have paid the ultimate sacrifice to keep us safe in \nAmerica. I stand here today with my colleagues to thank each responder \nfor their service and dedication to their communities. They answer our \ncalls for help. As an institution and as a nation, it is right for us \nto remember the sacrifice and honor that these individuals make for \nAmerica's families.\n  As a 38-year veteran of law enforcement myself, it is a special honor \nto be able to stand here today and usher this legislation forward. I \nwant to thank all of those who helped make this possible.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from Florida, a former sheriff \nhimself.\n  I rise today in strong support of S. 2755, the Fallen Heroes Flag Act \nof 2016.\n  I want to thank, also, Congressman Peter King, who has been a strong \nsupporter of the first responder community and for championing this \nissue for many, many years. I want to thank Senator Roy Blunt and \nSenator Chuck Schumer for helping move this bill through the Senate.\n  This bipartisan legislation will create a program to provide flags \nflown over the United States Capitol to the family members of public \nsafety officers who are killed in the line of duty at no cost to the \nfamily.\n  Our first responders make tremendous sacrifices to keep our \ncommunities safe. Should one of those brave men or women make the \nultimate sacrifice, the least we can do to recognize their \ncontributions to society, show our gratitude for their service, and \nexpress our sympathy to their families for their loss is present them \nwith a flag flown over the United States Capitol.\n  This bill has the strong support of the National Fraternal Order of \nPolice and the Sergeants Benevolent Association.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this \nbipartisan legislation so we can send it on to the President for his \nsignature.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the co-chair of law enforcement issues in the \nCongress, I cannot support this enough. This is a very important piece \nof legislation and will do a lot in terms of goodwill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUGENT. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from New Jersey for his support. We in \nlaw enforcement--and I still say ``we in law enforcement''--do \nappreciate it any time Congress reaches out and does something positive \nfor our law enforcement families, even though it is after the fact.\n  This is one of those times where, as sheriff, I had to preside over \nin-the-line-of-duty deaths. As a rookie police officer outside of \nChicago, my first year on the job, one of the guys that I went to the \nacademy with was shot and killed. I moved to Florida and became a \ndeputy sheriff and rose up the ranks to sheriff.\n  One of the things that I always worried about as a father and as a \nhusband was: What am I leaving to my family? How are they going to be \ntaken care of in the future? And what is going on in this country today \nin regards to belittling law enforcement? Trust me, we make mistakes, \nand I think that reasonable people understand that; but when you \ncondemn a whole profession, it is unconscionable.\n  I think this is the type of thing that we need to do. I do appreciate \nthis is very bipartisan in nature and that it is really lifting up all \nof our first responders. We think back to 9/11, when those firemen and \npolice officers rushed into the Twin Towers and those that lost their \nlives as others were leaving the towers toward safety. They did the \nunthinkable, and that is to rush into a burning building. Or they rush \nin somewhere where they know there is an armed intruder. They do it on \na daily basis. They don't ask for much, but we as Members of Congress \nreally stand up for them and their families by this simple act.\n  This is not a huge, huge thing, but I will tell you what; to a \ngrieving family, it is a small token of the appreciation that the \nUnited States of America, this Congress and the Senate, can bestow on a \nfamily in their deepest sorrow. It is not going to bring back their \nloved one, but I will tell you, they are going to look at that flag and \nremember the\n\n[[Page H2166]]\n\nfallen and how great a person they were.\n  So it is not just what we do today; it is really about what has \nhappened. The gentleman from New Jersey talked about the Senate; and \nMr. King, from this House, from New York, moved this legislation \nthrough. It has been a pleasure to stand here today, to come here today \nand talk for all those who can't talk for themselves; they can't speak \nfor themselves.\n  My 38 years in law enforcement was probably the best time of my life \nbecause I was actually doing something and protecting people on a \nregular basis. I can't think of a greater honor than to fly a flag of \nthis Nation over this Capitol and give that to the grieving family of a \nfallen first responder. Mr. Speaker, knowing that this institution is \nbehind them, so stand the American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I \nyield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of S. 2755, the \n``Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2016,'' which allows Members and Senators, \nat the request of an immediate family member of a fallen emergency \nresponder, to have a flag flown above the United States Capitol in \ntheir memory.\n  As a senior member of the House Committee on Homeland Security, I am \nintimately aware, as are my colleagues, of the great sacrifices made by \nour emergency responders.\n  This is why I am proud that earlier this Congress the House passed \nH.R. 2795, the FRIENDS Act, which I introduced.\n  I introduced the FRIENDS Act because it embodied the important and \nfundamental idea that we have an obligation to ensure that the first \nresponders who protect our loved ones in emergencies, have the peace of \nmind that comes from knowing that their loved ones are safe while they \ndo their duty.\n  S. 2755 and the FRIENDS Act embody the spirit of bipartisanship that \nis needed in this Congress.\n  These brave men and women who risk everything by running towards \ndanger should be honored by this Congress by streamlining the process \nto have a flag flown above the U.S. Capitol in their memory.\n  Let us not forget the 15 brave volunteer firefighters who perished in \nthe city of West, Texas, in 2013 when a fertilizer plant exploded.\n  This tragedy serves as a reminder of the risks and dangers undertaken \neach day by our firefighters and other first responders to keep us \nsafe.\n  Since 1996 in the city of Houston there have been 20 firefighters \nthat have lost their lives protecting others.\n  They are District Chief Ruben Lopez, Firefighter Steven C. Mayfield, \nFirefighter Lewis E. Mayo III, Firefighter Kimberly A. Smith, Captain \nJay Paul Jahnke, Probationary Firefighter Kevin Wayne Kulow, Captain \nGrady Don Burke, Assistant Chief David Louis Moore, Captain James \nArthur Harlow Sr., Captain Damion Jon Hobbs, Cadet Firefighter Cohnway \nMatthew Johnson, Captain Thomas William Dillion, Engineer Operator \nRobert Ryan Bebee, Firefighter/EMT Robert Herman Garner, IV, Captain \nMatthew Rena Renaud, Firefighter Anne McCormick Sullivan, Firefighter \nDaniel D Groover, Captain Dwight ``B.B.'' W Bazile, Firefighter Richard \nJ Cano, and Cadet Steven Whitfield II.\n  Since 1860, 109 Houston Police officers have fallen in the line of \nduty.\n  In 2015 officer Richard K. Martin was killed when he was \nintentionally struck with a car when he was laying down spike strips \nduring a pursuit.\n  I have on many occasions requested that U.S. Flags be flown above the \nCapitol in the memory of fallen first responders and presented them to \nthe family members.\n  First responders are called to serve and few outside of their ranks \ncan understand why they do the work that they do each day placing their \nlives in harm's way to save a stranger.\n  The greatest example of the selflessness of first responders was the \nhundreds of fire fighters, law enforcement officers, emergency \nmanagement service personnel, port authority workers, and federal \nofficers and agents who rushed into the Twin Towers on September 11th \n2001, to save lives.\n  On that terrible day 366 first responders sacrificed their lives so \nothers may live.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support S. 2755 because this bill streamlines the \nprocess to have a flag flown in the memory of the fallen emergency \nresponders in this country.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Nugent) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, S. 2755.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2166-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2166-H2172]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n PROMOTING RESPONSIBLE OPIOID MANAGEMENT AND INCORPORATING SCIENTIFIC \n                             EXPERTISE ACT\n\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend or add \nany extraneous material to their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4063, as amended, the \nPromoting Responsible Opioid Management and Incorporating Scientific \nExpertise--or the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE--Act.\n  When our Nation's servicemembers transition from military life to \ncivilian life, they carry with them the skills, experiences, memories, \nand relationships that will last a lifetime. Unfortunately, many of \nthem also carry significant pain as a result of injuries that they \nincurred while in service to this great Nation.\n  Veterans, in general, experience chronic pain at a higher rate than \ntheir nonveteran counterparts. What is more, chronic pain is one of the \nmost frequent conditions facing the veterans of Iraq and Afghanistan.\n  Effectively managing this pain, which often occurs alongside a number \nof other comorbid conditions, is a challenge for which the Department \nof Veterans Affairs has been increasingly turning to opioid-based \nmedications to meet that challenge.\n  Now, while opioids, when used appropriately, can be effective in \ntreating pain, opioid medications are extremely high risk. \nUnfortunately, VA's own research has found that veterans are at an \nincreased risk for many adverse outcomes that may accompany opioid use, \nincluding substance abuse, overdose, and self-inflicted injuries.\n  Given that, VA's recent reliance on opioid medications to manage \nveteran pain is alarming. According to a CBS News report on VA data, \nthe number of opioid prescriptions written by VA providers rose an \nastonishing 259 percent from 2002 to 2013. During that same time \nperiod, VA's total patient population increased only 29 percent.\n  The sad reality behind an overreliance on opioids became apparent at \nthe VA Medical Center at Tomah, Wisconsin, last year. In response to a \nseries of complaints made in 2011 and 2012, the VA Office of the \nInspector General conducted a review of alleged inappropriate \nprescribing of controlled substances and abuse of authority at the \nTomah VA Medical Center. The IG found that the number of opioids \nprescribed in Tomah was ``at considerable variance'' with the other VA \nmedical facilities in that region and was a cause for ``potentially \nserious concerns.''\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  It is no wonder that the veterans being treated in Tomah commonly \nreferred to it as ``Candy Land'' and to the facility chief of staff as \nthe ``Candy Man.'' Jason Simcakoski was one veteran who was being \ntreated by the Tomah VA Medical Center.\n  In August of 2014, Jason died from the combined effect of the \nmultiple prescription medications he received as an in-patient. He put \nhis trust in a system that ultimately failed him.\n  He left behind a young daughter and a grieving family, some of whom \nare with us today. Unfortunately, the failures in Tomah, the failures \nthat led to Jason's death, are not isolated. There are countless others \njust like him in the VA across this country.\n  Chronic pain and the conditions that frequently accompany it are \nundoubtedly complex, and concerns about an overreliance on opioids are \ncertainly not unique to the Department of Veterans Affairs.\n  But the VA alone has the responsibility to treat our Nation's most \nheroic citizens, meaning VA does have a unique responsibility to act \nresponsibly.\n  The bill before us would help the Department do just that by \nimproving and expanding opioid safety initiatives, strengthening the \nVA/Department of Defense joint working group on pain management, \nmandating that VA medical facilities disclose information to State-\ncontrolled substance monitoring programs, and requiring VA review, \ninvestigate, and report on the use of opioids among veteran patients.\n  The manager's amendment to H.R. 4063 would require the Department and \nDOD to update their joint clinical practice guidelines for the \nmanagement of opioid therapy to reflect the latest medical practices.\n  The bill would also direct VA to ensure that every employee who \nprescribes opioids receives education and training on pain management \nand safe prescribing practices and every VA medical facility has a \ndesignated pain management team.\n  It would further require VA to maximize the availability of Food and \nDrug Administration-approved opioid receptor antagonists to ensure that \nveterans most at risk of opioid overdose have access to and training on \npotentially life-saving drugs that can counter the devastating effects \nof an opioid overdose.\n  I am grateful to the vice chairman of the full Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee, Gus Bilirakis, for sponsoring this legislation. I urge all \nof my colleagues to join me in supporting it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Committee on Armed Services,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 9, 2016.\n     Hon. Jeff Miller,\n     Chairman, Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman: I am writing to you concerning the bill \n     H.R. 4063, the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act. There are \n     certain provisions in the legislation which fall within the \n     Rule X jurisdiction of the Committee on Armed Services.\n       In the interest of permitting your committee to proceed \n     expeditiously to floor consideration of this important bill, \n     I am willing to waive this committee's right to sequential \n     referral. I do so with the understanding that by waiving \n     consideration of the bill the Committee on Armed Services \n     does not waive any future jurisdictional claim over the \n     subject matters contained in the bill which fall within its \n     Rule X jurisdiction. I request that you urge the Speaker to \n     name members of this committee to any conference committee \n     which is named to consider such provisions.\n       Please place this letter into the committee report on H.R. \n     4063 and into the Congressional Record during consideration \n     of the\n\n[[Page H2170]]\n\n     measure on the House floor. Thank you for the cooperative \n     spirit in which you have worked regarding this matter and \n     others between our respective committees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                    William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                               Committee on Veterans' Affairs,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2016.\n     Hon. William M. ``Mac'' Thornberry,\n     Chairman, Committee on Armed Services,\n     House of Representatives, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman, Thank you for your letter regarding H.R. \n     4063, as amended, the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act.\n       I agree that the Committee on Armed Services has valid \n     jurisdictional claims to certain provisions in this \n     legislation and I appreciate your decision not to request a \n     referral in the interest of expediting consideration of the \n     bill.\n       I agree that by foregoing a sequential referral to H.R. \n     4063, as amended, the Committee on Armed Services is not \n     waiving its jurisdiction.\n       This exchange of letters will be included in the \n     Committee's report on H.R. 4063, as amended.\n       If you have any further questions or concerns, please \n     contact Christine Hill, Staff Director for the Subcommittee \n     on Health.\n       Thank you for your commitment to the well-being of our \n     nation's veterans.\n       With warm personal regards, I am,\n           Sincerely,\n                                                      Jeff Miller,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 4063, as amended, the \nJason Simcakoski PROMISE Act.\n  I would like to thank my friend from Florida, the vice chair of the \ncommittee, Congressman Gus Bilirakis, for introducing this bill and for \nhis passionate leadership on this very important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also would like to take a moment to thank Chairman \nMiller for his extraordinary leadership on this bill and on issues that \npertain to veterans generally. I thank the chairman so much for all of \nhis work. In fact, the rumor among our colleagues is that he runs the \nmost bipartisan committee on Capitol Hill. I thank him for his \nleadership.\n  The epidemic of opioid addiction and overdose deaths is a national \nproblem. It is a public health crisis, Mr. Speaker, that affects \nconstituents living in all of our districts and all of our States.\n  Opioid use disorder is a chronic relapsing disease of the brain. Yet, \nthe stigma associated with opioid use disorder keeps people from \nseeking, accessing, or maintaining treatment.\n  In 2014, according to The New York Times, over 47,000 people died \nfrom a drug overdose. That is 125 Americans each day who lost their \nlives due to addiction or abuse. Of these, more than 61 percent \ninvolved opioids.\n  Across the country, Mr. Speaker, nearly 260 million prescriptions are \nwritten for opioids, enough, according to the Centers for Disease \nControl, for every American adult to have their own bottle of pills \nthat can be highly, highly addictive.\n  In my home State of North Carolina, fatal drug overdoses have jumped \n75 percent since 2002. According to an article in February from The \nCharlotte Observer, nearly half of the accidental drug overdose deaths \nin 2010 were associated with prescriptions that had been filled within \n60 days of death.\n  It is estimated that North Carolina has spent over $582 million in \nhealthcare costs stemming from opioid abuse. This is nearly $59 for \neach man, woman, and child in my home State of North Carolina. This is \na healthcare problem, Mr. Speaker, that affects all levels of our \nsociety. One of the main drivers is the overprescription of opioids to \nmanage pain.\n  Veterans are at an even greater risk. The statistics on veterans \nexperiencing chronic pain are absolutely staggering. Over 50 percent of \nall veterans enrolled and receiving care at VA medical facilities \nexperience chronic pain, with over half a million veterans managing \npain with prescribed opioids. Compared to the general population, \nveterans are prescribed opioids at a much, much higher rate.\n  But there is a growing awareness that the long-term prescription of \nopioids to manage chronic pain can have severe and sometimes tragic--\nyes, tragic--consequences. It has been reported that veterans, our \nbeloved veterans, are twice as likely to die from accidental overdose \ncompared to nonveterans.\n  As a Member of Congress that represents the ``Nation's Most Military \nFriendly State''--and we like to say that all of the time--and as an \nArmy veteran, as I am myself, I am alarmed and committed to bringing \nabout a solution.\n  But addressing this crisis will not be easy. The Veterans' Affairs \nCommittee members know that so very well. It is not going to be easy. \nIt will take the work of all of us working together. It will take \neducation. It will take research into more effective and less addictive \nways to treat chronic pain.\n  It will take the combined work, Mr. Speaker, of our States and the \nFederal Government to address what the CDC has termed ``the worst drug \naddiction epidemic in the country's history,'' and the chief medical \nofficer of my State's medical board has called it ``an unequivocal \nhealth crisis.''\n  This bill, Mr. Speaker, we are debating today marks a major step \nforward, and it will go a very long way in helping to lessen this \npublic health emergency.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Bilirakis) of the 12th District of Florida, \nthe vice chairman of the full committee, somebody who has been a \nstalwart on this and many other veteran issues.\n  Mr. BILIRAKIS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember. I appreciate it.\n  I rise in support of my bill, H.R. 4063, the Promoting Responsible \nOpioid Management and Incorporating Scientific Expertise, or the Jason \nSimcakoski PROMISE Act.\n  This important bill helps us fulfill our promise to past, current, \nand future veterans, our true American heroes, Mr. Speaker.\n  I introduced the PROMISE Act in response to the tragic death of \nMarine Corps Corporal Jason Simcakoski at the Tomah, Wisconsin, VA \nMedical Center.\n  Jason's death, caused by a mixed drug toxicity and the combination of \nvarious medications, was an avoidable tragedy. My colleagues and I \nworked with local veterans, veterans organizations, and other \nstakeholders to get this done right.\n  I am honored to discuss the need for this bill in the presence of \nJason's family, who join us in the Capitol on this memorable day. We \ncould not do it without them.\n  The PROMISE Act can't bring Jason and others like him back. But, like \nJason's family expressed to me, this will ensure future veterans get \nthe treatment they need for their physical and invisible wounds.\n  Currently, VA treatment for chronic pain is largely the prescription \nof opioids without consideration of a patient's personal history or \npreferences. Unfortunately, there is a lack of data on veteran opioid \nuse. There are also inefficiencies in the VA identifying abuse of \nopioids and with patient follow-up to determine effectiveness of these \ndrugs on a case-by-case basis.\n  The PROMISE Act is the congressional action needed to rectify these \nproblems. The PROMISE Act increases safety for opioid therapy and pain \nmanagement, ensures more transparency at the VA, and encourages more \noutreach and awareness of the patient advocacy program for veterans.\n  My bill also acknowledges that VA patient services do not stop at the \ninitial consultation. It requires the VA to maintain realtime tracking \nof data on opioid use to help prevent overmedication and misuse or \noveruse of medication.\n  I want to thank Speaker Ryan; Representative Butterfield, of course; \nour great chairman, Mr. Miller from Florida, a real good friend of \nmine; Representative Kind, Representative Rice, and many others who \nsupported this bill and worked to make this happen.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill to uphold our commitment \nand promise to those that pay the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Kind), and I thank Mr. Kind for \ncoming to the floor. There is not a Member of this body who works \nharder than him on issues that pertain to veterans.\n\n[[Page H2171]]\n\n  (Mr. KIND asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. KIND. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good friend from North Carolina for \nyielding me this time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE \nAct.\n  Jason was a veteran who unfortunately saw his life end way too soon \nwhile receiving treatment at the Tomah VA Medical Center in the heart \nof my congressional district.\n  I want to thank, first of all, Subcommittee Chairman Bilirakis for \nthe leadership and support that he has shown this legislation. He has \nbeen a real joy to work with.\n  I want to thank Chairman Miller for the leadership he has provided \nthe committee and for the concern and the attention that he has given \nto all of our veterans throughout our country.\n  I want to thank Representative Butterfield and the other members of \nthe committee for the strong bipartisan support that this legislation \nenjoys on the floor today.\n  Jason was born in Stevens Point, Wisconsin, in 1978 in my \ncongressional district. He is the son of Marvin and Linda Simcakoski. \nHe is a graduate of Stevens Point Pacelli High School.\n  Shortly after his graduation, he joined the Marine Corps, where he \nreached the rank of corporal, receiving the Sea Service Deployment \nRibbon with one star, a Certificate of Commendation, the Rifle Sharp \nShooters Badge, and the Good Conduct Medal. He was honorably discharged \nin February of 2002. Jason loved being a marine, and he was very proud \nto serve his country.\n  He married Heather in 2010 in Stevens Point, and they had a beautiful \ndaughter named Anaya. I am proud that many members of Jason's family \ncame out to Washington this week to see the passage of this bill today: \nhis mother Linda, his wife Heather, his daughter Anaya, who are in the \nChamber with us today. His father, Marvin, who was also intimately \ninvolved in helping draft this legislation and see it through, was \nunfortunately unable to attend.\n  But I commend all of them because this is how legislation is meant to \nwork, by reaching out to veterans organizations, getting direct \nfeedback from the veterans themselves, their families, healthcare \nproviders. We have known for some time that we have had a pain \nmanagement problem not just in the VA medical system, but throughout \nour entire healthcare system.\n  This unfortunately came to light through numerous investigations at \nthe Tomah VA Medical Center over the course of the last few years, \nwhich ultimately helped and precipitated the legislation that we have \nbefore us today.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Jason's family's guiding star in all of this, based on the numerous \nconversations that I have had with them and that they have had with \nChairman Bilirakis and even with Speaker Ryan, was to ensure that the \ncare and the treatment that our veterans receive be enhanced so that no \nveteran and no family would have to go through and endure what they \ndid.\n  Jason was receiving pain management and was under the opioid \nmedication at Tomah. This legislation, I think, advances that goal. I \ndon't think anyone can be here with absolute certitude and promise a \nfamily or future veterans that mistakes won't happen in the future; but \nI think what is contained in this legislation is a significant step in \nthe right direction, with the understanding that more work is needed.\n  The bill would require a review and an update of the VA's Clinical \nPractice Guideline for the Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic \nPain. It requires all opioid prescribers at the VA to have enhanced \npain management and safe opioid prescribing education and training. It \nimproves the realtime tracking of and access to data on the opioid use \nof veterans in order to prevent overmedication. It provides additional \nresources to assist the VA's ability to counter overdoses. It expands \nthe Opioid Safety Initiative to all VA medical facilities. It updates \nthe Joint Working Group of the VA and DOD to focus on opioid \nprescribing practices, the use of alternative pain therapy, and the \ncoordination when a servicemember transitions from the DOD into the VA \ncare setting. It also encourages the use of alternative and \ncomplementary forms of pain management. Lastly, it requires the VA to \nreport on prescription rates so we can better assess the problem and \nfind solutions.\n  This is a work in progress not just within the VA system, not just \nwith the reforms that are currently being implemented at the Tomah VA \nMedical Center in my congressional district, but throughout the entire \nhealthcare system. We as a Nation have not done a very good job of \nmanaging pain at all levels. I am glad and I am proud that this \nCongress sees the need to move forward on a comprehensive opioid \nlegislation bill. Hopefully we can get that to the finish line yet this \nyear. There is also a major VA reform bill that we are working on--\nexcellent vehicles in order to include some of the provisions of this \nlegislation as we move forward.\n  If there is any hope and promise that out of the tragedy of Jason's \ndeath good things can come of it, I think the legislation that we have \nbefore us today, the Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act, gives us that hope \nand gives us that opportunity. I couldn't think of a more powerful \nlegacy in Jason's name than this legislation.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to give their support of this legislation \ntoday. Again, I thank the leadership of the Committee on Veterans' \nAffairs for the help, the assistance, and the focus that they have \nprovided on this important piece of legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members are reminded that it is not in order \nto introduce to the House individuals present in the gallery.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman from Florida for \nyielding and for his efforts and the efforts of all of those who are \ninvolved in this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, my concern here is twofold. First of all, as a \npharmacist with over 30 years of experience and practice, this is a \ndeep concern of mine.\n  Secondly, I believe we have a duty to our servicemen and -women who \nhave sacrificed their lives to serve and protect our country. Studies \nhave shown that soldiers and veterans use opioid painkillers far more \nfrequently than civilians because their military training and combat \nlead to far more injuries. In fact, a report by the American Public \nHealth Association found that the fatal overdose rate among VA patients \nis nearly double the national average. Something needs to be done. The \nVA is doing a disservice to our veterans by prescribing too many \nopioids at too high quantities. That is why H.R. 4063 is so important.\n  H.R. 4063 directs the Department of Defense and the Department of \nVeterans Affairs to jointly update the VA/DOD Clinical Practice \nGuideline for the Management of Opioid Therapy for Chronic Pain so it \nadequately reflects the current environment we face with opioid abuse. \nIt also directs the VA to modify and establish initiatives and \nprotocols to better address the misuse of opioids by our veterans.\n  These changes, I believe, will be one step toward ensuring that the \nservices provided to our men and women of the military will improve \ntheir overall care and will move us closer to fulfilling our duty of \nservicing our servicemen and -women.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  It is bipartisan legislation like this that makes me proud to be a \nMember of the United States Congress. I want to thank each one of my \ncolleagues for his role in making this day happen.\n  I thank Jason's family. I am not going to single them out except to \nmake reference to them. I just want to thank Jason's family for making \nthe journey to Washington today for this very important and momentous \noccasion.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MILLER of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I wish that we did not have to discuss this tragedy today on the \nfloor. Jake is not with us, not by his choice. His wife is a widow; his \ndaughter is now fatherless; his parents lost a son.\n\n[[Page H2172]]\n\n  Why? Why did he die of a drug overdose inside of the very hospital in \nwhich he sought protection?\n  Mr. Speaker, I hope that all Members will support this legislation \ntoday. It is not that it will bring Jake back, but it may prevent this \nfrom occurring to another veteran in the future.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 4063, \nthe ``Promise Act.''\n  H.R. 4063 directs the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and the \nDepartment of Defense (DOD) to jointly update their respective clinical \npractice guidelines.\n  The practice guideline pertains to the management of Opioid Therapy \nfor Chronic Pain.\n  The guidelines spell out procedures for: (1) prescribing opioids for \noutpatient treatment, (2) (con-tra-in-di-ca-tions) contraindications \nfor opioid therapy, (3) treatment of patients with post-traumatic \nstress disorder, (4) psychiatric disorders, or a history of substance \nabuse or addiction, (5) and management transitioning patients.\n  The guidelines also prescribe routine and random urine drug tests, as \nwell as treatment options to augment opioid therapy designed to \nminimize opioid dependence.\n  This bill examines the VA's evidence-based therapy treatment model \nfor treating veterans' mental health conditions.\n  The Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) will be expected to update \nsafety measures for opioid therapy, expand the use of alternative \nmedicine, and conduct audits of the VA health care system through a \nnongovernment entity.\n  The VA will be required to request documentation of medical license \nviolations during the past 20 years and any settlement agreements for \nmedical-related disciplinary charges from the medical board, of each \nstate.\n  All VA medical facilities will implement the opioid safety initiative \nand train employees to effectively dispense pain management techniques \nthrough the establishment of pain management teams.\n  Enhancing national oversight, the VA is also expected to track and \nmonitor opioid use and access to state program information, increase \nthe availability of Food and Drug Administration-approved opioid \nreceptor antagonists, and modify the computerized patient record \nsystem, as well as internal audits.\n  Adjusting the computerized patient record system will ensure that \nhealth care providers accessing veterans' records are notified of their \nuse of opioid therapy.\n  This system also informs health care providers of substance use \ndisorder or opioid abuse histories.\n  The Promise Act of 2016 institutes pilot programs within the VA to \nevaluate the feasibility of wellness programs complementing veteran \npain management and related health care services.\n  I support this legislation because it will promote safety measures \nfor opioid therapy and alternative medicine.\n  H.R. 4063 is a positive step in the right direction and I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in supporting its passage.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I stand today in support of H.R. 4063, \nthe Jason Simcakoski PROMISE Act. As those who defend our liberty \nreturn home from service, their fight for freedom internalizes. The \nhomecoming of our nation's veterans often marks their entrance into a \nnew war--a constant battle against a visceral and intangible enemy: \nsubstance abuse. As we pass this important legislation, we afford our \nveterans the adequate support to fight this uphill battle, thus \nallowing our nation's fallen soldiers to rise as they repeatedly repel \nattacks from addiction. We must pass the PROMISE Act, because if we do \nnot look out for the protectors of our freedom, who will look out for \nus?\n  Through my experiences as an EOE investigator at the USPS, I saw \nfirsthand the divisive consequences of substance abuse on addicts, \ntheir loved ones, and communities as a whole. The PROMISE Act will \nbring nationwide uniformity to opioid addiction prevention efforts by \nimplementing opioid treatment and therapy guidelines, expanding VA \nsafety initiatives, and establishing research-based committees to \nmeasure the quality of treatment methods. While some may question why \nwe are voting today to help those who have broken our nation's laws, \njust consider: who were the citizens that protected our freedom and \nnurtured our liberty when they were called upon? Now that our soldiers \nare the ones in need, who are we to deny them?\n  Just as veterans took on the duty of defending our communities, we \nmust come together to halt the increasing opioid addiction rate for the \nsake of veterans and the good of America as a whole. The PROMISE Act \nwill serve to acknowledge veterans' selfless sacrifice by establishing \na forgotten American ideal: that we as a nation will always care for \nthose who protect and defend our freedom. While no amount of money \ncould ever buy back that which was sacrificed in the name of liberty, \nthe passage of this legislation will alleviate some of the hardships \nfaced by opioid-dependent veterans. As we look to find the most \neffective methods for treating opioid addiction, the PROMISE Act will \nserve as a strong step toward reversing our nation's substance abuse \nepidemic.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Miller) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4063, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: ``A bill to improve \nthe use by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs of opioids in treating \nveterans, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2172-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2172-H2173]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ARIEL RIOS FEDERAL BUILDING\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous material on H.R. 4957.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  H.R. 4957 would designate the Federal building located at 99 New York \nAvenue, N.E., in the District of Columbia, as the Ariel Rios Federal \nBuilding.\n  I am pleased to be a cosponsor of this legislation, along with the \nchairman and ranking member of the Subcommittee on Economic \nDevelopment, Public Buildings, and Emergency Management--my colleague \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Barletta) and my colleague from Indiana (Mr. \nCarson).\n  Special Agent Ariel Rios joined the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives in 1978, where he became one of the most \neffective agents who was assigned to then-Vice President George H. W. \nBush's task force. Special Agent Rios worked as an undercover agent as \npart of the task force.\n  During his undercover assignment in 1982, he and another agent \narranged to meet two suspects at a motel in Miami, Florida, to purchase \nlarge quantities of drugs and machine guns. A confrontation ensued and, \nduring a struggle, Special Agent Rios was shot and was seriously \nwounded. He died shortly after in the hospital on December 2, 1982.\n  Special Agent Rios received a number of posthumous awards, including \nthe Secretary of the Treasury's Exceptional Service Award and a \nMeritorious Service Award from the Dade County Chiefs of Police \nAssociation. The previous location of the ATF headquarters on \nPennsylvania Avenue bore his name for 27 years. During that time, the \nATF relocated to a new headquarters building, and the old building was \noccupied by another agency and was renamed. H.R. 4957 would \nappropriately name the current location of the ATF headquarters after \nSpecial Agent Rios.\n\n[[Page H2173]]\n\n  I am very proud to recognize this American hero who so sadly perished \nwhile protecting the people of Miami, my hometown, from crime and \ndrugs. As a Member with the honor of representing south Florida in \nCongress, I thank Special Agent Rios for his service to our country, \nand I thank his family for their sacrifice of such a brave person on \nbehalf of all of us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank Representative Curbelo.\n  I am pleased that this bill is being considered by the House this \nafternoon during National Police Week. I also appreciate Subcommittee \nChairman Barletta's support of this measure and the support of the \nother members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \nwho also agreed to be original cosponsors of this great bill, which \nwould name the current headquarters of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, \nFirearms and Explosives, or the ATF, after fallen Special Agent Ariel \nRios.\n  As was mentioned by my colleague, Agent Rios was born in 1954. He \nattended the John Jay College of Criminal Justice in Manhattan, and he \ngraduated with a degree in criminal justice in 1976. Agent Rios \nimmediately started his career in criminal justice by working for the \nDepartment of Corrections in both Washington, D.C., and in New York \nCity. Later, he joined the ATF in 1978 and developed a reputation as an \neffective law enforcement officer.\n  In 1982, Agent Rios was working as a member of Vice President George \nH. W. Bush's anti-drug task force. It was here that he was shot and \nkilled while working undercover to unravel a drug ring in Miami, \nFlorida.\n  In 1985, Congress saw fit to honor the ultimate sacrifice that \nSpecial Agent Rios made. Congress acknowledged the fact that he was the \nfirst ATF agent to die in the line of duty by naming the headquarters \nof the ATF building the Ariel Rios Memorial Building. This name stood \nfor nearly 30 years until the building was renamed for President \nClinton in 2012 so as to reflect the fact that the old building now \nhoused the EPA. Unfortunately, the ``Ariel Rios'' name was not \ntransferred to the new ATF headquarters.\n  This bill seeks to correct this omission and name the new ATF \nheadquarters as the Ariel Rios Federal Building.\n  As a former police officer, I have a special appreciation for the \nrisks that face officers each and every day. Agent Rios' death serves \nas a reminder that when law enforcement officers walk out the door and \nleave their families for the day, they are putting their lives on the \nline to protect our communities.\n  It is fitting that the House is considering this legislation during \nNational Police Week, which is an annual event when thousands of law \nenforcement officers from around the world travel to Washington, D.C., \nto participate in events that honor those who have been killed in the \nline of duty. By naming the ATF headquarters after Mr. Rios, a front \nline law enforcement officer, we offer a very public tribute to the \ncommemoration of the sacrifices that too many officers have made.\n  This legislation comes at the request of many current and former \nagents who would not rest until this recognition was restored to \nSpecial Agent Rios. Because of their tireless efforts, the House will \nvote today to restore the name of Special Agent Rios to the ATF \nheadquarters. This is an overdue and well-deserved acknowledgment of \nboth Special Agent Rios and of the nearly 20,000 law enforcement agents \nwho have died in the line of duty in the United States of America.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased that so many on both sides \nof the aisle from our committee have agreed to cosponsor this \nlegislation. I am also honored that Mr. Rogers, the chairman of the \nCommittee on Appropriations, supports this bill.\n  Former President George H. W. Bush has written Congress in support of \nnaming this building after Special Agent Rios, as have several former \nDirectors of the ATF and as have several organizations that represent \nlaw enforcement officers.\n  I am very proud that this legislation is being considered today, and \nI urge my colleagues to support my bipartisan bill that honors Special \nAgent Rios.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1615\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I thank my colleague from Indiana (Mr. Carson) for his leadership on \nthis issue.\n  This, of course, is a simple naming bill, but it honors one of the \nmany men and women who paid the ultimate price to keep Americans safe. \nThis has a special place in my heart, obviously, because this took \nplace in my community where Special Agent Rios lost his life.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 4957.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members may \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous materials on this measure.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, on behalf of the Foreign Affairs Committee, I am pleased \nto call up the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, which was favorably \nreported this week by the Judiciary Committee on which I also sit.\n  This bipartisan bill, introduced by the gentleman and gentlewoman \nfrom New York, Mr. Katko and Miss Rice, helps to ensure that classified \ninformation used in the designation of foreign drug kingpins may be \nprotected from public disclosure so that it cannot be used by drug \nlords and terrorists.\n  Under current law, the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets \nControl, otherwise known as OFAC, is able to designate international \ndrug traffickers as kingpins. These designations are published in the \nFederal Register, and the individuals are added to the list of \nspecially designated nationals, which effectively blocks any U.S.-based \nasset and their access to the U.S.\n\n[[Page H2174]]\n\nfinancial system. This is a potent weapon against international drug \ntraffickers.\n  Since the enactment of the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act \n16 years ago, OFAC has designated more than 1,800 individuals, all of \nthem non-U.S. persons. These include not only high-profile drug \ntraffickers, but also individuals who are using drug proceeds to \nsupport international terrorism.\n  Now, listed persons can seek removal of those sanctions by \nchallenging them in Federal court. The tricky part arises when OFAC \ndesignations are based on classified information. We do not want to \nhand drug lords and terrorists the sources and methods we have for \nuncovering their nefarious activities. We also do not want OFAC to be \ndeterred from making the designations our national security requires \nbecause they are worried that such classified info may be publicly \ndisclosed.\n  For these reasons, other key OFAC sanctions laws, like the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act, provide protections for \nclassified information. Under that statute, OFAC can submit such \ninformation ex parte and in camera directly to the judge outside of \npublic view.\n  H.R. 4985 just incorporates that same protection in the Narcotics \nKingpin Designation Act. Also, it is worth remembering that these \ndesignations are not something done secretly in the dead of night. They \nresult from the coordination of five Federal agencies. They are \npublished publicly, and they are reported to 10 congressional \ncommittees, 5 in the House and 5 in the Senate, some of which receive \nthe classified background on the designated persons.\n  I want to thank Foreign Affairs Chairman Royce, Ranking Member Engel, \nJudiciary Chairman Goodlatte, and Ranking Member Conyers for moving \nthis bipartisan bill promptly to the floor.\n  H.R. 4985 is an important tool in our fight against high-level \nnarcotics traffickers and deserves our unanimous support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of this legislation and \nyield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like to thank Representative Katko and Representative Rice \nfor introducing this bill, H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation \nImprovement Act, which helps ensure that Federal courts can review \nsanctions against drug kingpins without forcing law enforcement or the \nintelligence community to publicly release classified information.\n  H.R. 4985 would amend the Foreign Narcotics Kingpin Designation Act \nmodeled on the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. The Kingpin \nAct allows the President to designate and apply economic sanctions \nagainst any significant foreign narcotics trafficker. This authority \nprovides a powerful tool to combat narcotics trafficking around the \nworld.\n  For example, just last month, the Treasury Department's Office of \nForeign Assets Control, which administers these sanctions, targeted a \nMexican drug cartel and the three brothers who run it, freezing their \nassets and banning U.S. persons from doing business with them.\n  As with the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, designations \nmade under the Kingpin Act may be challenged in court. However, unlike \nIEEPA, the Kingpin Act contains no explicit authority for judges to \nprivately review classified information. This gap in authority means it \nis only a matter of time until the government will be forced to choose \nbetween disclosing classified material and allowing a confirmed \nnarcotics trafficker to avoid justice.\n  H.R. 4985 would address this issue by adding a new section that \nexplicitly authorizes the government to allow judges to privately \nreview classified information when individuals challenge their \ndesignation as kingpins under the act. This provides a simple fix to a \ngap in current law, bringing the Kingpin Act in line with the \nInternational Emergency Economic Powers Act and improving our ability \nto ensure the law functions as intended.\n  I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania for its introduction, and I \nurge my colleagues to support the legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may to consume to \nthe gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko), the author of this bill.\n  Mr. KATKO. Mr. Speaker, let me start by thanking Judiciary Committee \nChairman Goodlatte for his efforts and his committee's efforts in \nshepherding this bill through the committee, where it received \nunanimous support.\n  I also want to thank my colleague across the aisle, Representative \nRice. We have partnered together on many bills that have passed the \nHouse to help keep our country safe and to keep it free from drug \ntrafficking. Both of us having a background as prosecutors on a Federal \nlevel will help us going forward.\n  This legislation makes important changes that strengthen the Kingpin \nAct and enhance the protection of classified information. The Kingpin \nAct has played an important role in our Nation's efforts to fight drug \ntrafficking for nearly two decades. In the last two decades, I was \nheavily involved with drug trafficking as a Federal organized crime \nprosecutor, so I understand the importance of the statute on a \nfirsthand basis.\n  The act established a process to sanction individuals involved in \ninternational narcotics trafficking. More than 1,800 individuals, all \nnon-U.S. persons, have been designated as drug kingpins by the \nTreasury's Office of Foreign Assets Control under the Kingpin Act. This \ndesignation precludes these traffickers from using the U.S. financial \nsystem and, in so doing, places a major obstacle in front of their \nefforts to move and use their ill-gotten gains.\n  Many of the individuals placed on the kingpin list are put there on \nthe basis of classified information. The law provides a process by \nwhich these individuals can seek removal from the list in Federal \ncourt, but, unfortunately, the law currently doesn't protect classified \ninformation in such delisting cases. This opens up the possibility that \nsome kingpins won't be sanctioned at all or will be removed from the \nkingpin list, despite significant evidence of their illicit activities, \nin order to protect classified information.\n  This bill simply makes it clear that the Office of Foreign Assets \nControl may submit classified information in defense of its kingpin \ndesignations in a nonpublic, protected setting in order to safeguard \nclassified information. This bill will make it easier to sanction \ninternational drug kingpins who cause enormous problems both in the \nUnited States and in their home countries. It will make it harder for \nthese criminals to carry out their dangerous and destructive drug \ntrade.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am grateful for the House's consideration of this \nbill, alongside several other important measures, to fight back against \nthe opioid epidemic gripping much of our Nation, and certainly in my \ndistrict as well.\n  My district has been extremely hard-hit by this epidemic as well as a \nscourge of dangerous synthetic substances, which I hope to address at a \nlater time during this Congress. Almost every family in my district has \nbeen affected by this epidemic or knows someone who has.\n  We need to fight back against the kingpins for profiteering off this \nmisery. It is gratifying to see the House working together across the \naisle to tackle these enormous problems, and our country will be better \noff for it.\n  Mr. CICILLINE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from New York for the introduction of \nthis bill. It closes an important gap in the statute, which will \nenhance the safety of our country and provide essential review \nconfidentially.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I just want to echo what my good friend from \nRhode Island (Mr. Cicilline) has stated.\n  As a former prosecutor, and Mr. Katko, who was a former prosecutor, \nand my good friend from Rhode Island (Mr. Cicilline), who was a mayor \nand had jurisdiction over law enforcement agencies, we all know what \nthe importance of this legislation is.\n  I want to thank the authors of this. I want to thank the staff \nmembers who worked on this. This is going to improve the lives of not \nonly Americans, but people around the world.\n\n[[Page H2175]]\n\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROYCE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend from Virginia, \nJudiciary Chairman Goodlatte, his Ranking Member, Mr. Conyers, and the \ngentleman and gentlelady from New York--Mr. Katko and Miss Rice--for \ntheir work on H.R. 4985, the Kingpin Designation Improvement Act, which \ndeserves our support.\n  In the context of today's floor debate, it is important that we \ndiscuss the extensive role of Iran's primary regional proxy--\nHezbollah--in the international drug trade.\n  Earlier this year, the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration announced \nthat they have, in cooperation with law enforcement agencies from 7 \nother nations, disrupted a global criminal enterprise Hezbollah was \nusing to finance its participation in the Syrian conflict, as well as \nto plan for a future war with Israel.\n  Unfortunately, this is nothing new. For years, Hezbollah has had \nbusiness connections with South American drug cartels, and has been \nusing them to enter the narcotics trafficking business. In 2011 and \n2013, the Department of the Treasury and other agencies designated core \nHezbollah members and affiliates for engaging in international \nnarcotics networks.\n  As a result, the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of \n2015, which I authored and passed into law in December, required \nspecific Administration reporting on Hezbollah's international \nnarcotics trafficking networks.\n  Unfortunately, once a terrorist organization enters this business, \nthey seldom leave. Sanctions relief for Iran as a result of the \nAdministration's flawed deal with that regime, and the resulting inflow \nof Iranian money to Hezbollah will not likely cause them to turn away \nfrom the lucrative drug industry. Rather, it may enable Hezbollah to \ndouble down on their efforts to finance their destructive regional \nactivities.\n  For example, instead of 150,000 rockets on Israel's northern border, \nHezbollah could afford to field 300,000, financed by the Iranian regime \nand Hezbollah's trafficking of narcotics into our communities.\n  With this in mind, it is important that we have robust Narcotics \nKingpin Designation Act authorities in place, which this legislation \nensures. I support the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

POSSESSION, MANUFACTURE OR DISTRIBUTION FOR PURPOSES \n                   OF UNLAWFUL IMPORTATIONS.\n\n       Section 1009 of the Controlled Substances Import and Export \n     Act (21 U.S.C. 959) is amended--\n       (1) by redesignating subsections (b) and (c) as subsections \n     (c) and (d), respectively; and\n       (2) in subsection (a), by striking ``It shall'' and all \n     that follows and inserting the following: ``It shall be \n     unlawful for any person to manufacture or distribute a \n     controlled substance in schedule I or II or flunitrazepam or \n     a listed chemical intending, knowing, or having reasonable \n     cause to believe that such substance or chemical will be \n     unlawfully imported into the United States or into waters \n     within a distance of 12 miles of the coast of the United \n     States.\n       ``(b) It shall be unlawful for any person to manufacture or \n     distribute a listed chemical--\n       ``(1) intending or knowing that the listed chemical will be \n     used to manufacture a controlled substance; and\n       ``(2) intending, knowing, or having reasonable cause to \n     believe that the controlled substance will be unlawfully \n     imported into the United States.''.\n\n     SEC. 3. TRAFFICKING IN COUNTERFEIT GOODS OR SERVICES.\n\n       Chapter 113 of title 18, United States Code, is amended--\n       (1) in section 2318(b)(2), by striking ``section 2320(e)'' \n     and inserting ``section 2320(f)''; and\n       (2) in section 2320--\n       (A) in subsection (a), by striking paragraph (4) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(4) traffics in a drug and knowingly uses a counterfeit \n     mark on or in connection with such drug,'';\n       (B) in subsection (b)(3), in the matter preceding \n     subparagraph (A), by striking ``counterfeit drug'' and \n     inserting ``drug that uses a counterfeit mark on or in \n     connection with the drug''; and\n       (C) in subsection (f), by striking paragraph (6) and \n     inserting the following:\n       ``(6) the term `drug' means a drug, as defined in section \n     201 of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act (21 U.S.C. \n     321).''.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on S. 32, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  International drug traffickers are profiting off the misery of \nAmerican citizens, including our children. In recent years, our Nation \nhas experienced an epidemic of opioid abuse. A significant part of that \nepidemic involves the trafficking of illicit heroin across our borders \nand into our communities and homes. Every Member in this Chamber today \nhas a heartbreaking story about a constituent or a constituent's child \nwho has been lost to this scourge.\n  The irony, Mr. Speaker, is that international drug traffickers know \nour drug trafficking laws as well as, if not better than, most \nAmericans do. They know that if they simply employ a middleman to take \nthe drugs from them and transport them into the U.S., it makes it much \nharder, if not impossible, for U.S. law enforcement to prosecute them \nunder those drug trafficking laws.\n  Why is it more difficult, you might ask. Because under current law \nthe government must prove that a trafficker knew the drugs were headed \nfor the United States. Drug trafficking organizations in Colombia, \nPeru, Ecuador, and other Central and South American source nations sell \ntheir illicit products to Mexican traffickers who, in turn, traffic the \ndrugs into the United States.\n  This makes it difficult, under current law, for Federal prosecutors \nto make cases against such source nation manufacturers, wholesale \ndistributors, brokers, and transporters since direct evidence of their \nintent that the drugs are bound for the United States is difficult, if \nnot impossible, to develop.\n  The result is that source nation malefactors who produce and \ndistribute illegal narcotics escape prosecution under U.S. law because \nthey feign ignorance of the drug's ultimate destination. This has \nhappened with increasing regularity over the past several years, and it \nis Congress' responsibility to address this problem.\n  S. 32, the Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015, is identical \nto H.R. 3380, legislation that was introduced by my Committee on the \nJudiciary colleagues, the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino) and \nthe gentleman from Puerto Rico (Mr. Pierluisi).\n  This bill makes crucial changes to our Federal drug laws to give law \nenforcement additional tools to combat extraterritorial drug \ntrafficking. It does this by amending the Controlled Substances Import \nand Export Act to stipulate that, when a narcotics trafficker or \nmanufacturer has a ``reasonable cause to believe'' that the illegal \nnarcotics he produces or traffics will be sent into the U.S., the U.S. \nmay prosecute him. This amendment will permit Federal prosecutors to \npursue extraterritorial drug traffickers who are not directly smuggling \ndrugs into the United States but who facilitate it.\n  S. 32 also amends the Controlled Substances Import and Export Act to \naddress the increasingly prevalent problem of trafficking in listed \nchemicals, which are chemicals regulated by the\n\n[[Page H2176]]\n\nDEA because they are used in the manufacture of controlled substances. \nDuring a recent codel to South and Central America, several of my \ncolleagues and I heard firsthand how drug trafficking organizations \nhave relied upon shadowy chemical suppliers in the manufacture of \nmethamphetamine, heroin, cocaine, and other dangerous narcotics. S. 32 \nwould enable Federal prosecutors to reach chemical traffickers who \nknowingly facilitate and benefit from the illicit production and \nsmuggling of listed chemicals.\n  Both of these amendments will allow Federal law enforcement to go \nafter not the lowly drug mules moving drugs into the United States, but \nthe criminals who facilitate at a high level, within the source nation, \nthe trafficking of narcotics and precursor chemicals into the United \nStates. As one law enforcement official has said to me, it is better to \nfight this battle there than here.\n  In addition to these important reforms, S. 32 also amends the \ncriminal counterfeit law to include an intent requirement for \ntrafficking in counterfeit drugs. I am pleased the House is taking up \nthis important bill, which the Senate has already passed unanimously, \nso that it can move expeditiously to the President's desk.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I am writing to notify you that \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on S. \n     32, Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015, so that it \n     may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for \n     consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way altered. In addition, the \n     Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on S. 32 and \n     requests your support when such a request is made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters \n     on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of the bill on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                     Washington, DC, May 10, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for your letter regarding S. \n     32, the ``Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015,'' for \n     which the Committee on Energy and Commerce received an \n     additional referral.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego formal \n     consideration of S. 32 so that it may proceed to the House \n     floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving formal \n     consideration of the bill, the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that \n     fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, I would \n     support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate \n     number of conferees on any House-Senate conference involving \n     this legislation.\n       Finally, I am pleased to include this letter and your \n     letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration \n     of S. 32.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would like, first, for everyone to know that we here in the \nCongress are working to address the current heroin epidemic. We know \nthat illegal drugs continue to present a public health crisis that \nimpacts individuals and families in communities across the United \nStates. S. 32 attempts to address the illegal importation of the drugs \ncoming into the United States by amending section 959 of the Controlled \nSubstances Act.\n  We have a bit of a problem here, but no one has worked on this longer \nor harder than Ms. Sheila Jackson Lee. It is in that spirit that I \nyield such time as she may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. \nJackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman and the ranking \nmember for capturing what we in the Committee on the Judiciary have \nbeen doing over the last couple months. We have been working in a very \neffective, bipartisan manner to deal with the whole scheme, if you \nwill, of criminal justice reform. We have been extensively involved in \nwhat has become a major epidemic across this Nation.\n  I listened to a number of legislative initiatives, one dealing with a \nveteran who died from a drug overdose that was just debated here on the \nfloor of the House. As I was flying in today, we knew there was an \nincident in my district where a motorcyclist was killed by a driver, a \nyoung woman who was under the influence of opioids. We know that this \nTransnational Drug Trafficking Act is an important act, and we want to \ncontinue in our bipartisan effort.\n  It is important for me to note a concern that I do not believe the \nsponsors intended, but which I believe must be addressed. This bill is \nintended to help us do more to combat the importation of illegal drugs \ninto our country, but it could also subject more people to mandatory \nminimum sentencing, an unfortunate feature of our criminal justice \nsystem that we must address.\n  The United States has been suffering from the damaging effects of \nillicit drug trafficking for decades. The majority of the drugs \nwreaking havoc in the United States originate in foreign countries, \nmoving from one country to the next under the direction of powerful and \nwealthy drug kingpins. I think all of my adult life, Mr. Speaker, we \nhave heard the words ``drug kingpins''--you cannot live in urban \nAmerica without hearing about them; you cannot live in Texas without \nhearing about them--many of whom never see or touch the drugs or enter \nthe boundaries of this country themselves.\n  Foreign drug kingpins in Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru are leading \nproducers of cocaine imported into the United States. These kingpins \nlead operations which sell to traffickers in Mexico, who receive the \ndrugs from Central America, South America, or Mexico and then smuggle \nthe drugs into the United States.\n  Certainly, drugs come from all over. The Obama administration \nreported instances of Afghan drug trafficking working with West African \ndrug trafficking organizations to smuggle heroin into the United \nStates. It is around the world.\n  I support the idea that these drug kingpins are dangerous, but S. 32 \nis intended to help Federal prosecutors successfully prosecute foreign \ndrug traffickers whose criminal activity outside the U.S. threatens the \nhealth, safety, and security of Americans at home.\n  Section 959 makes it a crime to manufacture or distribute controlled \nsubstances or certain chemicals used to make controlled substances \nintended or knowing that the substance or chemical will ultimately be \nbrought illegally into the U.S. or within 12 miles of the coast of the \nU.S. In recent years, Federal prosecutors reported difficulties \nenforcing this statute in some instances.\n  Some drug traffickers are aware of the methods used to charge and \nthen extradite foreign criminals into the U.S. for prosecution. Drug \ntraffickers simply avoid any discussion of the destination of the drug \nshipments. S. 32 would amend section 959, making it easier for \nprosecutors to obtain a conviction against drug traffickers who operate \nin other countries. That is certainly an important mission.\n  I am troubled, however, that lowering the intent requirement in the \nstatute without limiting its use to leaders and organizers would expose \neven low-level offenders to mandatory minimum sentences. We are working \nnow to stop that tide so that we can restore the criminal justice \nsystem to be just and fair. This would happen, depending on the \nquantity of drugs involved.\n  Historically, mandatory minimums created in the late 1980s to target \nkingpins have been largely applied to low-level, nonviolent offenders. \nMandatory minimums have led to unwarranted and unfair sentences and \noverincarceration. As the ranking member of the Subcommittee on Crime, \nTerrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, I am engaged with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the problem of \nmandatory minimum sentencing. I am concerned that S. 32 may make \nmatters worse.\n  In the Committee on the Judiciary, Ranking Member Conyers proposed a\n\n[[Page H2177]]\n\nvery thoughtful amendment to H.R. 3380, the House companion to this \nbill, to specify that the reduced intent standard would only apply to \nleaders and organizers of foreign drug trafficking organizations. The \namendment would have made certain that the substantial resources, time, \nand money necessary to extradite foreign criminals will be expended \nonly on those individuals whose prosecution would disrupt the chain, \nthe pipeline, or dismantle drug trafficking networks. If this bill was \namended as recommended, it would be a useful tool to help target \nleaders of transnational organized crime from Africa to Afghanistan, to \nSouth and Central America and beyond, networks in the U.S. and abroad, \npriorities and objective detail in the President's strategy to combat \ntransnational organized crime.\n  In a climate in Congress when we are working on a bipartisan basis to \nmake our criminal justice system more just and effective and to reduce \nmandatory minimums, the best course is for us to limit the scope of \nthis bill to high-level drug traffickers--a simple fix. While we do not \nhave the opportunity to amend this bill today, I ask that my colleagues \nvote against it so that we may continue to work to address this \nconcern, which would not undermine the goals of the bill.\n\n  S. 32 also corrects an error in section 2320 of title 18, the statute \nthat governs trafficking in counterfeit goods and services. In order to \nprove the offense of trafficking in drugs with counterfeit marks, there \nmust be proof that the accused knowingly used a counterfeit mark on or \nin connection with a trafficked drug. I support those changes.\n  The underlying change and spirit of the bill is a positive one. We \nare working here together. This scourge is something we must attack.\n  May I simply say, Mr. Speaker, I commend the sponsors of this bill \nfor their desire to improve our ability to pursue, convict, and \nultimately imprison top-level drug traffickers who have plagued our \nNation for decades and beyond. Although I believe this bill still \nrequires a simple change to address the unintended issue impacting \nmandatory minimum sentencing, I look forward to us working in the \nmanner in which we can work, and I look forward to this concluding in a \npositive way.\n  Mr. Speaker. Although I support the goals of the Transnational Drug \nTrafficking Act, I must note a concern that I do not believe the \nsponsors intended but which I believe must be addressed.\n  This bill is intended to help us do more to combat the importation of \nillegal drugs into our country.\n  But, it could also subject more people to mandatory minimum \nsentencing--an unfortunate feature of our criminal justice system that \nwe must address.\n  The United States has been suffering from the damaging effects of \nillicit drug trafficking for decades.\n  The majority of the drugs wreaking havoc in the U.S. originate in \nforeign countries, moving from one country to the next, under the \ndirection of powerful and wealthy drug kingpins--many of whom never see \nor touch the drugs or enter the boundaries of this country themselves.\n  Foreign drug kingpins in Columbia, Ecuador, and Peru are the leading \nproducers of cocaine imported into the U.S.\n  These kingpins lead operations which sell to traffickers in Mexico, \nwho receive the drugs in Central America, South America, or Mexico and, \nthen, smuggle the drugs into the U.S.\n  In 2011 the Obama Administration reported instances of Afghan drug \ntrafficking operations working with West African drug trafficking \norganizations to smuggle heroin into the U.S.\n  I support enhanced efforts to combat international drug trafficking.\n  S. 32 is intended to help federal prosecutors successfully prosecute \nforeign drug traffickers whose criminal activity outside of the U.S. \nthreatens the health, safety, and security of Americans at home.\n  At present, Section 959 of Title 21 targets criminal conduct \ncommitted outside of the United States.\n  Section 959 makes it a crime to manufacture or distribute controlled \nsubstances or certain chemicals used to make controlled substances, \nintending or knowing that the substance or chemical will ultimately be \nbrought illegally into the U.S. or within 12 miles of the coast of the \nU.S.\n  In recent years, federal prosecutors have reported difficulties \nenforcing this statute in some circumstances.\n  Since drug traffickers are aware of the methods used to charge and, \nthen, extradite foreign criminals into the U.S. for prosecution, drug \ntraffickers simply avoid any discussion of the destination of their \ndrug shipments.\n  This tactic leaves prosecutors with no direct evidence that the \ntraffickers know the ultimate destination of their drugs or the drugs \nproduced using their chemicals.\n  S. 32 would amend Section 959, making it easier for prosecutors to \nobtain a conviction against drug traffickers who operate in other \ncountries.\n  Prosecutors would no longer be required to prove the accused intended \nor actually knew the drugs or chemicals would be brought illegally into \nthe U.S.\n  S. 32 would reduce the level of intent necessary to prove the \naccused's guilt, requiring prosecutors to only prove that there was \nreasonable cause for the accused to believe the drugs or chemicals used \nto make the drugs would be brought illegally into the U.S.\n  I am troubled, however, that lowering the intent requirement in the \nstatute, without limiting its use to leaders and organizers would \nexpose even low-level offenders to mandatory minimum sentences, \ndepending on the quantity of drugs involved.\n  Historically, mandatory minimums created in the late 80's to target \nkingpins have been largely applied to low-level, non-violent offenders.\n  Mandatory minimums have led to unwarranted and unfair sentences and \nover-incarceration.\n  As the Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Crime, I am engaged with \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to address the problem of \nmandatory minimum sentencing.\n  I am concerned that S. 32 may make matters worse.\n  In the Judiciary Committee markup, Ranking Member Conyers proposed an \namendment to H.R. 3380, the House companion to this bill, to specify \nthat the reduced intent standard would only apply to leaders and \norganizers of foreign drug trafficking organizations.\n  The amendment would have made certain that the substantial resources, \ntime, and money necessary to extradite foreign criminals would be \nexpended only on those individuals whose prosecution would disrupt or \ndismantle drug trafficking networks.\n  If this bill was amended as recommended, it would be a useful tool to \nhelp target leaders of transnational organized crime networks in the \nU.S. and abroad--priorities and objectives detailed in the President's \nStrategy to Combat Transnational Organized Crime.\n  In a climate in Congress when we are working on a bipartisan basis to \nmake our criminal justice system more just and effective and to reduce \nmandatory minimums, the best course is for us to limit the scope of \nthis bill to high-level drug traffickers.\n  While we do not have the opportunity to amend this bill today, I ask

In order to \nprove the offense of trafficking in drugs with counterfeit marks, there \nmust be proof that the accused knowingly used a counterfeit mark on or \nin connection with a trafficked drug, and I support this change.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, I commend the sponsors of this bill for \ntheir desire to improve our ability to pursue, convict, and, \nultimately, imprison top-level drug traffickers, although I believe the \nbill still requires a change to address the unintended issue impacting \nmandatory minimum sentencing.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Marino), a \nmember of the Committee on the Judiciary and the chief sponsor of the \nHouse companion legislation to the bill before the House at this time.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. MARINO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman for yielding and for \nhis leadership in committee and today on this important bipartisan \npiece of legislation.\n  I also would like to thank my colleague, Congressman Pierluisi, for \nhis stalwart support and work on this bipartisan bill.\n  The chairman of the Judiciary Committee is correct in recognizing \nthat Federal law often fails to keep up with lawbreakers. As a former \nU.S. attorney, I am acutely aware of the ways criminal organizations \nadapt their practices to skirt Federal law and harm American citizens. \nThis bill directly responds to one scenario that has played out time \nand again in our Federal courts.\n  I would like to start by making a key point about the purpose of this \nbill and the type of organizations it targets. Our focus through this \nbill is the leaders of sophisticated, often multinational drug-\ntrafficking organizations\n\n[[Page H2178]]\n\nwith expansive networks of distribution internationally.\n  This includes source nation manufacturers primarily in South and \nCentral America. They are a significant source, if not the largest \nsource, of deadly drugs on the streets and in homes across America. It \nalso includes the leaders of large ``middleman'' wholesale trafficking \nand distribution organizations.\n  I want to stress that the bill does not target petty dealers or low-\nlevel smugglers in the final chain to the narcotics' final destination. \nInstead, the focus is on higher levels of the drug-trafficking chain \nbeyond our borders. These are the decisionmakers who have twisted our \nlaw for their own profit.\n  Federal law requires prosecutors to prove that defendant \nmanufacturers and traffickers knew the narcotics were destined for the \nU.S. Under their direction, drugs are manufactured and packaged for \nillegal wholesale distribution in these countries outside of the U.S. \nIn many instances, the final destination is the United States. But \nthese individuals can hide their knowledge or insert additional \nmiddlemen to potentially evade prosecution.\n  One recent case in the D.C. Federal district court perfectly depicts \nthis problem. On trial were two Guatemalan nationals, leaders of an \norganization that received tons of cocaine over 13 years from \nmanufacturers in Colombia and Venezuela. They built runways and \nwarehouses to store and receive such massive quantities of narcotics. \nThey then distributed the drugs to additional middlemen in Mexico.\n  It was known that these drugs reached the U.S. But the defendants \nclaimed that, once they passed them on, they had no knowledge of its \nultimate destination. At trial, this was their only defense. Currently, \nthe law allows them to claim ignorance and simply put the blame on \nthose who do their bidding.\n  My district and many of my colleagues' districts face a growing \nheroin epidemic. Our efforts this week to counter this crisis are \ncrucial to stopping it.\n  My final point. This bill is about dismantling international drug-\ntrafficking organizations. It is about bringing to justice the source \nnation manufacturers and middlemen wholesalers behind the flow of \ndeadly narcotics across our borders, nothing else.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the bill so we can make that happen \ntoday.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is no doubt that we must stop the flow of illegal \ndrugs coming into the United States from foreign countries.\n  I want to commend our colleagues who have worked with Ms. Jackson Lee \non this, and I want to commend the chairman of the full committee, Mr. \nGoodlatte, as well for dealing with this very important subject.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must avoid subjecting more people to mandatory \nminimum sentences. As a matter of principle, I oppose mandatory minimum \nsentences because they are unjust and unwise.\n  The flaws in mandatory minimum sentencing have led to extraordinary \ninjustices, prison overcrowding, and excessive cost to taxpayers. They \nhave been shown to have a disparate impact on minorities.\n  While I am committed to combating the importation of illegal drugs in \nthis country, I must oppose the expansion of mandatory minimum \nsentences, which is what S. 32 would do.\n  In the Judiciary Committee markup, I offered an amendment to limit \nthe scope of the changes that would be made by this bill to the leaders \nor organizers of the drug organizations, in other words, the real \nkingpins.\n  Whether or not it is the intent of this bill to target low-level \noffenders, too often it is precisely these individuals who are easier \nto arrest, easier to convict, and subject to mandatory penalties.\n  Now, while I understand that we are today considering a Senate-passed \nbill, I maintain that we should take the time to address this issue. \nThis bill's expansion of those convicted under the statute should be \nlimited to kingpins, those to whom mandatory minimum penalties were \noriginally intended to apply in the first place.\n  So, accordingly, I sincerely ask my colleagues to vote against this \nbill so that we may address this concern.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, in closing, without question, illegal drugs \nimported into the United States have harmed our citizens and our \ncommunities in innumerable ways. It is critical that appropriate steps \nbe taken to address this problem.\n  Although S. 32 is a well-intentioned effort to do so, I believe that \nthis bill should be amended to address a concern related to mandatory \nminimum sentencing. On this basis, I oppose the bill in its current \nform.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me and the ranking subcommittee member \nof the Judiciary Committee from Texas, Ms. Jackson Lee, in supporting \nthis bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCOTT of Virginia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to S. 32, \nthe Transnational Drug Trafficking Act of 2015. While I support the \nunderlying goal of combating drug trafficking, existing federal \ncriminal laws already prohibit and punish this conduct. This bill \nhowever weakens existing mens rea standards, and therefore could lead \nto the application of mandatory minimums to action which the defendant \ndid not know was illegal.\n  This bill therefore is a perfect example of four of the most common \nproblems in crime policy.\n  First, it is a textbook example of overcriminalization, namely the \ncareless creation and addition of federal crimes without reviewing if \nthat conduct is already sufficiently prohibited and can be prosecuted \nunder existing federal criminal laws. Existing federal laws prohibit \nimportation and exportation of controlled substances, possession with \nintent to distribute such substances, or attempt or conspiracy to do so \nand therefore already prohibit the very conduct S. 32 was drafted to \nreach.\n  Our federal code contains over 5,000 offenses carrying criminal \npenalties, but a precise count eludes not only the Congressional \nresearch service but also the Department of Justice, the agency charged \nwith prosecuting those offenses. The House Judiciary Committee's bi-\npartisan Overcriminalization Task Force, upon which I served as Ranking \nMember, found that our Congressional appetite to add new federal \noffenses to demonstrate that we were ``tough on crime,'' instead of \nrelying on existing state or federal statutes, was a significant \ndriver. If we are serious about cleaning up our federal code, it starts \nwith ensuring that the first question we ask when introducing, marking \nup, or voting on a bill is whether that bill is necessary. There is no \nsuch evidence in the record that the Department of Justice has been \nunable to investigate or prosecute these such cases under existing law, \nnor is there any evidence that the present punishment for violation of \nthese laws is insufficient.\n  Second, the mens rea standard in S. 32 is weaker than the criminal \nintent standards of existing federal drug statutes carrying mandatory \nminimums. This means that the government can convict based on a lower \nstandard of proof. Again, the need for a robust mens rea standard is a \nkey Constitutional requirement that ensures that citizens are not \ndeprived of their liberty, absent a showing that they were aware that \ntheir conduct was prohibited and they intended to engage in that \nunlawful conduct. In the wake of discussions about the importance of \nmens rea in protecting defendants who act with innocent intent and/or \nno notice of the illegality of their conduct, it is disappointing to \nsee a step in the wrong direction that makes it easier for the \ngovernment to convict them based upon a weaker standard.\n  Third, applying S. 32 would lead to unintended consequences due to \nthis weaker mens rea standard. Specifically, not only does S. 32 \ncriminalize ``intending'' or ``knowing'' that one of the prohibited \nchemicals will be used to manufacture a controlled substance, but also \n``having reasonable cause to believe that the controlled substance will \nbe unlawfully imported into the United States.''\n  Many legitimate industrial chemicals, such as anhydrous ammonia found \nin fertilizer or ephedrine found in sinus medication, and natural \nsubstances, such as the alkaloid fluid extracted from the bulbs of \npoppy plants, can also be used to process and synthesize some illicitly \nproduced drugs.\n  Thus, the problem S. 32 presents is that it may sweep too broadly. \nFor example, a fertilizer manufacturer or pharmaceutical company or \nflorist in Europe could be criminally liable and subject to a mandatory \nminimum penalty. That is because under S. 32's rubric, any \nmanufacturer, importer, or distributor of any substance that some \nillicit chemist seeks to turn into an existing, or as-of-yet-developed, \ncontrolled substance would be vulnerable to\n\n[[Page H2179]]\n\nfederal criminal charges. The problem is that S. 32's ``reasonable \ncause to believe'' benchmark is intellectually bankrupt''--is it \n``reasonable cause to believe that the entity they are shipping it to \nhas requested it for illicit purposes'' or merely ``reasonable cause to \nbelieve that these are the types of chemicals that could be turned into \nillicit drugs?''\n  Lastly, this bill expands the universe of conduct to which a \nmandatory minimum applies. Research and evidence in the past few \ndecades has demonstrated that mandatory minimums are ineffective \ndeterrents, waste the taxpayers' money, force judges to impose \nirrational sentences, and discriminate against minorities, particularly \nwith regards to drug offenses. Unfortunately, there are too many \nmandatory minimums in the federal code. If we expect to do anything \nabout that problem, the first step has to be to stop passing new ones. \nThe mandatory minimums in the code today did not get there all at \nonce--they got there one at a time, each one part of a larger bill, \nwhich on balance might have been a good idea. Therefore, the only way \nto stop passing new mandatory minimums is to stop passing bills that \ncontain mandatory minimums. Giving lip service to the suggestion that \nyou would have preferred that the mandatory minimum had not been in a \nbill, then voting for it anyway, just creates another mandatory minimum \nand guarantees that those who support mandatory minimums will include \nthem in the next crime bill. And more mandatory minimums will be \ncreated and the failed war on drugs will continue.\n  If our goal is to ensure that we prosecute transnational drug \ntraffickers, let us provide adequate funding to local, state, and \nfederal law enforcement agencies to do so under multiple federal \nstatutes that already achieve that goal, without raising these \nproblematic implementation and fairness concerns.\n  In summary, while I support the underlying goal of S. 32, I have \ngrave concerns about its redundancy, its erosion of the mens reas \nstandard commonly used in these offenses, its broad sweep and its use \nof mandatory minimums. Therefore, I urge my colleagues to vote no on S. \n32.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 32.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2179-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2179-H2181]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 GOOD SAMARITAN ASSESSMENT ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5048, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016, was introduced \nby our colleague, Congressman Frank Guinta, co-chair of the House \nBipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. This legislation \ndirects the Government Accountability Office to study the various Good \nSamaritan laws in effect in States across the country.\n  Generally speaking, every State has some form of Good Samaritan law, \nwhich protects from prosecution citizens who render aid in good faith \nto someone in need of assistance. As a general matter, courts will not \nhold a Good Samaritan liable if he or she rendered care as a result of \nan emergency, the emergency or injury was not caused by the Good \nSamaritan himself, and the care was not given in a negligent or \nreckless manner.\n  In the context of opioids, Good Samaritan law refers to laws that \nprovide immunity for responding to an opioid overdose by rendering aid \nor by calling 911.\n  Today more than half the States and the District of Columbia have \nenacted some form of Good Samaritan law that provides immunity or \nlimits liability for those who report an opioid overdose or render care \nto a person experiencing such an emergency.\n  In my home State of Virginia, the general assembly passed a Good \nSamaritan law in 2015, which provides immunity for individuals who \ncontact emergency services to report an overdose, provided the caller \nremains at the scene of the overdose until law enforcement responds, \nidentifies himself when law enforcement responds, and cooperates with \nany criminal investigation.\n  Given the recent proliferation of these laws at the State level and \nCongress' desire and duty to address the opioid epidemic, it is fitting \nwe assess how the various Good Samaritan laws work to protect our \ncitizens and help save lives. H.R. 5048 will direct the GAO to help us \nget the information we need.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5048, the Good Samaritan \nAssessment Act. This legislation is part of a series of bills the House \nis considering this week in an effort to address the growing public \nhealth crisis in our Nation that is being caused by a surge in heroin \nuse and abuse of other opioid drugs.\n  Without question, abuse of opioid drugs can have serious long-term \neffects, including physical and functional changes to the brain \naffecting impulse, reward, and motivation. But opioid abuse can have a \nmore immediate and serious consequence. An overdose can threaten the \nlife of the victim.\n  In recent years, heroin and prescription opioid drug overdoses have \nrisen sharply in the United States. According to the Centers for \nDisease Control and Prevention, drug overdose deaths more than doubled \nbetween 1999 and 2014. In 2014 alone, more than 47,000 people died from \ndrug overdoses, the highest of any previous year.\n  Fortunately, many of these tragic deaths can be prevented through the \nadministration of an opioid reversal drug such as naloxone. But to be \neffective in saving lives, these drugs must be administered on an \nemergency basis.\n\n[[Page H2180]]\n\n  First responders answering emergency calls or caregivers who are \ntreating drug users are frequently in the best position to administer a \nlifesaving reversal drug in time to be effective.\n  An overdose victim's family and friends as well as other drug users \nare often the first people to be aware that an individual is suffering \na drug overdose. Nevertheless, these individuals can hesitate or even \nfail to call 911 out of fear that they may be prosecuted or otherwise \nheld liable if something goes wrong.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Similarly, first responders and other potential caregivers may \nhesitate or fail to administer emergency medical treatment for fear of \npossible adverse consequences.\n  To alleviate such concerns and help ensure that overdose victims \nreceive timely medical treatment, the Office of National Drug Control \nPolicy has been working with States and municipalities to enact so-\ncalled Good Samaritan laws.\n  These laws are intended to protect from civil or criminal liability \nfirst responders, caregivers, and others who call for emergency \nassistance in overdose cases or administer opioid reversal drugs.\n  Currently, 35 States and the District of Columbia now have at least \nsome form of a Good Samaritan or a 911 drug immunity law, but the \nprotections afforded by these laws vary significantly from jurisdiction \nto jurisdiction.\n  H.R. 5048 directs the Government Accountability Office to study and \nreport to the appropriate committees of Congress on the efforts of the \nOffice of National Drug Control Policy to expand Good Samaritan \nprotections.\n  In addition, the study would examine any law that exempts from civil \nor criminal liability individuals who contact emergency service \nproviders in response to a drug overdose or who administer opioid \nreversal drugs to overdose victims.\n  The report must also include a compilation of Good Samaritan laws \ncurrently in effect. The analysis and data required to be generated by \nH.R. 5048 will greatly assist Congress in understanding the various \npolicies adopted by the States.\n  Accordingly, I sincerely urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5048.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, REVIVE! is the Opioid Overdose and Naloxone Education \nprogram for the Commonwealth of Virginia. REVIVE! provides training to \nprofessionals, stakeholders, and others on how to recognize and respond \nto an opioid overdose emergency with the administration of naloxone.\n  REVIVE! is a collaborative effort led by the Virginia Department of \nBehavioral Health and Developmental Services, working alongside the \nVirginia Department of Health, the Virginia Department of Health \nProfessions, recovery community organizations such as the McShin \nFoundation, OneCare of Southwest Virginia, the Substance Abuse and \nAddiction Recovery Alliance of Virginia, and other stakeholders.\n  Virginia has been severely impacted by opioid abuse, particularly the \nabuse of prescription drugs. In 1999, the first year for which such \ndata is available, approximately 23 people died from abuse of fentanyl, \nhydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone, the leading prescription opioids \nabused, commonly referred to as FHMO.\n  By 2013, the most recent year for which complete data is available, \n386 individuals died from the abuse of FHMO, an increase of 1,578 \npercent, with fentanyl being the primary substance fueling this \nincrease.\n  In 2013 alone, there was an increase of more than 100 percent in \ndeaths attributed to fentanyl use. In 2013, as before in 2011, drug-\nrelated deaths happened at a higher per capita level, 11 deaths per \n100,000, than motor vehicle crashes, 10.1 per 100,000.\n  The 2013 data provides evidence of other disturbing trends in \nVirginia, including a sharp rise in heroin deaths. In 2010, only 49 \ndeaths in Virginia were attributed to heroin use. By 2013, that figure \nhad risen to 213, an increase of 334 percent in only 4 years, while \ncocaine deaths remained relatively level.\n  The changes in drug-related deaths in Virginia in 2013 are not \nlimited to which substances had the greatest impact. The geography of \nthe opioid epidemic in Virginia is shifting as well.\n  In past years, the western portion of Virginia, the portion that I \nrepresent, typically accounted for approximately one-third of drug-\nrelated deaths in any given year. In 2013, for the first time since \nthese records have been maintained, the prevalence of drug-related \ndeaths was spread evenly over the Commonwealth, as the eastern region \nof Virginia saw an increase of more than 51 percent in drug-related \ndeaths in a single year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, H.R. 5048 will help to provide valuable \ninformation that will assist comprehensive efforts needed to combat the \ngrowing scourge of opioid abuse that is affecting millions of Americans \nand help reduce the tragic loss of life resulting from drug overdoses.\n  Accordingly, I urge support of the passage of H.R. 5048.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta), the chief \nsponsor of the legislation, to close debate.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this legislation, \nthe Good Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016.\n  This legislation simply directs the GAO to study State and local Good \nSamaritan laws that protect caregivers, law enforcement personnel, and \nfirst responders who administer opioid overdose reversal drugs or \ndevices, as well as those who contact emergency service providers in \nresponse to an overdose from civil or criminal liability.\n  A Good Samaritan law offers legal protection to people who give \nreasonable assistance to those who are or who they believe to be \ninjured, ill, or otherwise incapacitated.\n  These laws vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction but generally they \nprevent an individual who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress \nfrom being successfully sued or prosecuted for wrongdoing. Their \npurpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help an individual in \nneed for fear of legal repercussions.\n\n  This legislation is crucial toward understanding which Good Samaritan \nlaws are working well to provide a framework for others to follow.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, last year we had 430 people die \nfrom a drug-related overdose. The number continues to climb because the \ncoroner's office has not concluded the autopsies from last year.\n  Imagine a family member who is trying to grieve over their loved one \nwho had the illness of addiction and somebody stood over that body and \nwas afraid to help.\n  I think that this legislation is important, and I am glad that it is \nstriking a bipartisan tone, because this is about saving lives. This is \nabout providing assistance to those who are in moments of deepest \ndespair in their life.\n  I work on this issue not just on behalf of my constituents and the \n50,000 people across the country who have passed due to this sickness, \nbut I also do it in the name of my friend, Abi Lizotte, who is a \nsurvivor, who is 8 months clean, with a 6-month old child, who \ntestified at a hearing in New Hampshire about the possibility of \nsuccess because she had somebody who assisted her.\n  This addiction has ripped the country apart. We have an obligation as \na Congress to act, and I am so pleased with the leadership of Chairman \nGoodlatte and so many Republicans and Democrats who have shared the \nsame hope and understanding that life is worth fighting for.\n  So I urge my colleagues to support this legislation. I appreciate the \ncommittee's work, the chairman's work, the bipartisan work.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5048, the \n``Good Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016.''\n  Our nation currently faces epidemic levels of opioid drug users and \naddicts, with a corresponding increase in the number of opioid drug \noverdoses and deaths.\n\n[[Page H2181]]\n\n  According to the Centers for Disease Control, drug overdose death \nrates more than doubled between1999 and 2014.\n  Each day, more than 100 Americans die as a result of an overdose, \nmaking drug overdoses the leading cause of death in the United States.\n  Compounding this tragedy is the fact that many of these deaths could \nhave been prevented if the victim had received emergency medical \ntreatment.\n  Opioid reversal drugs such as Naloxone have proven effective in \nreversing opioid drug overdoses and reviving victims.\n  But a victim's chances of surviving an overdose can depend on how \nquickly medical assistance is received.\n  Those closest to a victim--family, friends, or other drug users--are \ncommonly the first to become aware that an individual is suffering an \noverdose and needs emergency medical assistance.\n  Their prompt call to 911 can mean the difference between life and \ndeath.\n  Similarly, first responders or other persons serving as caregivers to \nindividuals with drug problems are often in the best position to \npromptly administer a reversal drug.\n  However, such life-saving assistance may not be made available in \ntime if a witness to an overdose delays or fails to call 911, or a \ncaregiver or first responder does not promptly administer an overdose \nreversal drug or device, due to fear that they might be prosecuted or \notherwise held responsible for their involvement, or held liable if \nsomething goes wrong.\n  To encourage people to seek medical attention for someone suffering \nan overdose, and to have first responders trained, equipped, and able \nto administer opioid reversal drugs or devices, states and localities \nneed to enact Good Samaritan laws that protect from criminal or civil \nliability individuals who seek or provide life-saving assistance in \ndrug overdose situations.\n  In 2013, only ten states and the District of Columbia had such drug \noverdose Good Samaritan laws.\n  The Office of National Drug Control Policy (ONDCP) has been working \nwith states and municipalities to enact Good Samaritan laws providing \nprotections to individuals who call for emergency assistance and first \nresponders, law enforcement personnel, and caregivers who administer \nopioid reversal drugs or devices.\n  Thanks in part to ONDCP's efforts, 35 states and the District of \nColumbia now have some form of Good Samaritan or emergency drug \ntreatment immunity law.\n  Under this bill, the General Accounting Office would provide the \nappropriate House and Senate committees with a report on the results of \nONDCP's work, as well as a compilation of the various Good Samaritan \nlaws currently in effect.\n  While the report will not take a position on any formulation of such \nlaws, this information will be helpful to Congress and the states in \ncataloging and understanding the various approaches states are taking \nwith respect to this issue.\n  With more information, we can make better decisions and adopt the \nbest approach.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 5048.\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 5048 the \nGood Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016. Addiction to opioids and other \nprescription pain relievers have become an epidemic in the United \nStates. According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 2.1 \nmillion Americans have an addiction to opioid drugs. While the use or \nprescription can assist individual pain, the risk for addiction is \nbecoming a major problem. This has resulted in people being put into \nsituations to try to save someone's life a drug overdose. According to \ncurrent law, any emergency personnel who administers drugs to combat an \noverdose can be prosecuted.\n  If individuals are worried that they will be punished for saving \nsomeone's life, many lives could be lost to drug overdoses. According \nto estimates between 2002-2014 the number of deaths from heroin have \nquadrupled and prescription opioids have killed more Americans than all \nother drugs combined. In my district, I have seen many people affected \nby drug abuse issues and the Good Samaritan Assessment Act will not \nonly help save the lives of people in our district, but American's \nnationwide. This bill will start the process to allow individuals to \nnot be criminally charged for people administering drugs to save \nsomeone's life.\n  The Good Samaritan Assessment Act of 2016 will require the \nComptroller General of the United States to study Good Samaritan laws \nthat pertain to opioid overdoses and other purposes. By passing this \nlegislation to do research there would be more efforts to encourage \nGood Samaritan laws to be put into place in the United States.\n  I would like to close by saying that I am proud of our chamber for \ntaking this important step to make sure that Americans would not face \nthe possibility of being criminally prosecuted for trying to save \nsomeone's life. I also want to thank my colleagues for recognizing the \nimportance of being a good samaritan, and actively helping those in \nneed.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 5052, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 5052, the Opioid Program Evaluation Act, or OPEN Act, is a bill \nthat would require an evaluation of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse \nReduction Grant Program that will be authorized by H.R. 5046, and other \nopioid-related grant programs administered by the Department of Health \nand Human Services.\n  This bipartisan bill, sponsored by the gentleman from California (Mr. \nMcCarthy), the majority leader, and the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. \nHoyer), the minority whip, requires the Attorney General, through an \narrangement with the National Academy of Sciences and the Secretary of \nHHS, through an arrangement with the National Academy of Sciences, or \nother entity, to:\n  Identify outcomes that are to be achieved by the activities funded by \nCongress to address opioid abuse;\n  Develop the metrics by which each program's performance will be \nevaluated;\n  Complete an interim evaluation assessing the nature and extent of \nopioid abuse and illegal opioid distribution in the United States;\n  And carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness of the programs.\n  Additionally, to increase transparency and facilitate the evaluation \nof the performance of the programs, the bill requires grantees to \ncollect and annually report data on the activities conducted pursuant \nto these programs.\n  Evaluations such as these can be Congress' best measure of how well a \nFederal program or agency is operating. At their conclusion, we hope to \nlearn, for example, whether a substantial number of criminal justice \nagency personnel have received training on substance abuse disorders \nand co-occurring mental illness and adapted their procedures \naccordingly.\n  We also hope to learn the extent to which offenders offered a \ntreatment alternative to incarceration have benefited from a response \nthat integrates substance abuse services into the traditional criminal \njustice system.\n  I agree with the bill's sponsors that Congress must demand greater \nachievement and increased transparency and accountability with respect \nto our Federal grant programs. Therefore, I thank the bill's sponsors \nfor the contribution this bill makes to the effort to address opioid \nabuse, as well as to our congressional oversight efforts.\n  I urge support of this important bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                             Committee on Energy and Commerce,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 3, 2016.\n     Hon. Bob Goodlatte,\n     Chairman, Committee on the Judiciary, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Goodlatte: I am writing to notify you that \n     the Committee on Energy and Commerce will forgo action on \n     H.R. 5052, a bill to direct the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the \n     effectiveness of grant programs that provide grants for the \n     primary purpose of providing assistance in addressing \n     problems pertaining to opioid abuse, and for other purposes, \n     so that it may proceed expeditiously to the House floor for \n     consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the Committee on \n     Energy and Commerce's jurisdictional interests over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way altered. In addition, the \n     Committee reserves the right to seek conferees on H.R. 5052 \n     and requests your support when such a request is made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding and ask that a copy of our exchange of letters \n     on this matter be included in the Congressional Record during \n     consideration of the bill on the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                       Fred Upton,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                         House of Representatives,\n\n\n                                   Committee on the Judiciary,\n\n                                      Washington, DC, May 4, 2016.\n     Hon. Fred Upton,\n     Chairman, Committee on Energy and Commerce, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Upton: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 5052, a bill to direct the Attorney General and the \n     Secretary of Health and Human Services to evaluate the \n     effectiveness of grant programs that provide grants for the \n     primary purpose of providing assistance in addressing \n     problems pertaining to opioid abuse, and for other purposes, \n     which the Judiciary Committee ordered reported favorably to \n     the House on April 27, 2016.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego formal \n     consideration of H.R. 5052 so that it may proceed to the \n     House floor. I acknowledge that although you are waiving \n     formal consideration of the bill, the Committee on Energy and \n     Commerce is in no way waiving its jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in those provisions of the bill that \n     fall within your Rule X jurisdiction. In addition, I would \n     support your effort to seek appointment of an appropriate \n     number of conferees on any House-Senate conference involving \n     this legislation.\n       Finally, I am pleased to include this letter and your \n     letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration \n     of H.R. 5052.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Bob Goodlatte,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 5052, the Opioid Program Evaluation Act, \notherwise known as the OPEN Act. The OPEN Act is part of a \ncomprehensive, bipartisan series of proposals being considered by \nCongress to combat the opioid abuse epidemic that is afflicting \nmillions of Americans. For example, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse \nReduction Act will provide critical funding assistance to States so \nthat they can create and implement a wide variety of strategies, \nincluding alternatives to incarceration, that are designed to reduce \nopioid abuse.\n  These grant programs have tremendous promise, as they will enable \ncriminal justice agencies to focus on what is likely to be the most \neffective\n\n[[Page H2183]]\n\nsolutions based on their specific, individual needs. Jurisdictions, for \nexample, may choose to implement the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion \napproach established with success in Seattle and which is beginning to \nbe used in other cities.\n  The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act would also assist with \nthe provision of medication-assisted treatment and help first \nresponders prevent deaths by allowing them to obtain and administer \ndrugs that revive overdose victims. Strategies like these are worthy of \nour continued support.\n  At the same time, it is important that we track the actual results of \nthese programs so that we can objectively determine the most successful \nstrategies for combating opioid abuse and adjust our efforts and \nresource allocation accordingly.\n  The OPEN Act is a commonsense measure that will provide a meaningful \nway to assist the effectiveness of these grants. Under this act, the \nDepartments of Justice and Health and Human Services will identify \noutcomes achieved by activities funded under these grant programs. The \nOPEN Act requires these agencies to develop the metrics by which the \nachievement of such outcomes can be objectively analyzed. Those \noutcomes and metrics will, in turn, be studied by the National Academy \nof Sciences or other independent evaluators and reported on to \nCongress. Armed with this information, Congress will then be able to \nassess the success of the programs funded by these grants.\n  I, therefore, support H.R. 5052 and commend it without reservation to \nmy colleagues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, it is my pleasure to yield such time as \nhe may consume to the gentleman from California (Mr. McCarthy), the \nmajority leader, who is also the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nwant to thank the chairman for his work in dealing with opioid abuse \nthroughout the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, where I come from in Kern County, California, over 160 \npeople are sent to the emergency room for opioid overdoses every single \nyear. Every single one of those stories is tragic.\n  Addiction tears families apart, it uproots communities, and it \ndeprives people of the basic freedom to live the lives they want. \nOpioid addiction is only getting worse in this country. The most recent \nCenters for Disease Control and Prevention data show that 78 Americans \ndie every single day from overdose--78 Americans.\n  We need to do something about it. Ultimately, it is individuals, \nfamilies, and the communities that are on the front line in the fight \nagainst addiction. But Congress can do something, too. The Federal \nGovernment can and should support community efforts to stop opioid \nabuse and help those in recovery.\n  So we have over one dozen bills we will pass this week that target at \nthe center of the opioid addiction: the drug trade, prescription abuse, \nhealth care, prevention, you name it.\n  But it is not enough to pass laws and start new programs. After all, \na lot of government programs sound good, but they don't mean as much if \nthey don't work. Most programs, if not every government program, are \ncreated with the very best of intentions; but good intentions don't \nmake good government.\n  When Congress decided to set up a program using money and resources \nfrom the American people, we had better be sure that what we are doing \nis making a difference and actually helping those in need as best we \ncan. That is why Congressman Steny Hoyer and I drafted the Opioid \nProgram Evaluation Act, better known as the OPEN Act, because we need \nto actually help stop the abuse, not just create programs to talk about \nit. We need to prevent addiction from happening. We need to help those \naddicted to recover, and we can't afford to waste time and money \naccomplishing these goals.\n  Ultimately, we need to use the power of data to determine if these \nprograms actually work. It is that simple. We live in the age of data, \nand innovators around the country and around the world are using data \nto do everything from providing better service to customers, to \npreventing disease and to preventing crimes across this country.\n  We can learn from that. We need to bring data and innovation into \ngovernment. When we do that, we can ensure government programs work as \nintended and that it is in the most effective way possible. That is \nwhat this bill will do. It gives healthcare officials, researchers, and \nengaged citizens the opportunity to see exactly what their government \nis doing and then to use the information to make the best possible \ntreatment for those who are addicted to opioids.\n  For months now, I have been working with other Members on the \nInnovation Initiative with this exact goal: to modernize government. \nThis is just the latest bill shaping our policies and reforming the way \nWashington works.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge the Members to join and support this bill.\n  I want to thank the minority whip for his work, his thoughtfulness, \nand his research in making this happen.\n  Today is a vote for accountability. Vote for more than just words. \nVote to effectively fight the opioid epidemic.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Maryland (Mr. Hoyer), the distinguished \nminority whip of the Congress and the coauthor of this measure.\n  Mr. HOYER. Mr. Speaker, I thank my friend, the ranking member and \nformer chairman of the Judiciary Committee, and, if I could say, in a \nbipartisan bill, maybe the next chairman of the Judiciary Committee, \nwith all due respect to my friend Mr. Goodlatte. I thank the gentleman \nvery much for bringing this bill to the floor.\n  I thank the majority leader for his comments, and I rise in support, \nobviously, of this legislation, which I am proud to cosponsor with my \nfriend, the majority leader, Mr. McCarthy, from California.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill, as he said, will help ensure that future \ninvestments in the fight against opioid addiction are allocated in the \nmost effective way possible. We owe that to the American people, and we \nowe it to the effectiveness of our efforts against this scourge on our \ncountry.\n  Our bill requires the Departments of Justice and Health and Human \nServices to develop, as you have heard, metrics by which opioid-related \ngrant programs will be evaluated: Do they work? Are they worth the \ninvestment? It will facilitate data collection and analysis in order to \ndetermine best practices--what works and what doesn't--so policymakers \ncan best target resources.\n  The opioid epidemic is a major public health challenge that requires \nand demands bipartisan cooperation and leadership across the branches \nand offices of our government at the Federal, State, and local levels. \nThis crisis has already quadrupled--quadrupled--the rate of overdose \ndeaths between 2000 and 2013 and continues to plague communities across \nthe country.\n  Between 2007 and 2014, 237 people in southern Maryland died as a \nresult of prescription opioid overdoses, and 287 more died from using \nheroin, a drug to which those addicted to opioid painkillers often turn \nwhen they can no longer access prescription medications. This is a \ncritical problem affecting lives and families across the Nation, which \nis why the Congress must take action and is doing so on a bipartisan \nbasis.\n  In addition to the OPEN Act, the House is considering a number of \nbipartisan bills this week that will likely be adopted as part of an \namendment to the legislation passed in the Senate, the Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, CARA.\n  Democratic Members have been instrumental in writing these bills in \nsuch a way that the policies and programs they create have the greatest \nchance of saving lives and preventing addiction. The good news is they \nhave worked with their Republican colleagues, and their Republican \ncolleagues have worked with them. These bills reflect the seriousness \nwith which Democrats and Republicans have been leading on this issue \nand the bipartisan nature of efforts in Congress to address the \nchallenge.\n  But it isn't enough to enact these bills and the ones put forward by \nmy Republican colleagues. We need to ensure that our efforts to combat \nopioid addiction receive the funding necessary\n\n[[Page H2184]]\n\nto succeed. That funding is not in this bill, nor is it in some of the \nother bills that will be considered. It is nice to say that we ought to \nget something done, but if we do not apply the resources to accomplish \nthe objective, it is empty rhetoric and political posturing.\n  President Obama has requested $1.1 billion to fight opioid addiction, \nbut the majority has not yet committed to acting on that request, nor \nhas it committed to funding the bipartisan legislation that we expect \nto pass this week. The legislation is good, but if we don't give it the \nresources to be implemented, it will not bring the relief that is \nneeded.\n  So as we work together to take these important steps to prevent \nopioid abuse and promote recovery, Congress needs to work together to \nensure that these efforts are not left unfunded. I am certain that \nthere is a way we can work together to pay for them and help our \ncommunities fight this epidemic that has destroyed so many lives and \ndevastated communities and families across this country.\n  Again, I want to thank the Republican leader, Mr. McCarthy. He and I \nhave found opportunities to work together, and we believe those have \nhad positive results. He has partnered with me on this OPEN Act, and I \nhope we can keep working together to fund these initiatives and help \nend the scourge, the cancer, of opioid abuse and addiction in our \ncountry. If we do so, Americans will thank us, and they will think we \nhave done a better job, frankly, than they think we are doing.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I want to say to my colleagues I deeply appreciate the observations \nand perceptions on both sides of the aisle in dealing with this \nsubject.\n  The approaches to dealing with opioid abuse should be based on \nevidence of their effectiveness and ability to save lives. The OPEN Act \nwill provide the information necessary to properly make that \nevaluation. Accordingly, I sincerely urge my colleagues to support H.R. \n5052.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this good \nlegislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5052, the \n``Opioid Program Evaluation Act of 2016,'' otherwise known as the \n``OPEN'' Act.\n  This is an important bill intended to provide a mechanism to evaluate \nthe effectiveness of the grant programs being considered by Congress to \naddress the serious and growing problem of opioid abuse.\n  The current surge in the use of heroin and other opioid drugs such as \nhydrocodone and oxycodone requires a strong, national response.\n  Opioid abuse leads to physical and functional changes to parts of the \nbrain affecting, impulse, reward, and motivation.\n  In recent years, it is estimated that the number of heroin users in \nthe United States has grown to over 680,000 people.\n  Similarly, the use of other opioids, such as hydrocodone and \noxycodone has grown by 100 percent and 500 percent respectively.\n  To fight this crisis involving illegal opioids and the abuse of \nprescription opioids, we must employ a multi-faceted approach that \nactually achieves results.\n  This bill would evaluate the effectiveness of H.R. 5046, the \n``Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act,'' a bill reported by the \nJudiciary Committee.\n  That bill was written with the goal of assisting States in the \nimplementation of a variety of strategies, including:\n  Providing treatment alternatives to incarceration; training criminal \njustice agency personnel on substance use and co-occurring mental \nillness; increasing collaboration between State criminal justice \nagencies and State substance abuse systems; purchasing opioid reversal \ndrugs and devices for first responders and providing training to carry \nand administer opioid reversal drugs and devices; and implementing \nmedication-assisted treatment programs used or operated by criminal \njustice agencies.\n  As opioid abuse grant programs move forward, it is important we find \na way to evaluate the success of these strategies and the effectiveness \nof the programs in implementing them.\n  This is why I support the requirements of the OPEN Act.\n  Specifically, the OPEN Act will:\n  Instruct the Departments of Justice and Health and Human Services to \nidentify outcomes to be achieved and develop metrics for evaluating \nsuccess in achieving those outcomes; enlist the National Academy of \nSciences to evaluate and report to Congress on the outcomes and metrics \nof the grant programs; require grantees to report annually on the \nprogress made through the grants; and instruct the Departments of \nJustice and Health and Human Services to complete an evaluation of the \neffectiveness of their grant programs after five years.\n  I am confident that the comprehensive approach we are taking to \naddress opioid abuse will help address the Nation's growing epidemic.\n  For these reasons, I support the OPEN Act and the goal of ensuring \nthe best possible response to treat and prevent opioid abuse in \nAmerica, and I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The question \nis on the motion offered by the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) \nthat the House suspend the rules and pass the bill, H.R. 5052, as \namended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, on that, I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2184-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2184-H2186]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1730\n BULLETPROOF VEST PARTNERSHIP GRANT PROGRAM REAUTHORIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include extraneous material on S. 125, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Since 1999, the Bulletproof Vest Program, or BVP, has awarded more \nthan 13,000 jurisdictions a total of $393 million in Federal funds for \nthe purchase of over 1 million bulletproof vests. The Bulletproof Vest \nGrant Program is a critical resource for State and local jurisdictions \nthat has proven to save lives.\n  We must be sure that our law enforcement officers are protected from \nthe risks inherent in the job. In 2016 alone, there have been 17 police \nofficers killed by gunfire. In March, a bulletproof vest saved the life \nof Officer Andy Harris, who was shot when he responded to a shots fired \ncall. He is but one of many officers saved by a bulletproof vest.\n  Based on data collected and recorded by the Department of Justice, \nprotective vests were directly attributable to saving the lives of at \nleast 33 law enforcement and corrections officers in 20 different \nStates in a single year. At least 14 of those lifesaving vests had been \npurchased, in part, with BVP funds.\n  This bill reauthorizes BVP grants at $25 million per year and extends \nthe authorization through 2020. The bill has the support of all major \nlaw enforcement organizations, and has been approved by the Senate. \nWith this authorization, we will immediately be impacting the safety of \nour law enforcement officers.\n  Law enforcement officers across the United States put their lives on \nthe line every day to protect their communities and fellow citizens. As \nthey continually make sacrifices for us, we must ensure that we provide \nthem with resources to protect their lives as they protect ours.\n  Today's approval of legislation reauthorizing a critical bulletproof \nvest grant program for State and local law enforcement officers will \nsave lives. I thank Representative LoBiondo and Senate Judiciary \nCommittee Ranking Member Leahy for their work on this issue and \ndedication to our Nation's law enforcement officers.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Members of the House, I rise in strong support of S. 125, the \nBulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program.\n  This bill, which would provide matching grants to State, local, and \ntribal law enforcement agencies so that they can purchase bullet-\nresistant vests for their officers, is important for several reasons.\n  To begin with, S. 125 will facilitate the provision of critical \nprotection to law enforcement officers, who often risk their lives \nwhile serving our communities. While some of the approximately 800,000 \nlaw enforcement officers throughout the United States do have some form \nof bullet-resistant armor, far too many of these brave men and women \nare not afforded the same protection due to State and local budget \nconstraints.\n  Since its inception, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program \nhas assisted State and local law enforcement agencies in obtaining the \nnecessary protection equipment to safeguard the lives of their \nofficers. To date, this program has provided more than 1 million \nofficers with lifesaving vests. During the past 30 years, bullet-\nresistant vests have saved the lives of more than 3,000 law enforcement \nofficers.\n  The timeliness of this bill provides a perfect opportunity to \nacknowledge National Police Week. Right now, thousands of law \nenforcement officers are in Washington, D.C., to honor their fellow \nofficers who paid the ultimate sacrifice.\n  Each year, the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial holds a \nvigil to recognize the newly engraved names of officers who died while \nserving and protecting the people in our communities.\n  We must do everything in our power to protect those who protect us. \nThe Bulletproof Vest Program will help prevent the deaths of officers, \nand we hope that even fewer names will have to be added to the National \nLaw Enforcement Officers Memorial.\n  The bill is critical because it provides up to 50 percent of the \ncosts for an officer's new armor vest. The officer's department, in \nturn, pays the remaining costs. Importantly, small police departments \nthat service areas with less than 100,000 residents receive priority \nfunding under this measure.\n  Finally, S. 125 responds to the critical concern that bullet-\nresistant vests--to achieve their intended goals of protecting an \nofficer from life-threatening gunshots--must meet certain standards. To \nthis end, the bill requires a law enforcement agency to purchase body \narmor that meets strict performance standards set by the National \nInstitute of Justice.\n  Additionally, the agency must have a policy that encourages officers \nto wear their vests while on duty. And, the agency must ensure that \nthese vests properly fit female officers as well.\n  For all of these reasons, I strongly support S. 125.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, we are prepared to close, and I reserve \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of S. \n125, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization \nAct.\n  Our brave law enforcement officers put their lives in harm's way \nevery day to protect our communities. The least we can do is provide \nthem with the proper safety gear.\n\n  That is why we must authorize the highly successful Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program to ensure that all of America's law \nenforcement officers have access to the lifesaving protection they \nneed. My friend, Mr. Reichert, from the coast, and myself, pledged when \nwe became cochairs of public safety in the Congress many, many years \nago that not only do we need more police on the beat, but we need to \nprotect them. There is no question in my mind we have allowed the bad \nguys to outarm the good guys, and we have to take a look at that.\n  Since it was established in 1999, this program has provided grantees \nwith approximately $247 million for more than 1 million lifesaving \nvests in over 13,000 State and local law enforcement agencies \nthroughout the country. I did not hear any of those communities turn \nback the money. You are talking about 13,000 State and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  There is a place for the Federal Government. There are \nresponsibilities we cannot circumvent. While many officers are \nprotected by bullet-resistant armor, there are an alarming number of \nofficers in departments across our country that cannot afford this same\n\n[[Page H2186]]\n\nprotection due to local budget constraints.\n  As long as I am in Congress, I will continue to do all that I can to \nwork closely with law enforcement officials, not just talking with them \nand patting them on the back, so they have adequate resources to \nprotect themselves while patrolling our streets.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bipartisan \nlegislation that will help improve the protection of our law \nenforcement officials.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfor my closing remarks.\n  First, I would like to recognize the distinguished Senator from \nVermont, Patrick Leahy, as being very, very influential in developing \nthe measure before us under discussion now.\n  In closing, I note that we expect our law enforcement officers to \nprotect those who are unable to protect themselves. But to do so, \nhowever, we must ensure that these brave men and women are themselves \nprotected.\n  In 2012, for example, armor-resistant vests were credited with saving \nthe lives of 33 law enforcement officers in 20 different States. \nFourteen of those vests were purchased with the help of Bulletproof \nVest Partnership Program funds.\n  In my home district in Michigan, the police departments for Highland \nPark, Melvindale, Romulus City, Wayne County, and others have received \nfunds through this important program.\n  While some of the approximately 800,000 law enforcement officers \nthroughout our country do have some form of bullet-resistant armor, far \ntoo many of these brave men and women are not afforded the same \nprotection due to State and local budget constraints.\n  It is with great pleasure and privilege that I assure every Member of \nthe House that S. 125 will ensure that this program continues to \nprovide such vitally needed assistance.\n  I urge support for this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe), a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee, and he will close debate on our side.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Virginia \nfor yielding time.\n  Mr. Speaker, last month, a few weeks ago, Alden Clopton was on patrol \nafter midnight. He is a deputy constable in Houston, Texas. He works \nfor the constable's office at Precinct 7.\n  Constables are just like deputy sheriffs and police officers. They \nhave all the power under the State of Texas laws as any other police \nofficer.\n  He was on routine patrol with his rookie partner trainee, Ann \nGlasgow, and they made a traffic stop in a tough part of town in \nHouston, Texas. As the investigation is taking place, Mr. Speaker, some \noutlaw snuck up behind Alden Clopton and pulled out a pistol and shot \nat him six times in the back.\n  Some of those bullets made their mark and some of those bullets \nmissed. He owes his life, he says, to the bulletproof vest that he was \nwearing. Constable May Walker, a constable at Precinct 7, said he \nsurvived because he was wearing a vest.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  You may have never heard of Alden Clopton, but he is a peace officer \nwho comes from a peace officer family. His wife is a deputy sheriff; \nhis three brothers are all in law enforcement; and his son is a cop in \nMississippi, I believe. He lives today because he had a bulletproof \nvest on. As the ranking member has said and as the chairman has said, \nwe owe it to peace officers to protect them when they go out in society \nand do society's dirty work for us--to protect and serve us.\n  This week is National Police Week. We honor our police officers--\nthose who protect us, those who work the thin blue line to protect us \nfrom those who would do us harm. This is an appropriate piece of \nlegislation to show peace officers like Alden Clopton and all of those \nthroughout the country that we have their backs--that we support them--\nand that Congress is going to do what is necessary to protect them \nwhile they protect us.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LoBIONDO. Mr. Speaker, the Senate counterpart to my legislation, \nH.R. 228, that will reauthorize the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Act, \ncomes during a momentous week in law enforcement--National Police Week, \nstarting this Sunday.\n  Thank you, as well, to the gentleman from Indiana, Mr. Visclosky, for \nworking with me on this legislation since its original passage in 1999.\n  Recent tragic events highlight the threats our men and women in \nuniform face each day.\n  However, these all-important vests cannot protect the lives of those \nwho do not have access to them.\n  Now more than ever, it is imperative that we give law enforcement the \ntools they need so they may do their jobs and carry out their duties \nsafely and effectively.\n  The Bulletproof Vest Partnership program is one of those critical \ntools.\n  In fact, we know from some of the most recent statistics, that 14 of \n33 officers saved by bulletproof vests, were purchased using funds from \nthe Bulletproof Vest Partnership program.\n  Since 1999, over 13,000 jurisdictions across the country have \nparticipated in the BVP program.\n  I encourage those law enforcement officials and concerned citizens \nlistening, especially those in South Jersey, to apply for this vital \nprogram.\n  The deadline to do so, May 16th, is quickly approaching.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, S. 125.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2186-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2186-H2189]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT SELF-DEFENSE AND PROTECTION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 2137) to ensure Federal law enforcement officers remain able \nto ensure their own safety, and the safety of their families, during a \ncovered furlough.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 2137\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Federal Law Enforcement \n     Self-Defense and Protection Act of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n       Congress finds the following:\n       (1) Too often, Federal law enforcement officers encounter \n     potentially violent criminals, placing officers in danger of \n     grave physical harm.\n       (2) In 2012 alone, 1,857 Federal law enforcement officers \n     were assaulted, with 206 sustaining serious injuries.\n       (3) From 2008 through 2011, an additional 8,587 Federal law \n     enforcement officers were assaulted.\n       (4) Federal law enforcement officers remain a target even \n     when they are off-duty. Over the past 3 years, 27 law \n     enforcement officers have been killed off-duty.\n       (5) It is essential that law enforcement officers are able \n     to defend themselves, so they can carry out their critical \n     missions and ensure their own personal safety and the safety \n     of their families whether on-duty or off-duty.\n       (6) These dangers to law enforcement officers continue to \n     exist during a covered furlough.\n\n     SEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\n\n       In this Act--\n       (1) the term ``agency'' means each authority of the \n     executive, legislative, or judicial branch of the Government \n     of the United States;\n       (2) the term ``covered Federal law enforcement officer'' \n     means any individual who--\n       (A) is an employee of an agency;\n       (B) has the authority to make arrests or apprehensions for, \n     or prosecute, violations of Federal law; and\n       (C) on the day before the date on which the applicable \n     covered furlough begins, is authorized by the agency \n     employing the individual to carry a firearm in the course of \n     official duties;\n       (3) the term ``covered furlough'' means a planned event by \n     an agency during which employees are involuntarily furloughed \n     due to downsizing, reduced funding, lack of work, or any \n     budget situation including a lapse in appropriations; and\n       (4) the term ``firearm'' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 921 of title 18, United States Code.\n\n     SEC. 4. PROTECTING FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICERS WHO ARE \n                   SUBJECTED TO A COVERED FURLOUGH.\n\n       During a covered furlough, a covered Federal law \n     enforcement officer shall have the\n\n[[Page H2187]]\n\n     same rights to carry a firearm issued by the Federal \n     Government as if the covered furlough was not in effect, \n     including, if authorized on the day before the date on which \n     the covered furlough begins, the right to carry a concealed \n     firearm, if the sole reason the covered Federal law \n     enforcement officer was placed on leave was due to the \n     covered furlough.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Conyers) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and to include extraneous materials on H.R. 2137, currently \nunder consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  As we honor our law enforcement heroes for the annual Police Week, I \nrise in support of H.R. 2137, the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense \nand Protection Act of 2015.\n  Federal law enforcement officers face potentially dangerous \nsituations on a daily basis whether they are on duty or off duty. \nAccordingly, they are permitted to carry their government-issued \nfirearms on their persons even when they are not on duty. However, \nduring the 2013 government shutdown, at least three Federal agencies \nforbade their law enforcement officers from carrying their government-\nissued firearms or credentials during the furlough. This decision \npotentially endangered these officers' lives by putting them at an \nunnecessary risk. Further, it prevented these highly trained officers \nfrom being able to respond to a critical incident or threat.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act will \nensure that officers are able to defend and protect themselves on and \noff duty by allowing all covered Federal law enforcement officers to \ncontinue to carry their government-issued firearms during a furlough or \na government shutdown. Allowing our highly trained and experienced \nFederal law enforcement officers to carry their firearms during a \nfurlough not only ensures their safety and protection, but the safety \nand protection of their families and those around them.\n  As we honor our Nation's law enforcement officers this week during \nthe annual National Police Week, let's ensure that the brave men and \nwomen of the Federal law enforcement community have the capability to \ndefend themselves and others and to respond to threatening situations \neven in a time of furlough.\n  I thank the bill's sponsor, Mr. Collins of Georgia, for his work on \nthis important measure, and I urge my colleagues to support this \nbipartisan legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Members of the House, I rise in support of H.R. 2137, the Federal Law \nEnforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act.\n  This bill would authorize Federal law enforcement officers to carry \ntheir government-issued firearms during government shutdowns and \nadministrative furloughs that result from lapses in appropriations. \nEssentially, this measure would help ensure that those who protect us \nare able to continue to do so even during an official furlough. The \nability of our Federal law enforcement officers to respond to critical \nincidents should not be impeded, particularly when violent crimes are \ncommitted in their presence.\n  H.R. 2137 does not expand Federal law enforcement officers' authority \nto carry firearms. The bill merely authorizes these officers to \ncontinue to carry their federally issued firearms as if a furlough had \nnot occurred. This legislation recognizes the very real threat of harm \nthat many of our officers face, particularly special agents, on a \nregular basis--a threat that does not simply disappear because of a \ngovernment shutdown.\n  In 2012, for example, more than 1,800 Federal law enforcement \nofficers were assaulted and, of those, approximately 200 sustained \nserious injuries. Even when off duty, Federal law enforcement officers \nremain the target of assault. For example, between 2011 and 2014, 27 \nlaw enforcement officers were killed while they were off duty.\n  Although this legislation only concerns Federal officers, I want to \ntake a moment to recognize the State, local, and Federal officers who \nhave sacrificed their lives in serving our communities.\n  This week, law enforcement officers throughout the United States have \ncome to Washington to show their support for our fallen officers during \nNational Police Week. In the spirit of National Police Week, it is \nvitally important that our Federal officers are able to protect people \nin our communities, themselves, and their family members from the \ncontinuing threats they encounter. Given the fact that H.R. 2137 \nfacilitates this critical goal, I am eager to support this bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins), a member of the Judiciary \nCommittee and the chief sponsor of this legislation.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the opportunity to \nrise today in support of H.R. 2137, the Federal Law Enforcement Self-\nDefense and Protection Act.\n  I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for their \nsupport of this legislation and for their commitment to getting it to \nthe floor today. With their support, H.R. 2137 passed the Judiciary \nCommittee on a voice vote.\n  I also thank my friends, Congresswoman Gabbard from Hawaii, \nCongressman Reichert from Washington, and Congressman Pascrell from New \nJersey, for joining me in introducing H.R. 2137 and for their strong \nsupport of this bill.\n  Finally, I thank Senator Toomey for introducing the companion \nlegislation in the Senate.\n  Mr. Speaker, I introduced this legislation to provide better \nprotections for law enforcement officers, and I am glad to see that it \nis moving forward. It is particularly fitting that we consider this \nbill this week during National Police Week. Thousands of law \nenforcement officers are here from all over the country to commemorate \ntheir partners who have fallen in the line of duty and to recognize \ntheir sacrifices and contributions. I thank them for their service.\n\n  This is also a special week for this Congressman from the Ninth \nCongressional District of Georgia because I am a proud son of a Georgia \nState trooper. I know firsthand how hard they work and of the \nsacrifices they make in their time away from their families. He made \nsure that my brother and I had all of the chances at life that he had. \nI thank him because I know when he was off duty, as I was growing up, \nhe was no less concerned about protecting the community. The dangers \nthat were associated with his job didn't stop just because he came home \nto us. I think this holds true for all law enforcement officers.\n  Our law enforcement officers are highly trained and they are well \naware of the responsibilities that are associated with their jobs. In \nlight of that training and of the dangers faced by officers, Federal \nlaw enforcement officers are typically allowed to carry their firearms \n24 hours a day, 7 days a week, 365 days a year. It just seems like \ncommon sense. Federal law enforcement officers don't cease to be \nofficers when they are off duty. Crime doesn't stop simply because an \nofficer isn't working on a particular day. The Federal Law Enforcement \nSelf-Defense and Protection Act recognizes that and takes important \nsteps to ensure that law enforcement officers can better protect \nthemselves.\n  In 2013, during the Federal Government shutdown, at least three \nFederal agencies determined that the Antideficiency Act required them \nto forbid their law enforcement officers from carrying their agency-\nissued firearms or their personally owned firearms that were authorized \nby the agency. This interpretation of the law meant that at least 1,800 \nofficers were disarmed.\n  During this time, there were reports confirming that at least one \ndisarmed Federal law enforcement officer was\n\n[[Page H2188]]\n\nattacked while off duty. Fortunately, she was able to get away \nunharmed, but the incident highlights the real dangers that officers \nface even while off duty. In fact, in 2012 alone, more than 1,800 \nFederal officers were assaulted with 206 of them having sustained \nserious injuries. From 2008 to 2011, more than 8,500 Federal law \nenforcement officers were assaulted; and in the last 3 years, 27 \nFederal law enforcement officers have been killed while off duty.\n  The threats and dangers are real. That is why, at a minimum, we \nshould ensure that the policies to protect law enforcement officers are \nclear and consistent. However, there are reports that officers were \ndisarmed inconsistently at other agencies. It is clear that the \npolicies varied by agency. This level of inconsistency does not make \nsense, just as the policy to disarm officers doesn't make sense.\n  H.R. 2137 ensures that it is clear that Federal law enforcement \nofficers can carry their weapons in the event of a lapse of \nappropriations or of an administrative furlough. Under the bill, \nofficers retain the right to carry their government-issued firearms for \npersonal protection or to respond to a critical incident.\n  Importantly, this bill does not protect those who are on \nadministrative leave or those who have lost the right to carry. It does \nnot expand firearms carry authority to law enforcement officers who do \nnot currently possess it, but it does ensure that there is a consistent \npolicy for those officers who are able to carry and who are furloughed \nthrough no fault of their own.\n  The legislation is narrowly tailored, but it has a large impact. H.R. \n2137 recognizes that Federal officers could be confronted by job-\nrelated threats whether they are on duty or off. It recognizes that \nofficers need to be able to protect themselves, their families, and \ntheir communities. This bill is a bipartisan agreement that protects \nour law enforcement officers, who put their lives on the line to \nprotect us, and it makes sure that it is a priority. This bill is \nsupported by the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, the \nFraternal Order of Police, and the National Association of Police \nOrganizations.\n  H.R. 2137 is a sign of the recognition that we must do everything in \nour power to ensure that law enforcement officers have access to the \ntools they need to protect themselves and the public. Speaking also as \na State trooper's kid, it reminds me that my dad, for all that he did \nin the 30-plus years that he worked, was on duty when he was not on \nduty. This is simply a recognition that all of our officers carry that \nsame trust, and we want to give them the tools to do what they need to \ndo.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a senior member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the authors of this legislation, as well as \nthe previous speaker, my friend, for his articulation of this bill, and \nI thank all of the Members who are on the floor joining in support of \nH.R. 2137, the Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act \nof 2015. I thank Mr. Conyers, the ranking member, for yielding to me.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me express my recognition and appreciation of the \nthousands of families who will come to honor those police officers who \nhave fallen in duty--many of them, their loved ones. We honor law \nenforcement officers who gave their lives in the line of duty. The loss \nof one officer's life is one too many. In considering the myriad of \ndangers our officers face, we must ensure they have the appropriate \nauthority to protect our communities and themselves.\n  I support this legislation because it will make it clear that the \nbrave Federal law enforcement officers who protect us will not be \nforced to lock away their government-issued firearms in the event of \nofficial furloughs, such as those occasioned by government shutdowns.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Our Federal law enforcement officers must be prepared to respond to \nnumerous threats faced each day by our country, and this bill will help \nthem do so without expanding any existing authority or creating new \nones.\n  This bill ensures our Federal law enforcement agencies uniformly \nprovide our special agents and other law enforcement officers with the \nnecessary support to respond to critical incidents.\n  Our officers are highly trained and understand the importance \nassociated with possessing government-issued weapons.\n  Let me conclude my remarks by again expressing my appreciation to the \nauthors and the chairman and the ranking member of the full committee.\n  I look forward as we move forward on legislation such as the Law \nEnforcement Integrity Act. We want to continue to give our police \nofficers the skills and tools to be able to do the work that they love, \nand that is protecting the men and women of this Nation.\n  Again, I offer my appreciation, respect, and sympathy as we honor \nthose who have fallen in duty to all of their families.\n  I ask support for H.R. 2137.\n  I wish to express my full support for the Bulletproof Vest \nPartnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act of 2015.\n  I am a cosponsor of the House version of this bill, and I support \nadoption of this Senate-passed bill so that we can send it to the \nPresident for signature.\n  In an effort to keep our citizens safe, law enforcement and \ncorrectional officers put their lives on the line each day, in every \nstate and territory of the United States.\n  Gun violence poses a lethal threat to all of us, and our law \nenforcement officers are often particularly at risk while protecting \nus.\n  Reauthorization of the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program \nwill provide our officers with needed protection when they come face-\nto-face with individuals who seek to do harm to the officers and \nothers.\n  Last year, 42 law enforcement officers were killed by gunfire.\n  Seventeen law enforcement officers have already been killed by \ngunfire this year.\n  In some instances, greater availability of protective vests may have \nsaved the lives of these officers.\n  This program not only promotes the purchase of protective vests and \nbody armor, but it also encourages officers to protect themselves by \nwearing the equipment.\n  In order to receive funds, grantee jurisdictions must certify during \nthe application process that they have a mandatory wear policy.\n  This requirement ensures that all uniformed patrol officers in a \ngrantee jurisdiction will wear protective vests or body armor while on \nduty.\n  Each vest purchased through the program must pass strict performance \nstandards set by the National Institute of Justice.\n  The program also gives special consideration to jurisdictions with \nfewer than 100,000 residents.\n  Without these grants, small jurisdictions might f not be able to \ninclude this life-saving equipment in their budgets--leaving officers \nvulnerable to the daily dangers of policing.\n  Last year, in my district, the Houston Community College Police \nDepartment received $8,260.45 from the BVP program, enabling the \npurchase of 24 protective vests.\n  And the Jacinto City Police Department was able to purchase 7 armor \nvests with $2,135.90 received through the BVP program.\n  The state of Texas received a total of $1,090,175.60 in matching \nfunds from this program in 2015, which made the purchase of 2,834 new \nprotective vests possible.\n  Since its inception in 1999, the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant \nProgram has helped provide more than 1 million vests as of December \n2014, to law enforcement officers in more than 13,000 jurisdictions.\n  The number of women in law enforcement continues to grow.\n  Yet much of the protective armor currently offered is primarily \ndesigned for male officers.\n  To be certain female officers receive the same level of protection as \ntheir male counterparts, the BVP program gives priority to \njurisdictions that provide uniquely-fitted vests, including protective \nvests that conform anatomically to females.\n  From conducting traffic stops to responding to domestic violence \ncalls, our law enforcement officers often face extreme danger.\n  Those dangers are evidenced this week--National Police Week--as we \nhonor the brave men and women who gave their lives to protect us and \nour communities.\n  As we honor our law enforcement officers during National Police Week, \nwith particular recognition for the sacrifice of fallen officers and \ntheir families, it is fitting that we complete work on this legislation \ntoday so that it may become law.\n  Therefore, I urge my colleagues to support S. 125.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from New \nJersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n\n[[Page H2189]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in very strong support of \nH.R. 2137.\n  I thank Representative Doug Collins. This is a good, gutsy bill. I \nthank my co-chair of the Law Enforcement Caucus, Representative Dave \nReichert, who is always there for every law enforcement person in this \ncountry, regardless of which level that law enforcement officer serves, \nbe it Federal, state, county, or local, and Representative Tulsi \nGabbard for introducing this bipartisan legislation.\n  Federal law enforcement officers risk their own safety to make our \ncommunities safer every day. We need to make sure that they have the \ntools they need to do the job.\n  Law enforcement officers were ordered--and you have heard this \nbefore--to lock up their government-issued weapons and were prohibited \nfrom carrying their government-issued credentials while carrying their \npersonally owned weapon during the last government shutdown.\n  This decision potentially endangered one female agent. We just heard \nthat described. Thankfully, she was able to deescalate the situation \nand walk away unharmed.\n  This incident serves as a reminder that criminals don't care if \nFederal officers are furloughed, and it highlights the very real need \nto ensure that law enforcement officers have the means to protect \nthemselves regardless of their duty status.\n  This bill will allow the brave members of the Federal law enforcement \ncommunity to have the capability to defend themselves and respond to \nthreatening situations even in a time when they are off or furloughed.\n  I urge my colleagues to support swift passage of this bipartisan \nlegislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume \nfor my concluding remarks.\n  Members of the House, in 2004, Congress, in recognition of the \nserious dangers faced by the Federal law enforcement officers, passed \nthe Law Enforcement Officers Safety Act, which authorizes Federal law \nenforcement officers to carry concealed weapons in any jurisdiction in \nthe United States.\n  Passage of H.R. 2137 would ensure that, when appropriations lapse or \nanother government shutdown occurs, which we hope it won't, Federal law \nenforcement officers authorized to carry firearms will continue to be \nable to carry their government-issued firearms throughout the \nshutdown's duration for personal protection and to respond to critical \nincidents.\n  I urge support for this bill. I thank all of the Members who \ncontributed to it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, this is a good piece of legislation. I \nurge my colleagues to support it and support our law enforcement \nofficers.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, as we honor police week, I rise in \nsupport of another common sense bill that would benefit the men and \nwomen who serve our nation in federal law enforcement.\n  The Federal Law Enforcement Self-Defense and Protection Act is a \nsimple bill, it allows a federal law enforcement officer to carry their \ngovernment issued firearm during a furlough in the same way that they \ncould carry their weapon if there was no furlough.\n  The risks that federal law enforcement officials face are the same \nwhether or not they are on furlough or not. Some federal law \nenforcement officials have even been specifically targeted because of \ntheir positions.\n  These brave men and women should not be put in jeopardy due to a \nbudget shortfall or an inability to pass a budget. The risks they face \nare the same, they have the right to defend themselves.\n  I thank Rep. Collins for bringing this bill forward, and I urge your \nsupport today.\n  That's just the way it is.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2137.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2189-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2189-H2192]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    RECOVERING MISSING CHILDREN ACT\n\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 3209) to amend the Internal Revenue Code of 1986 to permit \nthe disclosure of certain tax return information for the purpose of \nmissing or exploited children investigations, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 3209\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Recovering Missing Children \n     Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN RETURN INFORMATION RELATING TO \n                   MISSING OR EXPLOITED CHILDREN INVESTIGATIONS.\n\n       (a) In General.--Section 6103(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended--\n       (1) by inserting ``or pertaining to the case of a missing \n     or exploited child,'' after ``may be a party,'' in \n     subparagraph (A)(i),\n       (2) by inserting ``or to such a case of a missing or \n     exploited child,'' after ``may be a party,'' in subparagraph \n     (A)(iii), and\n       (3) by inserting ``(or any criminal investigation or \n     proceeding, in the case of a matter relating to a missing or \n     exploited child)'' after ``concerning such act'' in \n     subparagraph (B)(iii).\n       (b) Disclosure to State and Local Law Enforcement \n     Agencies.--\n       (1) In general.--Section 6103(i)(1) of the Internal Revenue \n     Code of 1986 is amended by adding at the end the following \n     new subparagraph:\n       ``(C) Disclosure to state and local law enforcement \n     agencies in the case of matters pertaining to a missing or \n     exploited child.--\n       ``(i) In general.--In the case of an investigation \n     pertaining to a missing or exploited child, the head of any \n     Federal agency, or his designee, may disclose any return or \n     return information obtained under subparagraph (A) to \n     officers and employees of any State or local law enforcement \n     agency, but only if--\n\n       ``(I) such State or local law enforcement agency is part of \n     a team with the Federal agency in such investigation, and\n       ``(II) such information is disclosed only to such officers \n     and employees who are personally and directly engaged in such \n     investigation.\n\n       ``(ii) Limitation on use of information.--Information \n     disclosed under this subparagraph shall be solely for the use \n     of such officers and employees in locating the missing child, \n     in a grand jury proceeding, or in any preparation for, or \n     investigation which may result in, a judicial or \n     administrative proceeding.\n       ``(iii) Missing child.--For purposes of this subparagraph, \n     the term `missing child' shall have the meaning given such \n     term by section 403 of the Missing Children's Assistance Act \n     (42 U.S.C. 5772).\n       ``(iv) Exploited child.--For purposes of this subparagraph, \n     the term `exploited child' means a minor with respect to whom \n     there is reason to believe that a specified offense against a \n     minor (as defined by section 111(7) of the Sex Offender \n     Registration and Notification Act (42 U.S.C. 16911(7))) has \n     or is occurring.''.\n       (2) Conforming amendments.--\n       (A) Section 6103(a)(2) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``subsection (i)(7)(A)'' and inserting ``subsection (i)(1)(C) \n     or (7)(A)''.\n       (B) Section 6103(p)(4) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``(i)(3)(B)(i)'' in the matter preceding subparagraph (A) and \n     inserting ``(i)(1)(C), (3)(B)(i),''.\n       (C) Section 7213(a)(2) of such Code is amended by striking \n     ``(i)(3)(B)(i)'' and inserting ``(i)(1)(C), (3)(B)(i),''.\n       (c) Effective Date.--The amendments made by this section \n     shall apply to disclosures made after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and to \ninclude extraneous material on H.R. 3209, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Minnesota?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, this week we have thousands of members of \nthe law enforcement community here in Washington to celebrate Police \nWeek.\n  Every day police officers throughout our country wear the uniform \nwith pride, and they understand the tremendous responsibility that \ncomes with it, putting the safety of others before the safety of \nthemselves.\n  They protect us, they protect our families, and they protect our \nneighborhoods. We owe it to these police officers to give them every \nreasonable\n\n[[Page H2190]]\n\ntool possible to solve crimes and keep our communities safe.\n  Unfortunately, police officers are currently being denied a critical \nresource when it comes to solving child abduction and missing children \ncases. While many may picture the perpetrators of these crimes as \nstrangers, the reality is actually very difficult to fathom, and that \nis because every year there are more than 200,000 cases of children \nthat are abducted by a parent or a relative.\n  The psychological and emotional damage inflicted on a child in these \ncases can be devastating. Abducted children often are moved from city \nto city and prohibited from going to school or participating in youth \nactivities due to a fear by the perpetrator of being caught. Many of \nthese children are told that the parent that they are separated from is \ndead or no longer wants them.\n  Statistics show that an abducted child is at a higher risk for \nphysical abuse, and some psychologists believe that family abduction is \none of the most devastating forms of child abuse.\n  Here is the opportunity, Mr. Speaker. Research shows that, in a \nsignificant number of child abductions, the perpetrator will file a tax \nreturn using this child's Social Security number, providing a current \naddress, and a potential case-breaking discovery.\n  One report found that as many as 46 percent of these cases could be \nsolved if law enforcement had access to this information. While this \ntype of critical tax information can be accessed to solve other serious \ncrimes, current law does not allow police officers to access Federal \ntax records to help them find an abducted child. Without such a \nvaluable tool, it could be very difficult for law enforcement to solve \nthese cases when the suspect has left the area and has taken action to \nconceal their new location.\n  The bipartisan Recovering Missing Children Act will allow \ninvestigators to access this critical information and reunite families. \nThis is a commonsense fix that fills the information gap, potentially \nsolving thousands of cases and saving lives.\n  It is endorsed by the National Center for Missing and Exploited \nChildren, the Fraternal Order of Police, the Sergeants Benevolent \nAssociation, the National Association of Police Officers, the Major \nCounty Sheriffs' Association, and the Major Cities Chiefs Association.\n  Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record two letters in support of H.R. \n3209.\n\n                                                    April 7, 2016.\n     Hon. Kevin Brady,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n     Hon. Sander Levin,\n     Ranking Member, Committee on Ways and Means, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. Chairman & Representative Levin: On behalf of the \n     undersigned organizations, we write to advise you of our \n     strong support for H.R. 3209, the ``Recovering Missing \n     Children Act,'' and to request that the Committee consider \n     and mark up this legislation at the earliest possible \n     opportunity.\n       The National Center for Missing and Exploited Children \n     reports that more than 200,000 children are abducted by their \n     parents or other close relatives every year. According to \n     findings from the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration, however, new addresses for these missing \n     children can be identified as often as 46 percent of the time \n     through analysis of taxes subsequently filed using either the \n     suspected perpetrator's or the missing child's Social \n     Security Number. Unfortunately, despite the value that this \n     evidence would have in combating child abductions, the IRS is \n     currently constrained from providing the relevant tax \n     information to law enforcement.\n       To the extent that law enforcement needs access to every \n     available tool to aid in the swift recovery of missing \n     children, H.R. 3209 would solve this problem by filling the \n     information gap. Specifically, the bill would amend current \n     law to add the case of a missing child to the list of \n     exceptions that allow the IRS to release tax return \n     information to law enforcement. Given the sensitivity of \n     taxpayer data, the bill would limit the disclosure of \n     relevant tax information solely to those law enforcement \n     officers who are engaged in the recovery of a missing child \n     or the subsequent investigation and prosecution of the \n     alleged abductor. As a result, we believe the ``Recovering \n     Missing Children Act'' strikes the proper balance between \n     protecting taxpayer privacy and facilitating the ability of \n     law enforcement to reunite missing children with their \n     families.\n       H.R. 3209 represents a commonsense solution to the \n     unintended consequences of laws protecting taxpayer \n     information that is limited to specific scenarios of child \n     abduction. On behalf of our organizations and the men and \n     women of law enforcement that we are proud to represent, we \n     therefore stand ready to work with you and the other Members \n     of the Committee to advance the ``Recovering Missing Children \n     Act'' as expeditiously as possible.\n           Sincerely,\n     Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association;\n     Fraternal Order of Police;\n     International Association of Chiefs of Police;\n     Major Cities Chiefs Association;\n     Major County Sheriffs' Association;\n     National Association of Police Organizations;\n     National Narcotic Officers' Associations' Coalition;\n     Sergeants Benevolent Association NYPD.\n                                  ____\n\n                                     National Center for Missing &\n\n\n                                           Exploited Children,\n\n                                 Alexandria, VA, January 12, 2016.\n     Hon. Erik Paulsen,\n     House of Representatives,\n     Washington, DC.\n       Dear Representative Paulsen: On behalf of the National \n     Center for Missing & Exploited Children (NCMEC) and the \n     families and children we serve, I am writing to express our \n     support for your legislation, the Recovering Missing Children \n     Act (H.R. 3209). This bill provides law enforcement with an \n     additional tool in their search for missing and exploited \n     children.\n       As you know, NCMEC was created as a private, non-profit \n     organization in 1984 and designated by Congress to serve as \n     the national clearinghouse on issues related to missing and \n     exploited children. NCMEC provides services to families, \n     private industry, law enforcement, victims, and the general \n     public to assist in the prevention of child abductions, the \n     recovery of missing children, and the provision of services \n     to combat child sexual exploitation. NCMEC performs 22 \n     functions, including those related to assisting law \n     enforcement, families, and others regarding family \n     abductions.\n       Child abduction by a parent is a crime under both federal \n     and state law. These children suffer emotional abuse, \n     including lack of identity and grief over the loss of a \n     parent. The abductor may give the child a false explanation \n     for the abduction and/or indicate that the searching parent \n     no longer wants the child. Abductors who move the child \n     between cities, or between countries, make it difficult for \n     law enforcement and the searching parent to locate and \n     recover the child.\n       In order to ensure that law enforcement has access to \n     information that could lead to the recovery of a missing or \n     exploited child, we believe the Internal Revenue Service \n     (IRS) database is one resource that could provide key \n     information to help law enforcement. A 2007 study by the \n     Department of Treasury Inspector General for Tax \n     Administration (TIGTA) confirmed that the IRS database \n     contains information that could help law enforcement \n     investigating these cases. For example, according to the \n     study, addresses that were different from those where the \n     children and/or alleged abductors lived at the time of the \n     abductions were found for 46% of the missing children (237 \n     out of 520) and 34% of the alleged abductors (104 out of \n     305). Thus, making it apparent that IRS information could \n     help law enforcement investigating cases involving missing \n     and exploited children.\n       The current framework of the Internal Revenue Code makes it \n     very difficult, and often impossible, for federal law \n     enforcement investigating missing child cases to use the \n     exceptions from Section 6103 to access IRS information.\n       A clarification in the law is necessary to ensure the \n     disclosure of IRS data that could lead to the recovery of a \n     missing or exploited child. As such, we believe the \n     legislation you have sponsored--the Recovering Missing \n     Children Act--could enhance law enforcement's ability to \n     locate missing and exploited children.\n       NCMEC is proud to lend our support to this important \n     legislation and we are grateful for your dedication to the \n     safety of our nation's children.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    John F. Clark,\n                                                President and CEO.\n\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague, Representative Joe \nCourtney, for his leadership and bipartisan advocacy on this issue.\n  I also thank my friend, Mr. Pascrell, who is on the Ways and Means \nCommittee, for his leadership, along with Congressman Reichert, who is \na member of the Law Enforcement Caucus, for getting behind this \nlegislation, showing again that both parties can work together on \nmeaningful legislation that improves the lives of American families.\n  As we prepare for the National Missing Children's Day coming up on \nMay 25, I encourage my colleagues to support this bill today so we can \ngive investigators the tools that they need to crack the case and bring \na missing child home.\n\n[[Page H2191]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of H.R. 3209, the Recovering Missing \nChildren Act. I thank my friend, Representative Erik Paulsen, for \nintroducing it. It is strong, it is reasonable, and it is the right \nthing to do. Representative Joe Courtney has waited and worked for this \nlegislation for a long time.\n  As a father and a grandfather, I can't even begin to imagine what \nparents go through in the event their child goes missing. I can't \nimagine it. I really can't. And I certainly can't imagine hearing that \nlaw enforcement is handicapped in its ability to do everything possible \nto help bring their child back.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are 200,000 kids that are abducted by a family \nmember every year. That is something for another day perhaps, but it is \npart of this problem here.\n  In 2007, a study by the Treasury Inspector General for Tax \nAdministration, TIGTA--we use that term a lot in the Ways and Means \nCommittee--found that tax return information could be helpful in many \ncases involving missing children.\n  TIGTA reviewed whether IRS data would show addresses for persons \nclaiming tax benefits with respect to those missing children after the \ntime of the abduction or their suspected abductors. That sounds pretty \nbizarre, but that is happening.\n  TIGTA looked at 520 missing children's cases and found that the IRS \ndata showed new addresses for 46 percent of the cases. Similarly, IRS \ndata showed new addresses for 34 percent of suspected abductors.\n  Federal law rightly prohibits the IRS from disclosing confidential \ntaxpayer information except in a limited number of exceptions. For \nexample, this information may be released to Federal Government \nemployees if ordered by a Federal judge in preparation for a nontax-\nrelated criminal prosecution.\n  H.R. 3209 would add criminal investigations related to missing or \nexploited children as one of these exceptions. We should be thankful to \nthe author of this legislation because this is a critical exception \nthat should have been done a long time ago.\n  The bill would also allow this information to be released to State \nand local law enforcement officials who are working with the Federal \nagency in its missing or exploited child investigation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nWashington (Mr. Reichert), who has long been an advocate for law \nenforcement and has always been on the front lines helping law \nenforcement with their initiatives and helping victims.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank both Mr. Paulsen and Mr. Pascrell \nfor their support and for the energy and the effort they put behind \nthis legislation.\n  As I was sitting here waiting for my turn to speak, I was thinking to \nmyself that I will be 66 years old here in a few weeks. So half of my \nlife, 33 years, was in law enforcement. It kind of stunned me for a \nsecond.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  I have been in Congress now 11\\1/2\\ years. I have found that there \nare some very, very good friends here in Congress who support law \nenforcement. This is not a partisan issue. Mr. Pascrell and I have been \ngreat partners as co-chairs of the Law Enforcement Caucus, and he is a \nvaliant fighter for law enforcement, firefighters, all first \nresponders. We make a great team. As you can see, there are others who \nhave joined us here today.\n  In my 33 years, Mr. Speaker, I have had the opportunity to work on \npatrol, to search for kids in that moment in time where you get a call \nto a shopping mall and a mother has turned her head for a minute or a \nfather has just let go of the hand of the child for a second and turned \naround and the child is gone. You can just see the panic in their eyes \nand the fear in their face. But a few minutes later, they are found \nwandering around in a toy shop or hiding somewhere, playing hide-and-\nseek, and they have their child back within minutes.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, there are other families that aren't so fortunate, \nthat I have had the honor of meeting, where their child had been \nmissing for years. Some are fortunate enough, Mr. Speaker, to get their \nchild back. I have been at the other end of that, where you search and \nyou find. I found a young man up in the mountains of Alaska who had \nbeen taken by his father and whisked away in an old camper and hidden \nin the mountains of Alaska. We found him safe and returned him to his \nmom.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have also had the sad experience of finding a missing \nchild dead. I have had to be the one who went to the home and notified \nthe mom and dad: We found Cindy, but she is not alive. Someone killed \nher.\n  These are tough cases. When I was working these cases, I would say to \nthe family: We are going to get your child back, and we will find the \nperson responsible for taking your child. When I was a detective, I \nsaid the same thing: We are going to be tough, and we will find them.\n  Today, with this Federal legislation, we are even saying it in \nstronger words. Now the local law enforcement agencies have the power \nof the Federal Government. That information that we needed back in the \nday when I was an officer on the street or a detective on the street, I \ndidn't have. But today we are going to give them that power and \nauthority.\n  The message today is: those who take children from their homes, those \nwho take children off the streets, we will find you--we will find you--\nbecause I don't want police officers knocking on a door and telling a \nparent that their child won't be coming home.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield an additional 2 minutes to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, when I was a detective on the Green River \nTask Force, we solved over 2,000 cases of missing women, young women, \nand girls over that period of time. We solved 51 murders, and we worked \nclosely with the families. Those detectives who went home every night \ndid not go home and stop thinking about these cases. I know that every \none of those detectives and every one of the families involved in that \ninvestigation today appreciate the action of Mr. Paulsen, Mr. Pascrell, \nand all those who support this bill.\n  I know families that actually kept their child's bedroom exactly the \nway it was the day they went missing, for 5 or 6 years. They didn't \nchange a thing because they always have hope. They always have hope \nthat their daughter or their son will be coming home, until the day \nthat door gets a knock and the officer arrives and says: We found \nlittle Johnny, or, Little Johnny won't be coming home.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge everyone to support this legislation. I \nappreciate so much the action by everyone involved in bringing this \nforward.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the gentleman from \nConnecticut (Mr. Courtney). He has worked very hard on this issue for a \nvery, very long time.\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Pascrell for yielding time, \nand I thank my good friend and colleague Erik Paulsen for his great \nwork in getting us to this point today where finally we are going to \nmove this measure forward.\n  It is almost 5 years to the day that Mr. Paulsen and I introduced \nthis legislation, along with a number of others, in 2011, to deal with \nthis really, just almost inexplicable anomaly in the law which \nbasically says that one arm of the government--the IRS--can actually \nknow the whereabouts of a missing child but can't share that \ninformation with another arm of government--namely, State and local law \nenforcement--which, in most cases, almost 100 percent of cases \ninvolving missing children, is the level of government that actually \ndeals with the investigation and attempts to recover children.\n  So you have a situation where you have got all these resources and \nefforts happening at the State and local level scurrying around, trying \nto find leads for abducted children, yet the government is sitting on \ninformation in terms of tax returns that were filed with the Social \nSecurity number of the child who is missing or the suspected abductor, \nand the two levels of government can't talk to each other.\n\n[[Page H2192]]\n\n  This legislation will break down that barrier and allow, again, \ntimely information to be shared for the thousands of children, which we \nknow from data that the missing children foundation and other law \nenforcement groups have been sharing with Congress over a number of \nyears.\n  So again, as was said earlier, the data is astonishing: 200,000 \nabductions are reported each year; 12,000 tend to last longer than 6 \nmonths. In 2007, the Treasury Department looked at 1,700 Social \nSecurity numbers of missing kids and found that, as Mr. Pascrell said, \nover a third had been used in returns after the abduction.\n  For some it is really kind of hard to imagine how an abducting \nrelative or even stranger could have the nerve to file a tax return and \nclaim the Social Security and child exemption for the child that they \nhave in their possession, but the data shows that, in fact, that \nhappens. It may be because they are anxious to get the refund; it may \nbe because they don't want to be violating a second set of laws in \nterms of not filing a tax return. But the fact of the matter is that \nthere are thousands of children that the government knows their \nwhereabouts, and this law will allow that information to be shared. For \nevery family that will benefit from it, it really is just an amazing \nopportunity for us to really relieve the stress and pain that these \nhorrible cases inflict year in and year out.\n\n  As I said, it took 5 years. We have a great coalition of outside \ngroups that are supporting it. As Calvin Coolidge once said: ``Nothing \nin the world can take the place of persistence . . . The slogan `Press \nOn' has solved and always will solve the problems of the human race.'' \nThis, I think, is an example of it. It took 5 long years, but the House \nis now poised to move forward on H.R. 3209, Recovering Missing Children \nAct, and again we want to get swift passage and move this through the \nSenate and to the President's desk so that we can, again, provide a lot \nof relief and solace to families that are anxiously looking for their \nloved ones.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, having no other speakers, I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time to \nclose.\n  When Mr. Reichert said before that we will track you down and find \nyou, he meant it, because he was on many a chase in his 33 years in law \nenforcement, and he always gave special attention to those that \ninvolved children.\n  I want to congratulate Representative Paulsen. Most of the time, \nalmost all the time, he always provides a reasonable resolution to \nproblems. I mean that.\n  I know that we simply cannot have information at our fingertips that \ncan help bring an abducted child home and not allow law enforcement to \nuse it. Allowing law enforcement to use information that can help \nlocate missing and abducted children is a no-brainer. We need to \nestablish a system that protects taxpayers' privacy but also allows law \nenforcement to do its job. This bill does just that.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense legislation. It has \nbeen a good, bipartisan few hours.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I won't go on too much longer. We have had great \ntestimony and offerings today by folks who have been working in a very \nbipartisan way on a very key component that has been around for 5 years \nbut will absolutely make a difference in solving missing child \nabduction cases. It is common sense, it is bipartisan, and most \nimportantly, it will help reunite families with missing children.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, as co-chair of the Congressional Caucus on \nFoster Youth, I rise today in recognition of May as National Foster \nCare Month.\n  Growing up, my parents welcomed many foster children into our family, \nproviding them with a stable and nurturing environment.\n  One of the biggest challenges for youth in foster care is finding \ntheir forever family. Even youth who age out of foster care still need \na place to call home after they turn 18, and whether through \nreunification, adoption, or an individual plan, every foster youth \ndeserves a permanent home.\n  Mr. Speaker, these children belong to all of us, and we are all \nresponsible for their well-being. I urge my colleagues to join me in \nrecognizing May as National Foster Care Month.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2194-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       RECOGNIZING MEMBERS OF PENN STATE'S RED CELL ANALYTICS LAB\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

I was happy to learn that \nmembers of the Red Cell Analytics Lab move on to great careers, working \nfor companies in our financial and technology sectors, along with the \nFederal Government.\n  It is unfortunate that these talents are necessary in today's world, \nbut I am glad they are being cultivated at Penn State University.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2194-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          THE HEROIN EPIDEMIC\n\n  (Mr. RYAN of Ohio asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Speaker, this week, we are going to take up a \npackage of bills that I support dealing with the massive heroin \nepidemic plaguing places like Ohio, but all over the country.\n  In my congressional district, we saw, a few months back, over 22 \noverdoses. In Trumbull County alone, 7 deaths; in Summit County, city \nof Akron, 56 people died of a heroin overdose, compared to just 40 in \n2013. Now, in Ohio, these drug overdoses have been the leading cause of \naccidental deaths in our State, bypassing car accidents.\n  This House this week is going to do the responsible thing and pass \nkey legislation and hopefully combine with the Senate legislation. But \nthere is a missing piece on the recovery side. We need to make sure \nthat, as we address this issue, it is comprehensive: it is about \naddiction and it is about treatment, but it also must be about \nrecovery.\n  So I commend my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for these \nimportant pieces of legislation that are coming forth. I will support \nthem, but knowing that we have got a lot more work to do and that the \nbottom line is we need money behind these programs.\n  The President put in his budget over $1 billion. We need to make sure \nthat the resources get down to the local community so that we can help \nstem the tide of this epidemic in our country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2194-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2194]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           SUPPORTING TSC GLOBAL AWARENESS DAY AND MAX LUCCA\n\n  (Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. ROS-LEHTINEN. Mr. Speaker, today I rise to lend my voice in \nsupport of TSC Global Awareness Day on May 15.\n  Tuberous sclerosis complex, or TSC, is a rare genetic disease that \ncauses uncontrolled tumor growth across the face, body, and organs of \naffected individuals. Unfortunately, there is no cure for TSC.\n  South Florida's own Max Lucca--look at that sweet young face--was \ndiagnosed with TSC when he was only 2 weeks old. Now he is 8, and Max \nLucca has thrived because of the constant love and care provided by his \nparents, Vanessa and Max. Max Lucca enjoys baseball--as you can see--\nand hanging out with his best buddy.\n  So please think of this sweet young boy, Max Lucca, and others living \nwith TSC on May 15 for TSC Global Awareness Day, and let's work \ntogether to find new treatments and a cure for this tragic disease.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2194-6", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2194-H2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          GIVING HOPE TO DUCHENNE MUSCULAR DYSTROPHY PATIENTS\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak about a genetic \ndisorder, Duchenne muscular dystrophy, that has caused heartbreak for \nfamilies across the country. The genetic mutation, found typically in \nboys, weakens muscles and leaves most sufferers confined to \nwheelchairs. Due to lung or heart failure, most afflicted with Duchenne \npass away before their 25th birthday.\n\n[[Page H2195]]\n\n  However, there is hope with new medical advancement that could \nincrease the lifespan and improve the quality of life for those living \nwith Duchenne. A new drug was used in a medical trial where every \nparticipant was able to walk for 4 years after starting the treatment, \nand on top of that, there were no negative side effects. However, the \nFDA has yet to approve this new drug, even with such promising results.\n  Mr. Speaker, Duchenne muscular dystrophy is an awful condition that \nmore or less guarantees a short life for those who live with it. \nMedical advancement is giving hope to those patients for a longer and a \nbetter life, but bureaucratic redtape is preventing those folks from \naccessing it. It is time for the FDA to remove those roadblocks and to \nmove forward for a new, possible, life-improving treatment.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2195-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    SALEM TOWNSHIP FIRST RESPONDERS\n\n  (Mr. ROTHFUS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ROTHFUS.

In addition to Chief Rosatti's department, the following \nvolunteer fire departments also responded: Slickville, White Valley, \nExport, Crabtree, Greensburg, Delmont, Hannastown, Grandview, New \nAlexandria, Jeannette, Harrison City, Washington Township, Saltsburg, \nTunnelton, and Sardis.\n  These departments were joined by seven other local, county, and State \nagencies.

Mr. Speaker, Ben Rhodes from the administration said \nthat the Iran deal would be the ObamaCare of the administration's \nsecond term. When I heard that, I thought, ``Sheesh,'' because a lot of \nus don't think highly of ObamaCare. We don't think it has worked out \nwell. We didn't think the Iran deal was going to work out well. But now \nthat actually has a deeper meaning.\n  ObamaCare was sold to the American people on a set of deceptions: if \nyou like your plan, you can keep it; if you like your doctor, you can \nkeep him; you are going to pay $2,500 less per family for health \ninsurance. Now, it turns out, so was the Iran deal.\n  They concocted a narrative--a false narrative--that, with the \nelection of Rouhani, a moderate who really wanted to have an opening, \nthis was a once-in-a-generation opportunity for America to seize this \nday and strike a deal with Iran--even though they are the world's \nleading state sponsor of terrorism--and bring peace to the world.\n  That was all false. This started before Rouhani was elected. He is \nnot a moderate. This was a deal made in conjunction with Iran's hard-\nliners; and as we are seeing now with how they are behaving, it is \nbenefitting Iran's hard-liners.\n  ObamaCare we can fix. It will be tough. But we may not be able to \nrecover if Iran gets a nuclear weapon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2195-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL NURSES WEEK\n\n  (Mr. GUINTA asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize National Nurses Week, a \ntime to celebrate the contribution of over 3 million registered nurses \naround our country. They are our friends and neighbors who care for our \nloved ones and treat us when we are sick.\n  A nurse is usually the first person we talk to at the doctor's \noffice, even first thing in the morning. A nurse may be the first \nperson we meet in life. Increasingly, as the American population ages, \nnurses are filling larger roles.\n  In New Hampshire, especially rural regions, we need them more than \never. At job fairs I hosted in Manchester and Laconia, healthcare \nemployers are scouring the State for help. I cosponsored the Home \nHealth Care Planning Improvement Act to allow nurse practitioners to \nvisit more patients at home.\n  Nurses are on the front lines of the heroin epidemic in the Granite \nState and around the country. Some are Members of Congress, putting \ntheir kindness, compassion, and understanding to work in government. \nDuring National Nurses Week, please thank a nurse for his or her \ncontributions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2195-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2195]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1915\n                    PUBLIC LAND ACCESS BY THE GO ACT\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, the current process to obtain outfitter and \nguide permits for hiking, hunting, and fishing exhibitions on our \npublic lands for recreation events is too expensive and very \ncomplicated. Guides and outfitters should not have to navigate \narbitrary rules, inconsistent practices, and unresponsive Federal \nagencies.\n  As a result, I have introduced the Guides and Outfitters Act, known \nas the GO Act, H.R. 5129, which will renew the authorization for these \nrecreation permits while eliminating burdensome red tape.\n  This measure will also cap permit fees, ensure that fees are charged \nonly for activities on the actual public lands, not on private lands, \nprovides categorical exclusions for previously studied uses to reduce \ndelays, and allows online applications.\n  The GO Act is consistent with my commitment to increasing public \naccess to the public lands, making Federal agencies more responsive to \nthe communities in which they operate and removing unnecessary \nbureaucratic red tape that keeps people off of their lands.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2195-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2195-H2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        NATION'S OPIOID EPIDEMIC\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Young of Iowa). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from Massachusetts \n(Ms. Clark) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the \nminority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous material on the subject of this Special \nOrder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank my \ncolleagues for joining us this evening for this critically important \ndiscussion.\n  I thank the chairs of the bipartisan task force on the opioid \nepidemic for their leadership and tenacity in pushing reforms. I thank \nCongresswoman Kuster and Congressman Guinta.\n  This week the House will debate solutions to our Nation's opioid \ncrisis. If there has ever been a time to put away partisan differences \nand ideological rhetoric, it is now. I am proud of the work of the task \nforce in supporting bipartisan bills to help stem the tide of this \nepidemic.\n  This is a public health crisis that reaches into every community. It \nis an equal opportunity killer, without regard for age, gender, race, \nor economic background. It does not care if you are a Democrat or a \nRepublican.\n  In Massachusetts, just last year we lost nearly 1,400 lives to this \nopioid crisis. Half of all of the deaths in Massachusetts of opioid \noverdoses involve heroin, but prescription opioid overdoses are also \nsurging. Between\n\n[[Page H2196]]\n\n2013 and 2014, they increased by over 90 percent. In my State more than \nothers, the epidemic is claiming the lives of our young people ages 25 \nto 34.\n  Too many parents are trying to save their child from opioid \naddiction's deadly grip, and they are counting on us for help. That is \nwhy we are here this evening--to do everything we can to save lives.\n  At the center of this debate are the families at home who speak out \nand bravely share their stories so no other parent has to endure the \npain of losing their child.\n  Tonight I am thinking of Debbie Deagle, who I met in October during a \ntown hall in Revere, Massachusetts. In front of a large audience she \ntold the story of Stephen, her only child, who she lost to opioid \naddiction. In her words, she was inconsolable and it was difficult to \nmake it through each day. She was also angry because not a month had \ngone by in the last 15 years she hadn't heard of somebody overdosing, \nbut nobody wanted to talk about it and everybody was too ashamed.\n  Debbie talked about the shame her son felt. She described him as \nbrilliant, her miracle child. She raised him as a single mother and, \nwhile it was hard, his beautiful life was a gift she cherished.\n  He was smart, witty, a songwriter, and a musician. He had a bright \nfuture. He had graduated with honors from St. John's Prep and went to \nNortheastern University, where he became a computer science major, \nwhich was his gift.\n  It was four impacted wisdom teeth his freshman year of college and \nthe opioids that he took for pain that started him on his road to \naddiction. When his substance abuse disorder derailed Stephen's life, \nDebbie started reading blogs where people commented: They are only \njunkies. They should just cull the herd. That is what got her angry. \nShe thought: These aren't animals. These are children.\n  On their own, Debbie and her son battled addiction, insurance \ncompanies, and the courts. In the end, it was a battle they lost. On \nJanuary 8, 2015, Stephen Deagle passed away after his excruciating \nstruggle with opioids, and his mother lived her worst nightmare saying \ngoodbye to her only son.\n  When we asked Debbie if we could share her story, her request was \nsimple: Please get Congress to do something. We deserve real solutions \nnow.\n  So my request to this Congress is to listen to Debbie and the pleas \nof too many other moms like her. This crisis is an urgent calling for \nCongress to act and save lives.\n  This week we will have the opportunity to pass legislation that will \ngive critical tools to address this crisis. Ultimately, however, we \nmust also provide the financial resources to our State and local \npartners to change the course of this epidemic.\n  I thank you for all the work that is being done.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Clark for yielding, \nand I extend my gratitude to her for joining me tonight in this Special \nOrder.\n  I am also grateful for the opportunity to join bipartisan members--\nRepublican and Democrat--from around the country to talk about heroin \nabuse, an increasingly deadly public health crisis.\n  Last year I joined with my colleague from New Hampshire, \nCongresswoman Kuster, to create The Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the \nHeroin Epidemic. We strive to fight the tragedy of opioid addiction and \nfatal overdose from around the Nation.\n  Since its creation last October, our task force has grown to 80 \nmembers. Our growth and impact is a testament to the depth of the \ncrisis and the focus of the Members of this body.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, abuse and overdose claimed the \nlives of 430 people in 2015. To put that number in perspective, that is \n1 out of every 3,000 residents died of an overdose last year. The CDC \nreports that, nationally, overdose deaths have tripled over the last 10 \nyears.\n  I am proud of the work we have done so far to combat this epidemic. \nBut as many struggling families and ailing communities know, there is \nmuch more work to be done.\n  A few weeks ago the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic proposed a legislative agenda. Our bills would assist law \nenforcement, treatment providers, and recovery personnel in their \nbattle against the epidemic.\n  During this Heroin and Opioid Awareness Week, we will see our \nlegislation come to the floor for a vote. I am pleased that my \ncolleagues have tirelessly worked to protect our loved ones from this \nepidemic, and I am proud to cosponsor many bills coming to the floor \nthis week, including the House response to the Comprehensive Addiction \nand Recovery Act.\n  To address the comprehensive nature of this epidemic, we must provide \na comprehensive legislative package to bolster the efforts of those \nhelping our communities.\n  I have filed several amendments to this package for this week. They \nwill increase grants for medication-assisted treatments and long-term \nrecovery.\n  I also have filed legislation that would reauthorize recovery court \nprograms for 3 years, and I am grateful that my bill, the Good \nSamaritan Assessment Act of 2016, passed by suspension in the House \nearlier today. I hope this provision will be included in the conference \nreport.\n  Very simply, these provisions are absolutely crucial to aiding those \nin need. My colleagues and I have committed to seeing the House of \nRepresentatives pass the strongest and most comprehensive plan \npossible.\n  I believe we will do our due diligence to pass this plan, go to \nconference with the Senate, and put a bill on the President's desk \nbefore June.\n  Our plan is urgently needed. Nearly 129 people die every day from an \nopioid overdose. In my district and around the country, I hear from \nfamilies and friends who know someone coping with substance use \ndisorder.\n  We will only make a dent in this great challenge by listening to its \nvictims. We need to hear fathers like Doug Griffin of Newton in New \nHampshire's First District. His daughter, Courtney, fell victim to \nheroin abuse at just 20 years old.\n  Doug remembers Courtney as a bright, lively girl with a great sense \nof humor and a deep passion for life. She played music. She loved \ns'mores. Courtney told Doug she planned to become a marine and serve \nher country.\n  But 3 years later she was lost on the streets, in and out of rehab \nfacilities. Prescription pills, fentanyl, and street heroin ensnared \nCourtney into a fatal web of addiction. She lost the will to live.\n  Because Courtney's pain was so great and because she had so few \noptions for treatment, Doug says he and his family hid the truth from \nthe outside world. To help others, they are speaking out now, just as \nthis body is this evening.\n  Doug is courageously telling everyone he knows about the warning \nsigns of heroin abuse and the deficiencies in our public response. \nMillions of Americans share Courtney's story and Doug's anguish. It is \nonly by speaking out and sharing grief that we will remove the stigma \npreventing far too many from seeking help.\n  Tonight it is about telling the truth. It is about finding the \nsolutions we need and why we need them. It is about putting political \ndisagreements aside and cooperating for the common good, for the common \ngood not just of our constituents, but our country.\n  As the House considers this vital legislation, I encourage my \ncolleagues to listen to their constituents, hear their stories, share \ntheir struggles, and help them fight back. We could win this public \nemergency, and it starts this week with the comprehensive CARA \nlegislation.\n  I thank my colleagues from both sides of the aisle for working so \njudiciously and in a manner that I think puts people ahead of anything \nelse that this body is doing. I commend my colleagues, and I am honored \nto work with them on this legislation.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the congresswoman from the Commonwealth of \nMassachusetts just to the south of my district.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Guinta.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Connecticut (Mr. \nCourtney).\n  Mr. COURTNEY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Clark for organizing \nthis really important discussion here this evening.\n\n[[Page H2197]]\n\n  The scope of the problem in terms of what is facing our Nation is \npretty astonishing when you look at the statistics from the Centers for \nDisease Control.\n  In 2004, 7,000 Americans lost their lives to heroin overdoses. Fast-\nforward 10 years and that number is now over 27,000. Again, the \nstatistics land in suburban America, rural America, and urban America.\n  But at the end of the day, behind every one of those numbers is a \nstory of a human being and a family. That is why this discussion is so \nimportant tonight.\n  Next to me I have a chart showing the face of Justice Kelly, who is a \n21-year-old from Tolland, Connecticut. Tolland, Connecticut, is the \nquintessential small-town New England community. It is about 5 miles \nfrom where I live. Her mother, Jennifer, moved there hoping that this \nwas going to be a great community to raise her child, and she went \nthrough the public school system.\n  Battling depression, she fell victim to heroin addiction and for the \nlast number of years has been battling this with methadone treatment in \nand out of facilities and programs.\n  Last summer she really finally went to her family and just begged \nthem to get access to a long-term rehab program. Unfortunately, the \nwaiting lists were months. The facilities in Connecticut, like so many \nother parts of the country, were full.\n  In August of 2015, when she again was in a predicament where she lost \nher asthma medication, the combination of suffering from asthma and a \nheroin overdose resulted in her being rushed to the hospital with an \noverdose condition.\n  The good news is that the folks at the emergency room were able to \nsave her life. But as her mother said, ``As we pulled into the parking \nlot of the ER, I knew at that moment I was losing her. All I remember \nfrom that moment on was being more scared than I have been in my entire \nlife. I saw a whole team of people come outside and try and save my \nbaby's life. I stood there helpless and alone. All I could do was look \nto God.''\n  She now is in a permanent vegetative state, as the photograph next to \nme indicates, and there really are no signs of improvement.\n  Her mother went on to say, ``They saved my daughter's life that day, \nbut it's been a very hard journey. Justice's injury is so severe that \nthe likelihood Justice will ever recover is very slim. More than \nlikely, I will have to make the decision to bring my baby home with \nhospice.''\n  This story shows that this problem extends far beyond even the \nfatalities. It also is going to leave people with chronic life-changing \nconditions, like this beautiful young girl from Tolland, Connecticut.\n\n                              {time}  1930\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this issue is now coming to the floor this week with a \nnumber of measures authorizing different changes and approaches to this \nprogram.\n  I want to, again, emphasize the fact that I come from the State with \nthe highest per capita income, but even in Connecticut, people cannot \nfind access to treatment beds. That is why at some point we have to \nbring this discussion to a higher level and realize that we need to get \nresources out to the communities so that law enforcement can at the \nfront lines deal with this issue in emergency situations, so that we \nhave treatment options for families like the Kelly family in Tolland, \nConnecticut, and so that we go upstream in terms of prevention and \neducation so as to get to the root causes of the pathways to heroin and \nopioid addiction. This is going to require an all-hands-on-deck \napproach.\n  Yes, let's support the legislation that is coming forward this week, \nlet's make smart policy changes, and let's authorize different \nprograms. At the end of the day, we need to put our money where our \nmouth is in that we need to treat this like it is a natural disaster. \nAs a Nation, we would instantly respond to a hurricane that is taking \nhuman lives at a clip much slower, in fact, than what is happening with \nthe heroin opioid crisis.\n  Let's move forward with the $600 million request for emergency \nsupplemental funding, which is before the Appropriations Committee, so \nthat we will not just talk about solving this problem but, again, put \nthe resources out there so that the police, the addiction counselors, \nthe treatment folks, and all of the families who are out there who are \ndesperate for help will know that our country is going to treat this as \nthe true crisis that it is and will know we will get the resources all \nacross the country.\n  Again, I thank Representativ Clark for organizing this discussion. \nJennifer Kelly, Justice's mother, thanks the gentlewoman for letting us \nhave an opportunity to tell the story about her daughter.\n  As a Nation, let's move forward with all of the resources and good \nideas because that is the only way we are ever going to come to terms \nwith this problem and solve it.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Please extend our thanks to Jennifer's \nfamily for sharing that story, and I thank the gentleman for his \nadvocacy.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Katko).\n  Mr. KATKO. I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Mr. Speaker, during my 15 years as a Federal prosecutor in Syracuse, \nNew York, I witnessed firsthand on a daily basis the devastating \nimpacts of drug use, in general, and of heroin, in particular, and the \nterrible impacts it had on the well-being of our children, on the lives \nof those directly involved, and on the safety of our community. \nTragically, the devastating impact of heroin and other opioids has \ngotten much worse in recent years.\n  As a Federal prosecutor, I have seen every possible drug known to man \non the streets. I have never seen anything that has had the devastating \neffects that heroin has had on our communities. Literally, fatal \nincidents are happening on a regular basis.\n  One of my top priorities during my time in Washington has been to \nfacilitate a community dialogue on this public health epidemic to \ndiscuss ways of treating and preventing addiction. At every forum, at \nevery town hall, at every business I visit, at every hospital I visit, \nI hear from my constituents of the devastation this epidemic is \ninflicting on our communities. I hear tragic stories about friends or \nfamily members succumbing to heroin addiction. I hear from medical \nworkers and first responders about the strain this epidemic is placing \non their resources. I hear stories of pain and loss, and I want to \nshare a few of those with you to illustrate what I am talking about.\n  During the course of the six town halls I have conducted or have \nparticipated in throughout my district over the last several months, we \nhave routinely heard of the stories of victims. In particular, families \nhave told of the loved ones they have lost. One individual really \ncaught my attention. They all caught my attention, but this one was \npretty devastating.\n  Morgan Axe was a beautiful young woman and a great athlete--just a \ngreat kid overall--who battled addiction with heroin for several years. \nAt 24 years old, she became pregnant and she stopped taking heroin \ncompletely in order to protect her baby. She stopped taking any drugs \nthat would have helped her with her cravings, and she was doing great. \nAt the fifth month--at 5 months of being clean--a boyfriend thought it \nwould be a good idea to give her a dose of heroin. We have the \ntelephone records to show it. She took that heroin and she died, as did \nher baby.\n  Her mother had to come to that forum and talk about this. I applaud \nher for the openness with which she talked about it, for the pain that \nshe shared with us, and for the lessons that can be learned from this. \nIt can happen to anybody. It is not an inner city drug. When we were \ngrowing up, we used to think of heroin users as individuals who would \nbe under a bridge somewhere or in an alley, but that is not the way it \nis. It affects those in the suburbs, the wealthy, the poor, and \neveryone in between.\n  I have one other quick story. When I was renting my congressional \noffice, the individual who was showing me the office had a sad look in \nhis eye. He began to tell me the story about his daughter, who was the \nFinal Four MVP for the NCAA Junior College Lacrosse the year before. \nShe died of a heroin overdose because she got into heroin after that \nchampionship.\n  It is an epidemic with enormous consequences, and it is getting \nworse. The epidemic of addiction is claiming the\n\n[[Page H2198]]\n\nlives from every age, class, and race, like I mentioned. I know that \nsociety doesn't like to talk about drugs, addiction, and overdose, but \nthis is a problem that we can no longer ignore, and it is one that we \nmust absolutely, positively, address. The scourge must be stopped.\n  I am absolutely proud to be part of the House action that is being \ntaken this week on several measures that will help to fight against \nthis growing opioid epidemic and through the passage of my drug kingpin \nbill earlier today. Much remains to be done, and I hope that Congress \nwill build on the actions this week and will continue to work on \nefforts in a bipartisan manner so we can fight back and save people \nfrom addiction.\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. I thank the gentleman for sharing \nMorgan's story with us.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from the western part of the \nCommonwealth, Mr. Neal.\n  (Mr. NEAL asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. NEAL. I thank Congresswomen Clark and Ann Kuster and Congressman \nFrank Guinta for the good work that they have done in calling attention \nthis evening to this crisis that now threatens to overwhelm \nrehabilitation centers across the country. What I want to specifically \ncite in my comments for the next few minutes is a very human story. Her \nname is Bethany, and she wrote to me on January 18 of this year.\n\n       Dear Congressman Neal:\n       I am writing to you regarding the heroin prescription pill \n     crisis our State and Nation is currently entrenched in. I am \n     a physician assistant who graduated from Wake Forest Baptist \n     Medical School in their Physician Assistants program in 2003. \n     I have worked in various outpatient clinics, as well as at \n     Bay State Medical Center in Springfield, Massachusetts, and \n     at the Cooley Dickinson emergency room operations in \n     Northampton, Massachusetts. I have treated overdose patients, \n     have been alongside physicians who have pronounced patients \n     deceased from an overdose, as well as having referred \n     patients to crisis support teams, outpatient treatment, and \n     rehabs.\n       After all of this, I never expected that I would become \n     addicted to prescription painkillers after a series of \n     surgeries and illness. I suffered in silence, alone in fear, \n     shame, and guilt. I was a functioning professional who \n     referred my addicted patients to various resources, but when \n     I tried to reach out for help, I hit roadblocks.\n       For instance, the emergency room I worked in was outsourced \n     so that when I went to the emergency room director on two \n     separate occasions to ask to go to the Employee Assistance \n     Program, I was told that those resources were only available \n     to hospital employees. I tried outpatient therapy and 12-step \n     programs, but I kept sliding backwards.\n       After years of struggling, I couldn't keep silent any \n     longer. I confessed my addiction to a coworker. I felt that, \n     finally, help would come. Instead, I was fired for cause and \n     without benefits. The fear that had kept me silent for all of \n     those years was now my reality. My husband was a stay-at-home \n     dad.\n       And now how could we support our three children?\n       I felt like my life was falling apart. Little did I know \n     that what I was doing was actually falling into place. With \n     family support, I found a rehab program for 6 months where I \n     could go with two young children. I saw my oldest on the \n     weekends.\n       After graduating rehab, I interviewed and signed up with \n     the Massachusetts professional reporting system. For 5 years, \n     I have called in daily. I am subjected to at least 15 random \n     drug tests a year. I go to 2 to 4 hours of recovery meetings \n     every week and attend a professionals in recovery meeting \n     weekly. It was in the professionals meetings that I finally \n     found a sense of belonging. It was the vital piece of the \n     puzzle that had been lacking as I searched for recovery but \n     kept backsliding.\n\n  She writes in this letter to me of her strong faith and how it helped \nto get her through this very difficult time in her life, but she also \npoints out that the system is broken, that the emergency room funding \nfor reaching individuals is inadequate, that pain management is \ninadequate, that pain scales, treatments are inadequate.\n  She writes:\n\n       I found myself overtreating pain at times because I was \n     taught that we could get sanctioned from not treating pain. I \n     felt obligated to treat someone's subjective pain without \n     objective findings or reason.\n\n  She writes of all of the challenges that she faced, all having \nstarted because of surgeries and illnesses that she had that required \nmedication that, in fact, in the end, she could not successfully \nescape.\n  She testified in a forum that I held. She was courageous enough to \nget up and talk about the problems that she had.\n  Do you know what?\n  She is doing better.\n  So we call attention to those tonight who might find a path forward \nfrom the grim reality of heroin that sells on the streets of \nSpringfield and Hartford for $3 a bag. This was an individual who had a \nnormal working relationship with colleagues. This was an individual who \nwent to work faithfully, had a professional designation, and found \nherself caught up in the opioid crisis because of the prescriptions \nthat had been given to her early on.\n  I know of the maintenance plan that is being proposed and of the \nsuggestions that are being offered for more physicians to secure \ntraining and how opioids might be extended to those who need them, but \nI would implore this Congress to act favorably upon that proposal and \nthat legislation.\n  We all regularly go to caucus meetings, we go to a host of get-\ntogethers, at which we always attempt to upgrade our skills. There is \nnothing that will upgrade your skills like the coarseness of a \ncampaign--I can tell you that--but we all find that professional \nopportunity to challenge ourselves to do better in this institution.\n  That should not be unlike those who are outside of the institution. \nWhere you regularly require courses for attorneys, CPAs, and others, \nwhy not for physicians so they may receive the training that today \nwould be readily available with the assistance of this Congress, \nhopefully after the vigorous activity that we will take this week?\n  I close as I opened. I thank Congresswoman Clark for her leadership, \nCongresswoman Kuster for her leadership, and Congressman Guinta for his \nleadership on this issue. I am telling you, across western and central \nMassachusetts, this is devastating families. There is an opportunity \nhere for the Congress to respond.\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. I thank Mr. Neal for the critical story \nthat Bethany shared with him and that the gentleman shared with us. We \nknow how devastating this crisis has been in western and central \nMassachusetts, and we thank the gentleman for all of his leadership on \nit.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Stefanik).\n  Ms. STEFANIK. I thank Ms. Clark.\n  Mr. Speaker, first, I want to take a moment to thank my colleagues \nMr. Guinta, Ms. Kuster, and Ms. Clark for their work and tireless \nefforts to combat the heroin epidemic that is sweeping across our \nNation.\n  Over the last 15 years, heroin-related deaths have quadrupled, \nleaving families and communities across this country shattered. This \ncrisis has been felt acutely in my district where the region is a major \npipeline for illicit drug trafficking.\n  Last November, law enforcement in Washington County, New York, made \n11 arrests in one morning of individuals who were illegally selling \nheroin, cocaine, and prescription drugs. In New York's North Country, I \nhave seen and heard from those in recovery and from those still \nstruggling that heroin addiction and prescription drug abuse is a \nlifelong challenge. In my district, heroin addiction tragedies have \ncaused parents to bury their children and have left spouses widowed and \nyoung children parentless.\n  These drugs reach out and impact even the strongest members of our \ncommunities. Addiction is a disease that does not discriminate. The \nsupport offered by treatment centers like St. Joseph's Addiction \nTreatment & Recovery Center in Saranac Lake is critical to those who \nsuffer from this disease. Several veterans whom I had the opportunity \nto visit with at St. Joseph's have seen the harsh reality of war and \nare now fighting battles at home--one against heroin and opioid \naddiction and another against posttraumatic stress disorder.\n  Heroin abuse touches our communities, our homes, and our families in \nways that have grave effects on everyday people and everyday lives. As \nheroin use has increased, police departments across this Nation have \nseen a rapid rise in related crimes, such as sex trafficking, domestic \ndisputes, larceny, burglary, and prostitution--all tied to heroin use.\n  This week, I am honored to stand with my colleagues from both sides \nof\n\n[[Page H2199]]\n\nthe aisle to advance legislative solutions to this widespread and \ninsidious crisis. As a member of Representatives Guinta's and Kuster's \nbipartisan task force to combat heroin abuse and assist law enforcement \nefforts, we have worked tirelessly to find solutions. The legislation \nwe present this week provides critical tools to medical personnel and \nlaw enforcement for stemming the flow of drugs and enhancing treatment \noptions and availability.\n  These are real problems that need to be addressed through innovation, \ncooperation, and thoughtful action. I am confident that we can secure a \nbetter heroin-free future for our Nation. These efforts are not the end \nof the House's work on this issue. We will continue to seek solutions \nto this crisis that has touched families across my district and across \nour Nation.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  On behalf of the families, communities, and veterans in New York's \n21st Congressional District and across the country, I urge my \ncolleagues to join those of us here tonight as we work to eliminate the \nheroin epidemic facing this country.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Stefanik for \ntelling us of the work of St. Joseph's and highlighting the importance \nof the impact of this crisis on veterans.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Ohio (Ms. Kaptur).\n  Ms. KAPTUR. Mr. Speaker, I first thank my colleagues, Congresswoman \nClark for leading this effort, Congressman Guinta, as well as \nCongresswoman Ann Kuster, who have worked tirelessly to move the heroin \ntask force agenda forward. I applaud their persevering efforts and \nHouse leadership's acknowledgement of the danger and devastation the \nheroin and opioid epidemic has caused across our great Nation.\n  This serious situation impacts every county in the 9th District of \nOhio, stretching across all of northern Ohio. We have been impacted \nmore heavily due to the major Ohio turnpike, I-80/I-90, and easy \ntransport networks that link to international smuggling access points.\n  The largest of our district's five counties, Cuyahoga County, \nrecently declared a public health emergency because of record rates of \noverdoses. The county lost a staggering 181 citizens in the first 4 \nmonths of 2016, a rate of overdose death that, if continued, would more \nthan double the 2015 numbers for that county.\n  Mayors across our district report to me the dramatic increase in \nemergency calls connected to the epidemic. For northern Ohio, spikes in \nopioid overdoses are outpacing the ability of local hospitals and \nrehabilitation facilities to respond effectively.\n  This week's legislative activity is imperative to communities across \nAmerica. I encourage our colleagues in leadership to work expeditiously \nto conference the legislation. Send it to the President with funding \nimmediately. People's lives and local community stability and safety \nare waiting for our action.\n  Tonight I would like to share the stories of three young adults--two \nnamed Matt and one named Tracy--who have been victimized by the heroin \nand opioid epidemic.\n  The first is Matt who was 29 from Toledo, Ohio, who never thought he \nwould become a drug addict. He never knew anything about drugs. He \nnever even smoked cigarettes as a youth. He had a great upbringing and \na good home with an amazingly loving family. He went to private schools \nfrom kindergarten through high school, then to college at a Division I \nuniversity on a full athletic scholarship for baseball after graduating \nwith a 4.0 GPA.\n  So what happened, you ask?\n  He tore his rotator cuff as a sophomore in college and was given a \nprescription for 90 percent Percocet. It only took about a week before \nhe became physically dependent and totally reliant. Percocet became the \ngateway portal to self-annihilation.\n  To sum up, his next year, Percocet pills got expensive, and he \ndropped out of college. And one day, not being able to find any pills \nbecause of the price and lack of availability, he was offered heroin, \nwhich was cheaper and stronger. And from that day on, he was hooked and \ninjected heroin for 9 years.\n  Matt transformed into a shell of who he used to be, a shell of who he \nwanted to be and who he always imagined to become. Matt lost everything \nand everyone in his life because of heroin. After 13 arrests in four \ndifferent states, he is now a convicted felon. He overdosed and died, \nhaving been kept alive for 5 days by machines in ICU.\n  How could this have happened to such a promising young man?\n  Heroin and opioid abuse sees no boundaries. It is death masquerading \nas medicine.\n  In Toledo, there are only 16 federally funded detox beds for an \nestimated 10,000 opiate addicts. We simply have to have legislation \nthat allows for more detox facilities. There are programs like Team \nRecovery that have made a difference in the lives of individuals like \nTracy, whose story I will place in the Record.\n  Let me just say that if there are families out there who need \nassistance, one can call 1-800-662-4357 for advice and direction. That \nis an addiction hotline, 1-800-662-HELP. The life you save may be your \nown or that of a relative, friend, or loved one.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank my colleagues Frank Guinta and Ann \nKuster who have worked tirelessly to move the Heroin Task Force agenda \nforward. I applaud their persevering efforts and House Leaderships' \nacknowledgment of the danger and devastation the heroin and opioid \nepidemic has caused across this great nation.\n  This serious situation impacts every county in our 9th Ohio district \nthat stretches across all of northern Ohio. We have been impacted more \nheavily due to the major Ohio Turnpike, I-80-90, and easy transport \nnetworks that link to international smuggling access points.\n  The largest of our district's five counties, Cuyahoga County, \nrecently declared a public health emergency because of record rates of \noverdoses. The County lost a staggering 181 citizens in the first four \nmonths of 2016, a rate of overdose deaths that if continued, would more \nthan double 2015 numbers for the County.\n  Mayors across our district report to me the dramatic increase in \nemergency calls connected to the epidemic. For Northern Ohio, spikes in \nopioid overdoses are outpacing the ability of local hospitals and \nrehabilitations facilities to respond effectively. This week's \nlegislative activity is imperative to communities across America. I \nencourage our colleagues and leadership to work expeditiously to \nconference the legislation. Send it to the President, with funding, \nimmediately.\n  People lives and local community stability are waiting for our \naction.\n  Tonight, I want to share the stories of three young adults--two named \nMatt--and one named Tracy. Individuals from our district who have been \nvictimized by the heroin and opioid epidemic.\n  The first is Matt, who was 29, from Toledo, Ohio. He never thought he \nwould become a drug addict. He never knew anything about drugs, not \neven wanting to smoke cigarettes as a youth. He had a great upbringing \nin a good home, with an amazingly loving family. He went to private \nschools from kindergarten through high school, then to college at a \nDivision 1 university on a full athletic scholarship for baseball after \ngraduating with a 4.0 GPA. So what happened, you ask?\n  He tore his rotator cuff as a sophomore in college and was given a \nprescription for 90 Percocet. It only took about a week before he \nbecame physically dependent and totally reliant. Percocet became the \ngateway portal to self-annihilation.\n  To sum up--his next year, Percocet pills got expensive and he dropped \nout of college. One day, not being able to find any pills because of \nthe price and lack of availability, he was offered heroin, which was \ncheaper and stronger. From that day on he was hooked, and injected \nheroin for 9 years.\n  Matt transformed into a shell of who he used to be, a shell of who he \nwanted to be--and who he always imagined to become. He lost \neverything--and everyone--in his life because of heroin.\n  After thirteen arrests in four different states, he is now a \nconvicted felon. He overdosed and died, having been kept alive for 5 \ndays by machines in ICU. How could this have happened to such a \npromising young man? Heroin and opioid abuse sees no boundaries. It is \ndeath masquerading as medicine.\n  In Toledo, there are only sixteen federally funded detox beds for an \nestimated 10,000 opiate addicts. Another young man also named Matt was \none of the lucky ones who was able to secure a detox bed through Ohio's \nDrug Abuse Response Team, or DART program. Today, it has been almost \neight months since he was able to secure the bed, which has changed his \ncourse completely.\n  In detox, along with three friends, all of which remain sober, Matt \nstarted Team Recovery, an advocacy group for addicts that makes \nrecovery available and achievable. Team Recovery strives to change the \nstigma attached to addiction and make people realize addicts are not \nbad people. They are people who need medical help.\n  Team Recovery speaks to Ohio students between 6th grade and college-\nage, about\n\n[[Page H2200]]\n\ndrugs and alcohol, and offers assistance to family members and friends \nof those who need healing and support. They hope to eventually spread \ntheir efforts across the nation.\n  Today, Matt has turned his life around and reconnected with family \nand friends. He speaks daily with police, judges, coroners, doctors, \ntreatment providers, police & fire chiefs, all in an effort to \ncollaborate in this fight against opiates. His message is positive and \nclear. Recovery is possible, and it is beautiful.\n  Working alongside Matt at Team Recovery is Tracy, 39 years old, who \npoint blank told me that she is a recovering addict. Tracy started \nsmoking marijuana when she was 15, to numb the pain from past sexual \nabuse, not otherwise knowing how to cope in a healthy way. She moved \nfrom Toledo, to Chillicothe, Ohio in 2001, where she met a man who \nintroduced her to opioid pills and cocaine. At age 24, she started \nusing cocaine and it wasn't long before she used it every day.\n  Eventually, she started to smoke it and even inject.\n  For 6 years her addiction was so bad she lost everything: jobs, \nfriends, family, everything she owned, even her dignity and morals. She \nwas alone fighting the worst battle of her life.\n  In 2007, she was caught with possession of cocaine, after reoffending \nshortly after, she was sent to prison. Rather than give Tracy any \nchance to seek treatment, she was sent to prison for 5 years.\n  In prison, she realized there were just as many drugs in prison as on \nthe street. Being there did not help. She needed treatment, not a \nprison sentence. It is nearly impossible to find a treatment facility \nbecause there are so few available.\n  From the age of 15 until May 4, 2007, Tracy abused drugs. What drove \nher to sobriety? She was so tired of losing everything, living couch to \ncouch, doing illegal things to get drugs and having her dignity and \nmorals stripped away because she was chasing a high. She was ready for \na change, to take back the life she lost during her addiction.\n  Today, her life has changed dramatically. A week ago, on May 4th, she \ncelebrated 9 years of sobriety. Now, she uses her experience of moving \npast addiction to help others. She is in college, studying psychology \nto become a substance abuse counselor. She started a job at a recovery \nhouse as a resident advisor and is also an active member of Team \nRecovery.\n  The legislative action the House will address this week will provide \nmuch needed correction to our justice and health systems--which have \nnot adapted fast enough to this crisis.\n  I wish to emphasize a few lessons Team Recovery highlighted to me. \nThese are the recommendations of individuals who understand the plight \nof heroin and opioid addiction better than most:\n  1. There needs to be more funding for detox beds. They should not be \nlimited to 16 beds per facility.\n  2. Medicaid should not cap facilities to 16 detox beds.\n  3. Prevention, education, and awareness are paramount! The innovative \napproach of Team Recovery's school presentations allows students to \nbetter relate, impacting their understanding and behavior.\n  4. Better monitoring of prescription prescribing and over-prescribing \nis needed. Creating stricter limitations on prescription counts is \nhighly necessary.\n  5. Suboxone and Methadone (opioids) are not the solution to an opiate \nepidemic for everyone, but cannot be ruled out as an option for some.\n  6. Vivitrol is a key resource and should be utilized more.\n  7. Recovery is possible but detox and treatment are paramount. Jail \nwithout addiction treatment fails those who need help.\n  8. Opioids impact the way the brain functions. Recovery can take \nmonths, if not years, if it is to be effective.\n  Finally, if anyone listening is facing this terrible monster of \naddiction, or you know a friend or loved one who is, call 1-800-662-\nHELP.\n  That's 1-800-662-4357 for advice and direction.\n  The life you save may be your own, or that of a relative, friend or \nloved one.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Kaptur for \nputting a face to this addiction with the moving stories of Matt and \nTracy.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. Chabot).\n  Mr. CHABOT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Clark and Mr. Guinta for their \nhard work in making this Special Order happen tonight and in moving \nforward on this very, very important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, opioid use is an epidemic in this country, and \nunfortunately the problem is only getting worse.\n  I want to also commend Senator Rob Portman for his leadership in \nintroducing and passing in the other body CARA, legislation to combat \nopioids, especially heroin. I would expect that whatever we pass here \nin the House--and we are considering a number of bills--will ultimately \nbe reconciled with the Senate and Mr. Portman's bill over in the \nSenate. This will help many struggling Americans.\n  I talked to a member of a city council in one of the smaller \ncommunities in my district back in--I represent the greater Cincinnati \narea--in Lorain County. It happened to be North Bend.\n  According to the last census, there are only 857 people who live in \nthe entire village, so it is pretty small. But the first councilperson \nthat I talked to talked about the heroin problem they are having in \nthis community. This is a very small community, kind of a normal, \nmiddle class area. There are great people, families, hardworking \npeople. Yet, heroin is becoming a scourge in this community.\n  William Henry Harrison, one of our earlier presidents--he has his \nmonument and was buried--is from this community. It is just amazing to \nme to think that if it is hitting a small community like this, it is \nhitting virtually everywhere.\n  Simply put, we must find workable solutions to this epidemic. High \nincome, low income, urban, suburban, rural, it really doesn't matter. \nThis epidemic is impacting communities all across this country.\n  In fact, in my home State of Ohio, 13 out of 16 congressional \ndistricts are designated as high intensity drug trafficking areas by \nthe Office of National Drug Control Policy. Back in 2014, just a little \nover a year ago, we had a staggering 2,744 heroin deaths in our State \nalone. Obviously, States all over the country are having this problem \nas well.\n  Mr. Speaker, in searching for an answer to this problem--I happened \nto be the dean of the Republicans in Ohio--we had a briefing with the \nhead of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, Michael Botticelli. \nWe actually learned an awful lot about what is happening in our State \nand nationally.\n  Basically what we learned is that there are two fronts. It is \nreducing the supply and it is eliminating the demand. Supply reduction \nis a complex issue. Since much of the heroin is coming across the \nMexican border, obviously, increased border security is important. \nTreatment is absolutely important.\n  The Drug Enforcement Agency often has take-back days where people can \ndrop off old prescriptions to licensed agents for disposal. What we \nhave seen are that an awful lot of especially young people who are \ngetting hooked on heroin start out with prescription drugs, and \noftentimes it is something that they got from a family member in their \nown home.\n  Despite additional control mechanisms, if there is one thing we have \nlearned over the years, it is almost impossible to completely cut off \nthe supply of any particular drug. So we must also eliminate the \ndemand.\n  We need to focus on drug treatment and prevention programs. For \nexample, in Cincinnati, we have something called the Talbert House, \nwhich is one of many nonprofits that help folks in southwest Ohio and \nnorthern Kentucky to combat substance abuse. So there are many, many \nprograms that we already have. We need to have more.\n  I want to, again, commend the fact that this is happening in a \nbipartisan manner. We have a lot of Members in the House, both \nRepublicans and Democrats, who have come together and have a lot of \ngood plans. They have talked with the folks in their districts. I \ncommend my colleagues for working on this together in a bipartisan \nmanner.\n  Let's reconcile what we pass here with the Senate, let's get this \npassed into law, and let's move this forward on this very, very \ncritical issue.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts for pulling this Special \nOrder together this evening.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from \nOhio for reminding us that even rural America has not been spared this \nepidemic.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is an emotional night for me. I \nthank the gentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark) for guiding us. I\n\n[[Page H2201]]\n\nalso thank Representatives Guinta and Kuster. I am so moved by the fact \nthat we are here on a bipartisan statement.\n  As I spoke to Ms. Kuster and indicated, as a ranking member of the \nSubcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations \ncount me in, as she began to expand the tragic window of the impact of \ndrug addiction, particularly opioids. Let me speak very quickly because \nI have a lot to say.\n  This is an epidemic that has gone beyond reason. Between 2000 and \n2014, almost half a million people died from drug overdoses. In 2014 \nalone, more than 47,000 people died of drug overdoses. The largest \npercentage of overdose deaths in 2014 were attributed to opioids like \nprescription painkillers, methadone, morphine, and heroin.\n  Today in the Rules Committee, we made it clear that we want to work \nwith doctors and law enforcement. We also said that we understand the \nuse of painkillers during end of life. We understand that, so we are \nnot here to condemn. We are here to help.\n  I am so glad that the Judiciary Committee will have on the floor this \nComprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act that responds to this crisis. \nIt is a treatment bill where we will bring together law enforcement \nand substance abuse treatment persons.\n\n  This emergency is compounded due to the perilous connection between \nprescription painkillers and heroin. Approximately three out of four \nnew heroin users report that their use began with their abuse of \nprescription drugs.\n  Not only were 11 million people at risk of overdosing due to their \nabuse of prescription painkillers, 11 million people were also at risk \nof becoming addicted to heroin with its attendant risks.\n  We have heard the stories, and let me share some with you very \nquickly. I read one on the plane as I came up. It was a very painful \nstory. A woman was detained in a fatal car wreck. In that car was her \nlittle 2-year-old and a little 7-year-old. She was on hydrocodone. She \nsideswiped two cars and then killed a person on a motorcycle. That \nperson's family does not have them anymore. This woman will be \nsubjected possibly to life imprisonment. Those children will not have a \nmother.\n  What about the situation in Ohio?\n  We don't know what the circumstances were, but eight persons of a \nfamily were killed execution style. Drugs were behind it.\n  What about this mother who supplied hydrocodone and alcohol to her \nson and his date on prom night?\n  There is an epidemic that we must confront. There are those who would \ndo wrong, but those who are addicted.\n  This is evidenced by a study, ``How the Heroin Epidemic Differs in \nCommunities of Color.'' It is important, as I stand here and look at \nthe suburban and rural areas, that we, again, remember how it has \ndoubled among African Americans, Latinos, and Native Americans and that \nwe look to the kind of resources that would include all.\n  In conclusion, let me share these numbers with you that I think are \nso very important. They are startling. The increase in overdose by \nrates: 267 percent by the White population from 2010 to 2014. 213 \npercent by African Americans from to 2010 to 2014. 137 percent by \nHispanic. And Native Americans, 236 percent. Not one person can be \ncounted out that needs to be included in our work here on the floor of \nthe House.\n  I am glad that we are making this statement today and next week \nbecause now America knows the Congress is speaking, the bully pulpit \nwill be heard, and I hope we can save lives.\n  I am pleased to join my colleagues of the Bipartisan Task Force to \nCombat the Heroin Epidemic to speak on this important issue impacting \nall Americans.\n  I want to thank Congressman Frank Guinta (R-NH) for his leadership in \nelevating this issue to a national forum that has drawn unprecedented \nattention and concern.\n  We must take action because today a leading killer of Americans is \ndrug overdose.\n  Between 2000 and 2014, almost half a million people died from drug \noverdoses.\n  Many of these deaths were preventable.\n  In 2014 alone, more than 47,000 people died of drug overdoses.\n  The largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to \nopioids--like prescription painkillers, methadone, morphine, and \nheroin.\n  Specifically, 28,647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid \nin 2014.\n  We are experiencing an emergency that impacts citizens in every \nstate, city, and town in this country--that is prescription painkiller \nand opioid abuse.\n  This emergency is compounded due to the perilous connection between \nprescription painkillers and heroin.\n  Prescription painkiller abuse is the strongest risk factor for future \nheroin use.\n  Approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their \nuse began with their abuse of prescription painkillers.\n  Heroin use becomes appealing to those addicted to prescription \npainkillers because it is cheaper and easier to obtain.\n  Due to its potency, heroin use tends to lead to addiction.\n  Heroin addiction is often deadly, leading to overdose or other \nchronic diseases.\n  The rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths increased \nis cause for alarm.\n  In the four years between 2010 and 2014, heroin overdoses more than \ntripled.\n  More than 10,500 people died from heroin overdoses in 2014.\n  In 2013, more than 8,200 people died from heroin overdoses.\n  In that same year, 11 million people admitted to improper use of \nprescription painkillers.\n  Not only were 11 million people at risk of overdosing due to their \nabuse of prescription painkillers, 11 million people were also at high \nrisk of becoming addicted to heroin--with its attendant risks and \ndangers.\n  This current crisis requires an immediate and comprehensive response \nand the bill before us today is one element of a broader strategy.\n  I am proud to say that I have worked with my colleagues on the \nJudiciary Committee and with members of the Heroin Task Force to \nintroduce and cosponsor legislation that help combat this deadly \nepidemic.\n\n                  Legislation Supported by Jackson Lee\n\n     1.

It really is \n     disingenuous if the resources are only going to be directed \n     at the suburbs and the counties where, basically, the white \n     folks are getting high.''\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Ms. Jackson Lee for \nher advocacy and leadership and always championing our communities of \ncolor who have also been devastated by this crisis.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding and \nthank her and Mr. Guinta for this very important evening where we are \ntalking about a plague on our country.\n  I am pleased to stand here today to join my colleagues from both \nsides of the aisle in resolve to find real solutions for the heroin and \nopioid epidemic hitting our communities and our Nation. Our Bipartisan \nTask Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic is actively bringing together \nlaw enforcement, treatment, and recovery experts to share critical \ninformation that has been helping us to better understand the issue.\n  This House is working on crafting better laws that will help law \nenforcement tackle this problem so that treatment and recovery \nprofessionals can effectively offer lifesaving treatments to those \ncurrently suffering from addiction.\n  Our words must be followed by action. We are working with all levels \nof government, from the Federal down to the local level, as well as the \nprivate sector and nonprofits to fix this problem.\n  For example, I introduced the Co-Prescribing Saves Lives Act with my \nDemocratic colleague, Congressman Bill Keating, which would encourage \nphysicians to co-prescribe naloxone alongside opioid prescriptions and \nmake naloxone more widely available in Federal health settings. \nNaloxone is a safe and effective antidote to opioid-related overdoses, \nincluding heroin and fentanyl, and is used as a critical tool in \npreventing fatal opioid overdose, having reversed more than 26,000 \noverdoses between 1996 and 2014.\n  I have cosponsored and supported several other bills, such as the \nones we are working on this week, to advance stronger, up-to-date \nsolutions to this brutal epidemic.\n  But it is the human side of the story that motivates us. Every \ndistrict has their stories, and I commend the families that are \nspeaking out so that others don't experience the pain and loss that \nthey have.\n  Vonda Probst from Friedens, Pennsylvania, lost her son Jared Carter \nto a heroin overdose 2 years ago. Jared enjoyed motorcycle riding, four \nwheeling, fixing old cars, and being outdoors. He would have turned 30 \nlast summer. There are far too many stories like Jared's in \nPennsylvania and throughout the Nation, stories about lives full of \npotential and value that are cut short by drug abuse.\n  Chad Schilling was another individual from my district whose family \nhas spoken out. Chad died last month at the age of 32. He was the third \nmember of his high school's 2001 football team. ``It can happen to \nanybody,'' Jeff Schilling, Chad's dad, said. ``I don't care if you're \npoor, you're homeless, you're wealthy, it can happen to you. So get \nhelp.''\n  And then there is Tony Swalligan. As stated in an editorial in \nJohnstown's Tribune-Democrat, Kathi, Tony's mother, wants others to \nknow that she is both grieving and angry that heroin claimed Tony, her \nbaby, the youngest of 10, who was just 23 years old.\n  She said: ``As a woman of faith, I'm taking this to God and asking \nhim to damn heroin. That's how I feel: Damn heroin.''\n  ``You only have to come over to the funeral home,'' Tony's mother \nsaid, ``to know there's absolutely nothing fun about heroin. And it's \nnot just themselves they're killing. They're doing this to their whole \nfamily. You think, `Ooo, I want to get high.' But you're killing your \nwhole family.''\n  His mother said: ``What part of `heroin is highly addictive' don't \nour young people understand? Do they all think they're 6 feet tall and \nbulletproof?''\n  It is these stories that are all too often, but we must, we can find \neffective solutions to the opioid epidemic for these families. I am \nconfident, by working together, we can turn the tide and save lives. I \nthank, again, my colleagues for organizing this very important hour.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congressman Rothfus \nfor sharing the stories of Jared, Chad, and Tony and really putting a \nface and a name to this epidemic.\n  I now yield to the gentlewoman from Maine (Ms. Pingree).\n  Ms. PINGREE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleagues very much for \norganizing this Special Order and for the bipartisan approach to \ndealing with such a challenging issue.\n  I would like to rise today to share some of the stories, as my \ncolleagues have, about my constituents whose lives have been impacted \nby addiction.\n  We are now so well aware that addiction to prescription opioids is on \nthe rise nationwide. In my home State of Maine, that trend has also \nbeen accompanied by a drastic increase in the use of heroin and other \nillicit drugs. Sadly, now heroin and other drugs provide a cheaper, \nmore readily available alternative to diverted prescription medicines. \nThe unpredictable formulations of these drugs, which can vary \ndrastically in toxicity, have made Maine's\n\n[[Page H2203]]\n\nepidemic of addiction particularly deadly.\n  In cities, small towns, and rural areas across the State, people are \ndying each week. Everyone knows someone--a family member, a friend, a \nneighbor--who has overdosed. No one is immune. People from every \nbackground, income level, and generation are at risk.\n  One of the individuals we have tragically lost was a brother of a \nstaff member of mine. His name was David McCarthy, and his struggle \nwith addiction was captured in a feature this summer in The Washington \nPost, entitled, ``And Then He Decided Not to Be.'' David, who had been \nsober for several months, relapsed on the evening before he left home \nto return to his winter job at a ski resort.\n  His family came forward to speak openly and honestly about his death \nbecause they believe, as I do, that removing the stigma and silence \naround addiction is an essential part of treating it as the serious \nillness that it is.\n\n  One of the most poignant aspects of this family's experience is that \nthe day after David's death, his brother Michael overdosed on the same \nbatch of heroin. In Michael's case, however, he was found while he was \nstill alive, and the same paramedics who responded to David's death \nhappened to have a physician with them who administered an overdose \nreversal drug to revive him, so he survived. With his family's support, \nhe has now entered a long-term treatment program. Access to those \nresources, like readily available Narcan and quality treatment \nopportunities, quite literally saves lives.\n  I am deeply frustrated and disappointed that my colleagues here in \nCongress have been unable to come together to provide funding to \naddress this epidemic. I am very glad to see the House working on \nlegislation this week related to opioid abuse, but the reality is, \nwithout funds appropriated to support the new programs created, many of \nthese bills are nothing more than political rhetoric.\n  I am afraid that some lawmakers would prefer to have people suffering \nfrom addiction continue to turn to our already overburdened emergency \nrooms for care, to continue asking them to enter treatment, only to be \nturned away because they can't pay, or asking those people who are \naddicted to continue struggling to recover while also dealing with \nhomelessness, food insecurity, and a range of other challenges. That is \njust unacceptable.\n  Every victim of this epidemic represents an incredible loss, not only \nto the people who love them, but to all of us, in the form of missed \npotential.\n  This summer I had the pleasure of meeting Chris Poulos, a University \nof Maine law graduate who was working to get his security clearance for \na fellowship at the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy. \nThe process was especially difficult for him because he is a convicted \nfelon who was arrested for drug possession during a period of addiction \nto opioids and other drugs; but now Chris is devoting his considerable \ntalent and intellect to helping others--not despite, but because of his \nown recovery. The State of Maine and our country are better off because \nhe could access treatment when he needed it.\n  Our constituents need treatment, and they need it now. States can't \nface the epidemic alone, and they shouldn't have to. The difference \nFederal funding can make became clear to me recently when I visited \nCrossroads, a recovery center in my district. Through a Federal grant, \nthey established a treatment program for pregnant and parenting women \nwhich allows them to remain unified with their children while working \non their recovery.\n  One participant, Helen, came to the program while pregnant with her \nfourth child. The caring staff at Crossroads worked with her to ensure \nthat she was able to bond with her baby after his birth and help \nfacilitate her transition to a long-term sober housing program. I am \nproud that Federal funding played a part in her recovery. I firmly \nbelieve that helping Helen to get clean is a great investment in her, \nin her children, and in our society.\n  During my visit to Crossroads, though, I heard about the many people \nwho struggle to access affordable treatment or find themselves left \nwithout any support when they have completed it. They, too, need us \nurgently.\n  Congress needs to come together and appropriate emergency funds to \ncombat the epidemic of opioid abuse in our country. Clearly, it is a \nmatter of life and death.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from \nMaine. I thank her for sharing the personal story of David and Michael. \nI know that, in my extended office family, we grieve and remember and \nwill continue to work for change for Kyle and Emmett, who we have lost \nin the past year as well. We will remember all the names that were \nmentioned in this first hour of Stephen, Jennifer, Morgan, Bethany, \nMatt, Tracy, Jared, Chad, Tony, David, and Michael.\n  I thank my colleague from New Hampshire again for his work on this \nbipartisan task force.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2203-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2203]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4641, \n ESTABLISHING PAIN MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES INTER-AGENCY TASK FORCE, \n  AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 5046, COMPREHENSIVE OPIOID \n                      ABUSE REDUCTION ACT OF 2016\n\n  Mr. STIVERS (during the Special Order of Ms. Clark of Massachusetts), \nfrom the Committee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that Members have 5 \nlegislative days to revise and extend their remarks in the Record.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from New Hampshire?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague, the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark), who is doing great work in \nthis area. New England is particularly stressed with an opioid \nepidemic, as are many other States around the country, but her work is \nimportant because we share a cross-State border. We need to continue to \nwork together on this particular issue.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), a leader on the \nheroin and opioid epidemic and bringing legislation to the floor.\n  Mr. DOLD. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my good friend for yielding. I \nwant to thank Representative Guinta for his leadership with the \nBipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. I also want to \nthank Representative Kuster and Representative Clark for their \nleadership on this issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, between 2001 and 2014, there was a threefold increase in \nprescription drug overdoses. What was amazing is that during that same \nperiod of time there was a sixfold increase in heroin overdoses in the \nUnited States. This is truly an epidemic. Today every 19 minutes, \nsomeone dies from a heroin overdose.\n  In Chicago's collar counties, we lose one individual every 3 days. In \nCook County, it is more than one a day. As the co-chair of the Illinois \nSuburban Anti-Heroin Task Force, I have seen the unimaginable suffering \nthat heroin has brought into families in our community. Naloxone, \nhowever, has proven to be hugely successful as a lifesaving\n\n[[Page H2204]]\n\nantidote. When used, naloxone helps restore breathing that has been \nstopped by an overdose of heroin.\n  In Lake County, Illinois, alone, over the course of a little bit over \na year, over 74 lives have been saved with naloxone. This program \nequips police with the overdose antidote and trains them how to \nadminister this medication. What was fascinating was that the police \nforce didn't have to be asked to do this. They actually requested to \nhave the opportunity because they were coming to these scenes over and \nover and over again, usually about 5 to 7 minutes before first \nresponders and the fire department would come, before the paramedics \nwould be there. They didn't want to actually watch these young people, \nthese individuals, these people who were addicted just wither away and \ndie. So they were given naloxone, they were given the training, and \nthus we have seen the success in one county across our country.\n  My work with the Lake County Opioid Initiative inspired me to \nintroduce Lali's Law with Representative Clark. Our bill is named in \nhonor of Alex Laliberte, a young man from Stevenson High School, who \npassed away just before his finals in his sophomore year.\n  Now, what is amazing about Alex is that Alex was a normal guy. He \nplayed sports, had lots of friends, had good grades, your typical all-\nAmerican, red-blooded young man. Yet when he was in college in that \nfirst part of his sophomore year, he started to get sick, and he went \ninto the hospital. His parents and his teachers, nobody really knew \nwhat was wrong, but he was actually going through withdrawal from \nprescription drugs. He would get better and then, all of a sudden, \nwould repeat this process, until eventually he passed away.\n  Lali's Law will help increase access to naloxone by providing grant \nmoney to States as they implement standing order programs that will \nallow pharmacists to dispense naloxone over the counter without a \nperson-specific prescription. With increased access, the World Health \nOrganization says that we will be able to save at least 20,000 \nadditional lives each and every year.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Naloxone is one piece of the puzzle to combat the opioid epidemic. \nAnother piece is getting addicts saved by naloxone--those that have had \nthat second chance at recovery--into treatment.\n  This summer the Lake County Opioid Initiative is rolling out another \nprogram with the help of police officers who are trying to become that \nlink between the addicts. They are trying to get those suffering from \naddiction into treatment centers that can actually help them. They want \nto bring them in.\n  They say: We don't want to put you in handcuffs. We don't want to put \nyou behind bars. We actually want to get you into treatment. So bring \nyour paraphernalia in, bring the drugs in here, and let's try to get \nyou into an area where you can get that treatment that you need.\n  We are also encouraging people to properly dispose of their excess \nmedications, especially prescription opioids. The Lake County Underage \nDrinking and Drug Prevention Task Force has set up drug take-back boxes \nthroughout Lake County at police departments.\n  What is amazing is that, over the course of the last year, they have \ncollected 12,000 pounds of prescription drugs. This is just in the \npolice station.\n  So we went to Walgreens and said: Please help us. Please help us get \nthis word out. Please help us make it easier for us to allow people to \nget their prescriptions that they don't need--the excess--back. They \nare able to and said they would happily to do that.\n  I am so pleased to announce that Walgreens said they are going to put \n500 prescription take-back boxes throughout the country. This is a huge \nstep forward. CVS is working on education programs. So we appreciate \nthose outside of the Congress that are helping us in this regard.\n  I am thrilled that we are taking up these incredible bills, these \ngreat bills, these steps forward that will help our communities combat \nthe opioid epidemic by leveraging resources in our judicial and public \nhealth systems.\n  I encourage my colleagues to take a look at these very seriously. I \nencourage my colleagues not only to vote for these, but I encourage my \ncolleagues to go back to their community and educate their citizens, \ntheir families, their organizations in their district, about this \nincredible epidemic.\n  There are parents I encounter today that say, ``It is not in my \nneighborhood,'' and it is, ``It is not in my school,'' and it is. The \nevidence is far too overwhelming.\n  Frankly, this is why this week, in a bipartisan effort, Republicans \nand Democrats alike are coming together to shed light on what we see \neach and every day.\n  Because there is no way in the world we can have another parent walk \ninto a bedroom to find another child that has overdosed without doing \nall that we can to try to prevent that tragedy from happening ever \nagain.\n  So, again, I want to thank Frank Guinta, I want to thank Ann Kuster, \nand I want to thank all of those that have come tonight to help combat \nthis incredible epidemic.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I want to thank the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Dold), \nfor his leadership in Lali's Law and making sure that that bill comes \nto the floor for passage, as it is incredibly important to his district \nand honors Alex and his challenge.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from New Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my friend \nand the co-chairman of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic, who is working diligently with me on this task force to do \neverything we can to help citizens of our State and the Nation.\n  Ms. KUSTER. I thank Mr. Guinta for his leadership and all of the \nparticipants in this bipartisan Special Order who are putting a face on \nthe heroin epidemic all across the country.\n  This evening I rise, as co-chair of the Bipartisan Task Force to \nCombat the Heroin Epidemic, to join my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle who have spoken to highlight the impact that this devastating \nimpact has had in our home State of New Hampshire and all across the \ncountry.\n  Just a few months ago our task force held a similar Special Order to \nfocus on the human impacts of this crisis and how it is affecting \nfamilies and friends and colleagues in communities all across our \ndistricts. While the crisis has continued, the good news is that we are \nnow making important progress toward a solution here in Congress.\n  I am appreciative of the important work that the Senate undertook in \npassing the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act, and I want to \nthank Democratic and Republican leadership as well of the relevant \ncommittees for their hard work in recent weeks in bringing legislation \nto the floor of the House this week.\n  At the same time, I call upon my colleagues to ensure that this \nimportant work fulfills its intended purpose by providing the necessary \nassistance to treatment and recovery efforts that are so critical to \nresponding to this crisis.\n  Recently, in January, I spoke about my dear friend Kriss' \nstepdaughter, Amber, who tragically died from an overdose after a \ntreatment bed was unavailable for her after leaving incarceration. This \nstory, of course, illustrates the tragic consequences that limited \ntreatment capacities can have for vulnerable members of our \ncommunities.\n  Another heartbreaking story in my district involves Carl, the son of \nmy constituent and good friend, Sue Messinger.\n  At 24 years old, Carl had been using heroin on and off for about a \nyear before he finally approached his parents to talk about his \naddiction. To put it simply, his parents were stunned.\n  Carl was a recent college graduate who earned good grades and had his \neyes set on applying to dental school. It was almost inconceivable to \nthem that such a high-achieving young man could fall victim to opioid \naddiction. But as they learned that day and as we all now know too \nwell, there is no one face of addiction.\n  After discussing his addiction at length with his parents and asking \nfor their help and support as he began his journey to recovery, Carl's \nparents were able to secure him a place at a detox program over 50 \nmiles away from home, the only one that would take him as a cash-paying \nclient because their insurance would not cover an opioid detox program.\n  Six days later Carl successfully completed the detox and was \ndischarged to\n\n[[Page H2205]]\n\nreturn home to his parents. Over the next several weeks, Carl continued \non his road to recovery. He passed every drug test and remained \nresolutely committed to avoiding all drugs and alcohol. His family was \nso pleased to see him getting better with each and every day.\n  But when Carl came down with an upper respiratory infection shortly \nthereafter, a fatal error occurred in treating the infection. Unaware \nof Carl's history of addiction and his recent completion of detox, the \ndoctor who saw Carl for his respiratory infection prescribed \nCheratussin AC syrup, a narcotic cough suppressant.\n  Triggered by the codeine in the cough syrup, Carl's addiction was \ninstantly reawakened. When Carl could resist the craving no longer, he \ndecided to inject. The substance he injected, however, was pure \nfentanyl, 50 times more powerful than heroin. He died of an overdose in \nhis family's home.\n  There were no labels on the bottle that indicated that cough medicine \ncould trigger such drug-seeking behavior and no way for Carl or his \nparents to know that his cough medicine could pose such a fatal danger.\n  Since his death, his mother Sue has spoken out about the need to \nreform labeling requirements to make sure that no other family has to \nendure what she has had to live through. Carl was an educated, kind, \ndriven young man who came from a supportive family, and this tragedy \ncould occur to anyone.\n  The tragedy of Carl's story is why I was proud to help introduce \nJessie's Law. Sponsored by Representative Walberg, this bill would seek \nto ensure that medical professionals have full knowledge of a patient's \nprevious opioid addiction.\n  It seeks to do this by requiring the Secretary of Health and Human \nServices to develop standards for the prominent display of a patient's \nhistory of opioid addiction in their medical records when those \npatients consent to include that information and by ensuring that the \ninformation can more easily be shared among providers with consent.\n  While this legislation was only recently introduced and is not \nincluded in the current package of bills, I am hopeful we can work on \nbipartisan basis to bring this important bill to the floor before the \nend of this session.\n  I am very pleased with the legislation we are considering this week \nthat will have a measurable impact to move the needle in finding this \nepidemic.\n  Among the 15 bills on the floor this week, half are part of the \nlegislative agenda developed by the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the \nHeroin Epidemic that I started with my colleague, Congressman Guinta. \nAdditionally, provisions of several other bills are included in \nlegislation being considered.\n  So this week represents truly important progress in the House. It is \ncritical that those who have engaged in the fight against the epidemic \ncontinue to press on in our efforts to include critical financial \nassistance for prevention, treatment, and recovery in our final bill.\n  As we reflect tonight on those we have lost to this epidemic and \nthose who are still fighting it, let us continue to focus to ensure our \ncommunities have the help that they need to put this crisis behind is.\n  Again, I thank all of our colleagues who are working to stop this \nepidemic.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I want to thank the gentlewoman from New Hampshire for \ntalking about Carl and our good friend Kriss and her stepdaughter \nAmber.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick), my \ncolleague.\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. I thank Representative Guinta for yielding and for \nhis incredible and sustained leadership, along with Representative \nKuster and others, on this important bipartisan work.\n  I know that we all wonder if the work that we do here in the Nation's \ncapital--the bills that we consider, the votes that we cast--is having \nan impact on individuals.\n  I truly believe--and I know that each of us do--that, if we can pass \nthe bills that are being discussed here tonight, we can get them \nthrough the Senate and on the President's desk. If they could become \nlaw, we literally could save lives. We could see families being saved.\n  For some that we represent, the opioid drug use may seem a world \naway. But, sadly, the numbers remove any doubt about heroin's impact so \nclose to home when we have heard those stories told over and over again \nthis evening.\n  By every metric, the effects of heroin has reached epidemic levels. I \nheard Representative Courtney earlier today here on the floor speak \nabout the epidemic as a national emergency. With that I agree.\n  In Pennsylvania, heroin overdoses and opioid abuse will kill more \npeople than homicides or influenza. In some States, it is more deadly \nthan automobile accidents.\n  There are several reasons for the rising statistics, Mr. Speaker, \nincluding the increased supply and decreased cost of heroin and the \nincreasing number of Americans addicted to opioid painkillers.\n  At a townhall meeting last fall in Quakertown, Bucks County, \nPennsylvania, in my district, graduates of the Bucks County Drug Court \nshared their inspirational journeys toward recovery.\n  These stories, while marked with tragedy, are also punctuated with \nthe hope that their message can save others from the pain and the loss \nof heroin addiction. Their message is having an impact.\n  My community of Bucks County, Pennsylvania, and others around this \ncountry are joining in the fight against drug abuse. Just 2 weeks ago, \nBucks County residents helped dispose of more than 10,394 pounds of old \npills and prescription drugs.\n\n  I just heard this evening both Representative Dold and Representative \nChabot speak about what they referred to as drug take-back days. We in \nBucks County have removed literally tons of prescription drugs from the \nstreet, medicine cabinets, and from the water stream. Remove the supply \nas we work to remove the demand.\n  As a member of the task force, I am continuing to work with leaders \nlike those speaking here tonight in both political parties toward a \ncommon goal of developing and enacting these national policies to stem \nthe rising tide of drug use and drug abuse.\n  Through the hard work of this task force and the tireless efforts of \nlocal recovery advocates across our country, this week the House will \ntake an important step toward passing comprehensive policies designed \nto help combat the opioid epidemic facing our Nation.\n  I am proud to be part of this effort that will undoubtedly help save \nothers from the pain and the loss of addiction.\n  I thank Representative Guinta for his leadership. We look forward to \nthe success of these bills here this week.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank Congressman Fitzpatrick for his leadership on the \nbipartisan task force and for working with us to combat this \nsignificant challenge.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Staten Island, New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  Mr. DONOVAN. I thank Congressman Guinta and Congresswoman Kuster for \ntheir leadership in this area.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week the House of Representatives will act to pass \na package of bills addressing the opioid crisis.\n  One of them, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, will \nauthorize new grant programs for cities and nonprofits for education, \ntreatment, and enforcement, and not a minute too soon.\n  Opioid abuse is an epidemic. It is everywhere you look. It is in our \nneighborhood, in our social circles, and in our schools. Too many \nparents have buried their sons and daughters or watched them struggle \nfor years with addiction, treatment, and relapse. It has to stop.\n  An effective response needs to address three areas: education, \ntreatment, and enforcement. Today's youth have to be educated about the \ndangers of addiction, and loved ones need to learn to recognize the \nearly signs.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  The legislation the House will pass this week authorizes new grants \nto prevent the next generation from abusing pills and heroin.\n  Proven diversion programs, like the drug treatment courts I \nparticipated in as district attorney of Staten Island\n\n[[Page H2206]]\n\nfor 12 years, should have the resources and the staffing needed to \naccomplish their mission: To get users off of drugs.\n  The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act authorizes grants to \nestablish new drug courts and expand those already in operation. \nHowever, we must follow up on our efforts this week and ensure that the \ngrant application process is not overly complicated and onerous.\n  In the past, the Federal grant processes has discouraged effective \ntreatment organizations from seeking the resources made available by \nCongress. This is a national health emergency, and the bureaucracy must \nnot get in the way of treatment.\n  Mr. Speaker, this week marks a major step forward. Congress is \ndirecting resources towards programs and policies that have been \neffective, and will continue to evaluate what is working and what is \nnot. By working together and getting the right tools to local experts, \nwe can beat this demon of addiction.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New York for his \nwork on the Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, I thank him for his work on the \ntask force and continuing the fight in this epidemic.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. Rodney \nDavis).\n  Mr. RODNEY DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues, Mr. \nGuinta, Ms. Kuster, and the previous Special Order leader, Ms. Clark. \nThis is tremendously a great turnout for such an important subject, and \nfor you three to lead it. Especially my good friend, Mr. Guinta, I want \nto say thank you on behalf of the many families who have been affected \nby this epidemic in Central Illinois where I am blessed to serve. I \nthink this shows how serious Congress is about addressing the issue of \nopioids and addiction in our country, and I am happy the House is going \nto consider important pieces of legislation this week.\n  I want to read a quote from today's Bloomington, Illinois, \nPantagraph. It says: ``The profile of a typical heroin user shooting up \nin an alley or backstage at a rock concert no longer holds true.''\n  According to the CDC, there were more than 1,700 drug overdose deaths \nin my home State of Illinois in 2014, and the eighth highest in the \nNation.\n  As of March of this year, the Illinois Department of Public Health \nreported that 761 deaths in 2015 were attributed to heroin alone. And \nwhile the majority of these occur in the Chicagoland area, our State's \nrural communities, the communities that I serve, have seen a noticeable \nrise of heroin-related deaths in recent years.\n  As a matter of fact, just yesterday in Bloomington, Illinois, the \ntowns of Bloomington, Normal, McLean County, I was there. There have \nbeen seven deaths last year attributed in that one county to heroin \nuse.\n  I had the opportunity to join McLean County Sheriff Jon Sandage and \nCounty Coroner Kathy Davis and talk about what they see firsthand.\n  Mr. Speaker, I saw for the first time in my life what heroin looked \nlike in the evidence locker at the McLean County Sheriff's Office just \nyesterday. I also had the opportunity to ride along with McLean County \nSheriff's Deputy Jonathan Albee, a handler in the department's K-9 \nUnit, and his dog, Keej, who liked to bark at me a lot while I was in \nthat car.\n  We discussed the recent rise in heroin overdoses, as well as the 70 \npercent increase in arrests for controlled substance possession that \nthe McLean County Sheriff's Office says they have seen in the last \nyear. And during that ride-along, I got to experience a stop where \ndrugs were found, but not heroin.\n  This is the community where my daughter just finished her freshman \nyear in college. I have seen how this epidemic cannot just touch larger \ncommunities, many urban communities like Bloomington, Normal, and \nMcLean County, it touches my home county of Christian County, too.\n  Mr. Speaker, just a few years ago our county health department \ndirector was arrested for heroin use and heroin possession. If it can \nhappen to our own county health department director, it can happen to \nanyone, regardless of your socioeconomic status.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are many factors that have made this epidemic \nwidespread, from prescription practices, to the actions of cartels \nsouth of the border; and that is why we are addressing this important \nissue this week in the House of Representatives.\n  I am proud to join with my colleague, Mr. Guinta. I want to thank him \nand the rest of the colleagues who have come here tonight to support \nthis important issue.\n  I can't wait to vote in a bipartisan way for every single bill we are \ngoing to take up this week to address this very important issue.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank the gentleman from Illinois for his being here \nthis evening, his leadership. He has talked very eloquently over the \nlast several months about constituents of his that he is working so \nclosely to help in creating an opportunity for recovery. So I thank the \ngentleman and thank him for being here.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Chester, Pennsylvania \n(Mr. Costello).\n  Mr. COSTELLO of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, Kevin Steele, who is the \ndistrict attorney in Montgomery County, one of the four counties that I \nrepresent a portion of in southeastern Pennsylvania, noted earlier this \nweek that there were 2,500 drug overdose deaths in Pennsylvania over \nthe past year, 60 alone in Montgomery County.\n  This is what he said: ``We're seeing numbers we haven't seen before. \nWe're on pace to have the deadliest year for overdoses.''\n  Now, not all of them are heroin, but quite a good number of them are.\n  I did not plan on coming down here to the House floor and speaking \nabout any particular individual who I know, and I won't name names; but \nI will say this, and this is a bit of a surreal moment for me.\n\n  Between the time that I left my office and I came to the House floor, \nmy brother texted me to let me know that someone that he went to high \nschool with, who he was goods friends with, who played in my backyard \ngrowing up, had passed away.\n  I then reached out to my other friend, who let me know that it was \nindeed, by all accounts, heroin. And in speaking with this friend, he \nshared with me the names of a few other individuals from my high school \nthat I was completely unaware of who have passed away in the past 6 \nmonths, kids I haven't seen or heard from in 15 or 20 years, but \nnevertheless, it strikes very close to home for me and I am sure a lot \nof Members here tonight who have had firsthand experience with the \nepidemic.\n  As a member of the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin \nEpidemic, I do want to thank Mr. Guinta and his leadership. We have an \nopportunity this week to take constructive steps to combat the heroin \nand opioid epidemic that damages our communities and destroys families, \nand we have that opportunity by bringing a series of commonsense, \nbipartisan bills to the House floor for consideration.\n  Now, it is a package of bills. I won't get into the specifics of each \none. I would rather paint with a little bit more of a broad brush here \nthis evening and simply say that these legislative efforts to take \nconstructive steps to get direct and immediate resources to those on \nthe front line in this battle, our first responders, our physicians, \nand healthcare providers, our local and municipal officials, is a \ntremendous step forward in the right direction.\n  I served as a county commissioner, and I can tell you, I know the \nchallenges that our local emergency responders and law enforcement \nprofessionals face each and every day.\n  Indeed, last week I was in Berks County, one of the four counties I \nrepresent, and had a roundtable with the county commissioners there, \nthe district attorney, the director of the emergency department at the \nlocal hospital, and also drug treatment professionals.\n  It is very clear that we need a multilateral approach between drug \ntreatment professionals, medical professionals, local officials. They \neach play a different role, but the theme is somewhat the same.\n  We have outdated regulations, we have insufficient resources, and we \nneed to better align the resources that we are providing. And that is \nwhat we are going to do this week in the House, positive productive \nsteps on a bipartisan basis to get those on the front lines in our \ncommunities, the resources they need. In doing so, we will better\n\n[[Page H2207]]\n\nempower our local first responders, our local law enforcement, and our \ncommunity healthcare providers.\n  I would be remiss if I didn't also speak about the issue of \nprevention, prevention in the first instance. Abuse-deterrent \nmedications are critical. Our life sciences industry in my district and \nacross this country are making tremendous strides. It is a key \ncomponent in preventing addiction for many in the first instance.\n  Let me conclude, though, with this, Mr. Speaker. As legislators, as \nlawmakers, we can't end this epidemic. A law, any number of laws that \nsimply pass the House that may get signed into law are not going to end \nan epidemic. We understand that--and I want the American people to \nunderstand tonight--we are not saying that by passing laws, we end the \nepidemic.\n  But what we can do is improve collaboration and better align \nresources from and for the various stakeholders so that together we can \nturn the trajectory of this epidemic, which is on a very dangerous \ncourse, we can turn it into a declining direction, which is what we \nneed to do. We need to turn this around.\n  We have a tremendous opportunity here in the House this week to take \nvery positive steps in that direction, and I want to thank Mr. Guinta \nfor his leadership on this issue.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. \nCostello) for being here this evening and for his leadership in \nauthoring the Prevent Drug Addiction Act of 2016, another mechanism by \nwhich we can provide opportunity to those who suffer from the ailment \nof addiction. His work is very well-regarded on the bipartisan task \nforce and, again, I thank him for his leadership.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to another honorable gentleman from the great \nState of Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan), my good friend.\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire and \nall of my colleagues who have taken this approach to comprehensive \ndiscussion on what we can do with legislation to deal with the issue of \nnot just heroin abuse, but the opioids that are now a precursor.\n  I would suggest that just about everybody who has come to this floor \ncomes with a personal story. Mine is very personal as well.\n\n  The name of the act that I am sponsoring that is part of this \ncomprehensive package is the John Thomas Decker Act.\n  John was an athlete of great talent. He was one of the record holders \nfor more than a decade as a receiver who went on to Cornell as part of \na program in which he was a lacrosse player, a program that won a \nnational championship during his time there.\n  But John, like so many student athletes, suffered from a knee injury \nthat impacted his ability to play, and like so many, he played through \nthe pain. And one of the things that he used in order to deal with that \npain was opioids, opioids that in the beginning were prescribed, and \nthen subsequently were used by him without a prescription.\n  But that should not surprise you, because one of the things that we \nlook at with respect to college athletes is that 23 percent of college \nathletes, according to one NCAA study, have been prescribed pain \nmedications during the course of the year. Another 6 percent, on top of \nthat, self-prescribe with opioids.\n  So as a result, we have almost 1 in 4--more than 1 in 4 dealing with \nopioids. The problem being that that leads, oftentimes, to an \naddiction. There is a misunderstanding, a belief among many that it is \na much safer drug because it has been prescribed, but not a recognition \nthat it can lead, in weeks and even days with daily use, to a \npsychological dependency, which can lead toward the addiction.\n  Many people think that because they have been able to get it under \ncontrol, they will return to it at some time later at a dosage that \nthey used before, and because of the concentration being higher, they \nwill return, and oftentimes it can lead, as it did in John Thomas \nDecker's situation, to an overdose.\n  The John Tomas Decker Act is designed to enable, at the high school \nlevel, the Centers for Disease Control to reach out, study the impact \nof opioid use among high school athletes and better arm those who \nengage with them to monitor the use of those who have been prescribed \nit, to screen for history of current drug use, depression, other kinds \nof things that can lead to addiction, and begin to educate not just \nthose student athletes, but those who are in charge of those student \nathletes about the great concern of opioid abuse, which can lead to \nheroin addiction and, ultimately, death.\n\n                              {time}  2045\n\n  I'm grateful for the leadership of my colleague from New Hampshire \nand her counterpart across the aisle for their work in this important \narea. I urge my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to support the \nJohn Thomas Decker Act, and I know that all of us will be committed to \ndoing everything we can to stay ahead of this very, very challenging \nissue for our Nation.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I thank the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan) for \nhis leadership on the John Thomas Decker Act and his work in fighting \nthis addiction as well.\n  Again, I thank the gentleman very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. \nJenkins).\n  Mr. JENKINS of West Virginia. Mr. Speaker, the United States is in \nthe middle of a drug crisis that is ravaging urban and rural \ncommunities alike. We have seen the overdose rates skyrocket in the \nUnited States in recent years. My home State of West Virginia sits atop \nthe list, and I have seen firsthand the destruction that the disease of \naddiction has brought to our cities and towns.\n  But imagine for a moment actually starting your life in the throes of \nwithdrawal. This is the tragic reality for thousands of newborns \nnationwide. During pregnancy, a baby is exposed to any drugs the mother \ntakes. As soon as they are born, their bodies begin going through \nwithdrawal from heroin, opioids, and other drugs. Not even babies are \nimmune from the effects of this drug epidemic.\n  Until you see these babies going through withdrawal yourself, you \ncannot imagine their suffering. Their bodies shake with tremors. Their \ncries are heartbreaking. They are sensitive to noise, to light, and \neven to touch. No baby should have to go through withdrawal in their \nfirst hours, in their first days or weeks of his or her life.\n  We in the House are working together on this critical issue. We are \npassing much-needed legislation to create a path to recovery and a path \nto a healthy start in life for every child.\n  I am honored to have legislation included in this package of bills \nthis week. The Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act will expand \nour knowledge of coverage and care for newborns with neonatal \nabstinence syndrome, or NAS, babies suffering from withdrawal after \nbirth from the exposure during pregnancy.\n  The dramatic increase of NAS, the challenges to developing new models \nof care, and breaking down regulatory barriers are things I know all \ntoo well. I helped start Lily's Place in my hometown of Huntington, \nWest Virginia, which treats NAS newborns in a stand-alone facility. The \ncare given is complementary to the traditional hospital setting. Lily's \nPlace offers clinical care by doctors and nurses, as well as social \nworkers for families.\n  Hearing the cries of these newborns will forever change you. We owe \nit to each and every child to make sure they have a chance to start \ntheir lives healthy and happy.\n  I wish to thank Congressman Guinta and Congresswoman Kuster for their \nleadership on the Bipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic. \nBy working together, we can find solutions and build a brighter future.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia for his \nleadership on the Nurturing and Supporting Healthy Babies Act. I look \nforward to voting this week in favor of the gentleman's legislation, \nand I appreciate the gentleman's compassion and passion for the issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Georgia, Congressman \nCarter.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for holding \nthis Special Order to discuss such an important issue.\n  Mr. Speaker, as a lifelong pharmacist, I have experienced firsthand\n\n[[Page H2208]]\n\nthe struggles that medical professionals and Americans face with \nprescription drug abuse. Many don't realize, but medical professionals \nare not immune to prescription drug abuse. I have had several \ncolleagues in the pharmacy profession who have struggled with \nprescription drug abuse.\n  In addition, I was the cosponsor in the Georgia General Assembly when \nthe Georgia Prescription Drug Monitoring Program was created. I believe \nthat PDMPs are one of the most important tools in the fight against \nprescription drug abuse. As a pharmacist, I experienced several \ncustomers who would walk into my store with an out-of-State driver's \nlicense. As you can imagine, I was a little hesitant to fill a \nprescription of someone who has a Kentucky driver's license when my \nstore is in south Georgia.\n  I believe the best way to address this issue is to work as a team. \nPhysicians, nurses, pharmacists, and anyone else who is part of an \nindividual's medical team has a role to play. We must work together if \nwe want to win against this powerful epidemic.\n  In addition, community leaders, community service centers, and any \nother entity that is involved in community health has a role to play. \nWe must all work together as a community to help people who are \nstruggling with addiction.\n  I encourage all of my colleagues to get involved in this issue. It is \none that will destroy your communities and its families from the inside \nout, and you won't know you have a problem until it is almost too big \nto fight.\n  Again, I want to thank the gentleman from New Hampshire for holding \nthis Special Order. I hope we can continue to work together on this \nissue because this work will never be done.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from Georgia \nfor his leadership, and particularly for his expertise in the area of \npharmacology. It is a critical component of understanding that we need \nto achieve based on the opioid crisis. I appreciate the gentleman's \nleadership and his ability to work with the Congress to make sure that \nwe are finding and striving for solutions beyond opioids for \nprescriptions for pain in the country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from California, Congressman \nKnight.\n  Mr. KNIGHT. I want to thank Congresswoman Kuster and Congressman \nGuinta for taking a leadership role in this epidemic. This is something \nthat has gone across the country. We have seen huge rises in the \nNortheast and across the Midwest, but this is something that is not \nimmune from any one of our districts.\n  I, along with Representatives Esty and Costello, are sponsoring \nlegislation to establish education programs for both consumer awareness \nand practitioner training to get at the root of most of these \naddictions.\n  As a police officer for 18 years with the LAPD, I have seen an awful \nlot of drug addiction and drug addiction problems in our streets. We \nsaw rock hit our streets many, many years ago, and that is still \ninfiltrating many of our urban areas in America. Then we moved on to \nother drugs like meth and heroin.\n  Heroin was always one of those kind of taboo drugs, but today it is \nnot. We have seen a lot of the kids that get addicted because they got \na sports injury or they got some other issue and have gotten a \nprescription drug, and they have moved on from the oxys when they have \nrun out of these opioids and they have moved on to heroin.\n  So it has not become a taboo drug. It has actually been a new drug \nthat they can continue on their addiction; and they don't understand \nwhat it is doing to their body, and they don't understand the \naddictions that are hurting them and, in some instances, killing them.\n  We have seen heroin and fentanyl taking over our streets and not just \nmoving from California to Maine, but absolutely taking over America and \nhurting our kids and killing our kids in record numbers.\n  My wife is also an NICU nurse. She has been an NICU nurse for about \n20 years, and she has seen the effects of little babies that have come \nin and are now addicted to these drugs, and they are addicted to \nheroin. Seeing what this does to a baby that is born premature and now \naddicted to this drug makes your heart go out, but you also understand \nthe problems that these babies are going to have probably for a very \nlong time in their young lives.\n  If we don't do something, this will continue to ravage our kids, and \nit will continue to kill our kids on our streets. If Congressman Guinta \nand Congresswoman Kuster had not brought this forward, then somebody \nwould have had to. But who? So I say I thank you to them both for doing \nthis. I know it ravages your State of New Hampshire, but it also \naffects our States and our cities across the country. Without \nleadership, this would have continued to go on.\n  These bills that we are voting on will do something. They will have \nan effect. The local administrations have to have an effect. Our \ncounties and our States have to have an effect or this will continue \non.\n  So I say I thank you to the gentlewoman and the gentleman, and I \nencourage everyone to vote on these.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Knight) for his service on the task force, his service \nfor the last 18 years in uniform, and the gentleman's continued service \nhere in the Congress. The gentleman's depth and understanding of the \nissue is critical to the passage of the legislation that we are \nbringing to the floor this week. I look forward to continuing our work \nwith the gentleman, and I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from our great State of \nNew Hampshire (Ms. Kuster), my esteemed colleague, who is the co-\nchairman of the bipartisan task force.\n  Ms. KUSTER. I thank the gentleman, Mr. Guinta, for his leadership and \nto everyone who participated tonight.\n  The idea behind a Special Order to put a face on this terrible heroin \nepidemic and addiction, generally, is to create compassion and empathy \nboth among our colleagues and for those of you who may be watching at \nhome. We need a societal change in the way we approach substance use \ndisorder. We need to understand that this is a disease. I say at home, \nfrequently, every time you hear the word ``addict,'' think of the word \n``diabetic.'' We don't say to someone: We can't treat you because you \nhave just eaten cake. Essentially, we say: That is a really hard \ndisease for you to live with, and we want to help you.\n  That is the message that we want to convey tonight to families in New \nHampshire and all across this country. We want to be a part of the \nsolution, and that is going to include prevention, education, \ntreatment, access to treatment, expanding access to treatment, and then \nlifelong recovery.\n  We know that the brain changes under the misuse of prescription drugs \nor opiates or heroin, and we need to have the patience to help people \nget through not just the treatment itself, but the recovery period. We \nneed homes where people can live in a substance-free environment, and \nwe need supports and mental health supports. We have learned that four \nout of five heroin users have a co-occurring mental health issue \ntypically untreated and typically not getting any kind of help with \nthat. So in a sense, what you have are people that are self-medicating.\n\n  We also know that four out of five heroin users are coming to this \nthrough prescription medication, so we need to reach out and work with \nour healthcare providers. I am very proud that both the American \nMedical Association and the American Hospital Association are \nsupporting many of the bills that we have coming forward on the floor \nthis week.\n  So this is the beginning. Our work is not done, but the message \ntonight is that Congress is coming together in a bipartisan way to \ntackle this head-on, to help these families, to help people get \ntreatment, and to put an end to this terrible, terrible disease.\n  I thank the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. I want to thank the gentlewoman, my colleague from our \nState of New Hampshire, where, unfortunately, last year, 430 people \nperished due to opioid abuse and addiction. That is 1 out of every \n3,000 of our residents. It is a significant challenge in our State, in \nthe Northeast, and New England, but all across the country. Almost \n50,000 people, last year, died of this epidemic.\n\n[[Page H2209]]\n\n  It is not just an epidemic, but an emergency, one that I believe this \nCongress is firmly standing strong in a bipartisan way to find \nsolutions, to do our part at the Federal level to make sure that we \nhave every opportunity not just to help those who seek treatment and \nrecovery, but also to strengthen law enforcement, to focus on those \nindividuals who are selling these drugs across the country, from \nCalifornia to New Hampshire, but also being proactive in prevention and \nin education.\n  We often speak of our friends and constituents in New Hampshire that \ncontinue to suffer, but we also talk about our children. I have a 12-\nyear-old and an 11-year-old that I hope will live lives without and \nfree from drugs. I want to make sure that every seventh- and eighth-\ngrader in the State of New Hampshire understands the severity of the \nproblem and understands that this is something that is deadly that we \ncannot even take once.\n  As you mentioned, the challenge of fentanyl, lacing a pill of heroin \nwith as many as three small pieces of fentanyl the size of grains of \nsand can kill a person. Most people don't realize that. This is a \ndeadly, deadly epidemic.\n\n                              {time}  2100\n\n  This week the House of Representatives takes up a whole host of \nbills. After the Senate passed their CARA Act 94-1, we have had four \ncommittees of jurisdiction work and try to improve that piece of \nlegislation.\n  I look forward to sharing a very strong bipartisan vote this week on \na whole host of bills, going to conference with the Senate, and getting \nthis bill to the President's desk. It is a mark of bipartisanship and \nit is a mark of leadership, something that the country needs to see \nfrom this institution and from this city.\n  I want to thank all of my colleagues who participated in this Special \nOrder tonight to kick off Heroin and Opioid Awareness Week. We have \nheard stories of success and difficulty come in equal measure from \nevery corner of the country.\n  I commend the House for passing a comprehensive bipartisan bill for \nthe relief of the vulnerable, the victimized, and distressed in my \ndistrict, in your district, and throughout the Nation. Any measure we \ntake to lighten even slightly the burden of suffering patients and \nfamilies can make the difference between fatal despair and renewal.\n  The House is scheduled to take up several similar measures this week. \nIt is my hope that, when combined, our efforts will begin to form a \nsolution to this harrowing and tragic national crisis. We will continue \nto work for safe communities and effective evidence-based treatments.\n  But I want to end this evening on a favorable note. I want to share \nthe story of my friend, Abi Lizotte, who the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire, Congresswoman Kuster, knows all too well.\n  Abi Lizotte last year had been addicted to heroin for an extended \nperiod of time and had nowhere left to turn. Her family wouldn't help \nher. Her friends wouldn't help her. Even the people she bought drugs \nfrom wouldn't help her.\n  She was 8 months pregnant. She finally called a nurse, a nurse that \nhad helped her earlier in the year, and asked for assistance. She went \nto the hospital and thankfully was able to see a physician. That \nphysician told her that she was days away from dying while she was \ncarrying her child.\n  Thankfully, through the grace of God and the help of people in New \nHampshire, she was able to start the process of recovery. Today my \nfriend Abi--and I am proud to call her my friend--has testified in \nfront of our committee hearings in New Hampshire, has testified about \nthe experience that she had and the loneliness and despair that she \nexperienced. She is now 6 months clean with an 8-month-old son named \nParker. It is a story of success.\n  She continues each and every day to strive for that success for \nothers. She actually goes to schools in New Hampshire and speaks to \nkids about her experience in the hope that other people will not fall \nto the same experience she had over the last several years.\n  I count her as a friend, but I focus our work in her name, just as \nyou focus your work in the name of Kriss Soterian's stepdaughter, \nAmber, because these are people we know. These are people that we don't \njust represent. They are people that we want to try to save.\n  I am very, very happy to see our leadership, the bipartisanship this \nweek in the legislation that will come to this floor, and I pray that \nnext year we don't see the same number of deaths, that we start to see \na decline.\n  But, regardless, this is just the beginning of this process where we \nwill continue to fight for every life, to fight for every person who is \ndealing with the disease of addiction, and will continue to work in a \nbipartisan way because people of our Nation deserve it.\n  I want to thank my colleague again, Ann Kuster from New Hampshire, my \nco-chair of the bipartisan task force, for her leadership. I thank the \nspeakers this evening. I look forward to a productive week and a \nproductive year.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2209-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2209-H2211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           ISSUES OF THE DAY\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westerman). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, we are back in session and things have \ncontinued to proceed on. I appreciate so much my colleagues calling \nattention to this national disaster, really. Opioids are being used at \nwhat seem to be unprecedented levels.\n  I know, since I have been here, there was basically a war against the \nuse of methamphetamines. So we restricted law-abiding citizens' access \nto Sudafed, one decongestant that works on me and has since it was \ndiscovered.\n  We have had more drugs pouring across our southern border, according \nto what DEA agents and local law enforcement have been telling me in \nTexas and Border Patrol down at our border, DPS at our border. Drugs \npouring in seem to have more purity and be more devastating to people \nthat get hooked on them.\n  Obviously, we have had doctors and nurses. I have sentenced many \nprofessionals, a number of them at least, for crimes committed. And \nthey are getting access to opioids, but it is a problem.\n  What concerns me, also, is that it appears this administration is \nsaying: We will help you clean up the criminal justice inadequacies as \nlong as you will pass bills that will get a lot of people, thousands \nand thousands of people, released from prison early.\n  We have seen from the figures that were provided to Senator Jeff \nSessions, pursuant to his request, that, of all the people in Federal \nprison for possession of illegal substances, 77 percent of them are not \ncitizens of the United States. That is 77 percent of those in Federal \nprison for possession are not U.S. citizens. So, obviously, this \nPresident has been giving illegal, unconstitutional amnesties out like \nthey were water at a marathon.\n  Hopefully, the Supreme Court is once and for all going to assure that \nthat stops. But it makes sense when you look at this as being an \nelection year and the Democratic Governor of Virginia makes thousands \nof felons eligible to vote.\n  All they need is to get out of prison, and then this President wants \nthousands and thousands more released from prison. The old saying is \ntrue here in Washington: No matter how cynical you get, it is never \nenough to catch up.\n  We should do criminal justice reform. I have been pushing for it for \nthe years I have been here, I guess for the last 8 years.\n  But if it is only going to get signed into law if it is combined with \nscrapping the sentences that were arrived at by judges agonizing over \nan appropriate sentence, then I hope and pray it will not happen until \nJanuary of next year, when a new President is in office, so that it \ndoes not get linked.\n  I mean, the cynicism for an administration to say, ``Yeah. We will do \nthe criminal justice reform that is necessary, but only if you will \nallow us to release thousands and thousands from prison,'' which there \nis no question that people will be murdered, people will be robbed, \npeople will be assaulted, shot, burglarized in crimes that never would \nhave happened if the President hadn't pushed the early release of so \nmany criminals.\n\n[[Page H2210]]\n\n  I hope and pray that we will be the guardians here in the House of \nthose American citizens that would be killed, robbed, burglarized, \nassaulted, if the President gets his way and releases people early. We \ncan't allow that to happen if we are going to keep our oath to the \nAmerican people.\n  We have heard so often in this room and, goodness, we have heard \nright here across the street in front of the Supreme Court people that \nclaim to be illegally in this country.\n  The only reason I am saying claim to be illegally in this country is \nwe have heard that all the people in this country are in the shadows \nand we need to bring them out of the shadows.\n  These people that were claiming to be illegally here protesting in \nfront of the Supreme Court recently were not in the shadows. They were \nin full sunlight out in front of the United States Supreme Court and, \nin fact, blocking traffic there right in front of the Supreme Court \nbuilding. Ultimately, the police just shut off the streets because so \nmany people were in the streets.\n  This story from yesterday in the Washington Examiner is entitled \n``Cashing in: Illegal Immigrants get $1,261 more welfare than American \nfamilies.''\n  The story says:\n  ``Illegal immigrant households receive an average of $5,692 in \nFederal welfare benefits every year, far more than the average `native' \nAmerican household, at $4,431, according to a new report on the cost of \nimmigration released Monday.\n  ``The Center for Immigration Studies, in an analysis of federal cost \nfigures, found that all immigrant-headed households--legal and \nillegal--receive an average of $6,241 in welfare''--\n  I will point out parenthetically here that that is an average. \nObviously, not everybody gets welfare that is here legally and \nillegally. Obviously, there are lots of households that don't get \nwelfare. But this is an average.\n  And the article says:\n  --``41 percent more than native households. As with Americans \nreceiving benefits such as food stamps and cash, much of the welfare to \nimmigrants supplements their low wage jobs.\n  ``The total cost is over $103 billion in welfare benefits to \nhouseholds headed by immigrants. A majority, 51 percent, of immigrant \nhouseholds receive some type of welfare compared to 30 percent of \nnative households, said the analysis of Census data.''\n  I would like to insert, Mr. Speaker, when Steve King and I visited in \nLondon, England, with the Social Security office equivalent there, they \npointed out that, in order to receive Social Security-type benefits in \nEngland, the law requires proof that you have been in the country for 5 \nyears before you are eligible.\n  We were told--I didn't see them, but we were told that, in applying \nto come to the country or being in the country, you had to agree not to \napply for benefits for 5 years, the idea being, if they are just an \nimmigrant magnet for people who want to come get welfare, they would go \nbroke. That was their reasoning. And, actually, it is quite good \nreasoning.\n\n                              {time}  2115\n\n  As one of the leaders there in the office made clear, she said: \n``Look, we want to make sure that people coming into England are going \nto be contributors to our society and not just takers from our \nsociety.''\n  I don't know if she has been successful. Apparently there are people \nwho come in who are just takers there; but this idea is interesting. It \nputs to the test whether someone is just coming in to get welfare \nbenefits one has never participated in, has helped pay for, or if one \nis coming in to help make America a better country.\n  Of course, some think: If I come to America and if they are paying me \nbenefits, obviously, America is a better country because my getting \nwelfare makes it a better country. But most of us would not necessarily \nagree with that. At least, I hope most would not.\n  But in seeing this figure that the total cost is over $103 billion \nfor welfare benefits to households that are headed by immigrants, \npossibly as much as anything else, it ought to indicate that our \nimmigration policies and certainly this administration need dramatic \nchanges. Perhaps it would be good to put a pause on immigration until \nwe get this worked out because we are doing great damage to our country \nand we are doing great damage to other countries.\n  Anyway, this goes on to read: ``Immigrants receiving the most, in the \nstudy of 2012 figures, come from Mexico and Central America. Their \naverage annual taxpayer-funded welfare collection is $8,251, 86 percent \nhigher than the benefits received by native households, said the \nreport.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that is pretty staggering. These are, apparently, 2012 \nfigures? Mexico and Central America? Immigrants from Mexico and Central \nAmerica are receiving, on average, $8,251 per year.\n  It is pretty clear. You don't have to be that great of a \nmathematician. I was good at math in junior high and in high school. In \ncollege, I only had to study for 15 minutes for the final to make an A \nin algebra. But you don't have to be good at math to know that no \nnation can sustain itself when it is giving people who are rushing into \nthe country over $8,000 without their ever contributing a dime to the \nongoing of the country.\n  In any event, the article reads: ``The new report follows another \nthat found President Obama seeking $17,613 for every new illegal minor, \nmore than Social Security retirees get.''\n  That is just mind-boggling. In the words of Bo Pilgrim, that is mind-\nboggling. It is $17,613 that President Obama sought to provide to every \nillegal immigrant minor--a person under 18. They have come into the \ncountry, breaking our law to get here. Yes, I have been there at all \nhours of the day and night on the border. No one comes across that \nborder unaccompanied. You can't get across the Rio Grande, in the areas \nthey were coming across, unaccompanied--4-year-old, 6-year-old, 8-year-\nold children as they stand there. I have seen them come up from the \nbank, and they are being helped. You see a woman helping this child, \nand the child is looking to her for answers, looking to her for \ninstructions, looking to her for help. Then she gets up there, and she \nasks: Oh, is this your child?\n  Oh, no. I don't know her at all. She is not accompanied. Nobody is \nwith her.\n  Yes, you are with her, and all of these other people are with her, \nbut we call it unaccompanied.\n  Then, of course, the President wants $17,613 for every new illegal \nimmigrant who is under 18, which, as the article points out, is more \nthan he would seek for Social Security retirees.\n  Again, from The Washington Examiner, it is talking about author Jason \nRichwine, who noted that illegal immigrants are barred from directly \nreceiving welfare, but, instead, they get it via their legal children.\n  `` `Illegal immigrants are barred from directly accessing most, \nthough not all, welfare programs, but they can receive welfare through \ntheir U.S.-born children. Legal immigrant households, which have \ngreater eligibility for welfare, cost $6,378, on average,' he wrote.\n  ``The average household''--again, this is just an average household--\n``headed by an immigrant, legal or illegal, costs taxpayers $6,234 in \nFederal welfare benefits.\n  ``The average immigrant household consumes 33 percent more cash \nwelfare, 57 percent more food assistance, and 44 percent more Medicaid \ndollars than the average native household.\n  ``At $8,251, households headed by immigrants from Central America and \nMexico have the highest welfare costs of any sending region.\n  ``The greater consumption of welfare dollars of immigrants can be \nexplained in large part by their lower level of education and larger \nnumber of children compared to natives. Over 24 percent of immigrant \nhouseholds are headed by a high school dropout compared to just 8 \npercent of native households. In addition, 13 percent of immigrant \nhouseholds have three or more children versus just 6 percent of native \nhouseholds.''\n  So when you do the math, as some people actually have, our Nation is \nnot long for the world unless we get on a lawful track. I have seen and \nhad signs shoved in front of my face over in front of the Supreme Court \nthat Jesus was an immigrant and that Jesus was a refugee. This thing I \nknow from everything we have been taught, from everything that is in \nthe Bible, is that Jesus was never an illegal immigrant. Jesus\n\n[[Page H2211]]\n\nmade clear you render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's. You follow \nthe law. He never broke the law nor advocated breaking the civilian \nlaw; though, those who crucified him clearly violated the law.\n  An article here from The Washington Free Beacon today, by Adam Kredo, \nreads: ``Report: Homegrown violent extremists planting roots across \nU.S.; foiled ISIS attacks, plots, and terror funding grows across \nNation.''\n  ``At least 75 homegrown violent extremists were found to be operating \nacross the United States in 2015, with the largest portion of these \nindividuals pledging allegiance to the ISIS terror group, according to \nrecent figures published by New Jersey's Office of Homeland Security \nand Preparedness.\n\n  ``The largest number of homegrown extremists were caught providing \nmaterial support to various terror organizations, while at least 21 \npercent of the terrorists were found to be planning attacks in the \nUnited States, according to the figures.\n  ``Another 10 percent successfully carried out terror attacks in \nCalifornia, New York, Tennessee, and Massachusetts, according to the \ndata, which shows that the New York City area was home to the largest \nnumber of violent extremists.''\n  That term ``violent extremists'' is so beloved by this administration \nso they don't have to use the term ``radical Islamists'' or ``Islamic \njihadists.''\n  Yet, here is an article from Craig Bannister today: \n``Administration's Censorship of State Department Video Mirrors \nDeletion of Hollande's 'Islamist' Remark.''\n  The article reads: ``The State Department's censorship of an on-\ncamera confession made by spokeswoman Jen Psaki appears identical to \nthe recent censorship by the White House of video of French President \nHollande speaking the words 'Islamist terrorism,' exposed by MRCTV.\n  ``FOX News' James Rosen reported on Monday that the State Department \nedited out an on-camera admission by Psaki in 2013 that it is Obama \nadministration's policy to lie to the American people, and that the \nIran nuclear deal was 'a good example' of a time it did.\n  ``The administration used the same censorship tactics earlier this \nyear when it edited out audio of President Hollande calling 'Islamist \nterrorism' the root of terrorism today . . .' The White House Web site \nhas censored a video of French President Francois Hollande saying that \n``Islamist terrorism'' is at the ``roots of terrorism.'' The White \nHouse briefly pulled video of a press event on terrorism with President \nObama, and when it reappeared on the whitehouse.gov Web site and \nYouTube, the audio of Hollande's translator goes silent, beginning with \nthe words ``Islamist terrorism,'' then begins again at the end of his \nsentence.'\n  ``The two censorships by the Obama administration follow the same \npattern:\n  ``A comment objectionable to the administration was edited out of the \nofficial video posted on a government Web site,\n  ``The censorship was discovered and documented because the official \ngovernment transcript had not been edited,\n  ``The missing video was, somehow, found and restored to the version \non the government Web site--after the censorship had been exposed, and\n  ``The administration pleaded ignorance of the editing once it had \nbeen made public.\n  ``Rosen's revelation begs a question posed to MRCTV multiple times \nsince it broke the Hollande story:\n  ``Is this an isolated incident, or are there other times the \nadministration has edited out comments it doesn't want the American \npeople to hear?''\n  Consistent with actions like preventing people from hearing the \nFrench President point out the truth that Islamic terrorism is at the \nroot of all terrorism--most terrorism it certainly is--here is a front \npage magazine story: ``Obama Frees USS Cole Bombing Terrorist. American \nlives don't matter,'' from Daniel Greenfield.\n  ``On Thursday morning, sailors on board the USS Cole were lining up \nfor an early lunch. Seventeen of them died as an al Qaeda bomb on board \na fishing boat tore through the hull outside the gallery. The dead \nincluded 15 men and two women, one of whom had a young child. For 3 \nweeks, the crew of the USS Cole struggled to keep their ship from \nsinking while working waste deep in water with bucket brigades, \nsleeping on the deck, and living surrounded by the terrible aftermath \nof the terrorist attack.\n  ``The survivors, wounded and whole, received the words `Glory is the \nReward of Valor,' written on the bent steel removed from the site of \nthe explosion that tore through their ship and their lives.\n\n                              {time}  2130\n\n  ``The President of the United States promised that justice would be \ndone:\n  ``'To those who attacked them, we say: You will not find a safe \nharbor. We will find you and justice will prevail.'''\n  As the article says: ``Despite Clinton's words, justice did not \nprevail.''\n  The article goes on to point out all the injustice of what President \nObama has done in freeing this bomber involved in the USS Cole bombing. \nHe is a murderer of 17, wounder of three dozen or so in an attack on a \nUnited States military ship.\n  The United States cannot long exist when this is the way we treat \nthose who are trying to destroy us.\n  In a May 5 account in The Weekly Standard's story, ``Obama's Foreign \nPolicy Guru Boasts of How the Administration Lied to Sell the Iran \nDeal,'' it says:\n  ``It's hardly any wonder that Deputy National Security Adviser Ben \nRhodes has a 'mind meld' with his boss, the President. According to a \nDavid Samuels New York Times Magazine article to be published Sunday \nand already posted to the Web site, Rhodes, like Barack Obama, is \ncontemptuous of 'the American foreign-policy establishment.' What Obama \ncalls the 'Washington playbook' dictating the sorts of responses \navailable to American policymakers, Rhodes calls the 'Blob.'''\n  This article points out what is in the news right now, that the Obama \nadministration--and I am being careful--that the Obama administration \nwas responsible for a lie perpetrated against the American people. They \nclaim they were dealing with moderates in Iran. They knew they were \ndealing with radicals, and Ben Rhodes is lying. He brags about all the \nlying they did to keep the Senate from standing up and having the \ncourage to say this is a treaty. It is being done with radical \nIslamists in Iran. It hurts all our friends, helps our enemies. We will \nnot allow that to happen. We are taking a vote on the Iran treaty as a \ntreaty.\n  And then when they did, if the Democrats tried to block it, then \nthis, more than anything else they have ever taken up, would be \nsomething they should say, as Harry Reid did, we may not have 60, but \nthis is critical. We vote on the Iran treaty and vote it down.\n  So 51 votes sets aside cloture, and they drive forward. It doesn't \nget the two-thirds vote, and we stop the radicals in Iran from getting \nthe hundreds of billions that will flow not just in 1 year, but over a \nperiod of time.\n  I met with Baloch people, Baloch leaders today. The southern part of \nIran, southern southwest part of Pakistan, those are indigenous Baloch \nareas. The most productive oilfields of Iran are Baloch areas.\n  They have been so unfairly terrorized and mistreated. They know what \nterrorists the leaders of Iran are.\n  We have friends in those areas of Iran and Pakistan, and this \nadministration chose to lie to the American people to get the Senate to \ndo nothing to stop them. And people around the world will die as a \nresult of the lies that Ben Rhodes has now admitted to.\n  God help us all.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2211-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2211]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hastings (at the request of Ms. Pelosi) for today through May 13.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "10"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/10/house-section/article/H2211-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2211-H2212]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          SENATE BILL REFERRED\n\n  A bill of the Senate of the following title was taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 546.
