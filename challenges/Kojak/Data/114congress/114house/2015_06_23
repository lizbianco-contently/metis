The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. McGovern) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, last Congress, we passed a new farm bill. \nAs a member of the Agriculture Committee, I could not support it, \neither in committee or on the House floor. I couldn't support it \nbecause it cut SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, our \nNation's premier antihunger program. I couldn't support a bill that I \nbelieved made hunger worse in America.\n  At the time, members of both parties offered many assurances that the \nchanges to SNAP's relationship with LIHEAP, the Low Income Home Energy \nAssistance Program, wouldn't hurt SNAP recipients, that the changes \nwere merely ``closing a loophole'' rather than a true benefit cut.\n  I was skeptical of those assurances at the time--and with good \nreason. The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the change would \nreduce benefits for about 850,000 low-income households by an average \nof $90 a month in the 14 States and the District of Columbia that took \nadvantage of a State option to link LIHEAP and SNAP. States chose to \nuse this option to alleviate some of the heartbreaking choices that \npoor families face. Seniors and the disabled are all too often the ones \nforced to choose between buying food or heating their homes or paying \nfor their prescriptions.\n  Throughout the farm bill process, antihunger advocates in the ``heat \nand eat'' States vigorously opposed the LIHEAP cuts to SNAP, saying \ntheir effects would be much greater than the Congressional Budget \nOffice estimates. I'm sorry to say they were right. These cuts are much \nmore than just abstract numbers. We are starting to hear real stories \nfrom real people who are seeing their SNAP benefits cut. Hunger is \nworse in this country because of these cuts.\n  Take Judy Beals, a disabled senior from Belleville, Wisconsin. \nEarlier this year, she saw her SNAP benefit cut from $120 a month to \n$16 a month. Let me repeat that, she now gets $16 a month in food \nassistance. That is it. That is unconscionable. How could anyone afford \nto feed themselves for a month on that?\n  Ms. Beals says she is forced to eat just once a day now that her SNAP \nbenefit has been cut as she tries to figure out how to pay her other \nbills. To add insult to injury, Ms. Beals found out that her SNAP \nbenefit had been cut at the register at the grocery store with a full \ncart of groceries.\n  Mr. Speaker, Ms. Beals' story is not unique. The Hunger Task Force in \nMilwaukee estimates that, in Wisconsin alone, 255,000 families have \nseen their SNAP benefits reduced since the LIHEAP cuts went into \neffect.\n  We are hearing similar stories in New Jersey, another State that did \nnot extend its heat and eat program. The Food Bank of South New Jersey \nestimates that 160,000 New Jersey residents have lost about $90 a month \nin SNAP benefits due to the farm bill cut.\n  Now, to be fair, there are several States, including my home State of \nMassachusetts, that did the right thing and found a way, mostly with \nState funds, to make up the money lost by the LIHEAP cut in the farm \nbill. Republican and Democratic Governors stepped up and recognized \nthat those already struggling to put food on the table would be worse \noff if they didn't find a way to fix the cut. In those States that did \nnot make up the money, we will continue to hear stories of people who \nhave seen their SNAP benefit cut.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to serve on the House Agriculture Committee. \nSince the beginning of this Congress, the committee has been conducting \na top-to-bottom review of the SNAP program. Now, I have no idea where \nthese hearings are going and, once again, we have heard assurances that \nthere will be no cuts in SNAP, but I have this sinking feeling in my \nstomach that these hearings are not leading to a place that is good for \nmillions of struggling Americans.\n  The fact is SNAP is a good program. It works. It is effective, and it \nis efficient. It is one of the most efficiently run Federal programs \nthat exists, with an unbelievably low error rate.\n  Instead of cutting SNAP or making other harmful policy changes, we\n\n[[Page H4548]]\n\nshould be strengthening the program. Democratic and Republican \nwitnesses alike have testified before the Agriculture Committee that \nthe SNAP benefit is already too low.\n  We have heard that the certification and recertification process is \ntime-consuming and onerous, especially for working families. We have \nheard about people who are eligible to get renewed benefits who fall \noff the program because of these onerous, new requirements.\n  We have heard from charities that they cannot solve the problems of \nhunger on their own. Charities do incredible work, but they cannot meet \nthe demand for food assistance. They need a strong Federal partner.\n  We need better coordination among all stakeholders--Federal agencies, \nnonprofits, faith-based organizations, and businesses--to end hunger. \nThat is why I have been advocating for a White House conference on \nfood, nutrition, and hunger. We need a coordinated, holistic plan to \nend hunger now.\n  If we make further cuts to SNAP, we will no doubt hear more stories \nlike Ms. Beals where those who are already struggling to put food on \nthe table see their food assistance benefits cut.\n  The bottom line, Mr. Speaker, is that we should not be making hunger \nworse in this country. We should end hunger now.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4548-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CONGRATULATIONS TO JUAN FELIPE HERRERA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Takano) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to congratulate and pay tribute \nto Juan Felipe Herrera, who was recently appointed to serve as the \nUnited States Poet Laureate.\n  The son of migrant farmworkers, Mr. Herrera is the first Latino \nAmerican to be appointed to this position and has published more than a \ndozen short stories, novels, and collections of poetry.\n  In 2008, he was awarded the National Book Critics Circle Award, and \nin 2012 he was appointed California's Poet Laureate.\n  Never one to shy away from experimentation, Mr. Herrera conducted a \n2-year poetry project, entitled, ``The Most Incredible and Biggest Poem \non Unity in the World,'' where California residents of all ages submit \ntheir writings on unity. The project resulted in a 170-page collection \nof poems on unity and how we as Americans can come together.\n  A recent retiree from the University of California, Riverside, Mr. \nHerrera taught creative writing and worked with young people in the \nInland Empire by creating an antibullying poetry project that allows \nkids affected by bullying to channel their feelings through poetry. \nPoetry, after all, is an incredibly powerful medium.\n  In his work, ``Let Me Tell You What a Poem Brings,'' Herrera spoke of \npoetry's impact, saying:\n\n     Before you go further,\n     let me tell you what a poem brings,\n     first, you must know the secret, there is no poem\n     to speak of, it is a way to attain a life without boundaries,\n     yes, it is that easy, a poem, imagine me telling you this,\n     instead of going day by day against the razors, well,\n     the judgments, all the tick-tock bronze, a leather jacket\n     sizing you up, the fashion mall, for example, from\n     the outside you think you are being entertained,\n     when you enter, things change, you get caught by surprise,\n     your mouth goes sour, you get thirsty, your legs grow cold\n     standing still in the middle of a storm, a poem, of course,\n     is always open for business too, except, as you can see,\n     it isn't exactly business that pulls your spirit into\n     the alarming waters, there you can bathe, you can play,\n     you can even join in on the gossip--the mist, that is,\n     the mist becomes central to your existence.\n\n  As a former student of Juan Felipe Herrera's, I offer my \ncongratulations and know that he will continue to inspire and move us \nwith his words as our next Poet Laureate.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4548-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4548]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today on a bill that Representatives \nMcSally, Cardenas, Joe Heck, and I have introduced, the Humane \nCosmetics Act.\n  The Humane Cosmetics Act would phase out the use of animal-based \ntesting for cosmetic products. It will eventually prohibit the sale of \ncosmetics tested on animals in foreign countries, making sure that only \nsafe products tested with cutting-edge technology enter the American \nmarket.\n  It is time for us to end the painful and completely unnecessary \nprocess of testing American cosmetics on animals. Safer, more cost-\neffective, and\n\n[[Page H4549]]\n\ncompletely humane alternatives already exist; and the United States is \nin no danger of losing its competitive role as a leader in the global \ncosmetics industry. Now, we need to ensure our place as a moral leader.\n  Over the last 20 years, cosmetics companies have reduced their use of \nanimals for cosmetics testing in favor of more reliable, cost-\neffective, and technologically advanced methods that can more \naccurately predict whether cosmetics are safe for humans.\n  Let's not stay in the past. Let's keep up with our peers. The Humane \nCosmetics Act would match U.S. law to the European Union, Israel, and \nIndia and ensure that the American cosmetics industry can remain \ncompetitive in a changing global market.\n  I urge my colleagues to cosponsor this bill.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4549-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REPEAL THE INDEPENDENT PAYMENT ADVISORY BOARD\n\n  (Mrs. BLACK asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. BLACK.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to talk about a very good friend \nof Hawaii and a very good friend of mine, Consul General Toyoei \nShigeeda.\n  Consul General Shigeeda has been a tireless advocate for Japan and \nhas been the glue that has held together a solid bond between Hawaii \nand Japan.\n  I have known Consul General Shigeeda and his wife, Michiko, since \nthey arrived in October of 2012. I have enjoyed many occasions with the \nconsul general and Michiko at the numerous bon dances throughout Oahu.\n  I recall inviting Consul General Shigeeda to the Aiea Hongwanji bon \ndance 2 years ago. We had a great time. More importantly, Consul \nGeneral Shigeeda and I enjoyed spending many Friday and Saturday nights \nlast year going to bon dances. He and Michiko are really great bon \ndancers.\n  I also wanted to commend the consul general on his efforts to bridge \nthe Pacific Ocean and bring together the leaders of Japan's Diet with \nthe members of the Hawaii State Legislature. This Japan-Hawaii \nFriendship Association will continue for many years and will continue \nto foster the great relationship between Hawaii and Japan.\n  I also wanted to thank Michiko. She has developed strong bonds with \nmany Japanese organizations and has always been a great advocate for \nJapan.\n  I wish them well, Mr. Speaker, for their service in Hawaii, and I \nwish them the very best in their future endeavors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4549-7", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4549]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

REQUIREMENTS FOR IANA STEWARDSHIP TRANSITION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Until the date that is 30 legislative days \n     after the submission to Congress of the report described in \n     subsection (b), the Assistant Secretary may not permit the \n     NTIA's role in the performance of the Internet Assigned \n     Numbers Authority functions to terminate, lapse, be \n     cancelled, or otherwise cease to be in effect.\n       (b) Report Described.--The report described in this \n     subsection is a report that contains--\n       (1) the proposal relating to the transition of the NTIA's \n     stewardship of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority \n     functions that was developed in a process convened by ICANN \n     at the request of the NTIA; and\n       (2) a certification by the Assistant Secretary that--\n       (A) such proposal--\n       (i) supports and enhances the multistakeholder model of \n     Internet governance;\n       (ii) maintains the security, stability, and resiliency of \n     the Internet domain name system;\n       (iii) meets the needs and expectations of the global \n     customers and partners of the Internet Assigned Numbers \n     Authority services;\n       (iv) maintains the openness of the Internet; and\n       (v) does not replace the role of the NTIA with a \n     government-led or intergovernmental organization solution; \n     and\n       (B) the required changes to ICANN's bylaws contained in the \n     final report of ICANN's Cross Community Working Group on \n     Enhancing ICANN Accountability and the changes to ICANN's \n     bylaws required by ICANN's IANA Stewardship Transition \n     Coordination Group have been adopted.\n       (c) Definitions.--In this section:\n       (1) Assistant secretary.--The term ``Assistant Secretary'' \n     means the Assistant Secretary of Commerce for Communications \n     and Information.\n       (2) ICANN.--The term ``ICANN'' means the Internet \n     Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers.\n       (3) Legislative day.--The term ``legislative day'' does not \n     include Saturdays, Sundays, legal public holidays, or days \n     either House of Congress is adjourned for more than 3 days \n     during a session of Congress.\n       (4) NTIA.--The term ``NTIA'' means the National \n     Telecommunications and Information Administration.\n       Amend the title so as to read: ``A bill to provide for \n     certain requirements relating to the Internet Assigned \n     Numbers Authority stewardship transition.''.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Shimkus) and the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pallone) \neach will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks \nand insert extraneous material in the Record on the bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Illinois?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are here to consider H.R. 805, the DOTCOM Act. \nI first introduced this legislation last Congress, and I am proud to \nsee it brought to the floor today. The DOTCOM Act is a great example of \nwhat can get done when we work together and build on the Energy and \nCommerce Committee's growing record of legislative success.\n  Mr. Speaker, as many of my colleagues know, from the time the \nadministration announced their intent to transition the IANA functions, \nI have had serious concerns about the potential risk associated with \nthe move. I have said time and again that this is far too important to \nrush and that we must carefully consider all the potential consequences \nand outcomes before any transition occurs.\n  Mr. Speaker, my bill would require a period of 30 legislative days \nfor us to review any proposal that NTIA receives from the \nmultistakeholder community and ICANN. This allows us to hear from our \nconstituents and consult with outside experts before we decide if \nICANN's proposal is satisfactory. If, in this review period allowed \nonly through passage of the DOTCOM Act, we find that ICANN and/or its \nproposal does not adequately protect the free and open Internet, \nCongress can then take action to either completely stop the transfer or \nrequire more safeguards to be put in place.\n  Additionally, and perhaps most importantly, the DOTCOM Act requires \nNTIA to renew their contract to continue these important stewardship \nfunctions with ICANN before it expires in September. Everyone agrees \nthat the contract should remain with NTIA while this process moves \nforward. DOTCOM is the vehicle to make sure this does in fact happen. \nExtending the contract takes the pressure off of making a rushed \ntransition and perhaps making mistakes. We get one bite at the apple on \nthis, and we need to make sure it is done correctly.\n  Mr. Speaker, before I relinquish my time, I want to say that I am \nvery proud of the work that has been done on this bill in the Energy \nand Commerce Committee, particularly by Chairmen Upton and Walden and \nRanking Members Pallone and Eshoo. We wouldn't be here today without \ntheir hard work and also the work of staff, particularly Greta Joynes \nof my office and committee staff David Redl, Kelsey Guyselman, Margaret \nMcCarthy, David Goldman, and Tiffany Guarascio.\n  Mr. Speaker, clearly, this is an issue that has brought both sides \ntogether for the best interests of all Americans. I ask my colleagues \nto support the passage of H.R. 805, and I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 805, the Domain Openness \nThrough Continued Oversight Matters, or DOTCOM, Act. I am pleased to \nsupport this bill, and I want to commend my colleagues for the \nbipartisan process in the Energy and Commerce Committee that brought us \nhere.\n  The Internet is a great American success story that has benefited \nbillions of users around the globe. Over the last two decades, the \nUnited States Government has taken steps to get out of the way and \nempower a bottom-up approach to Internet governance. Thanks to the \nsuccess of this multistakeholder model, the Internet has opened up new \nmarkets and economic opportunities and become an unprecedented platform \nfor democratic free expression.\n  Mr. Speaker, under both Republican and Democratic administrations, \nthe U.S. Government has supported the idea that the Internet should be \ngoverned through a decentralized process, free from governmental \ncontrol. Since the late 1990s, the U.S. Government has moved towards \nprivate sector management of the domain name system. To put it another \nway, we think that the future of the Internet should be determined by \nbusinesses, civil society, and technical experts.\n  Congress has also explicitly embraced this vision. As recently as \n2013, the House voted unanimously in support of a bill making it \nofficial U.S. policy to ``preserve and advance the successful \nmultistakeholder model that governs the Internet.''\n  Mr. Speaker, completing the transition of the Internet Assigned \nNumbers Authority advances that policy goal. The IANA transition \nreaffirms our two-decade commitment to the global multistakeholder \ncommunity, but we have a responsibility to make sure that the \ntransition is done right.\n  The DOTCOM Act continues the longstanding congressional support for \nthe global, open Internet while appropriately conducting oversight of \nthe National Telecommunications and Information Administration. We \nrequire NTIA to live up to the commitments the agency has made for the \nIANA transition and ensure that transparency and accountability \nmechanisms are in place before the U.S. Government can relinquish its \nstewardship role. In short, I believe our bill provides the necessary \nsafeguards for the IANA transition to occur without unnecessary delay.\n  Our vote on the DOTCOM Act today is timely for several reasons. Key\n\n[[Page H4551]]\n\nmeetings are taking place, as we speak, in Buenos Aires, Argentina, to \nfinalize planning for the IANA transition. And quick action on the \nDOTCOM Act is needed to provide a better alternative to the language in \nthe House Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill that blocks \nNTIA's ability to implement the transition. Unlike the appropriations \nrider, the DOTCOM Act provides a real opportunity for congressional \noversight, so I urge all my colleagues to support it.\n  Finally, Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Chairmen Upton and Walden, \nRepresentative Shimkus, and their respective staffs, David Redl and \nGreta Joynes, for working with Congresswoman Eshoo and other Democrats \non this bill. The DOTCOM Act shows what we can accomplish when our work \nis bipartisan from the start. I would also like to thank David Goldman \nand Margaret McCarthy of my staff for their hard work on this \nlegislation. I look forward to working with you all and our colleagues \nin the Senate to see this bill become law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have no other speakers. I urge passage of the DOTCOM \nAct.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 805, the DOTCOM \nAct.\n  Over the past two decades, U.S. policy through Republican and \nDemocratic administrations has supported the transition of the Internet \nAssigned Numbers Authority (IANA) to the private sector. The DOTCOM Act \nwhich passed the Energy and Commerce Committee by voice vote last week \ncarries on this bipartisan tradition by ensuring that the IANA \ntransition supports and enhances the multi-stakeholder model of \nInternet governance; maintains the security, stability, and resiliency \nof the Internet domain name system; and does not replace the role of \nthe NTIA with a government-led or intergovernmental organization \nsolution.\n  Importantly, the DOTCOM Act as amended by the Committee, represents a \nsensible alternative to the funding restriction included in the House-\npassed Commerce, Justice and Science (CJS) Appropriations bill. I look \nforward to working with my colleagues to see that the DOTCOM Act \nbecomes the law of the land--rather than enacting a counterproductive \nlimitation of funds which sends the wrong message to the international \ncommunity.\n  I thank Chairman Walden, Ranking Member Pallone and Congressman \nShimkus for their bipartisan cooperation on this bill and I urge my \ncolleagues to support the DOTCOM Act, which is a vote for the multi-\nstakeholder model of Internet governance and a global, open Internet, \nfree from governmental control.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, right now as we speak, the international \ncommunity is meeting in Argentina to discuss the state of the Internet \naround the globe. We have an opportunity today to send a loud and clear \nmessage to those gathered in Buenos Aires: that the United States will \nnot stand for anything other than strong safeguards to protect our \nonline future.\n  By advancing the DOTCOM Act, we can ensure that the Internet--the \nworld's greatest platform of ideas, commerce, and social connection--\ncontinues to thrive to the benefit of folks in Michigan and every \ncorner of the country.\n  As we move toward transitioning the United States' oversight role of \nthe Domain Name System to the international community of stakeholders, \nit is essential we tread carefully and thoughtfully. The bill we are \nconsidering today is a bipartisan effort to ensure appropriate \ncongressional oversight of this incredibly important transition, and \nensure that the administration and NTIA get it right as there are no \ndo-overs.\n  Over the course of the past year, the Energy and Commerce Committee \nhas engaged in efforts to ensure that any transition proposal \nconsidered by the administration contains the necessary safeguards to \nprotect the Internet. This bill incorporates the criteria initially put \nforward by NTIA, and requires the agency to certify to Congress that \nthe proposal meets these important metrics. It would also put important \naccountability measures in place for the Internet community.\n  This legislation, which the Energy and Commerce Committee approved by \nvoice vote, is the result of many informative hearings, feedback from a \nvariety of stakeholders--both domestically and internationally--and \nproductive and ongoing conversations between members on both sides of \nthe aisle. Once again, our committee's efforts demonstrate that \nCongress can work together to achieve meaningful results and build a \nbipartisan record of success. I want to recognize Mr. Shimkus for his \nleadership on this issue from the beginning, as well as Chairman Walden \nand Ranking Member Pallone for their hard work on this commonsense \nsolution to protect the Internet on which we have come to depend.\n  The world is watching. A vote for the DOTCOM Act is a vote for \neffective Congressional oversight. I urge all members to support this \nimportant legislation.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 805, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4551-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4551-H4560]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     TSCA MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, the TSCA Modernization Act has been a long time in \ncoming. We actually started work on this bill in the last Congress. We \nheld a total of eight hearings and received testimony from a broad \nrange of stakeholders, including the administration; but most \nimportantly, we worked with each other, Member to Member, across the \naisle.\n  The bill before you, Mr. Speaker, reflects lessons learned over the \ncourse of the last 3 years in which we worked on TSCA reform. First, \nthe bill is clear and understandable. Despite the highly technical \nnature of chemical regulation, Members can pick up this bill, read it \nfrom beginning to end, and understand what it does and how it works.\n  Second, the bill does not try to be all things for all people. Major \nsections of TSCA are not amended at all. For example, we leave the \nprocess for new chemical review in TSCA section 5 unchanged because it \nis working pretty well right now, and changes could make it worse.\n  The heart of the bill is our approach to regulating chemicals already \non the market. Thousands of these chemicals have been in commerce for \nmany years, and they pose no known risks and really don't need to be \nregulated at all. We leave those alone. But we do allow some existing \nchemicals to be scientifically evaluated for risk and, if necessary, to \nhave that risk managed through a rule by the EPA.\n  Chemicals may be chosen for risk evaluation in one of two ways: \neither EPA may select a chemical for risk evaluation based on what EPA \nknows may pose an unreasonable risk, or the manufacturer may designate \na chemical for EPA to evaluate for risk.\n  Now, why would a manufacturer invite EPA scrutiny of its product? \nThere are several reasons. First, some interest or even a retailer may \nbe raising concerns about a product, and the manufacturer wants to put \nthose concerns to rest. Or one or two States may be thinking about \nregulating the chemical. The State-by-State approach can spell disaster \nfor someone trying to capture economies of scale in a national market.\n  What better way to put these concerns to rest than to have EPA, with \nthe scientific standards that we require, perform an objective risk \nevaluation? Then the EPA decision on that chemical will apply in all \nthe States, and consumers and the public can have the confidence that \nthe chemical is safe for its intended uses.\n  Another area in the legislation that required careful discussion and \nnegotiation is preemption. Of course, we want to make sure national \nmarkets are just that and not a patchwork of restrictions varying State \nto State. At the same time, we did not want to deny anyone a legitimate \ncause of action under State tort or contract law. So that is what we \nsaid: as long as the State law does not conflict with the Federal \nruling, the State action may continue.\n  Mr. Speaker, the bill has strict but attainable deadlines for action. \nIf EPA initiates a risk evaluation, it must finish in 3 years. If a \nmanufacturer initiates one and includes information EPA needs to make a \ndecision, EPA should finish that in 2 years. Once the risk evaluation \nis complete, if EPA decides a rule is needed to manage the risk, EPA \nmust propose the rule within a year.\n  The risk evaluation itself only asks does the chemical present an \nunreasonable risk of injury to health or the environment. That is a \nscience question based on a combination of hazard and actual exposure. \nIf there is an unreasonable risk, the agency's decision on how to \nmanage it is based on many other factors such as cost effectiveness, \nwhether restricting an article will actually reduce exposure, whether \nreplacements are available, and many other concerns.\n  H.R. 2576 permits EPA to regulate articles in those areas where \nregulation of chemical substances and mixtures alone would not be \neffective to reduce the identified risk, but requires EPA to be careful \nin addressing replacement parts that serve a commercially intended \nfunction or the original product or are needed to maintain the \nfunctionality of the original product.\n  We think this system sets a new standard for quality regulation. Of \ncourse, we want to be protected from harm, but we do not want needless, \nexpensive regulations. Consumers want safe choices, not no choice at \nall.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are on the brink of setting up a commonsense approach \nto protecting people from unsafe chemical exposure that will become the \nstandard of the world.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  We want our constituents to be safe, and we want markets to work. \nThis bill delivers both.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Nearly four decades ago, Congress enacted the Toxic Substances \nControl Act to identify and regulate risks from dangerous chemicals. \nUnfortunately, the statute has never worked. Improvements to the law \nare long overdue, and I am happy to be here today with my Energy and \nCommerce colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support this landmark \nreform legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, what brought us together is the failure of the current \nstatute to keep the American public safe and to provide confidence in \nthe safety of American products. Toxic chemicals can be found in the \nproducts we use every day and are steadily building up in our bodies \nand the environment.\n  Consumers are worried about chemicals like BPA and triclosan, but \nthey don't know how to avoid them. It seems like every day there is a \nnew study about how chemicals are negatively affecting our health, and \nsomething needs to change.\n  The Energy and Commerce Committee has held many hearings over the \nlast 6 years to understand why TSCA isn't working. Some critical flaws \nwere built into the statute, like the grandfathering of over 60,000 \nchemicals in 1976 without any safety review. Other flaws came to light \nonly through litigation, like the impossible analytical burden of the \nstatute's ``least burdensome'' clause.\n  Even though we have recognized these flaws, forward progress has been \nelusive. When Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton approached Ranking \nMember Tonko and myself about working on a streamlined approach to \naddress the essential components of reform, I was hopeful.\n  The result is a bipartisan bill that will remove major obstacles to \nEPA action and give the Agency new authority and new resources. It will \noffer more protection and more implementation than current law. It is a \nstrong compromise, and I urge all of my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will empower EPA to regulate the universe of \nchemicals that were grandfathered in 1976 by removing the requirement \nthat EPA impose the ``least burdensome'' regulatory option and by \nestablishing a\n\n[[Page H4557]]\n\nrisk-based standard for risk management, instead of a cost-benefit \nstandard. For the first time, the decision of whether a chemical needs \nto be regulated will be based purely on the risk it poses.\n  H.R. 2576 will improve EPA's access to information about potentially \ndangerous chemicals by allowing EPA to require testing through orders \nand consent agreements, not just rulemakings, and by authorizing EPA to \nseek data when needed for a risk evaluation without first demonstrating \nrisk.\n  H.R. 2576 will provide expedited action for the worst chemicals, \nthose that are persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic. Under this bill, \nwe can expect quick action to get these chemicals out of our \nenvironment and out of our bodies.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 2576 will explicitly and directly protect \nvulnerable populations like children, workers, the elderly, and hotspot \ncommunities.\n  The bill will provide more resources for EPA to carry out this \nimportant program by removing outdated caps on user fees. It would also \nensure that those fees are deposited in a dedicated trust fund for TSCA \nimplementation.\n  Under the bill, all future confidential business information claims \nby industry would have to be substantiated, preventing abuse and \nensuring greater transparency.\n  H.R. 2576 would ensure that States maintain their important role as \npartners in chemical regulation. Under the bill, preemption of State \nlaws would be more limited than current law and other proposals. No \nState law would be preempted until Federal requirements are in effect.\n  Many State laws would be protected from preemption, including \nexisting State laws, new State laws adopted to address air and water \nquality or implement other Federal laws, State tort claims, and State \nlaws regulating uses not evaluated by EPA.\n  In response to concerns raised by stakeholders and Members, a few \nadditional important clarifications have been made following committee \nmarkup, and I thank the chairman for working with us to make those \nchanges.\n  There is now clear authority for EPA to set a schedule if \nmanufacturer-requested risk evaluations exceed EPA's capacity, ensuring \nthat such requests won't overwhelm the program. The grandfathering \nprovision for existing State laws has also been clarified based on \nfeedback from State attorneys general.\n  Mr. Speaker, strong committee report language further clarifies the \nlimited role of costs in risks management, the preservation of State \nmonitoring and reporting requirements, and the expansion of EPA's \ntesting authority.\n  I know that tomorrow, we will get back to disagreeing on the \nimportance of environmental protection and the essential role EPA plays \nin keeping America safe, but for today, we can all agree on the need \nfor a strong and protective Federal regulatory program for chemicals.\n  I want to thank Chairman Shimkus and Chairman Upton for their \nleadership and their willingness to work with Democrats and \nstakeholders to craft this legislation. I would also like to thank \nJackie Cohen of my staff for her hard work on this legislation, as well \nas Dave McCarthy of the majority staff for his efforts. This is a true \ntestament to what we can achieve when we work together.\n  I look forward to supporting this bill, and I hope all my colleagues \nwill join me in supporting this landmark legislation.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Bucshon), my colleague.\n  Mr. BUCSHON. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 2576, the \nTSCA Modernization Act of 2015, which updates the Toxic Substances \nControl Act, TSCA, of 1976. This legislation will benefit the Eighth \nDistrict of Indiana and our Nation by improving the regulation of \nchemicals in commerce.\n  Indiana's Eighth District has a strong and diverse manufacturing \nsector, including plastics, fertilizer production, automobiles, and \nmedical devices, which play pivotal roles in the local and State \neconomy.\n  H.R. 2576 will improve the EPA's outdated regulatory process for \nthese industries and manufacturers, fostering conditions for stronger \ninterstate commerce, and ensure robust protections for public health \nand the environment.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important legislation.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Tonko), the ranking member of the subcommittee.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Jersey and our \nranking member on the Energy and Commerce Committee, Representative \nPallone, for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, 40 years ago, Congress passed the Toxic Substances \nControl Act, which created a Federal program to manage the risks \nassociated with our Nation's industrial chemicals.\n  That law, TSCA, has never met that need. As a result, the public has \nlost confidence in this Federal program. The many failings of the \ncurrent law have been pointed out in reports, reports issued by the \nGovernment Accountability Office and others.\n\n  Well-intentioned attempts over the years to address some of the \nproblems administratively or through voluntary agreements amongst the \nEnvironmental Protection Agency, the chemical industry, and the \nenvironmental and public health communities have failed. The public has \ntoo little information about the safety of chemicals that they are \nexposed to every day in virtually every product that they use.\n  Even in the face of overwhelming evidence of harm to people's health, \nEPA is unable to regulate exposure to toxic chemicals. Congress had to \nstep in and explicitly legislate to gain public health and \nenvironmental protections from PCBs, for instance, and asbestos.\n  Because of the regulatory vacuum at the Federal level, some States \nhave legislated to secure protections for their citizens. In some \ncases, large retailers have initiated their own chemical policies to \nrespond to what are consumers' concerns.\n  Forty years of ineffective Federal policy is enough. H.R. 2576, the \nTSCA Modernization Act, amends TSCA and corrects the fundamental flaws \nthat exist in our law.\n  When my colleague Chairman Shimkus began the effort to reform TSCA in \nthe last Congress, I knew the committee could produce a bill. I \nbelieved we could. I was not convinced, however, that we could pass a \nlaw; but H.R. 2576 is a decisive step, I believe, in that direction.\n  I thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking Member Pallone \nfor their continued cooperation and dedicated effort on behalf of this \nlegislation. This truly has been a productive partnership, and the \nresult is a good bill, a bill that I am pleased to support.\n  H.R. 2576 is the result of much discussion, much work, and compromise \nby all parties involved. While no one group gets all that they might \nhave hoped for in this legislation, every stakeholder group gets \nsomething that they need. Frankly, we all need a functional, fair, and \nreliable Federal program of chemical regulation.\n  Industry gains a fair, predictable Federal program for chemical \nregulation, a program that will inspire public confidence in the safety \nof their products. In the context of our global economy, that is an \nimportant asset for doing business both here and in other countries.\n  The public health and environmental communities gain a Federal \nprogram in which EPA evaluates chemicals and, based on those \nevaluations, will act to regulate chemicals the Agency determines \npresent a risk to health or a risk to the environment.\n  Under current law, in order to regulate a chemical, EPA must \ndemonstrate that the benefits of regulating outweigh the costs. Under \nH.R. 2576, EPA's evaluation and decision on whether to act will be \nbased solely on risk factors, risk factors alone.\n  Considerations of cost will be addressed when the Agency selects \namong different regulatory options to reduce chemical exposures. That \nis a major gain--a major gain--for public health and a major gain for \nthe environment.\n  H.R. 2576 is a good bill. It offers significant improvements over our \ncurrent law. I know many Members have concerns about states' rights and \nState preemption provisions in TSCA. I share those concerns.\n  There is State preemption in current law, and there is State \npreemption in H.R. 2576, but State preemption only\n\n[[Page H4558]]\n\noccurs when EPA takes final--final--action on a chemical, either \nfinding it safe or regulating its risks.\n  H.R. 2576 maintains a strong role for the States. With those changes \nin TSCA, the States will have a more active and credible partner in \nthis effort at the Federal level.\n  Again, I want to thank Chairman Shimkus, Chairman Upton, and Ranking \nMember Pallone for their excellent work on this bill. I appreciate the \nconstructive partnership that we formed in working together on this \nlegislation. We worked through many difficult issues and found that \ncommon ground.\n  I look forward to continuing to work together as this bill moves on \nto the Senate.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. PALLONE. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Mr. TONKO. I thank the gentleman.\n  I urge my colleagues to end the ineffective chemical policy that we \nhave had for four decades and to support H.R. 2576.\n  I, too, would like to thank some individuals who are very pertinent \nto this discussion and final product. I thank David McCarthy from the \nsubcommittee staff on the majority side and Jerry Couri from the \nsubcommittee staff, Jackie Cohen from our subcommittee staff on the \nDemocratic side, and Chris Sarley of Chairman Shimkus' personal office \nstaff, and Jean Fruci of my personal staff, the legislative director \nfor my Congressional office.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, could I ask how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from New Jersey has 9\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Gene Green).\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, \nthe TSCA Modernization Act. I am a proud cosponsor of this bipartisan \nlegislation that will update the Toxic Substances Control Act, our \nNation's primary statute regulating the use and safety of commercial \nchemicals for the first time since it was enacted in 1976.\n  This legislation will directly address many of current TSCA's biggest \nflaws, including eliminating the ``least burdensome'' requirement and \nexplicitly clarifying the law's safety standard excludes any \nconsideration of costs.\n  This bill would require EPA to consider the risks to vulnerable \nsubpopulations, like children, pregnant women, workers, and set \nrestrictions if necessary to protect them.\n  The TSCA Modernization Act will go a long way towards ensuring that \nall American families--especially for families of chemical facility \nworkers and fence line communities in our congressional district in \nHouston and Harris County, Texas--are protected from potentially \nharmful chemicals and bring needed regulatory clarity to this important \nsector of our Nation's economy.\n  I would like to thank both Chairman Shimkus and Ranking Member Tonko \nof the Subcommittee on the Environment and the Economy and Chairman \nUpton and Ranking Member Pallone of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce and their staffs for the hard work and willingness to work \ntogether to make TSCA reform a reality.\n  I would also like to personally thank my legislative director, Sergio \nEspinosa, who has worked on this for three terms, I think, Mr. Speaker.\n  I want to ask my colleagues from both sides of the aisle to join us \nand vote in support of this important legislation.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Mrs. Capps).\n  Mrs. CAPPS. Mr. Speaker, we all know that our chemical regulatory \nsystem is badly broken and that it has been broken for a very long \ntime. When it comes to chemicals, weak statutory authority and limited \nresources have prevented the EPA from fulfilling its mission of \nprotecting public health and the environment. Current law is so weak \nthat the EPA famously could not even use it to ban the use of asbestos \ndespite overwhelming evidence that asbestos poses serious risks to \nhuman health.\n  Even when the EPA can successfully regulate a chemical under the \nToxic Substances Control Act, which we know as TSCA--which has happened \nonly five times--they must do so using a flawed cost-benefit analysis \nthat prioritizes profits over health and safety. These are just a few \nof the many serious flaws of the current system.\n  While the TSCA Modernization Act does not address all of these \nproblems, it does take several important steps forward that will help \nimprove the health and safety of consumers and their families. It \nfinally ensures that health, not cost, is the standard by which the \nsafety of chemicals is evaluated; it maintains critical State chemical \nsafety laws, such as California's landmark Proposition 65; and for the \nfirst time, it includes explicit protections for vulnerable \npopulations, such as pregnant mothers, children, and seniors.\n  I want to commend Chairmen Upton and Shimkus, Ranking Members Pallone \nand Tonko, and the committee staffs for all of their hard work and \ncommitment for making this a truly bipartisan bill. It is far from \nperfect, but it has improved at every step of the process, and I hope \nthat continues. Should the Senate pass its TSCA reform package, I hope \nthis cooperation continues in conference so we can produce an even \nstronger bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, for far too long, our chemical laws have prioritized \nprofits over human health and safety. This bill would put an end to \nthis inequity and to many other serious failings of the current system. \nThe TSCA Modernization Act is a good compromise and is a major step \nforward. That is why I will be voting for it today, and I urge my \ncolleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nColorado (Ms. DeGette).\n  Ms. DeGETTE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2576, the TSCA \nModernization Act.\n  Since the 111th Congress, a lot of us have been wrestling very \nseriously with how to reform the EPA's current regime for reviewing and \nregulating chemicals. Everyone agrees that the statute has been broken \nfor most of the decades that it has been in effect. Devising a new \nprogram, though, that would both enable the EPA to take meaningful \naction on the chemicals that truly need regulation and that will \nprotect the health of our citizens was an uphill battle in deeply \npartisan times; yet what we have come up with is a true compromise. We \nhave focused on the aspects of current law that really need to be \naddressed, and we have developed language that will move the ball \nforward.\n  As all of the other speakers have said, our work is not done after \nthe vote later today. The Senate, in working its own will, has come up \nwith a reform bill that takes a distinctly different approach. We have \na lot to reconcile. It is important that legislation makes it to the \nPresident's desk that will equip the EPA to protect us from toxic \nchemicals over the long term. Ultimately, we will be judged by how well \nthe new law works, not only over the next few years, but over the \ncoming decade.\n  I want to add my thanks, Mr. Speaker, to Congressman Frank Pallone, \nCongressman Shimkus, Congressman Tonko, Congressman Gene Green, all of \nour staffs, and, in particular, to my legislative director, Eleanor \nBastian, who has been working on this bill ever since we really started \nseriously negotiating.\n  One last thing--and I think it is important--is that Congresswoman \nCapps mentioned that this bill will not preempt State law and that it \nwill not preempt Proposition 65. This was an important provision, and I \nwant to thank Congressman Shimkus and his staff for working on it with \nus because it is important that we have these kinds of protections that \nwe need.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  In closing, I will just say thank you again to Mr. Shimkus, in \nparticular, for reaching out to me and to Mr. Tonko on this legislation \nand for making it bipartisan.\n\n[[Page H4559]]\n\n  I almost feel anticlimactic today because I know how much hard work \nhas gone into getting this bill to the floor. I know we are going to \nwork hard after it passes in the House to get it passed in the Senate \nand to have a law that goes to the President, so I urge all of my \ncolleagues to support the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  This is a good bill, and I am going to give my thanks to my \ncolleagues, too. We want a good vote today because we want to make sure \nwe have a strong House position as we go into negotiations with the \nSenate, and I think we are going to have that. I also appreciate the \nleadership for bringing this up on the suspension calendar, which, I \nthink, shows a lot of support right at the outset.\n  As everyone else has done, I want to take a moment to thank our \ncolleagues. This has been a multiyear, multi-Congress approach. As a \nformer high school teacher in government history, so far, the system is \nworking on this bill, and we are hoping for good things as we move \nforward with conference and get something to the President's desk. I \nharken back to Paul Tonko's comment and Frank Pallone's comment that we \ncould pass a bill but that, if we wanted to pass a law, we really \nneeded to open up the process a little bit. That was very helpful to \nme, and I appreciate that.\n  I also want to thank Chairman Upton, obviously, for his leadership \nand for his friendship.\n  Diana DeGette, who just spoke, and Gene Green have both been with me, \nslaving away, over the last couple of years. We have learned a lot \nabout each other, and we have learned a lot about the law, and it is a \nvery difficult law to understand. We also started getting help from Bob \nLatta, from Ohio, and from Bill Johnson, and I want to thank them for \ntheir help.\n  H.R. 2576 has also gained letters of support from a variety of \nstakeholders, which include--and sometimes this shocks people to know \nthat we have this group of diverse interests--the American Chemistry \nCouncil, the American Alliance for Innovation, the American Cleaning \nInstitute, the Consumer Specialty Products Association, the National \nAssociation of Chemical Distributors, the National Wildlife Federation, \njust to name a few.\n  I also want to thank two people who never promoted any particular \npolicy but who were responsible for exceptional quality in the \nlegislation before us--Tim Brown and Kakuti Lin, who are our House \nlegislative counsel. They make sure that the words in the bill do what \nwe intend them to do. That is a part of this process that really goes \nunrecognized, the people who are legislative counsel. They spend long \nhours, and we ask them to do heavy lifting on short notice, so we want \nto make sure that we thank them here today. In a highly technical field \nsuch as chemical risk management, that is not an easy task. I thank \nthem for their skill, dedication, and hard work.\n\n  Finally, I would like to recognize the dedicated staffs on both sides \nof the aisle who helped us craft this legislation--David McCarthy, who \nhas already been mentioned, along with Jerry Couri on the Energy and \nCommerce staff. Understanding our chemical regulations has helped \nMembers navigate through the complex nature of TSCA reform from our \nvery first informational hearing in the last Congress.\n  I know, over there, we have got Jackie Cohen, who in the last \nCongress was a real pain in the rear end to me, but, this year, we have \nbeen able to work together, which has been helpful. Jean Fruci also was \na calming influence, and we appreciate her steady guidance. They have \nboth provided quality input to my colleagues on the other side of the \naisle throughout this process. I appreciate their dedication, \noftentimes through nights and weekends, to help us get to where we are \ntoday.\n  I urge all of my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote \n``yes'' on H.R. 2576 to send a strong signal that the time is now to \nupdate this outdated law and to keep the momentum and the bipartisan \nspirit moving forward until the President signs it into law.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, I rise today for the purpose of engaging \nChairman Shimkus in colloquy. First, I would like to thank Mr. Shimkus \nfor working with me during and after markup to make sure that the \nimportant role of states in chemical regulation is preserved. In the \nabsence of a strong federal chemical regulatory program, many states \nhave taken action to protect their citizens from toxic chemicals. \nStrong laws are in place in many states to address chemicals including \nBPA, flame retardants, and more. Through the Committee process, \nexplicit protections have been added for state laws and state common \nlaws, including important changes taken from the amendment that I \noffered at markup. My amendment was drafted in response to the letter \nsent by 12 State Attorneys General, which I would like to introduce now \ninto the Record. Again, I appreciate you working with me to address the \npoints they raised. It is my understanding that nothing in this bill \nwould preempt or otherwise affect existing state laws or private rights \nof action, unless there is an actual conflict between a federal \nrequirement and a state requirement. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, Yes it is. H.R. 2576 contains protection \nfor existing state laws and existing citizen enforcement actions. No \nexisting state requirements will be preempted unless they actually \nconflict with federal requirements.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, as you know, over twenty-five years ago, the \npeople of California enacted a landmark ballot measure known as \nProposition 65. Proposition 65 requires persons who expose individuals \nto certain chemicals that are known to cause cancer or reproductive \nharm to display a clear and reasonable warning. Proposition 65 \nenforcement actions by the state and by private parties have played a \ncrucial role in reducing childhood exposure to harmful chemicals. This \nstate law operates somewhat differently from other state laws related \nto chemicals, so I want to ask specifically about the protection for \nProposition 65 in the bill. It is my understanding that nothing in this \nbill would preempt or otherwise impact enforcement of Proposition 65 or \nthe ability of the State to continue to authorize citizen enforcement \nof Proposition 65, unless there is an actual conflict. Is that correct?\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct. We do not intend to \ninterfere with operation of Proposition 65 unless a requirement under \nthat law actually conflicts with a federal requirement under TSCA.\n  Ms. ESHOO. Mr. Speaker, and just to be clear, the waiver provision in \nSection 18(b) of current law, which could protect additional state \nlaws, is not changed by this bill?\n  Mr. SHIMKUS. Mr. Speaker, that is correct.\n  Mr. UPTON. Mr. Speaker, this is a long time coming. The breakthrough \nbipartisan bill before us today is the culmination of a multi-year, \nmulti-Congress effort to modernize our decades-old chemical safety \nlaws. The Toxic Substances Control Act, which was signed into law by \nMichigan's own President Jerry Ford, needs to be updated for the 21st \ncentury. And this thoughtful bill improves chemical safety while \nencouraging continued innovation and economic growth and gives the \npublic greater confidence in the safety of American-made chemicals and \nthe products that contain them.\n  There are six core elements that form the basis of the TSCA \nModernization Act. First, this bill helps markets work and provides \ncertainty. Chemicals will get reviewed and will be ruled either safe \nfor intended uses, or in need of a risk management rule. Once a \ndecision is made by EPA, that decision will apply in all the states. \nManufacturers won't have to produce 50 different product versions for \n50 different states.\n  Second, the bill respects the role of states and individual rights of \naction. Tort and contract claims are explicitly protected in the pre-\nemption section.\n  Third, any regulation of a chemical will be guided by common sense. \nIs the regulation cost effective? If use in an article were restricted, \nwill exposure actually go down? Is there a feasible replacement? Is the \ntransition period fair? Without good answers to these questions \nregulation will not move forward.\n  Fourth, the bill will build confidence for consumers and the general \npublic that chemicals on the market anywhere in the U.S. are safe, and \nnot just because EPA says so. EPA must evaluate risk against the most \nstringent science standards we've ever enacted for chemicals. And the \nscience has to be transparent and hold up to objective peer review.\n  Fifth, the bill lets government and industry actually collaborate. \nChemical manufacturers are given the choice to ask for and get a \nchemical evaluated. And EPA must meet strict action deadlines. If the \nscience indicates the chemical is safe, then EPA must say so, and that \ndetermination will be the law in all 50 states.\n  Finally, the bill encourages innovation, largely by protecting \nconfidential business information. New technology is not likely to \nappear if the secret formula can be stolen and\n\n[[Page H4560]]\n\ncopied the minute a new product appears. This bill would prevent that \nfrom happening.\n  Each of the elements of the bill are not trade-offs, each provision \nworks to the support the others. It would not accomplish much good for \nEPA to evaluate all these chemicals if the results were not going to \napply in all the states. It does not make sense for the government to \nbe writing safety regulations if the result is no real improvement in \nsafety. And a manufacturer is not likely to cooperate with the \ngovernment in chemical evaluation if to do so means giving up a trade \nsecret.\n  The TSCA Modernization Act solves each of these concerns, as all \nthese safeguards work together.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a big day. The TSCA Modernization Act is good \nfor consumers, good for trade, and good for the environment. I \nespecially commend Mr. Shimkus, Mr. Pallone, Mr. Tonko, and Mr. Latta \nfor their dedication and hard work in putting together a bill that can \nbe signed into law. Let's put jobs and the economy first and vote yes.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Shimkus) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2576, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. PALLONE. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4560-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4560-H4562]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              BOYS TOWN CENTENNIAL COMMEMORATIVE COIN ACT\n\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Huizenga) and the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn \nB. Maloney) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n\n[[Page H4561]]\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that \nall Members may have 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend \ntheir remarks and to include extraneous material on this bill.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I rise today in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial \nCommemorative Coin Act, introduced by the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. \nFortenberry), and I seek its immediate passage.\n  Mr. Speaker, on December 12, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years \nof saving children and healing families. Boys Town was founded in 1917 \nby a young Irish priest, Father Edward Flanagan, who believed that \nevery child could be a productive citizen if given love, a home, an \neducation, and a trade. He accepted boys of every race, color, and \ncreed--an amazing thing back in 1917.\n  Boys Town first opened on December 12 of 1917 in a rundown Victorian \nmansion in downtown Omaha, Nebraska. In 1921, the home later moved to \nOverlook Farm on the outskirts of Omaha, where it remains located \ntoday. A number of years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Boys \nTown. By the 1930s, hundreds of boys lived at Boys Town, which grew to \ninclude dormitories and administrative buildings, and the boys even \nelected their own government, which included a mayor, a council, and \ncommissioners.\n  News of Father Flanagan's work spread worldwide, and even Hollywood \ntook notice with the very famous 1938 movie ``Boys Town,'' with Spencer \nTracy, who won an Academy Award for his portrayal of Father Flanagan. \nAt the request of President Truman, he even traveled the world, \nvisiting orphans and advising government leaders on how to care for \ndisplaced children after the war.\n  Although Father Flanagan died in 1948, his work at Boys Town, which \nFlanagan called ``God's work''--and I think most of us would agree with \nthat--continued. Today, although Boys Town is still headquartered in \nNebraska, it continues to expand its care across America. It is one of \nthe largest nonprofit child care agencies in the country, providing \ntreatment for behavioral, emotional, and physical problems for children \nand their families, helping as many as 2 million people annually. \nAdditionally, the Boys Town National Research Hospital is a global \nleader in the research of Usher syndrome.\n  Mr. Speaker, I can't think of a better way to commemorate Father \nFlanagan and Boys Town than by creating this commemorative coin. The \nspirit of Boys Town truly embodies the best of America. This bill would \nhelp recognize and continue to nurture that spirit.\n  I commend the gentleman from Nebraska for his hard work on this \nissue, and I ask for the immediate passage of the bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                                      Committee on Ways and Means,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Jeb Hensarling,\n     Chairman, Committee on Financial Services, Rayburn House \n         Office Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Hensarling: I am writing with respect to H.R. \n     893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative Coin Act. I \n     wanted to notify you that the Committee on Ways and Means \n     will forgo action on H.R. 893 so that it may proceed \n     expeditiously to the House floor for consideration.\n       This is done with the understanding that the jurisdictional \n     interests of the Committee on Ways and Means over this and \n     similar legislation are in no way diminished or altered. In \n     addition, the Committee reserves the right to seek conferees \n     on H.R. 893 and requests your support when such a request is \n     made.\n       I would appreciate your response confirming this \n     understanding with respect to H.R. 893 and ask that a copy of \n     our exchange of letters on this matter be included in the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the bill on the \n     House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                        Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                  Committee on Financial Services,\n\n\n                                     House of Representatives,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 22, 2015.\n     Hon. Paul Ryan,\n     Chairman, Committee on Ways and Means, Longworth House Office \n         Building, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Ryan: Thank you for your letter of June 19th \n     regarding H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative \n     Coin Act.\n       I am most appreciative of your decision to forego action on \n     H.R. 893 so that it may move expeditiously to the House \n     floor. I acknowledge that by forgoing such action the \n     Committee on Ways and Means is not waiving its jurisdictional \n     interest in this or similar legislation. In addition, if a \n     conference is necessary on this legislation, I will support \n     any request that your committee be represented therein.\n       Finally, I shall be pleased to include your letter and this \n     letter in the Congressional Record during floor consideration \n     of this measure.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                   Jeb Hensarling,\n                                                         Chairman.\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such \ntime as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of H.R. 893, the Boys Town Centennial Commemorative \nCoin Act.\n  I was pleased to be an original sponsor in the last Congress and a \ncosponsor in this one. This bill appropriately recognizes the \noutstanding work done by Boys Town, a nonprofit organization \nheadquartered in the village of Boys Town, Nebraska, that selflessly \npromotes the interest of children and their families across this \nNation.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Boys Town, which takes its name from Father Flanagan's Boys' Home, \nimpacts the lives of more than 2 million families across America each \nyear through its counseling services, outreach, and education. I am \nalso pleased to report that each year, Boys Town directly touches the \nlives of thousands of New Yorkers through its community support \nservices and homes for troubled youth.\n  Father Flanagan, the founder of Boys Town, focused on the inherent \ngood in children and built a world class organization that emphasized \nthe rehabilitation of troubled youth, rather than punishment. President \nFranklin Roosevelt once said that America needs 49 more Father \nFlanagans.\n  It is this compassionate approach and commitment to love, training, \nand guidance, regardless of race or religion, that has made Boys Town \nsuch a success story and a lifeline for countless children and their \nfamilies. In commemoration of their centennial anniversary, the bill \nbefore us today will require the U.S. Treasury Department to mint and \nissue $5 gold, $1 silver, and half-dollar clad commemorative coins.\n  Surcharges from the sale of the coins will allow Boys Town to raise \nneeded funds that will be dedicated to making a positive impact on the \nlives of children and families from underserved communities across \nAmerica. It is also important to note that the passage of this bill \ncomes at absolutely no cost to the taxpayer.\n  I would urge my colleagues to join me in passing this commonsense \nbipartisan bill without further delay.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Fortenberry), the sponsor \nof this bill.\n  Mr. FORTENBERRY. Mr. Speaker, first let me thank Mr. Huizenga and \nMrs. Maloney for their very thoughtful reflections on the history and \nimportance of Boys Town. I greatly appreciate the sentiments offered.\n  I am very happy and proud to stand here in support of the centennial \ncommemorative coin. As was mentioned, Boys Town was founded in 1917 by \nFather Edward Flanagan and has since grown from a small local home for \nchildren who found themselves in difficult circumstances in Omaha to \none of the largest nonprofit, nonsectarian child and family service \norganizations in America.\n  Boys Town offers a remarkable model of academic and spiritual \nengagement. Students learn more than math and grammar, as important as \nthat is. Their teachers and caregivers provide them with solid \nformation. Graduates are equipped to succeed not only professionally, \nbut are also given the life skills to stay on the right path.\n  Boys Town is so impactful that about 90 percent of the children who \ncome there integrate successfully back into\n\n[[Page H4562]]\n\ntheir communities; and historically, many, over time, have joined the \nmilitary.\n  What is this extraordinary model of intervention? It starts with a \nfamily. Each child is placed into a family with a caring, nurturing \nmother and a protective, giving father, where there are rules and \nexpectations, discipline, and love.\n  The success of Nebraska's Boys Town has recently been duplicated \nacross many, many communities in our country. Their network of 11 \nnational sites and national hotlines touches the lives of more than 2 \nmillion Americans each year.\n  On December 2, 2017, Boys Town will celebrate 100 years of saving \nchildren and helping to heal families. In honor of this 100-year \nanniversary, this legislation, again, would authorize the U.S. Mint to \nproduce a series of commemorative coins with a design emblematic of \nBoys Town's 100-year history.\n  These coins, of course, will be available to the general public for \nsale and will more than offset the cost of minting by the Treasury. As \nwas mentioned earlier, there will be no cost to the taxpayer.\n  Mr. Speaker, Boys Town is a quiet institution nestled in the \nheartland, my home. It does great service to America by helping to heal \nwounds during this socially fractured time.\n  A quick story, Mr. Speaker: last year, I had the privilege of \nparticipating as a commencement speaker at Boys Town. After I finished \nmy address, the young people were called forward to receive their \ndiplomas in a ceremony marked with great dignity and formality and even \nlightheartedness.\n  Even though family and friends and those visiting were told to please \nhold their applause, the excitement couldn't be contained. As each \ngraduate crossed the stage, shouts of joy and encouragement and \nclapping continued throughout the whole event.\n  Prior to the graduation, students had gathered for a retreat, giving \nthem the opportunity for reflection and recommitment. During their last \ntime together, the seniors discussed what they had to say. Here are \nquotes from a few of them.\n\n       I ran in the wrong crowd, hated my family, kept running \n     away from home, and inflicted self-harm. At Boys Town, I am a \n     member of the Junior ROTC and learned to like myself and my \n     family. I look forward to returning home and being a good \n     example to my younger brother.\n\n  Another said:\n\n       I lived on the streets from age 10 to 13 and stole to eat. \n     I ended up in prison, and my cousin got shot in the face. I \n     never played sports, let alone attended school, but at Boys \n     Town, I just finished playing baseball this year and signed \n     on with a college to study business.\n\n  Another child said this:\n\n       My mom and dad were both in prison, and I had trouble since \n     kindergarten. In junior high, I was locked up myself for 2 \n     years, and when I got out, my mom died. My dad was still in \n     prison. Since I have lived at Boys Town, I chose to get \n     myself on the right track and graduate and made a promise to \n     myself that I would never do anything that would land me in \n     prison. Boys Town saved my life.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, fortunately, most children do not experience such trauma \nin their lives, but some do. These are the kids who bear the scars of \nfraying social and familial bonds, destructive choices, and legal \ndifficulty.\n  Through no fault of their own, the great problems of our time fall \nmost heavily on our young people. Economic hardship and broken families \ndestroy the sense of safety and possibility that is a necessary \nantidote to social alienation.\n  Every child needs a nurturing environment of compassionate challenge \nand genuine promise. Education should cultivate that creativity, as \nwell as dignity, allowing all boys and girls to realize their full \npotential.\n  Today, we have an opportunity to celebrate the lives of remarkable \nyoung men and women and the extraordinary institution that is serving \nthem so well. By authorizing this Boys Town commemorative coin, we are \ninvesting in the future of our children in a simple but I think really \nimpactful way.\n  I want to thank the nearly 300 bipartisan Members of this Congress \nwho have signed on as cosponsors of this bill. I think that is an \nimportant statement. I would also like to thank Chairman Hensarling and \nRanking Member Waters as well for their leadership on the committee.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield such time \nas he may consume to the gentleman from Nebraska (Mr. Ashford), whose \nfather and grandfather served on the board of Boys Town.\n\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding me \nthis time.\n  I would like to commend my colleague Congressman Fortenberry for his \nwork on this issue and his words, which are right on. I would like to \nthank as well the chairman for his words, which accurately describe the \nhistory of Boys Town. Let me also thank the ranking member for her \ncomments that so accurately reflect what Boys Town means to our \ncommunity and to the entire country.\n  I grew up around Boys Town. I grew up playing sports at Boys Town. \nThe high school that I went to, Boys Town was in our conference; and we \nspent many very difficult nights playing basketball against the Boys \nTown basketball team which, quite frankly, was better than we were on \nmost every occasion.\n  In my years in the legislature that lasted until last year, I had the \nopportunity to work with a colleague of mine, Senator Bob Krist from \nOmaha, who spearheaded significant juvenile justice reform in our \nState.\n  The child welfare system in Nebraska was in deep trouble; and Senator \nKrist, along with Father Boes, who is the acclaimed and incredibly \ncompetent leader at Boys Town, we passed significant juvenile justice \nlegislation that helps families throughout the State of Nebraska, that \ndeals with brain development, that deals with wraparound services, \nfamily services, as was so aptly described by my colleague Congressman \nFortenberry.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are changing lives in Nebraska; and, as has been \nmentioned, Boys Town is changing lives throughout the country. Their \nunique approach to juvenile justice issues, the wraparound family-\ncentered services that deal with not only the parents but the siblings \nto help bring these young people into a productive life, is what Boys \nTown has been about for the 100 years that it has been in existence.\n  It is no longer there, but I remember as a child in the 1950s \nactually seeing the first Boys Town facility in downtown Omaha. When I \nwas growing up, Boys Town was way out of town. It had a farm around it. \nThe farm is still there, but now, it is in the middle of Omaha, as \nOmaha grows.\n  Though it is in a different place in the world today than it was in \n1917 with Father Flanagan, by bringing business leaders in Omaha \ntogether and others to create Boys Town, it serves that grand purpose \nthat Father Flanagan envisioned in 1917.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is with great pride that I thank the ranking member \nfor giving me this opportunity to speak.\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 1698, the Bullion and \nCollectible Coin Production Efficiency and Cost Savings Act, a \nbipartisan bill which I introduced in March, along with the gentlewoman \nfrom New York, Representative Maloney.\n  This simple piece of legislation would make minor changes to four \nexisting coin programs. Each change saves money for the United States \nMint, and it makes it easier to produce the coins or make the coins \nmore attractive to investors and collectors.\n  The changes include: first, making it less expensive to package gold \ninvestment coins; second, it allows the Mint to buy standard coinage \nsilver for collectible coins instead of the more expensive custom \nalloy; third, it removes the requirement for an already completed study \non the production of an investor coin made of palladium; and, fourth, \nit allows collector versions of the widely popular American eagle \nsilver investment coin to bear an inscription noting that next year is \nthe 30th anniversary of the first issuance of those coins.\n  These small changes will have an impact on saving taxpayer dollars \nover the next few years.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask for immediate passage of H.R. 1698.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself as \nmuch time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of this cost-saving legislation, \nwhich I was proud to cosponsor with my friend from Michigan.\n  People who see the big things that Congress does, they often forget \nthat we have to pay attention to the little things, too, and these \nlittle things are important. This is a very good example of that. This \nis a small bill which makes the government better, saves some \ntaxpayers' money, and makes our coin programs better for collectors and \nfor investors.\n  For years, the laws that specify the production of silver coins made \nby the Mint have required them to be 90 percent silver. Today, the \nstandard silver used in coins is 91 percent silver. So the Mint has had \nto pay extra for custom coin blanks. This legislation fixes that \nproblem.\n  It also allows the Mint to make a special collectible version of the \nAmerican Eagle silver bullion coin, noting the popularity of the \nprogram over the past 30 years.\n  The bill also allows the sale of American Buffalo gold coins in bulk \nrather than in individual packages, making handling easier for the Mint \nand for investors and clears the final hurdle for the Mint finally to \nproduce investor coins made of palladium, an idea from a 2010 bill from \nmy former colleague and very good friend, Mr. Watt.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill saves money and makes coin programs more \nattractive to collectors and investors. I ask for its immediate \npassage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HUIZENGA of Michigan. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2620. This bill would amend the \nUnited States Cotton Futures Act to allow for the creation of a world \ncotton contract listed on the United States exchange.\n\n[[Page H4564]]\n\n  Current law, which requires sampling and classing by the USDA of \nevery bale of cotton tendered under contracts listed on a U.S. exchange \nreflects an antiquated picture of the global cotton market. Some market \nparticipants need to hedge price fluctuations in foreign markets, and \nthe current law limits their ability to do so. We need to update our \nlaw to reflect the modern nature of this marketplace.\n  H.R. 2620 accomplishes this by providing an option for cotton \nproduced and delivered in foreign markets to be classed by rating \nfacilities closer to the point of delivery rather than by the United \nStates Department of Agriculture. It makes no changes to the treatment \nof domestically produced and delivered cotton.\n  This legislation will allow any willing exchange to meet industry \ndemand to design a world cotton contract. For example, ICE Futures \nU.S., which has already worked with market participants, has publicly \nannounced their intention and preference to list a world cotton \ncontract side by side with the domestically focused Cotton No. 2 \ncontract they already list.\n  H.R. 2620 allows for an important new contract for cotton hedging to \nbe developed, which would be beneficial to commercial hedgers. However, \nit is important specifically to me and to others to note, it would not \ndisrupt the industry's benchmark hedging contract, the No. 2 contract, \nwhich is relied upon by U.S. cotton producers in my district and around \nthe country.\n  Before I close, I would like to thank Chairman Conaway both for his \ncontinued leadership on the Agriculture Committee and his efforts on \nthis legislation. Additionally, I want to thank Ranking Member David \nScott for working with me on this issue over the last few months. And I \nwould like to acknowledge Lynn Westmoreland's work in this as well. He \nwas instrumental in advancing this issue.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of H.R. 2620.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I, too, have enjoyed working with my colleague from Georgia, the \nchairman of our Subcommittee on Commodity Exchanges, Energy, and \nCredit, Congressman Austin Scott.\n  Mr. Speaker, our bill, H.R. 2620, will modernize the way in which \ncotton futures contracts are listed and regulated under the 1916 Cotton \nFutures Act.\n  More specifically, as many of you know, the main tool used in the \nmarketplace for hedging cotton is the No. 2 contract. Currently, the \nNo. 2 contract only permits cotton grown within the United States. That \ncotton is delivered to only five United States cities: Galveston, \nTexas; Houston, Texas; Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas; Greenville, South \nCarolina; and Memphis, Tennessee.\n  Now, under the 1916 Cotton Futures Act, every bale of cotton tendered \nunder a contract listed on a U.S. exchange must be sampled and classed \nor graded by the United States Department of Agriculture. However, \nseeing that cotton is grown all over the world, my bill targets cotton \nthat is grown and delivered outside of the United States' borders.\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, here is the problem, the concern that our bill is \nsolving. As I mentioned earlier, because of the fact that there are \nonly five domestic cities that are cotton delivery points listed under \nthe 1916 Cotton Futures Act, there has been much concern that the \nCotton No. 2 contract cannot accurately reflect price movement in \nforeign markets and, therefore, cannot provide an effective risk \nmanagement tool. That is simply the problem.\n  Now, to solve this problem, what our bill will do is simply allow \nU.S.-based future exchanges flexibility in how they handle foreign-\ngrown cotton and foreign delivery points that will never touch the \nUnited States at all.\n  Mr. Speaker, we live now and we operate in a rapidly changing global \neconomy. It is very important that we not put our cotton producers or \nour commodities exchanges into a disadvantaged position competitively \nwhen it comes to being able to get the price fluctuations that occur in \nforeign markets, thereby providing our businesses with the most \neffective tool by which they can manage their risk.\n  So because the United States Department of Agriculture does not have \nthe manpower to deploy personnel all over the world at one time, our \nbill will allow cotton grown outside the United States to be classed by \neither a United States Department of Agriculture testing lab inside the \nUnited States or an international lab deemed to have comparable \ncomprehensive rules and regulations equivalent to the United States. \nThat is it. It is clean and simple.\n  Our bill solves this problem. It gives our cotton producers and it \ngives our exchanges that ability to be able to know how prices are \nsliding in each foreign country that is producing cotton while, at the \nsame time, our producers and our exchanges, without that, cannot apply \ngood risk management. That is why this is so essential.\n  So let me state again, as my colleague from Georgia, Mr. Austin \nScott, made clear, I, too, want to make clear that our bill does not \nchange the fact that 100 percent of all domestically produced and \ndelivered cotton will be classed by the United States Department of \nAgriculture. There is absolutely no change here.\n  Furthermore, the bill does not change or alter the Cotton No. 2 \ncontract. What our bill does is simply allow our U.S.-based futures \nexchanges that much-needed flexibility that is needed in order to list \ncotton that will never touch the United States through a world cotton \ncontract.\n  As I said, we live in a global marketplace. It is important that our \nrules and regulations reflect the modernization that has happened in \nour global markets since this act was written 100 years ago. It is \nimportant, Mr. Speaker, that we keep the United States economy the \nstrongest economy in the world, and our bill, H.R. 2620, will do just.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 2620.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, as my colleague, Mr. Scott, \nand I have said, this is simply a necessary, minor change. I would just \nask all Members to support passage of H.R. 2620.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Austin Scott) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 2620, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4564-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4564-H4566]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY HEADQUARTERS CONSOLIDATION \n                       ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. WALKER.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640. Mr. Speaker, \nsince 2006, the Department of Homeland Security and the General \nServices Administration have been working towards completing a \nconsolidated headquarters on the historic St. Elizabeths campus in \nWashington, D.C.\n  However, as with many other Federal projects, the consolidation has \nrun up against cost overruns and construction delays, at times \nestimated to be more than $1 billion over budget and 12 years behind \nschedule.\n  Earlier this year, I visited the site personally to see firsthand the \nprogress being made and the immense challenges that lie ahead. I remain \nconcerned that taxpayers' dollars will be put at risk without better \nmanagement.\n  This bill, H.R. 1640, the DHS Headquarters Consolidation \nAccountability Act of 2015, would require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity, in coordination with the Administrator of General Services, \nto investigate and submit a report on the estimated costs and property \nneeds of the project.\n  While we were encouraged by the updated DHS St. Elizabeths plans \npublished earlier this year, we still believe that increased oversight \nof the consolidation project will help ensure accountability and the \nefficient use of our constituents' taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, accountability is a fundamental aspect of citizen-ruled \ngovernment and something that our constituents expect their \nrepresentatives to uphold. H.R. 1640 does just this, and I look forward \nto the bipartisan support this legislation will receive.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, House of \n           Representatives,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 15, 2015.\n     Hon.

I appreciate your \n     support in bringing this legislation before the House of \n     Representatives, and accordingly, understand that the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will not seek \n     a sequential referral on the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing a sequential referral of this \n     bill at this time, the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation \n     in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill \n     be necessary, I would support a request by the Committee on \n     Transportation and Infrastructure for conferees on those \n     provisions within your jurisdiction.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Michael T. McCaul,\n\n                                                         Chairman,\n                                   Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the Department of \nHomeland Security Headquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of \n2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, in 2006, 3 years into the Department of Homeland \nSecurity's existence, President Bush proposed consolidating the \nheadquarters functions of the Department and its components from the \nmore than 50 locations to the St. Elizabeths campus in southeast \nWashington, D.C.\n  Construction began in 2009, but between sequestration and tightening \nbudgets, appropriations for the project have been $1.2 billion less \nthan President Bush and President Obama requested.\n  Naturally, Congress' failure to consistently and adequately fund the \nproject has greatly slowed construction and led to increased costs. It \nhas also forced DHS to revisit its master plan and reduce the scope of \nthe project.\n  At this juncture, it is important that the Department have a \nrealistic and\n\n[[Page H4566]]\n\nachievable plan. The legislation under consideration seeks to do just \nthat. If enacted, this legislation would require the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to submit to Congress an updated plan for St. \nElizabeths to inform future funding decisions.\n  Importantly, H.R. 1640 requires the submission of a proposed \noccupancy plan for St. Elizabeths that includes a list of components \nand offices to be housed there. A key consequence of the Department \nhaving to scale down the breadth of its consolidation plans is the \nreality that its portfolio of leased space will need to remain large.\n  In fact, with up to 69 percent of DHS' commercial leases in the \nnational capital region expiring between fiscal years 2016 to 2020, we \nshould all be aware that DHS will be forced to embark on the expensive \nprocess of recompeting and possibly relocating its operations and \npersonnel.\n  Before I reserve the balance of my time, I would like to acknowledge \nthat I am pleased that the bill includes an amendment I offered to give \nthe Department adequate time to engage the General Services \nAdministration, the construction manager for the project, in preparing \nthe updated plans, assessments, and estimates.\n  GSA's participation in the development of these key materials is \nessential to ensuring that what is transmitted to Congress is realistic \nand achievable.\n  As a supporter of the St. Elizabeths project and DHS' Unity of Effort \ninitiative, I urge passage of H.R. 1640. Colocation of DHS' personnel \nin one headquarters has the potential of not only achieving cost \nsavings, but fostering an environment where integration and \ncollaboration drives more effective and efficient operations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I appreciate the bipartisan approach taken on this legislation. The \nSt. Elizabeths project is about more than real estate; it is about \nensuring the Department of Homeland Security has a home where diverse \ncomponents can come together.\n  That is the thinking behind the Secretary's Unity of Effort \ninitiative. Enactment of this legislation will help to ensure that DHS \nhas a realistic plan for St. Elizabeths.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul and the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Walker) for their work on this legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. WALKER. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this strong bipartisan \npiece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1640, the \n``Department of Homeland Security Headquarters Consolidation \nAccountability Act of 2015.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation which directs the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to submit to Congress a report on the Department of \nHomeland Security headquarters consolidation project in the National \nCapital Region.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues on the Homeland Security Committee \nfor unanimously supporting the inclusion of my amendments to H.R. 1640.\n  Together, the Jackson Lee amendments offered a comprehensive look at \nthe Department's real estate obligations related to its headquarters \nconsolidation project at St. Elizabeths, as well as its leased \nportfolio in the National Capital Region.\n  Further, the Jackson Lee amendments help clarify how DHS will \nrelocate its personnel and operations at the headquarters level and \nacross its components at St. Elizabeths as construction continues on \nthe headquarters consolidation project.\n  Mr. Speaker, since DHS initiated its headquarters consolidation in \n2006, it has progressed despite changes in senior leadership and waning \nfunding support from Congress.\n  As a result, in April 2015, DHS and GSA announced that the \nconstruction sequence and timetable for the headquarters consolidation \nwould be adjusted to reflect reduced funding by Congress.\n  DHS must now re-compete up to 69 percent of its commercial leases in \nthe National Capital Region as they are scheduled to expire between \n2016 and 2020.\n  My first amendment directs DHS to provide information related to the \nexpected timing and terms of any lease renewals in the National Capital \nRegion.\n  My second amendment requires the Department to report on the numbers \nof its full-time equivalents who are expected to occupy each DHS-leased \nor owned property, which will guide the Department in adjusting its \nexpenditures on the headquarters consolidation project.\n  Together, they will ensure that DHS and GSA develop a comprehensive \npicture of which employees and operations will migrate to St. \nElizabeths and which will not.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in strong support of the \nsuspension bill, H.R. 1640, the ``Department of Homeland Security \nHeadquarters Consolidation Accountability Act of 2015.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Walker) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1640, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4566-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4566-H4569]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        DHS PAID ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. \nWatson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I believe our children and grandchildren deserve a \nbetter government than the one that we are passing on to them. Families \nare struggling due to a lagging economy. Government intrusion and \nsenseless regulations on businesses are pushing jobs overseas. With the \nrecent rash of scandals within our Federal Government, the American \npeople are continually losing their faith in representatives of our \ngovernment.\n  I know we can do better, and the American people expect to see \nchange. I came to Congress to make a difference, to cut spending, to \neliminate waste, and to hold Big Government bureaucrats accountable and \nmake this Nation a place that is more free, safe, and full of \nopportunity.\n  This is what the American people expect from us, and now is the time \nfor us to take bold and decisive action, and that is why I am standing \nhere today.\n  The Department of Homeland Security has roughly 240,000 employees who \nwork around the clock to protect the lives and liberties of Americans, \nand I am grateful for their dedicated service.\n  However, due to a lack of proper management and accountability, there \nare numbers of DHS employees who are staying at home and drawing a \npaycheck while being investigated for acts of misconduct.\n  In May of 2014, the former deputy inspector general at the Department \nof Homeland Security was accused of altering reports and delaying \ninvestigations. One of those investigations was the Secret Service \nprostitution scandal that occurred in 2012.\n  The Senate Subcommittee on Financial and Contracting Oversight delved \ninto this case, which also led to further investigations. However, even \nthough the former deputy inspector general was being investigated for \ngross misconduct, he was placed on administrative leave, receiving full \npay and benefits for almost an entire year.\n  We all know that there are occasional incidents like this in any \norganization. However, if this was an isolated case, I would not be \nstanding here today presenting this bill, but there are numerous cases \nlike it.\n  The Government Accountability Office reported that from 2011 to 2013, \nthe Department of Homeland Security provided its employees with over \n1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, equating to over $380 \nmillion in taxpayer dollars. Most of this paid leave was granted to \nemployees who were on administrative leave for reasons of misconduct.\n  Unfortunately, the Department has no agencywide standards or \nreporting policies regarding paid administrative leave for employees \nbeing investigated for misconduct. This lack of management and \naccountability allows employees with disciplinary issues, like the \nformer deputy inspector general, to fall through the cracks.\n  This bill, H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave \nAccountability Act of 2015, requires the Chief Human Capital Officer to \nimplement an agencywide policy regarding those who are on paid \nadministrative leave for more than 6 months being investigated for \nmisconduct. In addition, it requires the Department to report to \nCongress the number of employees on administrative leave during \ninvestigation, as well as the associated costs.\n  Having a commonsense policy, as mandated by this bill, will \npotentially save the Department millions of dollars and provide for \ncritical oversight and accountability.\n  The bill will also require the Chief Human Capital Officer to submit \nquarterly reports to the House and Senate Homeland Security Committees. \nThese reports will allow more oversight by Congress and ensure DHS is \nno longer squandering hard-working taxpayer dollars.\n  DHS must do a better job of tracking employees under investigation \nfor misconduct and, in a timely manner, take appropriate action to hold \nthem accountable. Employees who tarnish the Department's reputation do \nnot deserve paid vacations at taxpayer expense.\n  Americans are tired of government carelessly giving away their future \nthrough mismanagement and thoughtless spending habits.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support passage of H.R. 1633, a \ncommonsense bill that will help prevent fraud, alleviate waste, and \nbetter safeguard taxpayer dollars.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the DHS Paid \nAdministrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, this measure which was unanimously approved in \ncommittee, seeks to enhance how certain paid administrative leave is \ntracked and managed by the Department of Homeland Security.\n  H.R. 1633 was introduced in response to a 2014 Government \nAccountability Office report that looked at paid administrative leave \nexpenditures across government between fiscal years 2011 and 2014.\n  In that report, GAO found that, overall, agencies spent $3.1 billion \non paid administrative leave. Of that amount, the Department of \nHomeland Security spent $380 million on this category of leave. \nAgencies approve administrative leave for a variety of reasons, from \nsevere weather events, to jury duty, to voting, to disciplinary matters \nsubject to investigation.\n\n[[Page H4568]]\n\n  H.R. 1633 focuses on helping to improve DHS' management of just one \nsegment of paid administrative leave expenditures, leave that is paid \nfor 6 or more consecutive months to an employee that is under \ninvestigation by the Department for a conduct or criminal matter.\n  This legislation directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer \nto maintain records from throughout the Department on the number of \nemployees who are paid leave for 6 or more consecutive months during a \nDHS personnel investigation; the total costs, including salaries and \nbenefits associated with this leave; and the average length of time \nthat an employee in these circumstances is on paid administrative \nleave.\n  H.R. 1633 also directs the Department's Chief Human Capital Officer \nto develop and implement departmentwide policy on how components can \ncomply with this recordkeeping requirement and guidance and on how \ncomponents can expedite the resolution of personnel matters for an \nemployee in these circumstances.\n  In committee, language I authored was accepted to ensure that when a \ncomponent expeditiously works to resolve personnel matters, as directed \nby this bill, that component must do so in a way that is objective and \nfair.\n\n                              {time}  1630\n\n  The addition of this language is important because we do not want to \ncreate the impression that Congress values expediency and cost-cutting \nover fairness.\n  Even as we look to foster greater accountability, we must not lose \nsight of the fact that we are talking about people's careers here.\n  Before I close, I would add that this legislation does nothing to \ndisturb the discretion that the Department has to make leave decisions, \nand this bill should not impact the availability of paid administrative \nleave to the DHS workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Austin Scott), my good friend.\n  Mr. AUSTIN SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of \nH.R. 1633, the DHS Paid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of \n2015, introduced by my colleague from Georgia, Barry Loudermilk.\n  Over the span of 2 years, Department of Homeland Security employees \nracked up approximately 1.5 million days of paid administrative leave, \nwhich amounts to hundreds of millions of taxpayer dollars. Some of \nthese employees were placed on leave due to investigations into alleged \nmisconduct.\n  Stopping wasteful government spending has been a top priority for me \nduring my time in Congress, which is why I am proud to cosponsor this \npiece of legislation.\n  This bill increases government transparency by establishing an \naccountability system within the Department of Homeland Security. This \nsystem is essential in safeguarding against waste, fraud, and abuse.\n  I am glad that it is a bipartisan measure. I look forward to its \npassage, and I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 1633 and stand with \nthis commonsense legislation that saves taxpayer dollars.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I have no further speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter), my colleague, friend, and fellow member of the \nHomeland Security Committee.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n1633.\n  From 2011 to 2013, over 200 DHS employees were placed on paid \nadministrative leave. While administrative leave may be necessary on a \ncase-by-case basis, more frequently, we hear of Federal employees who \nare under investigation for conduct-related actions. These \ninvestigations can last for several months, which can result in a \nsubstantial cost to taxpayers.\n  For example, in 2013, a DHS employee was placed on paid \nadministrative leave for running a Web site that predicted and \nadvocated a race war. Such action should not involve paid leave. It \nclearly should involve termination of employment.\n  Another example involves former Acting and Deputy DHS Inspector \nGeneral Charles Edwards. Mr. Edwards was placed on paid leave in May of \n2014. As of October 2014, he was still on paid administrative leave.\n  This bill protects precious taxpayer dollars by requiring DHS to \ntrack and report on employees placed on administrative leave for \npersonnel matters. By keeping track of who is on paid administrative \nleave, we can better ensure we are not using the taxpayers' dime to pay \nfor DHS employee misconduct.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this bill.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I mentioned before, this legislation would do nothing \nto disturb the availability of paid administrative leave for DHS \nworkers who need it to vote or to serve on a jury. It is narrowly \nfocused on getting a handle on how much the Department is spending on \npaid administrative leave for individuals under investigation for 6 or \nmore months.\n  These circumstances are often tough for all involved. The sooner \nthere is an appropriate resolution, the better it is for everyone \ninvolved. If enacted, H.R. 1633 would help to ensure that such matters \nare resolved in a timely and appropriate manner.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to support this strong, \ncommonsense, and bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1633, the ``DHS \nPaid Administrative Leave Accountability Act of 2015.''\n  This bill makes needed improvements relating to the tracking and \nreporting of employees of the Department of Homeland Security including \nadministrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without \ncharge to leave, and personal matters, and for other purposes.\n  I support this bipartisan legislation, which amends the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 to direct the head of each component of the \nDepartment of Homeland Security to submit on a quarterly basis two \nreports to the Chief Human Capital Officer of DHS.\n  Mr. Speaker, Title I of Homeland Security Act would be amended by \nadding Section 104 which provides for the improvement of internal \ntracking and reporting for administrative leave.\n  First, this bill directs that the number of employees who had been on \nadministrative leave, or any other type of paid non-duty status without \ncharge to leave, for personnel matters for six consecutive months or \nlonger be reported.\n  Second, DHS agency heads must report the total cost to the component \nassociated with such leave and paid non-duty status for that quarter.\n  The Chief Human Capital Officer is responsible for determining \nappropriate actions to be taken by DHS to resolve any personnel matter \nexpeditiously or to eliminate or reduce the use of such leave and paid \nnon-duty status in addressing any personnel matter.\n  The Chief HCO is also to develop and implement a department-wide \npolicy in accordance with existing federal guidance specifically \nrelated to the use of such leave of paid non-duty status for personnel \nmatters.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1633 enhances transparency and allows for more \nfiscally conservative policy in regards to the costs associated with \npaid administrative leave.\n  However, it may be more difficult to accomplish this level of \ntransparency in regards to how data for leave is extracted and \nrecorded.\n  These are time sensitive additions which will require that within 90 \ndays of the enactment of this Act, and quarterly thereafter, the \ndepartment heads are required to submit their reports to the Chief \nOfficer.\n  In that same time span the Chief HC Officer is to promulgate a \ndepartment-wide policy in accordance with existing Federal guidance \nspecifically related to the use of administrative leave.\n  I join my colleagues in working to strengthen efficiency in all areas \nof government and supporting fiscally conservative methods to achieve \nthis goal.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting the passage of \nH.R. 1633.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H.R. 1633, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the\n\n[[Page H4569]]\n\nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4569-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4569-H4570]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          HOMELAND SECURITY DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS ACT\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I move to suspend the rules and pass the \nbill (H.R. 1646) to require the Secretary of Homeland Security to \nresearch how small- and medium-sized unmanned aerial systems could be \nused in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate the effects of such an \nattack, and for other purposes, as amended.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 1646\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``Homeland Security Drone \n     Assessment and Analysis Act''.\n\n     SEC. 2. DRONE ASSESSMENT AND ANALYSIS.\n\n       (a) In General.--The Secretary of Homeland Security shall, \n     in consultation with the Secretary of Defense, the Secretary \n     of Transportation, the Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman \n     of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission research how \n     commercially available small and medium sized unmanned \n     aircraft, excluding aircraft over 1,300 pounds could be used \n     to perpetuate an attack and, based on such research, the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall develop policies, \n     guidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland \n     Security to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risks of \n     such an attack. Not later than 180 days after the completion \n     of the research required under this subsection, the Secretary \n     of Homeland Security may provide, as appropriate, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Secretary of Transportation, the \n     Secretary of Energy, and the Chairman of the Nuclear \n     Regulatory Commission information, based on such research, \n     regarding how to best prevent and mitigate the risk of such \n     an attack.\n       (b) Dissemination to State and Local Officials.--The \n     Secretary of Homeland Security shall disseminate information \n     to State, local, and tribal law enforcement officials and \n     State and major urban area fusion centers, as appropriate, \n     regarding how such officials may bolster preparedness for and \n     responses to attacks perpetrated by commercially available \n     small and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft \n     over 1,300 pounds.\n       (c) Report.--Not later than one year after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to the Committee on Homeland Security and the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure of the House \n     of Representatives and the Committee on Homeland Security and \n     Governmental Affairs and the Committee on Commerce, Science \n     and Transportation of the Senate an assessment of the \n     security risk associated with commercially available small \n     and medium sized unmanned aircraft, excluding aircraft over \n     1,300 pounds. Such assessment shall be informed by research \n     conducted in accordance with subsection (a), shall contain \n     recommendations, if applicable, to prevent and mitigate the \n     risk of an unmanned aircraft system attack, and may be \n     developed in coordination with the Centers of Excellence of \n     the Department of Homeland Security and other academic \n     institutions.\n       (d) Prohibition on New Funding.--No funds are authorized to \n     be appropriated to carry out this Act. This Act shall be \n     carried out using amounts appropriated or otherwise made \n     available for such purposes.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Loudermilk) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. \nWatson Coleman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude any extraneous materials on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 1646.\n  The rapid increase of commercially available small-and medium-sized \nunmanned aerial systems, or UAS, most often referred to as drones, \nposes an emerging security threat. This is further evidenced by recent \nhigh-profile events at the White House, French nuclear power plants, \nand numerous airports and sports venues. Drones have been a part of \nfoiled terrorist plots, used to smuggle drugs across our borders, and \nthe negligent use of this technology presents a public safety risk.\n  During this Congress, bills have been introduced that focus on topics \nsuch as the commercial uses of drones and the privacy concerns \nassociated with their use. However, nobody has tackled the security \nimplications of expanding the use of drones. H.R. 1646, the Homeland \nSecurity Drone Assessment and Analysis Act, requires the Secretary of \nHomeland Security to research how commercially available small- and \nmedium-sized drones could be used in an attack and to develop policies, \nguidance, and protocols for the Department of Homeland Security to \nprevent an attack.\n  By the end of fiscal year 2015, the Federal Aviation Administration \nis expected to establish new rules to remove the waiver requirement and \nallow the operation of drones for nonrecreational purposes in U.S. \nairspace. Undoubtedly, these regulations would be better informed by a \nDHS assessment of the potential security risks associated with the \nexpanded use of small- and medium-sized drones. H.R. 1646 is a good \nfirst step towards protecting the country and the American people from \nthis emerging threat.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Transportation and \n           Infrastructure, Washington, DC, June 9, 2015.\n     Hon. Michael T. McCaul\n     Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman McCaul: I write concerning H.R. 1646, the \n     Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act. This \n     legislation includes matters that fall within the Rule X \n     jurisdiction of the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure.\n       In order to expedite floor consideration of H.R. 1646, the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure will forgo \n     action on this bill. However, this is conditional on our \n     mutual understanding that forgoing consideration of the bill \n     does not prejudice the Committee with respect to the \n     appointment of conferees or to any future jurisdictional \n     claim over the subject matters contained in the bill or \n     similar legislation that fall within the Committee's Rule X \n     jurisdiction. In addition, the bill's sponsor and the \n     Committee on Homeland Security have agreed to include two \n     changes to the bill in a Manager's Amendment on the House \n     Floor. Finally, I request you urge the Speaker to name \n     members of the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure \n     to any conference committee named to consider H.R. 1646.\n       Please place a copy of this letter and your response \n     acknowledging our jurisdictional interest into the \n     Congressional Record during consideration of the measure on \n     the House floor.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bill Shuster,\n                                                         Chairman.\n                                  ____\n                                  \n                                          House of Representatives\n\n\n                               Committee on Homeland Security,\n\n                                    Washington, DC, June 10, 2015.\n     Hon. Bill Shuster,\n     Chairman, Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Shuster, Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 1646, the ``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and \n     Analysis Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives, and \n     accordingly, understand that the Committee on Transportation \n     and Infrastructure will forego further action on the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill \n     at this time, the Committee on Transportation and \n     Infrastructure does not waive any jurisdiction over the \n     subject matter contained in this bill or similar legislation \n     in the future. In addition, should a conference on this bill \n     be necessary, I would support your request to have the \n     Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure represented on \n     the conference committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the report on the \n     bill and in the Congressional Record during consideration of \n     this bill on the house floor. I thank you for your \n     cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                         Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the Homeland Security Drone \nAssessment and Analysis Act, and in support of the House's adoption of \nH.R. 1646. I introduced this legislation in response to testimony that \nwe received in committee this past March on gaps in our\n\n[[Page H4570]]\n\nunderstanding of the security implications of unmanned aerial systems, \nUAS, in domestic airspace.\n  For example, off-the-shelf systems widely available today, in the \nwrong hands, can jam transmitted signals, take surveillance imagery, \nand carry dangerous weapons. Given these systems' capabilities, it is \nimportant that there be a comprehensive study of the security risks and \nplans to address them.\n  To that end, H.R. 1646 directs the Department of Homeland Security to \nresearch how a commercially available small- and medium-sized drone \ncould be used to perpetrate an attack, and to develop policies, \nguidance, and protocols to prevent such an attack or mitigate the risk \nof such an attack.\n  As amended in committee, my legislation directs DHS to work with the \nU.S. Departments of Transportation and Energy and the Nuclear \nRegulatory Commission to carry out this research, and allows for DHS to \nshare advice and information based on that research with these key \nFederal partners.\n  Mr. Speaker, drone technology holds great promise, with significant \nsocial and economic benefits not yet fully realized. However, given the \nrapid growth in the domestic drone market, it is important that we \nidentify and have strategies to mitigate the associated security risk.\n  If enacted, H.R. 1646 will enhance our Nation's security while, at \nthe same time, clarifying the framework for Americans' legitimate \ninterest in producing and using drones lawfully and safely.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this legislation, H.R. \n1646, to further the Department of Homeland Security's efforts to work \nwith other agencies on the security risks of small- and medium-sized \ndrones in domestic airspace.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LOUDERMILK. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues to \nsupport this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1646, the \n``Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation because it addresses the \npotential terrorist threat posed by small and medium-sized drones \nthroughout our country.\n  I thank my colleague, Congresswoman Watson Coleman of New Jersey, for \nintroducing this thoughtful and necessary legislation that will assist \nthe Department of Homeland Security.\n  The Homeland Security Drone Assessment and Analysis Act would require \nthe Department of Homeland Security to research how commercially \navailable small and medium-sized drones could be used to perpetrate an \nattack.\n  Agencies will be tasked with the responsibility of taking the lead \nfor developing effective policies and guidance along with the proper \nprotocols which will assist in preventing an attack perpetrated with a \ndrone.\n  Information regarding how to properly respond to the potential \nthreats from these drones will be distributed to state and local law \nenforcement agencies to allow them to develop approaches to mitigate \nidentified threats.\n  The protocols that will be developed as a result of this legislation \nwill assist every level of law enforcement in coordinated responses to \na drone related emergency.\n  Recent news reports of small drones crashing in areas such as on the \nWhite House lawn and incidents including near misses with commercial \naircraft demonstrate the need for this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, one of the most important things that can and must \ncontinue to be done is to protect our homeland from evolving threats.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is why I join my colleagues in working to \nstrengthen the laws that allow the Department of Homeland Security to \ncreate policies that will address emergency protocol threats such as \nthe proliferation of commercial use of drones.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting passage of H.R. \n1646.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Loudermilk) that the House suspend the \nrules and pass the bill, H. R. 1646, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  The title of the bill was amended so as to read: A bill to require \nthe Secretary of Homeland Security to research how certain commercially \navailable small and medium sized unmanned aircraft systems could be \nused in an attack, how to prevent or mitigate the risk of such an \nattack, and for other purposes.''.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4570-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4570-H4572]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    DHS FOIA EFFICIENCY ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter) and the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson \nColeman) each will control 20 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Georgia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include any extraneous materials on the bill under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615.\n  In November of 2014, it was reported that DHS had received and \nprocessed the most FOIA requests out of any Federal department. It \nholds the largest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal \nagency. In fact, since 2010, DHS FOIA requests have increased by over \n65 percent, and DHS currently holds almost half of all Federal FOIA \nrequests of any government agency--about 50,000 of 95,000 requests.\n  In addition, 3 weeks ago, I was informed that the increase in DHS \nFOIA requests was partly due to requests for immigration records for \npeople requesting information for their future deferred action cases. \nMy bill, H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015, streamlines \nthe process to address the tremendous workload and backlog and bring \ntransparency to the cost of FOIA requests to the Department.\n  In the recent past, DHS has received poor evaluations regarding its \nefficiency in handling FOIA requests. For these reasons, my bill \ndirects the chief FOIA officer of DHS to work with other officers \nwithin the Department to update their capabilities in handling the \nlarge amount of FOIA requests and identify the total annual costs \nassociated with processing these requests.\n  By updating their capabilities and reporting to Congress on how the \nDepartment is addressing their poor performance, my bill will direct \nthe Department to address its backlog and inefficiencies in an \nappropriate and quick manner.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 1615, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation, which was unanimously approved by the \ncommittee on May 20, seeks to improve the Department's processing of \nFreedom of Information Act requests.\n  In November 2014, the Comptroller General reported that DHS faces the \nlargest backlog of unprocessed FOIA requests of any Federal agency. \nWhile resource challenges and inefficiencies in DHS' internal processes \nhelp explain in part the backlog, we must not be complacent and accept \nthese challenges as excuses for the backlog.\n  A cornerstone of our democracy is that the government is accountable \nto its citizens. The FOIA process is a key mechanism to ensure \naccountability. I am pleased that the approach taken under this bill is \nconsistent with the Department's unity of effort initiative.\n  Specifically, H.R. 1615 requires that the Department's chief FOIA \nofficer collaborate with FOIA officials in component agencies to track \nthe total annual costs associated with processing FOIA requests, \nidentify and adopt cost-savings measures, and strategize on addressing \nthe backlog.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would also note that in committee, measures authored \nby Democratic members to promote automation and address staffing \nresources were adopted with bipartisan support.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage of H.R. 1615, a bipartisan bill that \nseeks to improve the responsiveness of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to the American public, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers, and I \nreserve the balance of my time\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, timely compliance with FOIA requests is imperative to an \nopen government. The DHS FOIA backlog has existed for too long and \nneeds to be addressed.\n  I thank Representative Carter and Chairman McCaul for their \nbipartisan efforts on the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act, which marks an \nimportant first step in addressing this FOIA backlog and promoting \ngreater automation in the processing of requests.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, once again, I urge my colleagues \nto support this strong, bipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield \nback the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Judiciary and \nHomeland Security Committees, and I rise in strong support of H.R. \n1615, the ``DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation, which addresses DHS' FOIA \nbacklog by requiring the department's chief FOIA officer to issue \nupdated regulations on obtaining records under the Act.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 1615 incorporates two key Jackson Lee \namendments offered during the committee markup of the bill.\n  In 2014, DHS had 67,097 FOIA requests that carried over from 2013; \nadded 291,242 requests; and processed 238,031 FOIA requests.\n  The agency still had 120,308 FOIA requests that were carried over \ninto 2015.\n  Because FOIA is a critical component of creating our nation's open \nand transparent government, the process of citizens getting access to \ninformation regarding government matters of personal or public interest \nis important.\n  DHS's ability to meet public demands for information through FOIA \nshould not be hampered by a lack of technology.\n  One of the Jackson Lee Amendments included in the bill directs that \nthe agency include information on how to adopt automated processing to \nmeet FOIA obligations triggered by agency: Public Notices published in \nthe Federal Register; Final rules; decisions, outcome of adjudicated \nmatters or other agency actions; and obligations to reply to citizen \nFOIA request.\n  Another Jackson Lee Amendment included in H.R. 1615 directs that a \nreport be drafted that provides an assessment of DHS progress made \ntoward automating the FOIA process.\n  That Jackson Lee amendment also provides that upon completion of the \nFOIA automation plan that the Chief FOIA officer provides the plan to \nthe heads of the components of the Department.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is true as Justice Brandeis famously observed that \n``sunshine is the best disinfectant.''\n  He was speaking of the power of knowledge to illuminate and to \nenhance the ability of people to understand and evaluate government \nactions when presented with information.\n  I agree with Justice Brandeis that ``the most important political \noffice is that of the private citizen.''\n  I support H.R. 1615 and urge my colleagues to join me in voting for \nits passage.\n\n[[Page H4572]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626.\n  Call me crazy, but it just doesn't make sense to me to have Federal \nagencies using multiple IT systems that do the same thing. As chairman \nof the Oversight and Government Reform Information Technology \nSubcommittee and a member of the Homeland Security Committee, I see \nthese cost overruns and hear stories of duplicative systems on a daily \nbasis. It is a ridiculous and outrageous waste of taxpayer dollars.\n  This year, the GAO's annual High Risk report designated information \ntechnology as a new area of high risk within the government. Federal \nagencies spend nearly $80 billion a year on IT projects, and nearly 80 \npercent of them are on outdated and legacy systems. In the Department \nof Homeland Security, there are more than 600 IT systems in FEMA alone.\n  The DHS IT Duplication Reduction Act is designed to change that. My \nbill requires the DHS Chief Information Officer to identify all IT \nsystems in the Department, figure out which ones are redundant, and \nthen come up with a strategy to reduce their number.\n  Mr. Speaker, when I was building a cybersecurity firm in the private \nsector, things like this didn't happen because there is no way that a \nsmall business trying to grow would ever waste their money like this.\n  Washington should have the same mentality, especially since this \nmoney being wasted isn't Washington's in the first place. I believe \nWashington can and should be much better stewards of the dollars \ntaxpayers have entrusted to them. It is past time to change the ``it is \nnot my money, so let's spend it'' culture here in Washington that leads \nto this kind of waste.\n  Taxpayers should be able to trust that every dollar is being used \ncarefully and thoughtfully on effective and efficient government that \nworks for them. I believe this legislation is a good start in reining \nin Federal IT spending and getting our government back on track.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1626, the DHS IT \nDuplication Reduction Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 1626 seeks to address duplication or fragmentation \nwithin the Department of Homeland Security's information technology \nsystems. Specifically, H.R. 1626 requires the Department's Chief \nInformation Officer to report on the number of IT systems throughout \nthe Department and identify and address those areas where duplication \nor fragmentation may exist.\n  This undertaking at the headquarters level should help inform the \nDepartment's IT budget planning which, in light of sequestration and \nthe downward trend of the Department's budget, becomes all the more \nimportant when considered in the critical missions entrusted to DHS.\n  This legislation is in the spirit of the Department's Unity of Effort \ninitiative and has the potential of fostering more coordinated IT \nplanning and management among the Department's components. In \ncommittee, a number of technical refinements authored by Democrats were \naccepted to ensure that reducing redundancy frees up resources for DHS' \noperations.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do urge support for this measure, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, in closing, I, once again, want to point out the \nbipartisan efforts in regards to this measure. This measure has the \npotential of fostering more coordinated IT planning and management \namong the Department's components.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge passage and support of this measure.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HURD of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member \nThompson, Congresswoman Watson Coleman, and my colleagues on the \nHomeland Security Committee for their support on this bill.\n  I, once again, urge all my colleagues to support this strong, \nbipartisan piece of legislation, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Texas?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong support of H.R. 1637, the \nFederally Funded Research and Development Sunshine Act of 2015.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am honored to represent 700,000 north and east Texans. \nThey have sent me here to Washington to pull the curtain back and shine \na light into this Federal bureaucracy.\n  Mr. Speaker, we all know that Federal agencies can be inefficient, \nineffective, and resistant to oversight. They don't like to be held \naccountable, not by the American people or by individuals like me who \nare elected to represent those folks here in Congress.\n  As a committed conservative who is fighting to secure the American \nhomeland, I believe that increased transparency is a national security \nissue, and because of that, every taxpayer dollar that we spend must be \nscrutinized.\n  We have to evaluate the government's programs and activities to see \nif they are worthwhile and to craft reforms that eliminate waste and \nbolster our national defense. A sluggish national security apparatus \nsimply won't suffice. The American people deserve more.\n  Congress can't even begin to conduct effective oversight and cut \nwaste, fraud, and abuse if we don't know what is going on behind closed \ndoors. That is why I introduced H.R. 1637. This bill will increase \ntransparency at the Department of Homeland Security by directing the \nSecretary to give Congress a detailed account each year of the ongoing \nand completed projects that federally funded research and development \ncenters, or FFRDCs, within the Department of Homeland Security have \nbeen assigned.\n  FFRDCs conduct specialized research and development for the Federal \nGovernment. The two FFRDCs within the Department of Homeland Security \nprovide independent analysis of homeland security issues. Currently, \nthe Homeland Security Committee is expected to oversee these FFRDCs; \nyet the committee doesn't even receive an account of the status of \nongoing or completed projects. It is hard to be a vigilant steward of \nhard-earned taxpayer dollars when you have a blindfold on.\n  My legislation will enable the committee to have visibility into the \nscope of FFRDC projects that the DHS has tasked them to meet their \nmission needs. This detailed accounting will allow committee members to \nhave insight into current research and development projects and be able \nto further scrutinize them, thereby increasing oversight and \ntransparency of the entire Science and Technology Directorate operation \nat DHS.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that Congress is aware of the Department \nof Homeland Security's research and development efforts and funding \npriorities to ensure that it is meeting the mission needs of its \ncomponents, and this bill today will shed light on those activities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to support this commonsense bill. I \nthink that we all agree that we can support increased transparency and \na stronger, more secure homeland.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n         House of Representatives, Committee on Science, Space, \n           and Technology,\n                                    Washington, DC, June 23, 2015.\n     Hon.

Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume, and I rise in strong support of H.R. 1637, the Federally \nFunded Research and Development Act of 2015, and.\n  Mr. Speaker, this legislation would require the Department of \nHomeland Security to prepare annual status reports on the research \nactivities of federally funded research and development centers, or \nFFRDCs, on behalf of the Department.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  DHS looks to these institutions that are largely operated by \nuniversities and not-for-profit organizations to help meet special \nlong-term research and development needs.\n  In addition to the two FFRDCs that DHS sponsors, there are 17 \nnational labs managed by the Department of Energy that provide research \nand technical assistance in support of the Nation's homeland security.\n  Among the areas of research expertise offered by these labs are \ncritical\n\n[[Page H4574]]\n\ninfrastructure protection; cybersecurity; chemical, biological, and \nnuclear forensics; biodefense countermeasures; biodetection; and \nemergency preparedness.\n  I believe that timely and regular information about how DHS is \nutilizing these institutions is important to assessing progress on a \nwide range of homeland security challenges. That is why I support H.R. \n1631 and urge passage.\n  I want to commend members of the Homeland Security Committee on the \nbipartisan nature in which this legislation has been crafted.

Lamar Smith,\n     Chairman, Committee on Science, Space, and Technology, \n         Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Smith: Thank you for your letter regarding \n     H.R. 2390, the ``Homeland Security University-based Centers \n     Review Act.'' I appreciate your support in bringing this \n     legislation before the House of Representatives, and \n     accordingly, understand that the Committee on Science, Space, \n     and Technology will forego further action on the bill.\n       The Committee on Homeland Security concurs with the mutual \n     understanding that by foregoing further action on this bill \n     at this time, the Committee on Science, Space, and Technology \n     does not waive any jurisdiction over the subject matter \n     contained in this bill or similar legislation in the future. \n     In addition, should a conference on this bill be necessary, I \n     would support your request to have the Committee on Science, \n     Space, and Technology represented on the conference \n     committee.\n       I will insert copies of this exchange in the Congressional \n     Record during consideration of this bill on the House floor. \n     I thank you for your cooperation in this matter.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Michael T. McCaul,\n                         Chairman, Committee on Homeland Security.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2390, the Homeland \nSecurity University-based Centers Review Act.\n  I introduced H.R. 2390, the Homeland Security University-based \nCenters Review Act, with my colleague Mr. Richmond, to provide Congress \nwith the full picture of the Department's management of the Centers of \nExcellence program.\n  This program dates back to the Department's earliest days. It was \nauthorized in the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to be ``a coordinated, \nuniversity-based system to enhance the Nation's homeland security.'' \nSince that time, however, we have not had a comprehensive review of the \nDepartment's management of this vital research and development program.\n  H.R. 2390 marks the most significant effort to assess the Centers of \nExcellence program to date. The measure directs the Government \nAccountability Office to issue a comprehensive report that, among other \nthings, evaluates how the Department aligns decisions about \nestablishing, maintaining, or eliminating a center with its research \nneeds; how DHS identifies, prioritizes, and funds projects; and how DHS \nmeasures progress on its research goals.\n  The bill also directs GAO to examine how DHS promotes collaboration \namong the centers, as well as with institutions outside of the network, \nincluding Historically Black Colleges and Universities and other \nminority-serving institutions.\n  I have the privilege of representing Jackson State University, which \nis part of the Department's Coastal Resilience Center of Excellence \nprogram. I am proud that in its capacity, Jackson State has contributed \nresearch and modeling that informed realtime operational decisions at \nthe Coast Guard and FEMA in the wake of Hurricane Sandy and other \ndisasters.\n  I know that throughout this country, there are other institutions \nthat could benefit from and bring unique knowledge and expertise to \nDHS' ten standing Centers of Excellence.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Homeland Security Committee has been involved in \nvigorous oversight of the Centers of Excellence, particularly \nencouraging the Department to adopt policies that help diversify \nuniversity and student participation in the homeland security \nenterprise.\n  In my opinion, the DHS Science and Technology Directorate's robust \noutreach effort to universities and institutions of recent years is \nthat direct result of our oversight, but we need to understand whether \nS's outreach, along with its effort to better manage the Centers of \nExcellence, are really working.\n  H.R. 2390 is an important first step in effectively assessing the \nvalue of the Centers of Excellence and evaluating whether or not the \nresearch and development potential of our Nation's universities are \nbeing effectively leveraged.\n  Mr. Speaker, again, I am grateful for the cooperation of the \nsubcommittee chairman, Mr. Ratcliffe, and the full committee chairman, \nMr. McCaul, for their help to improve the Department's Centers of \nExcellence; and I urge passage of this legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman McCaul and Ranking Member Thompson for \ntheir leadership on this bill.\n  I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bill. It is a \nstrong bipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2390 ``Homeland \nSecurity University-based Centers Review Act.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation which requires an annual report \nbe sent to Congress to assess the university-based centers for homeland \nsecurity program and provide recommendations for appropriate \nimprovements.\n  Mr. Speaker, the research that our designated institutions conduct is \nimperative to the current progress and future success of protecting our \nnation's greatest asset, the American people.\n   I join my colleagues in working to safeguard our investment by \nrequiting annual reports that give detailed reviews of how our funding \nis being spent and more effective ways we can use the information \nyielded from these studies in a real world applicable way.\n  This bill requires a review of the Department of Homeland Security's \n(DHS) efforts to identify key areas of study needed to support the \nhomeland security mission, and criteria that the Department utilized to \ndetermine those key areas for which the Department should maintain, \nestablish, or eliminate university-based centers.\n  DHS's mission is to ensure a homeland that is safe, secure, and \nresilient against terrorism and other hazards.\n  H.R. 2390 supports that mission by overseeing the funding of a \nuniversity-based research program that invests in the homeland \nsecurity, science and technology of the DHS.\n  It is imperative that we have oversight of how the funds are being \nused to meet DHS's university program criteria and this bill requires a \nreview of how university-based research is identified, prioritized, and \nfunded.\n  The Centers of Excellence (COE) network is an extended consortium of \nhundreds of universities conducting groundbreaking research to address \nhomeland security challenges.\n  Sponsored by the Office of University Programs, the COEs work closely \nwith the homeland security community to develop customer-driven, \ninnovative tools and technologies to solve real-world challenges.\n  The Institute for Infectious Animal Diseases (IIAD) and Texas A \nEngineering Experiment Station, have used this program to develop a \nmobile Certificate of Veterinary Inspection (CVI) application to \nsupport veterinary practitioners submitting animal health certificate \nrecords from the field.\n  This real-time information sharing is an alternative to email or web-\nbased systems, and helps improve communication between veterinarians \nand state animal health offices by supporting certificate submission \nfrom the field.\n  The Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act requires a \nreview of the Department of Homeland Security's criteria and metrics to \nmeasure demonstrable progress achieved by university-based centers in \nfulfilling Department taskings, and mechanisms for delivering and \ndisseminating the research results of designated university-based \ncenters within the Department and to other Federal, State, and local \nagencies.\n  Mr. Speaker, because these funds are used to enrich our future \ngenerations of leaders and\n\n[[Page H4576]]\n\nit is important that the different university-based centers reach out \nand collaborate among a diverse array of academic institutions, \nparticularly with historically Black colleges and universities (HBCU) \nand minority serving institutions.\n  I applaud Rankin Member Thompson for including specific language that \nreaches out to diverse universities, specifically often overshadowed \nhistorically Black colleges and universities.\n  HBCU such as Texas Southern University, in my Congressional district, \nis preparing technically savvy Homeland Security professionals for \nMaritime Transportation Security.\n  All educational institutions who meet criteria should be eligible to \nparticipate in the Department of Homeland Security's University \nProgram.\n  This bill supports the program's mission needs of building a stable \ncommunity of homeland security researchers and educators at U.S. \ncolleges and universities.\n  Fostering a homeland security culture within the academic community \nthrough research and educational programs is a great partnership \nbetween government and our education institutions.\n  Strengthening U.S. scientific leadership in homeland security \nresearch and education giving our students a competitive ranking on a \nglobal level.\n  Generating and disseminating knowledge and technical advances to \nadvance the homeland security mission helps to recruit future partners \nand participants.\n  Integrating homeland security activities across agencies engaged in \nrelevant academic research will help partners work in concert to \ndevelop critical technologies and analyses to secure the nation's \nsecurity interest.\n  The Department of Homeland Security's Science and Technology Centers \nof Excellence develop multidisciplinary, customer-driven, homeland \nsecurity science and technology solutions and help train the next \ngeneration of homeland security experts.\n  The Homeland Security University-based Centers Review Act regulates \nthe institutions designated with this distinguished honor of training \nthe next generation of leaders in the scientific and technological \nfields.\n  Raising the visibility and status of the government sponsored \nprograms creates an environment where each institution has to take \nresponsibility for the use of their funds and prove those uses \nfurthered the mission needs of DHS.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to support this bipartisan bill and strongly \nurge all of my colleagues to join me in supporting H.R. 2390.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentleman from Texas (Mr. Ratcliffe) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2390, as amended.\n  The question was taken; and (two-thirds being in the affirmative) the \nrules were suspended and the bill, as amended, was passed.\n  A motion to reconsider was laid on the table.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4576-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4576-H4578]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n         CBRN INTELLIGENCE AND INFORMATION SHARING ACT OF 2015\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, as the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's \nSubcommittee on Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I \nrise today in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and \nInformation Sharing Act of 2015.\n  We know that terrorists have long strived to employ chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and nuclear--or CBRN--materials in their \nattacks. ISIS and other terror organizations have attempted to use \nchemical weapons, and experts suggest that terrorist interest in \nutilizing chemical agents has increased. In fact, reports indicate that \nISIS may be currently using chemical weapons in Syria and Iraq.\n  Since the procedures and equipment required to develop biological \nweapons are the same as those used for legitimate research purposes and \nare readily available, it is imperative that intelligence information \nrelated to bio threats is appropriately analyzed and shared with those \nwho would be on the front lines of response in the event of a \nbiological attack.\n  Furthermore, events such as the Boston Marathon bombing in 2013 \nillustrated the need for better information sharing between Federal and \nlocal officials.\n  H.R. 2200 will enhance intelligence analysis and information sharing \nto fill this need and will work to ensure that State and local \nofficials get the actionable intelligence information necessary to stop \nor mitigate a CBRN attack.\n  This legislation considers information garnered from the Subcommittee \non Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications hearings on the \nthreat of chemical and biological terrorism. During two hearings \nearlier this year, we heard from numerous stakeholders that information \nsharing with appropriate State and local officials and emergency \nresponse providers about these threats is critical.\n  Specifically, this budget neutral bill requires the Office of \nIntelligence and Analysis at DHS to support homeland security focused \nintelligence analysis of CBRN threats, including emerging infectious \ndiseases, working in coordination with the Department's National \nBiosurveillance Integration Center and the intelligence community.\n  As information and intelligence is only useful if it is shared with \nthose who can take action, such as State, local, tribal, and private \nentities, H.R. 2200 directs the Office of Intelligence and Analysis to \nnot only share information with these partners, but also engage with \nthem and get their feedback on mechanisms for two-way sharing of \ninformation.\n  Finally, H.R. 2200 directs the Secretary of DHS to report annually \nfor 5 years on the Department's intelligence and information sharing \nactivities to counter the threat from weapons of mass destruction and \nDHS's activities in accordance with relevant intelligence strategies.\n  The House passed nearly identical bills during the 112th and 113th \nCongresses with bipartisan support.\n  I urge Members to join me in supporting this bill, and I reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN Intelligence and \nInformation Sharing Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, in the years following the September 11 attacks, \nCongress worked to address many of the preparedness gaps identified by \nthe 9/11 Commission, including the threat posed by weapons of mass \ndestruction. Pursuant to the 9/11 Commission's recommendations, \nCongress established the Weapons of Mass Destruction, or WMD \nCommission.\n  In 2008, the WMD Commission issued a series of recommendations to \ncounter the proliferation of WMDs and build a more robust national \ncapability to respond to such attacks.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Subsequently, the WMD Commission and its legacy organization, the WMD \nCenter, issued a series of report cards evaluating the Federal \nGovernment's progress in implementing the WMD Commission's \nrecommendations. Unfortunately, each report card found that the Federal \nGovernment was not acting quickly enough.\n  In the years since the WMD Center issued its final bio-response \nreport card in 2011, WMD threats have continued to evolve. What we know \nnow is that the threats posed by WMDs are more dynamic and that our \nenemies are growing more agile. H.R. 2200 focuses on an important \naspect of our Nation's ability to prevent, to prepare for, and to \nrespond to a WMD attack--information sharing.\n  At the full committee and subcommittee levels, the Committee on \nHomeland Security has devoted significant time and resources to \nassessing Federal activities to address the threat of WMDs. I have \nheard one message consistently from the witnesses who have come before \nus: we need to improve coordination and information sharing with State \nand local governments and emergency responders. Situational awareness \nis essential to ensuring a robust response to a CBRN incident and to \nsaving lives; and I appreciate Emergency Preparedness, Response, and \nCommunications Subcommittee Chairwoman McSally's efforts to improve \nCBRN threat-related intelligence and information sharing.\n  If we learned anything from the 9/11 attacks, it is that information \nsharing saves lives. From putting desperate pieces of information \ntogether, to stopping an attack, to ensuring that first responders are \nequipped to respond safely and effectively, information sharing plays \nan essential role in complete situational awareness. H.R. 2200 will \nimprove the way we use information related to evolving threats posed by \nchemical, biological, nuclear, and radiological agents. I urge my \ncolleagues to support H.R. 2200.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I, once again, urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \nlegislation that will enhance the sharing of CBRN-related threat \ninformation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 2200, the CBRN \nIntelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.\n  I would like to begin by thanking my colleague, Martha McSally, for \nher work on this important bill.\n  This bipartisan piece of legislation would direct the Department of \nHomeland Security to analyze terrorist intentions with respect to \nchemical, biological, radiological and nuclear material, and share this \ninformation with state, local and federal entities.\n  The bill includes my amendment, which was accepted in Committee, to \nrequire DHS to assess the specific risks presented by transporting \nthese materials, addressing a key concern in Western New York.\n  The Department of Energy plans to begin shipping highly-enriched \nuranium liquid from Canada to South Carolina next year. This material, \nwhich is far more radioactive than spent nuclear fuel, would be shipped \nin casks that have never been certified to carry highly-enriched \nuranium liquid.\n  The Department proposes to transport this waste across the Northern \nBorder at the Peace Bridge, the second busiest crossing for cargo and \nthe busiest crossing for passengers on the Northern Border.\n  The Peace Bridge crosses the Niagara River which connects two Great \nLakes, the contamination of which could endanger the world's largest \nfresh water supply.\n  The nuclear casks would then proceed from the Peace Bridge through \ndowntown Buffalo, a high-density urban area.\n  The Department of Energy approved this route nearly twenty years ago, \nand it reflects the pre-nine-eleven mindset on the threat and \nconsequences of terrorism.\n  The legislation before us today would allow the Department of Energy \nto reconsider the wisdom of transporting dangerously radioactive \nmaterial through high-risk areas like Buffalo.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague, Martha McSally, for her work and \nleadership on this issue and urge passage of this bill.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as a senior member of the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I rise in strong support of H.R. 2200, the ``CBRN \nIntelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.''\n  I support this bipartisan legislation which amends the Homeland \nSecurity Act of 2002 to direct the Office of Intelligence and Analysis \nof the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to: (1) support homeland \nsecurity-focused intelligence analysis of terrorist actors, their \nclaims, and their plans to conduct attacks involving chemical, \nbiological, radiological, and\n\n[[Page H4578]]\n\nnuclear materials against the nation and of global infectious disease, \npublic health, food, agricultural, and veterinary issues; (2) support \nhomeland security-focused risk analysis and risk assessments of such \nhomeland security hazards by providing relevant quantitative and no \nquantitative threat information; (3) leverage homeland security \nintelligence capabilities and structures to enhance prevention, \nprotection, response, and recovery efforts with respect to a chemical, \nbiological, radiological, or nuclear attack; and (4) share information \nand provide tailored analytical support on these threats to state, \nlocal, and tribal authorities as well as other national biosecurity and \nbiodefense stakeholders.\n  I am pleased that H.R. 2200 incorporates an amendment by \nCongresswoman McSally that directs the department to establish \nchemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear (CBRN) intelligence and \ninformation sharing functions of the Office of Intelligence and \nAnalysis of the Department of Homeland Security and to require \ndissemination of information analyzed by the Department to entities \nwith responsibilities relating to homeland security.\n  The Nation's chemical facilities represent a terrorist target that \nmust be protected.\n  It is my hope that this bill will improve upon current legislation \nauthorizing the Department of Homeland Security to regulate security \npractices at the Nation's chemical facilities.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is clear that we must equip ourselves to be able to \ndetect attacks of a CBRN nature.\n  H.R. 2200 ensures a standardized communication platform for need to \nknow industries dealing with such sensitive information.\n  There is no room for error when it comes to our nation's security.\n  I urge all of my colleagues to join me in voting to pass, H.R. 2200, \nthe ``CBRN Intelligence and Information Sharing Act of 2015.''\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. McSally) that the House suspend the rules \nand pass the bill, H.R. 2200, as amended.\n  The question was taken.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. In the opinion of the Chair, two-thirds \nbeing in the affirmative, the ayes have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, further \nproceedings on this motion will be postponed.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4578-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4578-H4579]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY INTEROPERABLE COMMUNICATIONS ACT\n\n  Ms. McSALLY.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nhave 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their remarks \nand to include any extraneous material on the bill under consideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Arizona?\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  As the chairman of the Committee on Homeland Security's Subcommittee \non Emergency Preparedness, Response, and Communications, I rise today \nin support of H.R. 615, the Department of Homeland Security \nInteroperable Communications Act, of which I am proud\n\n[[Page H4579]]\n\nto be a cosponsor. This bill was introduced by the gentleman from New \nJersey, the subcommittee's ranking member, Mr. Payne.\n  The bill amends the Homeland Security Act of 2002 to include, among \nthe responsibilities of the Department of Homeland Security's Under \nSecretary for Management, achieving and maintaining interoperable \ncommunications among the Department's components.\n  H.R. 615 addresses the findings and recommendations of a November \n2012 DHS Office of Inspector General report, which stated that the \nDepartment does not have the appropriate oversight or governance \nstructure to ensure communications interoperability among its \ncomponents. It is vital that the Department's components are able to \neffectively communicate day to day and, most importantly, during \nemergencies.\n  In response to the findings of this inspector general's report, I \njoined Chairman McCaul and Oversight and Management Efficiency \nSubcommittee Chairman Perry in requesting a review of this issue by the \nGovernment Accountability Office. Their report, which was released in \nMarch, found that nearly 3 years after the inspector general's report, \ncommunications problems persist in the Department and among its \ncomponents. In particular, Customs and Border Protection and \nImmigration and Customs Enforcement personnel reported to the GAO that \nthe lack of interoperability in some cases along the border resulted in \nmissed apprehensions and jeopardized agent safety.\n  My district is on the southwest border. I know the challenges our \nBorder Patrol agents, CBP officers, and ICE agents face in meeting \ntheir vital missions. It is unacceptable that they lack the tools and \ntraining necessary to communicate with each other. This bill seeks to \nmake this more of a priority at the headquarters level.\n  In order to ensure the Department is taking the necessary steps to \nachieve and maintain interoperable communications capabilities, H.R. \n615 requires the Department's Under Secretary for Management to submit \nan interoperable communications strategy to the Committee on Homeland \nSecurity no later than 180 days after enactment and to periodically \nreport to Congress on efforts to implement this strategy.\n  This bill passed the House in February by a vote of 379-0. I \nappreciate the swift action of the Senate Homeland Security and \nGovernmental Affairs Committee under the leadership of my friend, \nChairman Johnson. Their thoughtful additions have served to further \nimprove this bill. I urge all Members to join me in supporting it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as \nI may consume.\n  I rise in strong support of the Senate amendment to H.R. 615, the \nDepartment of Homeland Security Interoperable Communications Act.\n  In November 2012, the inspector general of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity issued an assessment of the interoperable communications \ncapability among DHS components. The inspector general found that, of \nthe 479 field radios that attempted to communicate on a specific common \nchannel, only one user could do so. That is a 99 percent failure rate.\n  In short, DHS, which is the Federal entity charged with providing \nguidance to State and local governments to improve interoperable \nemergency communications, was not practicing what it preached. The \ninspector general found that DHS' interoperable challenges were not \ntechnological in nature. Rather, they were attributed to the fact that \nthere was no one leading the effort to drive changes in the field. \nFurther, there were no policies in place to ensure that the 123,000 \nradio users at DHS understood how to use the communications equipment \nissued to them.\n  Throughout my tenure on the Committee on Homeland Security, I have \nrepeatedly sought opportunities to drive home the message that \ninteroperable communications are critical to the Homeland Security \nmission at the Federal, State, and local levels.\n  Addressing this fundamental operational challenge is consistent with \nthe DHS Unity of Effort initiative. So it would seem that the timing is \nright for real progress. However, late last month, we learned from the \ninspector general that, nearly 3 years after the issuance of the first \nreport, DHS' components' inability to communicate effectively on the \nDHS common channel persists and that DHS has not completed the \ncorrective actions necessary to resolve the problem. The inspector \ngeneral's most recent findings confirm that it is going to take \ndirecting the Department in law to get this done. That is why I was \nhappy to support Ranking Member Donald Payne, Jr., when he introduced \nthis legislation.\n  H.R. 615 would put DHS components on the path to achieving \ninteroperable communications by directing the Department's Under \nSecretary for Management to develop a strategy to achieve \ninteroperability. The taxpayers have spent $430 million on \ninteroperable communications capabilities at the Department so far. In \nthis austere fiscal climate, we cannot afford to waste more money \ninvesting in communications capabilities when DHS lacks the policies \nthat are sure to be effective.\n  With the help of full committee Chairman McCaul and subcommittee \nChairwoman McSally, the Department of Homeland Security Interoperable \nCommunications Act passed the House unanimously earlier this year. \nSubsequently, our Senate counterparts approved H.R. 615 by unanimous \nconsent with some enhancements. I urge my colleagues to concur with the \nSenate amendment to H.R. 615 and send this bill to the President's \ndesk.\n  The inspector general's report identifying the urgent interoperable \ncommunications problem at DHS came out 3 years ago. A comprehensive \nsolution is long overdue. Unfortunately, the Department has still not \nimplemented appropriate corrective action. I commend subcommittee \nRanking Member Payne for introducing this important legislation and for \nhis efforts to get it enacted into law. I urge my colleagues to concur \nwith the Senate amendment of H.R. 615.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I, once again, urge my colleagues to support H.R. 615, which seeks to \nenhance interoperable communications at the Department of Homeland \nSecurity.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, in just a moment, I will request a moment \nof silence, but before I do, I stand here with other Members of the \nSouth Carolina delegation to say our colleague Jim Clyburn, who right \nnow is back home visiting with aggrieved families on the coast of South \nCarolina, and many of us, like Senator Scott and others, will be going \nback during this week to visit with those same families.\n  I am joined as well by members of the Congressional Black Caucus and \nMembers of this body who have been deeply shaken by the events of this \nlast week in Charleston, South Carolina.\n  I rise with this group on behalf of the nine families who have been \nimpacted back home, on behalf of the people of the First District of \nSouth Carolina, and on behalf of the people of South Carolina who have \nshown a whole lot of heart and a whole lot of love here over the last \nweek.\n  I say this because, less than a week ago, as we all know, a young man \nwith incomprehensible malice came into the Mother Emanuel AME Church on \nCalhoun Street in Charleston, South Carolina, and did the unthinkable \nas he joined a Bible study and he gunned down nine of the members, the \nparishioners, there in the church.\n  Fortunately, our story doesn't end there because the family members \nof the victims also did the unthinkable. I say that because there, at \nthe bond hearing, they did the unimaginable, the incomprehensible in, I \nguess, showing human grace is a reflection of God's grace and what is \ntalked about in Romans in not repaying evil with evil, but repaying \nevil with good because, at the bond hearing, the first family comes up, \nand they say: ``I am in incomprehensible pain, but I forgive you.''\n  The next family comes up: ``I am in incredible pain, but I forgive \nyou.'' Those were the words that were repeated by each of the nine \nfamilies: ``I forgive you, I forgive you, and I forgive you.''\n  That set in motion and, if you will, set the stage this last week in \nCharleston for a level of community that I have never before seen in my \nlife and amazing things done at the church and in the community at \nlarge.\n  It is for that reason that we all stand here to remember the names of \nthe nine victims and to pause for a moment of silence here in just a \nmoment.\n  If I might, let me read the names of the victims: Reverend Clementa \nPinckney; Tywanza Sanders; Cynthia Hurd;\n\n[[Page H4581]]\n\nReverend Sharonda Coleman-Singleton; Myra Thompson; Ethel Lance; \nReverend Daniel Simmons, Sr.; Reverend Depayne Middleton-Doctor; and \nSusie Jackson.\n  Would you all join me and join us in a moment of silence.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4581-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4581]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    DOMAIN OPENNESS THROUGH CONTINUED OVERSIGHT MATTERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia).

Mr. Speaker, behind every man and woman in uniform \nserving our country are family members: husbands, wives, mothers, \nfathers, brothers, sisters, sons, daughters, and other family members \nwho make sacrifices as members of military families.\n  Recently, I attended the dedication of a new Minnesota military \nfamily tribute that is now part of the Capitol Mall area in St. Paul at \nour State Capitol. It was built entirely with private donations. It \ncommemorates the military Gold Star families, Blue Star families, and \nfamilies of our veterans. This memorial is the first of its kind in the \ncountry, and it recognizes the military family members that do so much \nto support our servicemen and -women and our veterans.\n  Being a member of a military family comes with many sacrifices. It \nmeans many sleepless nights during deployment. It means unexpected \nmoves around the country and serving as the frontline resource when our \nsoldiers transition into a new life. Every military family does this \nproudly.\n  Mr. Speaker, I commend Bill and Teri Popp and everyone who has worked \nso hard to make this tribute recognizing our military families \npossible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4582-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4582]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   REAUTHORIZE THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of \nreauthorization of the Export-Import Bank before its charter expires on \nJune 30.\n  In fiscal year 2014 alone, the Ex-Im Bank supported $27.4 billion \nworth of U.S. exports, with $10.7 billion of that total representing \nexports from small businesses. Additionally, 90 percent of all Ex-Im \ntransactions directly supported small business and more than 163,000 \nAmerican jobs. That is why 180 Democrats signed a discharge petition to \nforce a vote on this important issue.\n  Despite this data, some Republicans wrongly think the Ex-Im Bank \nrepresents crony capitalism that should be ended. For those Members, I \nwill leave you with this: Men lie, women lie, but numbers don't lie. \nReauthorize the Ex-Im Bank.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4582-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4582-H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      NATURAL GAS VEHICLES SHOULDN'T BE PENALIZED IN THE TAX CODE\n\n  (Mr. YOUNG of Indiana asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to discuss the \nimportance\n\n[[Page H4583]]\n\nof a simple modification to our Tax Code that will greatly support the \nconsumer-driven growth of natural gas in the transportation sector.\n  Today's abundant and domestically produced natural gas is an \nincreasingly important fuel to our transportation sector, from small \npassenger vehicles in my home State of Indiana, to container ships that \ntransport goods from America's heartland to overseas markets.\n  Now, our Tax Code is still taxing cars and trucks that run on natural \ngas at a higher rate than their diesel equivalent because the tax was \ninstituted years ago when our energy picture looked vastly different. \nWe need to correct this disparity. It is a simple fix and just one \nexample of how Congress can create a more level playing field while \ndiversifying our energy mix.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me on this matter.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL\n\n  (Mr. TONKO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, last week Pope Francis echoed the chorus of \n97 percent of climate scientists whose findings prove that climate \nchange is real and is manmade, and climate change has the potential to \ndestroy the only planet that we have. Let me say that again. Climate \nchange is real, it is manmade, and it can reverse all the progress we \nhave made as a nation.\n  Pope Francis frames the reality of climate change in a way that we \nmust consider if we are to protect our environment as directed by our \nCreator for future generations, future economic development, and future \nprogress. The leader of the Catholic Church accurately points out that \nit is a moral imperative to act on climate change; it is a moral \nimperative to act as a good steward of the environment and the gifts we \nhave been given.\n  I thank Pope Francis, and I hope the words he shared last week will \nring true with all of us, including those who continue to deny climate \nchange, both in this body and around the world. I hope the Pope's \nencyclical will encourage deniers to work with us to find creative ways \nto clean up our environment, help create jobs, and make our world just \na little bit better for our kids and grandkids.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          RELIGIOUS CLEANSING\n\n  (Mr. POE of Texas asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, the Roman Empire was notorious in its \nmassacre of Christians 2,000 years ago. Now Christians are once again \nfacing deadly persecution. Barbaric terrorist groups like ISIS are \nstalking and attacking Christians wherever they find them. Christians \nare disappearing, and some are fleeing countries like Syria and Iraq, \nhome to Christians since the days of early Christianity.\n  ISIS boasts of brutally killing and enslaving thousands of \nChristians. There are more and more reports of ISIS sex-trafficking \nyoung girls that are stolen away from their Christian parents. ISIS \neven posts videos online of their barbaric beheading of Christians.\n  Why the hate, kidnapping, and murder? Because Christians will not \nrenounce their Christian faith. The world, and the United States in \nparticular, needs to denounce the murder of people based on their \nreligious beliefs, whether Christians, Jews, or Muslims.\n  We cannot accept nor tolerate ISIS' genocide of Christians. Justice \ndemands ISIS be held accountable for their crimes of religious \ncleansing.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      JUNE IS NATIONAL DAIRY MONTH\n\n  (Mr. VALADAO asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, many of my colleagues on the House floor \ntoday may not know that June is National Dairy Month. As a dairy farmer \nmyself, I believe this month is a perfect opportunity to recognize how \nimportant the dairy industry is to the Central Valley.\n  Not only are there dairy farms in all 50 States, but dairy is the \nnumber one agriculture business in 10 States, including Idaho, New \nYork, and Wisconsin. However, my home State of California is the \nbiggest dairy producer in the country and is responsible for 21.3 \npercent of the U.S. milk supply. My own district, California 21, \nproduces the most dairy of any congressional district in the Nation.\n  However, dairy isn't just important to farmers. Not only do Americans \nconsume at least two cups of dairy products each and every day, but \nAmerica's dairy industry is important to our Nation's agriculture \nmarket and our entire economy.\n  Dairy farms across the country improve our national economy. The U.S. \ndairy industry creates an estimated $140 billion in economic output, \n$29 billion in household earnings, and is responsible for creating more \nthan 900,000 jobs.\n  So this summer when you stop for ice cream on a hot night or a bowl \nof cereal on a rushed morning, remember the hard-working Americans who \nbrought dairy to your grocery store.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1930\n                     CONGRATULATING INGERSOLL RAND\n\n  (Ms. FOXX asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. FOXX. Mr. Speaker, last month, Ingersoll Rand, a global leader in \nproducts that enhance energy efficiency, productivity, and operations \nfor its customers, celebrated the 50th anniversary of its Mocksville, \nNorth Carolina, plant.\n  Opened in 1965, the Mocksville plant began machining rotary \ncomponents for air compressors. Throughout the years, the workers in \nMocksville have manufactured assemblies and components for a number of \nproducts within Ingersoll Rand's portfolio.\n  Within the last 6 years, the plant has experienced tremendous growth \nas select assembly operations for Trane and Thermo King equipment were \nmoved to the plant. During difficult economic times, these jobs have \nstrengthened the local economy.\n  The company's major investment in Davie County is a tribute to the \narea's skilled workforce, men and women who are dedicated to producing \nthe best products in the world.\n  Congratulations to everyone at Ingersoll Rand in Mocksville as you \ncelebrate this significant milestone.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4583]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            CONFEDERATE FLAG\n\n  (Mr. PITTENGER asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in full support of South \nCarolina Governor Nikki Haley's call to remove the Confederate battle \nflag from the South Carolina statehouse grounds, and North Carolina \nGovernor Pat McCrory's call to discontinue State-issued Confederate \nflag license plates.\n  As one who grew up in the South, Mr. Speaker, and a proud North \nCarolinian, I fully understand that to many the Confederate flag \nrepresents history and heritage of their forefathers who fought for \nself-governance of the States. However, I cannot ignore that this same \nflag has also been used as a symbol of hate, and therefore causes \nimmense pain for many of our citizens--yes, our brothers and sisters.\n  In Romans, chapter 14, the Apostle Paul writes, ``Let us therefore \nmake every effort to do what leads to peace and to mutual edification. \nDo not destroy the work of God for the sake of food''--or, might I add, \na flag.\n  Let us be proud of our heritage, and let us give our descendants \nreason to be proud of our proper and thoughtful works today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4583-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4583-H4584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF MICHAEL JAMES SULLIVAN\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, it is with a heavy heart \nthat I rise today to celebrate the life of Michael James Sullivan and \noffer my condolences to his friends and family.\n\n[[Page H4584]]\n\nMichael passed away on June 14, 2015, after an 11-year battle against \nALS, also known as Lou Gehrig's disease.\n  When Michael was diagnosed with ALS in 2004, he was determined not to \nlet the disease control his life. He found hope in his family, friends, \nand faith. This hope encouraged him to become an advocate for the \n30,000 other Americans who live with ALS.\n  Mike encouraged others and their families to be strong and resilient \nin the face of illness. His upbeat and optimistic personality was a \nconstant reminder to take advantage of every opportunity that life \nhands us. He was a frequent visitor to my office. He was a tireless \nself-advocate who remained upbeat, compassionate, and personable--even \nin the face of a horribly debilitating disease.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can all learn from Michael Sullivan's exemplary \nservice, selflessness, and love. He will be greatly missed. His friends \nand family are blessed to have known such an honorable man. In the \nwords of Michael: ``One day together, we can create a world without \nALS.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4584-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4584]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2015\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased that the House showed \nleadership tonight in passing H.R. 1190, Protecting Seniors' Access to \nMedicare Act of 2015.\n  The IPAB board was going to be very problematic for seniors, and H.R. \n1190 is going to be a very important tool in correcting the wrongs of \nthe Affordable Care Act and preserving access to health care. It would \nindeed have had an unelected board making Medicare spending decisions \nwhich, again, would be shifting power to Washington, D.C., and away \nfrom that all-important doctor-patient relationship, where it really \nshould be.\n  We want to talk about savings in the medical field--and we need to--\nbecause not nearly enough is done, whether it was in the Affordable \nCare Act or other conversations around D.C. We need to talk about and \nwork on actually achieving cost cutting, reduction of unnecessary costs \ndelivering health care, litigation, and the time it takes to bring \nmiracle pharmaceuticals to markets.\n  These are the kinds of things that we need to be doing to make health \ncare more affordable and, indeed, more accessible.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4584-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4584-H4588]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           CALIFORNIA DROUGHT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks on the \nsubject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Speaker, I am not at all sure it is going to be \nthat controversial, but I was just looking outside the Capitol before I \ncame in to make this presentation, and it is raining. It is a downpour. \nFor those of us from California, it has been a long time since we have \nseen a downpour.\n  The Golden State, the seventh largest economy in the world and home \nto over 35 million people, is in the throes of a historic drought. This \nis the fourth year, and it is a world of hurt in California.\n  The economy is moving along. We are not complaining about the \neconomy. Many parts of it are moving along. But for everyone in the \nState of California, whether you are in the far north up near Mount \nShasta or way down here in the San Diego area, we are hurting.\n  There is a lot of talk. Water restrictions are taking place in every \ncity, whether you are on the coast, up in the north, or in the far \nsouth at Laguna Beach. Wherever you happen to be in the State of \nCalifornia, these restrictions are tightening up on the ability of \ncommunities to prosper, grow, and keep their lawns green, but more \nimportant in some communities, to even live there.\n  In some parts of the Central Valley, down here in the Fresno area, \nthere are communities that are out of water. Communities of 3,000, \n5,000, maybe even 10,000 people, have virtually no water at all.\n  This is a problem today. As we look to the future, we are going to \nsee the State's economy and population grow and the demand for water \nwill ever increase, unless we do something. What we must do is develop \na water plan for all of California.\n  Unfortunately, what we do most of the time in California is fight \nover water. There is the famous saying from Mark Twain: ``Whiskey is \nfor drinking. Water is for fighting over.''\n  And so it has been ever since my great-great-grandfather came to \nCalifornia in the early days of the Gold Rush up here in the mother \nlode region. You couldn't mine without water. And fighting over that \nwater was the order of the day, and it is today.\n  So as this entire State and much of the Southwest region--Nevada, \nsouthern Oregon, Utah, New Mexico, and even the western parts of \nTexas--suffer through this historic drought, we have taken to fighting \nin California. And I want to spend a few moments this evening talking \nabout what we must do immediately and then a long-term solution for the \nState of California.\n  Immediate, we are going to have to seek help. The State of California \nis using some bond money from past bond acts and some bond money from \nthe historic passage of Proposition 1 last November to immediately try \nto fix problems that exist in those communities without water. And so \nthat money will begin to flow to those communities, wherever they \nhappen to be.\n  There are a couple up here in the Sacramento Valley and further down \nin the San Joaquin Valley. The deserts have always been without water, \nso this is not new to them, although it is more extreme.\n  It is good that the bond act can provide immediate relief, but the \nrest of the short-term solutions will come from Washington. I want to \ncongratulate and thank the administration for providing $110 million of \nmoney for a variety of projects. Some of those projects are to dig \ndeeper wells for those communities without water, to find ways to \nimprove the conservation immediately, and to set about other programs \nthat are short-term in nature--all to the good. And that should \ncontinue.\n  In the days ahead, we are going to take up the appropriations bill \nfor water. In that appropriations bill, we should direct the \nadministration to do what it is doing--and to continue doing it through \nthis drought--and that is to focus all of those resources on the \nimmediate drought that is occurring.\n  Whether it is aid for ranchers and farmers or cities, it makes no \ndifference. It is broad and it needs to be done, and it should line up \nwith Proposition 1 of the last November ballot. That is both short-term \nand long-term. So the Federal Government supports those projects that \nwould be funded under that $7 billion bond act that the citizens of \nCalifornia voted for in an overwhelming majority.\n  But I would also like to talk about the long-term here. Because \ndroughts will come and go, and we must be prepared not only in \nCalifornia, but across the West.\n  For many years, the Department of Water Resources in California has \nlooked at the problem and has made many, many suggestions; but until \nabout 4 years ago, those suggestions were never put together in a \ncomprehensive plan.\n  I am familiar with this. I am a water warrior in California. I have \nrepresented this part of California for nearly 40 years, the great \nCentral Valley of California. I will put up another map so you can get \na better look at it.\n  So the plans that were put together by the California Department of \nWater Resources deal with the Sacramento River, which flows south, and \nthe San Joaquin River, which flows north from the Fresno area. This is \nway beyond Sacramento. Mount Shasta and Oregon, it is way up there.\n  These are the two great rivers of California, together with the \nColorado, which is way to the south. It flows into an area here which \nis called the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. This is the\n\n[[Page H4585]]\n\nlargest estuary of the Western Hemisphere, which is on the West Coast. \nFrom Alaska to Chile, there is no other estuary as important to fish \nand species of all kinds and to the environment and the economy of \nCalifornia.\n  As this water flows down the Sacramento River and the San Joaquin \nRiver, it is collected here and pumped south into the San Joaquin \nValley and over the Tehachapi Mountains way down here to southern \nCalifornia. That is the Great Southern water project and the Federal \nwater project.\n  But the result of that pumping is an extreme decline in the \nenvironment of the delta, Suisun Bay, and San Francisco Bay. Along with \nit, the salmon and other species have been largely decimated by those \nprojects.\n  So what are we to do? We will take the information that has been \ndeveloped over these many years by the California Department of Water \nResources and develop a comprehensive plan.\n  One plan, which actually dates back some 60 years now, is one that \nwould take the water around the delta and deliver it to the pumps down \nhere at Tracy. That plan, first proposed in the forties and then in the \nfifties, was taken up by our current Governor, Governor Jerry Brown, in \nthe late 1970s and early 1980s. It was called the Peripheral Canal--\nperipheral, that is around the delta, delivering water to the pumps.\n  I represented the delta at that time, and I said: Governor, what you \nhave managed to create here is the great vampire ditch.\n  The Peripheral Canal was big enough to take the water from the \nSacramento, depriving the delta of the freshwater that it needed for \nits environment, and deliver it to the pumps.\n  So we had another great water war. It actually went on the ballot, \nand the people of California decided not to build that canal. And so \nthere it sat until the second iteration of our current Governor, and he \ndecided it was time to address this problem.\n  And so now his suggestion is, instead of a canal, bury it underground \nso nobody can see it. He said: Don't worry about the canal. Don't \nworry. You will never see it.\n  I said: Because it is not going to get built?\n  He said: No, no. Because it will be underground.\n  Two massive tunnels, each 40 feet in diameter--about as tall as this \nChamber, actually, if we consider this is probably 50 feet in here--big \nenough to take all of the water out of the Sacramento River half of the \nyear, creating an existential threat to the delta.\n  Something needs to be done, no doubt about it. So by cobbling \ntogether the plans that were developed by the Department of Water \nResources and others, I put together what I called, a Water Plan for \nAll California.\n  By the way, this tunnel was first priced at $25 billion and did not \ncreate 1 gallon of new water--not 1 gallon of new water.\n\n                              {time}  1945\n\n  What it did was to create an existential threat to the delta, in that \nit was big enough to deprive the delta of the fresh water half of the \nyear. I said: Governor, that doesn't work. Let's look at this in a \nserious way that can create water for California's future.\n  This proposal was put together from plans that the State agencies had \ndeveloped in the past. I commend this to anybody that really wants to \nlook at what California's water future could be. Instead of a battle \nroyal, which we are now commenced with as we fight over these tunnels, \nand $25 billion--oh, by the way, there is a new iteration of it, and \nthey are throwing aside most of the habitat restoration and most of the \nenvironmental restoration and just going for the straight tunnels and \njust a little bit of mitigation.\n  Let's do something different. Let's create water that California will \nneed in its future. Let's build a system that will actually deliver \nmore water for California, while protecting the environment, and that \nis what this plan is all about, a water plan for all California.\n  There are the following elements in it: conservation; recycling; \nstorage; fixing the delta, which actually has to be fixed; letting \nscience run the process rather than politics; and make sure you protect \nthe water rights that have been in existence for more than a decade and \na half--excuse me--a century and a half.\n  These are the principal elements, and we are going to go through them \none at a time and explain why, if we were to spend, let's say, the full \n$17 billion, the current cost of the tunnels, and that is the first \nbid; that is not the final cost. Let's say we would spend that $17 \nbillion.\n  Let's allocate some of it for conservation, agricultural \nconservation. Now, every agriculturalist--and I am one--in California \nwill say, Yes, but we are already conserving water. Indeed, we are, and \na lot of water conservation has taken place, but that much more can be \ndone again.\n  There are somewhere, by the estimates of the State, 3 to 4 million \nacre feet of new water, available simply through conservation, and that \ndoes not include the urban conservation.\n  Now, understand, in today's drought, conservation is on everybody's \nmind, and in fact, it is mandated by law and executive order, but we \ncan do maybe 3 million acre feet of new water. That is enough for over \n120,000 homes a year per million acre feet.\n  Secondly, recycling--I often say, and I think this is more or less \naccurate, that the fifth largest river on the West Coast of the Western \nHemisphere are the sanitation plants in Southern California.\n  Whoa, what do you mean the fifth biggest river? Well, consider this: \nthe Colorado River, over here, abutting Arizona and Nevada, water is \ntaken from the Colorado River, 200 miles into the Los Angeles Basin.\n  Water is taken from northern California, the Sacramento River, in a \ncanal, pumps here at the delta, in a canal, 5,000 feet over the \nTehachapi Mountains, into the Los Angeles Basin. That water is cleaned \nonce. It is used in the Los Angeles Basin, cleaned again, in most \ncases, to a higher standard than the day it arrives in southern \nCalifornia; and nearly all of it is dumped into the ocean.\n  What? You do that in California? Well, we do. Fortunately, Orange \nCounty, a bastion of conservatism, is far ahead of the rest of the \nState and probably the Nation in water recycling. We need to do more of \nit.\n  For a few million, a couple of million dollars--excuse me, a couple \nof billion dollars, we could recycle at least a million acre feet of \nnew water in southern California, water that is already there, water \nthat is not being used.\n  In northern California, the San Francisco Bay area, for my friends in \nSan Francisco, you are taking what you tell the world is the cleanest \nwater in America, right out of Yosemite National Park, piping it across \nthe Central Valley into the San Francisco area, clean it--well, you \nreally don't have to do much cleaning because it is already clean--use \nit once, then you pipe it a mile offshore and dump it in the ocean.\n  Recycling is necessary in every part of California. Another million, \nperhaps, more acre feet of water could be available through recycling.\n  So conservation, recycling, 3, 4 million acre feet--we are getting \nclose to what California needs in the future.\n  So where are you going to put the water? Even in the midst of a \ndrought, we have had heavy rain flows--no place to put the water.\n  My colleague from northern California, the Sacramento Valley, Mr. \nLaMalfa and I have introduced a bill to build an off-stream storage \nreservoir here on the west side of the Sacramento Valley, a reservoir \nthat could hold 2 million acre feet of water--well, slightly less--and \nthat water would be available when needed.\n  It could flow down the Sacramento River, sweetening, pushing back the \nsaltwater in the delta; or it could be used for agricultural purposes \nin the Sacramento Valley or down in the San Joaquin Valley.\n  It also gives flexibilities to the great reservoirs of Shasta, the \nOroville Reservoir on the Feather River, and the Folsom Reservoir here \non the Sacramento River, giving flexibility to the water managers.\n  When it is needed for salmon and other species, you could use the \nwater out of Sites Reservoir. When it is needed for agriculture or for \nwater quality in the delta, you could use it out of Sites Reservoir, \nkeeping the cold water in Shasta, Oroville, or Folsom that is\n\n[[Page H4586]]\n\nnecessary for the salmon that spawn in those rivers.\n  Storage, off-stream storage, off-stream storage here, just east of \nContra Costa, in Los Vaqueros Reservoir, off-stream storage further \nsouth down here in Los Banos at the San Luis Reservoir, and the biggest \noff-stream reservoir of all, the great aquifer of the Sacramento, San \nJoaquin Valley, the great Central Valley of California, arguably, the \nsecond or third largest aquifer anywhere in the world, one that is now \nseriously overdrafted, as Californians, agriculture, cities, and others \nthirst for the water in this drought.\n  These storage reservoirs in northern California are just one part of \nthe storage systems that are needed for the future. The other part \nactually exists here in southern California, out here along the coast, \nthe West Basin, the San Fernando Valley, the San Gabriel Valley, the \nSanta Ana in Orange County, and as you move east into Riverside and San \nBernardino.\n  These are all historic aquifers that could be available to take that \nrecycled water, put it back in the ground, pull it out, clean it, and \nrecycle and recycle and eventually, these aquifers, many of which are \ncontaminated, would be clean and available for the future.\n  We could probably add all of the capacity of these aquifers in \nsouthern California and have greater storage capacity than the largest \nreservoir in the State of California, which is Shasta Reservoir, way up \nhere in northern California.\n  By using the aquifers as a storage facility in what we call \nconjunctive water management, when you have a lot of rain, you store \nit--store it off-stream, store it below ground in the aquifers. Then \nwhen you have your dry periods, as California historically does, you \ncan take that water out, but you cannot take out as much as currently \nbeing taken from these aquifers in California.\n\n  We are seeing the collapse of the aquifers in the San Joaquin Valley. \nWe are seeing the land subsiding in some places, as much as a foot a \nyear as the water is extracted, so we have to stop that, and so water \nmanagement becomes extremely important in the process.\n  I want to now turn to the delta, put this delta map back up and \nremind us, the Sacramento River coming down, the San Joaquin River \ncoming north. From the north, the Sacramento, from the south, the San \nJoaquin, meeting here in the great delta of California--this delta is \nseriously at risk, as I said a moment ago.\n  What to do about this? The Governor's plan, to take water around it, \nto deliver it to the pumps down here, I think, creates an existential \nthreat. Don't build something that could destroy the largest estuary on \nthe West Coast of the Western Hemisphere.\n  Instead, build something that is the right size, recognizing that \nwhile the delta is imperiled, perhaps by earthquakes, perhaps by sea \nlevel rise, nonetheless, all the plants call for water to be pumped out \nof the delta, even if it is taken around the delta.\n  The first thing to do, right now, is to armor, strengthen those key \nlevees in the delta that are necessary for the transfer of water to the \npumps, for the protection of the cities here on the eastern side, and \nto make sure that you are able to always be able to take that water \nthrough the delta. It is called the armored delta.\n  Under the Governor's plan or my plan or any other plan, those levees \nare going to be used for at least the next two decades, if not for a \nmuch longer period of time. Improve the delta, levees, and that is a \njob for the Federal Government.\n  I talked earlier about what could be done immediately by the Federal \nGovernment, and that is to secure some of these key delta channels by \nimproving the levees on those channels. That is step one.\n  Step two is what I call science. This area, the richest estuary on \nthe West Coast of the Western Hemisphere, home and nursery to salmon, \nto other species, such as the delta smelt and many other species, \nrequires very careful attention and very careful scientific study.\n  We are talking over here, in a place called Rio Vista, about building \na science center, bringing together all the State and Federal agencies \nso they can work in a collaborative science program. That is a great \nprogram called the Rivers Program. There are other science studies that \nare underway.\n  You have to let science drive this process. You cannot allow politics \nto drive it; otherwise, you put at risk the communities in this area; \nyou put at risk the environment; you put at risk the fish species, and \nyou put at risk the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Western \nHemisphere.\n  Keep in mind that the Congress of the United States, twice in the \nlast 4 years, has passed legislation that removes the environmental \nprotections for this estuarine system and simply grabs 800,000 acre \nfeet of water that was meant for the environment and sends it into the \nsouthern valley, into the southern valley here.\n  It is a rip-off. It is part of what has taken place in California \nsince the gold miners came in the 1850s, and that is, if you want \nwater, you simply take it from somebody. In this case, you are taking \nit from the delta, from the environment, from the agriculture; and you \nare pushing aside the environmental protections. Don't do it. It is not \nnecessary.\n  There is another thing, in addition to fixing the levees, and I call \nit the ``Little Sip, Big Gulp.'' Here it is. This is a map of the delta \nof California. Sacramento is up here, the confluence of the American \nRiver and the Sacramento River. That is the State capital. This is the \ndelta here.\n  We were talking about it in the larger map. San Francisco Bay is over \nhere, Suisun Bay and the rest. This is the heart of the delta. Stockton \nis down here. Tracy and the big massive pumps at Tracy, capable of \ntaking well over 15,000 cubic feet per second, are down here in this \narea.\n  The tunnels that the Governor wants to build would start here, travel \nthrough some of the richest agricultural land in the delta, or in the \nNation, agricultural land that has been in production since the 1850s \nand 1860s, along the Sacramento River, displacing, oh, maybe 4 or 5 \nmiles of habitat and agriculture and communities along this area. The \ntunnel would come down into this--the tunnels would come down into this \narea.\n  $17 billion--why would you do something that, first of all, is large \nenough to allow for the destruction of the delta? Why would you spend \nall that money, when a good portion of that project is already built? \nThis is it.\n  This is the Sacramento Deep Water Ship Channel, an ocean, a channel \nthat begins at San Francisco Bay, comes up the Sacramento River, and \nthen, in a channel that was built by the Army Corps of Engineers, all \nthe way up to the Port of Sacramento here in West Sacramento, on the \nother side of the State capital.\n  This is a deep water shipping channel. Ocean ships come into San \nFrancisco Bay and come all the way up here. It is a pretty good \neconomic activity. Agricultural products are shipped out.\n  I was over that way this last weekend, and they have log decks. I \nguess these are logs from the various fires that have occurred in \nCalifornia, and those are going to be shipped off to China. I sometimes \nwonder why we don't use those logs for the things that we should be \nmaking in America, but that is another subject for another day.\n  So what is an alternative? I call this the little sip solution, \n``Little Sip, Big Gulp solution.'' Take the water out of the Sacramento \nRiver here, 3,000--not 15,000--3,000 cubic feet per second. We know how \nto do that. Fish screens are already built to do that.\n\n                              {time}  2000\n\n  Let it flow down the Deep Water Channel to about here, just north of \nRio Vista. Put in a single ship lock and a pump.\n  Alternative one: put it in a small pipe through the delta down here \nto this area; and then, in an open channel along what is called Old \nRiver, take it down to the pumps at Tracy, 3,000 cubic feet per second.\n  You could do that most every day of the year, and it could deliver 2 \nmillion acre-feet of water to the pumps at Tracy in most years. In this \ndrought year, it wouldn't be possible.\n  A second alternative would be to take it down the Deep Water Channel, \n3,000 cubic feet, to the shipping lock and the pump, put it into a \ncanal that\n\n[[Page H4587]]\n\ngoes behind Rio Vista here, crosses Sherman Island at the confluence of \nthe Sacramento and the San Joaquin Rivers, and over to Contra Costa \nCounty to the pumps.\n  This is a very interesting solution because this solution creates a \nfail-safe solution for about 7 million people that live in the San \nFrancisco Bay area, because this particular route intersects six \naqueducts: the Solano aqueduct here, this would intersect it down here \nin Contra Costa; East Bay Municipal Utility aqueduct; the Contra Costa \nCounty aqueduct; the Los Vaqueros aqueduct for the Los Vaqueros river; \nzone seven, down here in the Livermore area, over here in this area; \nand also the South Bay aqueduct, going all the way down to Silicon \nValley.\n  What has happened, if this solution were chosen, should the need ever \narise for some reason, these critical water districts that supply the \nwater to this entire Bay area could get access to the Sacramento River \nwater. So if, for some reason, the delta was to become saline as a \nresult of a collapse of a levee system or any other reason, we have a \nfail-safe solution for the entire Bay region, except Marin County, \nwhich has its own water system.\n  Either of these is a system that would be right-sized. That is a \nLittle Sip big enough to provide 2 million acre-feet of water, which is \nroughly 40, 45 percent of the amount of water needed south of the delta \nfor southern California, for Los Angeles, and for the San Joaquin \nValley.\n  That is the Little Sip solution: a route through the delta, a \npipeline from here to Old River, and then an open channel on the east \nside of Old River to the pumps, or a canal across Contra Costa and \nSolano County. Either of them would work. And it would be a fraction of \nthe cost of the massive twin tunnels that would come this direction, \ndestroying the agricultural communities here in Portland and Clarksburg \nand putting at risk the entire delta because of the enormous size.\n  This is a 15,000-cubic-foot-per-second tunnel system. Now, granted, \nthey are only going to build three of the intakes here on the \nSacramento River. Okay. It is good to have only three. That gives you \n9,000, which is roughly two-thirds of the water going down the \nSacramento River half of the year.\n  So what does that mean for the delta? It means the delta is going to \nbe salty and deprived of the freshwater that this estuary needs. And \nall they need to do is to put in one more intake, and then they can \ntake all of the water half of the year.\n  Don't do it. Never build something that could be so destructive of \nsuch a precious natural resource as the delta.\n  So this is the Little Sip.\n  Where does the rest of the water come? It is called the Big Gulp. \nEven in this drought year, there have been two very heavy rains that \nhave sent a surge of water down the San Joaquin and down the \nSacramento. The pumps were turned on--not to their full might, but the \npumps were turned on, and the water was shipped to the south.\n  Okay. It worked. Can it work in the future in normal years?\n  There is sufficient water in the delta in a normal year to get \nanother 2, 2.5 million acre-feet of water out of the delta, itself, and \nthat is the Big Gulp. So you combine a small facility with a Big Gulp \nwhen the water is available in the delta.\n  Now, keep in mind, this project and the twin tunnel project that the \nGovernor is proposing both require storage south of the delta. Neither \nproject will work. And, in fact, the California water system today will \nnot work without storage south of the delta.\n  That is why--to back up to a map of all California--we have to have \nstorage offsite, at Sites Reservoir. There is talk of enlarging Shasta \nReservoir, way up here in this area. There is talk of building a new \nreservoir here on the San Joaquin River at Hanford's flat. There is \ntalk of enlarging--in fact, this one is almost certain to happen--\nenlarging Los Vaqueros Reservoir. The San Luis Reservoir down here \nneeds to be rebuilt because of earthquake safety, and it could be \nexpanded.\n  There is another reservoir site just south of it, Los Banos Grande. \nThat is another large reservoir. And, of course, the aquifers in the \nentire Central Valley of California, and we have already talked about \nthe aquifers in southern California.\n  So you have to have storage south of the delta. If you have storage \nsouth of the delta, then the Governor's plan or my plan, the Little \nSip, Big Gulp plan will work. Storage is absolutely essential in all of \nthese configurations. Fail to do the storage, and nothing is going to \nwork.\n  Let me just review what we have been talking about here. We have been \ntalking about a water plant for all California.\n  Conservation, to be sure, the great agricultural areas--even over \nhere in the Salinas Valley--conservation along this entire area, \nconservation in southern California, the great metropolitan areas, and \nin the Bay area. In doing so, the State's own estimate was 5 million. \nLet's just say you get 3 million acre-feet. Agricultural conservation, \nurban conservation, 3 million acre-feet of new water, water that is \ncurrently unavailable but there.\n  Recycling, we talked about recycling here in southern California. A \n$2 to $3 billion investment will give you 1 million acre-feet of water, \nand you already have the storage systems in place, the underground \naquifers of southern California. Similarly, recycling in the Bay area.\n  Sacramento, right here, starting just a month ago, a new recycling \nprogram, a $2 billion recycling program in Sacramento to recycle \nwater--some for that area, the rest to put clean water down the river \nrather than some of the water, which is a little shady.\n  So recycling, another million acre-feet at least, maybe more, as you \nbring on the recycling in the Bay area.\n  Now we have got 3 to 4 million acre-feet of water.\n  Storage systems, it is estimated that the Sites Reservoir can add in \nthis drought here, were it available, would have been 900,000 acre-feet \nof water in this drought year. Of course it is not built; it is not \navailable. But on average, it should provide some 500,000--400,000 to \n600,000 acre-feet of water annually out of Sites Reservoir; plus, as I \ndescribed earlier, the ability to reoperate the great reservoirs and, \ntogether, be able to perhaps get even more water as a result of Sites \nReservoir. The other reservoirs can provide additional water also.\n\n  So we ought to be able, through these processes, to get somewhere \nnear 5 million acre-feet of new water for California. If we have \nconservation, if we have the storage and we are able to get through the \ncurrent drought, it is a safe bet that 5 million acre-feet of annual \nwater yield will carry California into the next 30 to 50 years and \nbeyond that, depending on population growth and technologies.\n  I had not mentioned the use of this water out here. Well, that is the \nPacific Ocean. Desalinization and recycling use exactly the same \ntechnology. Recycling happens to be cheaper, in that it takes less \nenergy to clean recycled water than to clean the ocean water because \nthe ocean water has a lot of salts and other things in it, and it is \njust more expensive. But clearly, desalinization is also in our future.\n  Down here, in the San Diego area, a new recycling plant is going \nonline this year. They have been talking about one in Santa Barbara \nthat actually was built but then mothballed because it rained again. \nBut that one in Santa Barbara is likely to go back online as a result \nof the current drought and in anticipation of future droughts.\n  So desalinization is also in California's future.\n  Those are the basic elements: conservation; recycling; creation of \nnew storage systems; fixing the delta, the levees; Little Sip, Big Gulp \nstrategy; science-driven process.\n  Keep in mind, you have got to be right on the science; otherwise, you \nare going to destroy this extraordinarily valuable habitat of the delta \nand other places.\n  Finally, you had better be paying attention to the water rights and \nthe laws of California, which, unfortunately, in the first iteration of \nthe bill that passed Congress 4 years ago, just blew aside California \nwater rights. So if you want to start a big, big water war, if you want \nto heighten and enflame a water war in California, push aside the water \nrights which, incidentally, is now taking place as a result of the \ndrought.\n  That is a Water Plan for All of California. It is here. It is \navailable. My Web site has it. I recommend it to anybody that is \ninterested in a solution for\n\n[[Page H4588]]\n\nCalifornia's long-term water problems; and also, I recommend to people \nthat we have the Federal Government in the short term align its water \npolicy programs from the EPA--the Environmental Protection Agency--the \nDepartment of Agriculture, the Department of the Interior, the Army \nCorps of Engineers, that those water programs in the short term be \naligned with the State of California's bond act so that we can promote, \naugment, and advance the projects that would be undertaken in the $7 \nbillion water bond that the California voters passed last November.\n  My plea to those who think the tunnels are the solution is: stop, \ntake another look. Take another look at the Little Sip, Big Gulp \nsolution. This actually was something that was first proposed by the \nNatural Resources Defense Council. We were working with this about 5 \nyears ago. They came up with the Little Sip, Big Gulp name, and with \nsome modification, it is now a proposal that would cost a fraction of \nwhat the twin, massive, 40-foot-in-diameter tunnels would cost.\n  So, for California, there is a future. It is the Golden State. It is \nan economy unmatched by any other in the United States. It is an \neconomy particularly--well, actually, the entire State's economy is \nstressed as a result of the drought. And if we take the kind of steps \nthat I have been talking about here, we will be able to provide the \nwater that California needs in the next drought and in the years to \ncome as the population grows and as the economy grows.\n  So that is the water plan for all California. There are many other \npieces of the puzzle, one of which I am going to take just a second to \ntalk about. And that is this week, as we take up the appropriations for \nwater programs in the State of California--actually, water plans for \nthe United States, not just the State of California--we ought to be \nmindful of a project called the Land and Water Conservation Fund, a \nprogram that has been in effect for half a century. It takes the \nroyalties from the offshore oil and minerals onshore and allows much of \nthat royalty to be spent on preserving the special places of America--\nthe wildlife refuges, very unique habitat areas--setting aside those \nareas, using that money to buy up the land and, in some cases, to buy \nup easements so that the land will forever remain available to future \ngenerations in a more natural state. That is the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. Unfortunately, the authorization for it expires this \nyear, and at the moment, there is no perceived movement by the Congress \nof the United States to reinstitute and reauthorize the Land and Water \nConservation Fund.\n  When I was deputy Secretary of the Department of the Interior in the \nmid-nineties, we used this fund to set aside redwood forest off along \nthe coast of California, to protect the Everglades of Florida, to set \naside some of the land along the sand dunes on the Great Lakes. This is \na project for all of America, one that is worthy of being reauthorized \nand properly funded.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, perhaps enough about California's drought. \nNo, I will take that back.\n\n                              {time}  2015\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we have got a problem in California, short term and long \nterm, and it deserves the attention of the Congress of the United \nStates because California is the seventh largest economy in the world \nand critically important to the future of this Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "23"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/23/house-section/article/H4588-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4588-H4589]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      INJUSTICE AT HOME AND ABROAD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, it has been a tough week, for all \nChristians in the country have lost three brothers and six sisters in \nthe Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, South \nCarolina. The whole country mourns--well, probably not everybody. Evil \nhas those who support it and wallow in it, as did the evil perpetrator \nof the killings.\n  Our prayers continue to go out to the immediate family members and to \nthe church family members for their peace and for their comfort because \nthose of us who are believers know that those we have lost are at the \nfoot of the Saviour in Paradise.\n  I learned today that the President will be going to speak at the \nfuneral. I recall a speech in Arizona, and so as I encouraged our \nprayer caucus tonight, we should be praying for the President to be a \nuniter as he speaks.\n  I thought about the way a great President named Abraham Lincoln \nconcluded his second inaugural address. The war was not over; there was \ngreat hatred and bitterness. Of course, he mentioned in his inaugural \naddress--talking about North and South--both read the same Bible, both \npray to the same God, and each invokes His aid against the other.\n  He goes on to give what is one of the great theological treatises on \nthe nature of God; he quotes from the Old Testament a couple of times, \nbut with all the killing that occurred during the Civil War, he ended \ntrying to encourage uniting. I know there are those who advise the \nPresident that he should not let a good crisis go to waste, but for \nmany of us, the hope and prayer is that at this week's funeral, he will \nbe a uniter.\n  Mr. Speaker, President Lincoln closed his second inaugural with the \nwords: ``With malice toward none, with charity for all, with firmness \nin the right as God gives us to see the right, let us strive on to \nfinish the work we are in, to bind up the Nation's wounds, to care for \nhim who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, \nto do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among \nourselves and with all nations.''\n  Mr. Speaker, that was a man who sought to unite, who knew there was a \nHeavenly Father to Whom we could pray and Who would answer our prayers. \nI hope and pray that will be the outcome at the funeral of my brothers \nand sisters in Charleston, South Carolina.\n  Of course, then there is the judge side of me. Having sentenced \npeople both to prison and to death, the judge side of me says, from \nwhat we know, it sure cries out for the death penalty, but we will let \nthe justice system in South Carolina take care of that.\n  In the meantime, as we think about injustice, it is also hard not to \nthink of our friends and our allies in Israel who have trouble finding \nany friends. They are persecuted on every side. We got this report from \nthe U.N., an article talking about it from Marissa Newman of The Times \nof Israel: ``Israel slams `politically motivated and morally flawed' \nU.N. Gaza report.''\n  The article says: ``Israel on Monday said it would `seriously' \nevaluate the United Nations Human Rights Council inquiry on the Gaza \nconflict, while politicians from left and right slammed the \ninternational body for bias and declared that the international \ninvestigators lacked access to evidence.''\n  The article goes on down further: `` `The report is biased,' said \nPrime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in response. `Israel is not \nperpetrating war crimes but rather protecting itself from an \norganization that carries out war crimes. We won't sit back with our \narms crossed as our citizens are attacked by thousands of missiles.' ''\n  The article says: ``The Human Rights Council `in practice does \neverything but worry about human rights,' the prime minister charged. \n`The commission spends more time condemning Israel than Iran, Syria and \nNorth Korea put together.' ''\n  It seems that these are the times that cry out for a moral, \npragmatic, and unified response to the anti-Semitism that is growing--\nit is just unbelievable--in Europe and in the United States colleges \nand universities. It is incredible.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Bible talks about times when right will be wrong and \nwrong will be right; perhaps we are entering such an era. A country \nlike Israel is under attack from virtually every front, every side; and \nPalestinians, radical Islamists, and Iranians declare that they will \nsee that it is annihilated.\n  Their leaders make statements such as ``we are glad that they are \ngathered in Israel so that we can annihilate them all at once,'' and \nthe U.N. basically sees somehow level parties on the same plane: \nterrorists and people who promote democratic beliefs and carry them \nout, allow people to vote, believe\n\n[[Page H4589]]\n\nin the rights of women, and believe in equal rights.\n  Israel is a place where Muslims can freely vote and don't have to \nworry about a radical Islamist killing them if he or she doesn't \nbelieve and perform exactly like their radical Islamist leader tells \nthem to.\n  The article says that the Israeli Foreign Ministry also castigated \nthe U.N. Human Rights Council investigation for failing to distinguish \nbetween the Israeli military and Hamas:\n  ``It is regrettable that the report fails to recognize the profound \ndifference between Israel's moral behavior during Operation Protective \nEdge and the terror organizations it confronted.''\n  ``Likud minister Yuval Steinitz compared the conflict to a \nPalestinian suicide bomber commandeering a bus full of Palestinian \ncivilians and ramming it into an Israeli tank. `Many Palestinian \ncivilians would die,' he told Army Radio. `But that doesn't mean the \ntank is to blame.' The U.N. panel's approach was `absurd,' he said, in \nthat it would require Israel not to fire back when terrorists fire at \nits civilians `because the terrorists are hiding behind their \ncivilians.'\n  ``Steinitz also said the U.N. Human Rights Commission's obsessive \nfocus on Israel points to anti-Semitism. Asked whether Israel would \nhave done better to cooperate with the panel, he said, `You can't \nexplain to people who are not prepared to listen.'\n\n  ``Yesh Atid leader Yair Lapid also rejected the idea that Israel \nshould have cooperated, saying the panel had drawn its conclusions \nbefore it even began its probe.''\n  It goes on to discuss the report from the so-called Human Rights \nCouncil. The United Nations Human Rights Council is an abomination. It \nshould be an affront as it is an outrage to anyone who cares about \nhuman rights.\n  What has happened at the United Nations? We have had so many nations \njoin the United Nations that don't care about human rights, and they \ndon't care about women. Of course, they are so brutal in the treatment \nof those who would oppose it, that apparently it scares off feminist \ngroups who are afraid to attack those who really are inhumane in their \ntreatment of women, enough so the feminist liberal groups are afraid to \ntake them on.\n  Hopefully, some day, they will gain the courage to see where women \nare truly being abused in horrendous ways, and they will join with some \nof the rest of us in trying to stop that, instead of going after \nChristian groups or groups who believe that everyone, once conceived, \nshould have a right to live.\n  Maybe if some of those groups quit attacking those who are pro-life \nand spent a little time attacking those who are true abusers of women, \nthen we would find common footing, and we would be able to work better \ntogether.\n  There is another article here from Anne Bayefsky. This one is \nheadlined: ``U.N. report denies Israel's right of self-defense, \nadvocates arrest of Israelis instead.''\n  It really is outrageous, and the United States, as has been suggested \nby some writers, should withdraw from participation in the Human Rights \nCommission. The ICC, International Criminal Court, obviously from its \nactions and its efforts, is quite anti-Semitic. The United States has \nno business supporting the efforts of those who support the effort and \nabuse of Israelis and the effort to eliminate them from off of the \nglobe.\n  Mr. Speaker, if there had been an Israel during the Holocaust, Jews \nwould have had a place to go, and there would not have been 6 million \nkilled in the Holocaust. This is no time for anyone who cares about \nworld peace and the avoidance of suffering to stand up and decry \nIsrael. This is a time to stand with Israel.\n  Israel is an actual democratic republic in the middle of the Middle \nEast that respects women like no nation around in the Middle East and \nsupports the value of life and private property. How in the world are \nwe not a better friend to them?\n  I would like to see, as some writers have suggested, that we withdraw \nfrom anything that might lend our support to the International Criminal \nCourt because of its anti-Semitic views.\n  Mr. Speaker, I realized, as I was reading these articles about \nadditional anti-Semitic efforts by the United Nations, that the U.N. \nhas been overtaken by so many countries that don't believe in human \nrights for their people.\n\n                              {time}  2030\n\n  Many of them, they are abusive, have no problem with torturing those \nwith whom they disagree, have no problem killing people who convert \nfrom, for example, Islamic beliefs to Christian beliefs--get the death \npenalty in some of these countries.\n  You know, it is time to begin a new organization of democratic \nrepublics that respect the rights of women, men, children, and who have \nfair elections.\n  Let's have an international community like that. Let's have an \ninternational group that, when it speaks, it is not with blood dripping \noff of the votes of its members. It would mean something.\n  A human rights commission, for example, for a while had Libya as the \nhead. Are you kidding me? This is outrageous.\n  Mr. Speaker, I realized, in reviewing these articles, I have not yet \nfiled the bill that I normally file, the U.N. Voting Accountability \nAct.\n  What I have learned around this body is, if you keep filing a bill \nlong enough, even if it requires somebody else putting their name on it \nto get it to the floor, you get that done; you get it passed, and you \ndon't care who gets the credit.\n  The U.N. Voting Accountability bill is very simple. It basically says \nany nation that votes against the United States more than half of the \ntime in the preceding year would get no assistance from the United \nStates of any kind whatsoever. As I have said for years, you don't have \nto pay people to hate you. They will do it for free. It is still true.\n  It is time to leave that money here. It is time for this \nadministration to stop sending weapons that it knows have continuously \nfallen in the hands of the Islamic State and made it extremely \ndifficult for the courageous Kurdish fighters to fight and defeat the \nradical Islamic State.\n  Let's start sending those weapons directly to the Kurds. Baghdad is \nnot letting them get them. They cannot easily defeat the weapons, the \nup-armored vehicles, the things that we have sent that we knew \nultimately were falling into Islamic State hands.\n  As some Muslim friends, leaders in Middle Eastern states have \ncontinued to ask: Why is it that the United States administration keeps \nhelping the Muslim Brotherhood? Don't they know that is who is at war \nwith the United States?\n  They ask: Why do you keep helping your enemies?\n  It is time that we quit helping our enemies.
