The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, we take to the floor to deal with the \ndaily reminders of turmoil around the world: the unrest in the Middle \nEast, especially in Syria and ISIS; the sad reality of an unending \nstring of events regarding gun violence.\n  There is a certain amount of unrest here in the House, as our \nRepublican colleagues right now are trying to chart a path forward to \nreconcile differences of opinion within their own ranks that have some \nspillover effects for us. But in the background, there is a critical \nissue that we should be focused on that may not command the headlines; \nbut it is, nonetheless, a critically important item.\n  We are faced with arcane formulas that govern dealing with Medicare--\nthe rates that recipients pay for their services--that have a perverse \nimpact on some of the lowest income seniors. Through no fault of their \nown, 7.7 million senior citizens are going to be treated very unfairly. \nThese are the 30 percent of Medicare recipients who are going to pay \nthe burden for all Medicare recipients for the cost increases.\n  We have a provision in place that holds harmless people who get no \nincrease in their Social Security payments, and they are immune from \npremium increases. But that is not so for the other 30 percent. These \nare the people who are facing a 52 percent increase in that part B \npremium, over $54 a month.\n  Now, remember, nobody gets an increase in their Social Security, and \nthere is going to be about a $76 increase per month in the deductible.\n  A typical Medicare beneficiary pays almost $5,000 per year for \npremiums, cost sharing, and other services that aren't covered by \ninsurance. For many, that is not an unreasonable contribution for their \nhealth care, but not for everyone.\n  More than half the beneficiaries have incomes of $24,150. These 30 \npercent, the 7.7 million who will pick up the slack for everyone else, \nare going to be facing a significant impact, given their low incomes. \nIt doesn't actually have to be this way.\n  There are proposals that are available for Congress to deal with. \nRepresentative Dina Titus, Representative Jan Schakowsky, and Senator \nRon Wyden all have proposals that would eliminate or minimize the \nimpact on these vulnerable senior citizens.\n  And, bear in mind, it will also impact the States $2.3 billion in \nterms of Medicaid programs, which inevitably will translate into \nservice reductions, again, for some of our most vulnerable.\n  It is time for Congress to empower negotiators in both parties, in \nboth Chambers to act now. If we get involved with these potential \nsolutions, the costs are going to be far less than if we wait until the \nnext year, and we will be shielding some of our most vulnerable \ncitizens from significant increases at a time when they can ill afford \nit. This is one area where there is overwhelming support on both sides \nof the aisle.\n  I would call upon my friends in the Republican leadership to take a \nbreak from this strange process they are going through and debate in \nthe acrimony and the churn. Let's take a break and empower people to \nsolve these problems now. Our senior citizens deserve no less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6895-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6895-H6896]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     BREAST CANCER AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nMinnesota (Mr. Emmer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to remind us of the \nimportance of the month of October as Breast Cancer Awareness Month.\n  Like any disease that affects people regardless of race, color, \ncreed, or their status in society, cancer not only tests the mental and \nphysical strength of the person fighting the disease, it has a deep and \nlasting impact on family, friends, and communities.\n  Currently, more than 100 different types of cancer exist, but, in my \nhumble opinion, none is more wicked than breast cancer. This is most \nlikely because breast cancer is one of the most common and deadly \ncancers among women.\n\n[[Page H6896]]\n\n  In fact, one in eight women in America will be diagnosed with breast \ncancer in her lifetime. Breast cancer can be a cruel disease. It tears \nmothers from their children, wives from their husbands, and daughters \nfrom their parents.\n  In 2015, it is anticipated that, in our country alone, more than \n40,000 women will die from breast cancer. While women are most at risk, \nwe must remember that this disease does not just affect women; while \nless common in the United States, 2,350 men are diagnosed with breast \ncancer each year.\n  In the past 20 years, there have been incredible advances in the \nresearch and medicine surrounding breast cancer, but there is much left \nto be done. We can't rest until we can prevent or cure this horrible \ndisease.\n  Again, we have already made huge strides in the fight against breast \ncancer. Death rates due to breast cancer have been declining since \n1989, and women younger than 50 are now less likely to get breast \ncancer than ever before. This is largely due to the awareness that has \nbeen raised on the importance of self-exams and yearly doctor \nphysicals.\n  However, currently, 29 percent of insured women are still not \nreceiving mammograms; and for women without health insurance, the \npercentage is even higher, with 68 percent not receiving mammograms.\n  It is extremely important that we continue to place an emphasis on \nearly detection so that we can catch this disease as early as possible \nand have the best shot at beating it.\n  While there are factors like genetics and age that can make someone \nmore susceptible to the disease, breast cancer does not discriminate \nagainst education, upbringing, or wealth. From CEOs in New York City to \na stay-at-home mom in small town Minnesota, this disease knows no \nbounds.\n  I expect that just about everyone who walks these halls and too many \nto count across our country have been impacted by breast cancer in some \nway. I am no exception. Fifteen years ago, I lost my sister, Bridget, \nto breast cancer. Bridget was only 38 years old when she left us. She \nleft behind two beautiful daughters and a husband who loved her.\n  While her life was a lesson on how to get the most out of each second \nof every minute of every hour and every day, there is not a day that \ngoes by when I don't wish there could have been a cure for her.\n  For those who have experienced personal loss and pain from breast \ncancer, and for everyone who is fighting this disease, we join with you \nthis month not only to raise awareness about breast cancer but to sound \na call to action, to strengthen our resolve, and to eradicate this \ndisease once and for all.\n  In Congress, we can absolutely play a role in this effort. To the \nextent possible within our constitutional authority, we can and should \nencourage further advancement of medical research.\n  I am proud to be a cosponsor of the Accelerating the End of Breast \nCancer Act of 2015, which will establish a commission to work to defeat \nthis disease. The commission will consist of experts in cancer research \nwho will work to identify opportunities and ideas to advance our quest \nto prevent and cure breast cancer for future generations.\n  October is a month to raise awareness. We have made progress, and we \nare making progress in our fight against this unforgiving disease. Let \nus use this month to rededicate ourselves to our shared goal of \neradicating breast cancer once and for all.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6896-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6896-H6897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 WASHINGTON IS OUT OF STEP WITH AMERICA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, as Donald Trump and Ben Carson have \nturned up the volume with more and more outrageous statements and \npolicy proposals, Members of Congress have been trying to keep up.\n  Now, Republicans in the House not only have to play to the small, but \nextremely vocal, segment of the electorate that feels Washington is \n``out of step with the American people,'' but they have another \naudience to woo--each other--because a lot of our colleagues are \ncurrently running for leadership positions.\n  But is it really Washington that is out of step with America or is it \nthe most vocal, most active, and most vitriolic elements of the \nRepublican base that are out of step with America?\n  Last week's NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll was pretty startling. \nIt shows in issue after issue that on the positions adopted by the \nleading GOP candidates, vast majorities of Americans disagree with \nRepublicans. On abortion restrictions, immigration, LGBT equality, \nracial diversity, and reproductive health, some in the Republican base \ndemand we go back to the Dark Ages. But it is not, in fact, the \ndirection that most Americans want to go.\n  For most Americans, ``Mad Men'' was a good TV drama set before racial \nintegration, before the women's movement really took hold, before gays \nand lesbians dared come out of the closet, and before we removed racial \nquotas from immigration. But some in the Republican Party aspire to \nturn it into a reality TV show.\n  The latest throw-down from the right has been over Planned Parenthood \nand reimbursing this respected organization for health services it \nprovides to women across the country.\n  In many cases, Planned Parenthood is the only source of affordable \nand accessible reproductive health care, contraception, HIV and STD \ntesting, cancer screenings, and basic health care for women.\n  Under Federal law, our tax dollars cannot pay for abortions, and \nthere are no credible claims that this is being violated. Under law, \nabortion is legal in the United States, despite all of the restrictions \nimposed and proposed by my Republican colleagues. But this goes further \nthan abortion rights and a woman's right to control her own health care \nand reproduction.\n  Some Americans here and around the country are, frankly, not too \ncomfortable with the whole family planning thing. In my family, I have \ntwo daughters who are brilliant and whom I trust to make decisions for \nthemselves. They were born 8 years apart and not by accident.\n  My wife and I planned her pregnancies around her career as an \ninvestment banker and had our children when we were ready. That is an \noption that opened the world of opportunity and self-determination to \nmy wife that my mother never had. Puerto Rican women in this country in \nmy mother's day had one thing forced on them by the government, and \nthat was sterilization, period.\n  So when I hear talk about shutting down the government to appease the \nfar right on Planned Parenthood, I think of the progress we have made \nfrom my mother's generation to my wife's generation and now to the \nworld in which my daughters live.\n  It seems to me that we should not be looking for ways to limit \nchoices women have, to force them into back alleys or across State \nlines for health care or to treat them as if only wise men in \nWashington can make decisions for the women of America.\n  But that desire to turn the clock backwards, to undo the progress of \nour lifetimes, and to punish America for evolving over time is \nbasically at the heart of the Republican agenda, as driven by their \nmost active and vocal base. Republicans run for office and legislate as \nif they want gay people back in the closet, as if they want Latinos and \nAsians to become invisible, as if they wish women were just in the \nkitchen or in the bedroom, as if we could go back to those golden days \nbefore the Civil Rights Act, the Voting Rights Act, Brown v. Board of \nEducation, when everything was separate and some people were more equal \nthan others.\n  Well, with all due respect to Mr. Carson and Emperor Trump, every \npoll indicates that the American people are not with them, and that is \nespecially true of young people in America. Dr. Carson must be \nnostalgic for the anti-Catholic days before John Kennedy was elected \nbecause he is now raising doubts that people of certain religions are \nqualified to serve their country as President.\n  Senator Cruz must look at the old days when we turned away refugees \nfrom Europe because of their religion, as we did in the 1930s and 1940s \nwhen anti-Semitism gripped this country. Now he wants to send Muslims \nback to die in Syria.\n  And now there is Donald Trump. He wants to deport about a quarter of \nthe\n\n[[Page H6897]]\n\n50 million Latinos in the United States. If mass deportation was good \nenough for President Eisenhower, he feels it should be good enough for \nAmerica today.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  I will agree with one leading candidate, Jeb Bush, who recently said \nthat ``stuff happens.'' Stuff does happen. A lot of stuff has happened \nsince the 1950s when I was born and the 1960s when I grew up in \nAmerica.\n  Our laws and our culture have evolved to become more inclusive, and \nwe have a more diverse and egalitarian society because of it. Many \nRepublicans call that stuff the problem. I call that stuff progress.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6897-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6897]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  LOSING A GENERATION TO GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nIllinois (Ms. Kelly) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. KELLY of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I am tired. I am tired of, once \nagain, being asked to rise to honor the victims of gun violence.\n  Not even a month ago, I stood at this very podium on behalf of gun \nviolence victims. With nearly 300 mass shootings in less than 300 days, \nthis Congress has proven that there is no appetite to end gun violence.\n  I am tired because we will have more moments of silence in honor of \ngun victims, and then we will have moments of action from leaders \nworking to stop gun violence.\n  To my colleagues who came here on the platform of caring about \nchildren, to my colleagues who came here for peace, to my friends on \nthe left and right of the aisle, can't we own up to our responsibility \nto stop this violence? Can't we own the fact that we are losing a \ngeneration of Americans to gun violence?\n  Every year, over 100,000 people are shot in America, more than 30,000 \nof them fatally. This is a crisis that demands more than a moment of \nsilence from Congress.\n  With every mass shooting, we hear every excuse in the book for \ninaction: it is a family problem; it is a mental health issue; it is a \npeople problem. Apparently, it is everything but a gun problem. At this \npoint, even our excuses are tired.\n  Let me share some headlines from my hometown this week:\n  From Sunday's Chicago Tribune, ``Man Killed, 4 Injured in \nShootings'';\n  Monday, CBS Chicago, ``One Dead, 11 Wounded in Weekend Shootings \nAcross Chicago'';\n  Tuesday, Chicago Sun Times, ``Man and Woman Shot Near Douglas Park on \nWest Side'';\n  Wednesday, Chicago Tribune, ``One Dead, Eight Wounded in Shootings in \nChicago.''\n  These aren't just headlines. They are deferred dreams and altered \nrealities for countless families. This isn't a Chicago problem, a \nNewtown problem, or an Oregon problem; it is an American problem.\n  Today, gun deaths are on pace to be the leading cause of death for \nAmericans aged 15 through 24, not because our kids are leaving the home \nfront for war, but because the home front is becoming a war zone. It is \nbecause military-style weapons are flooding our streets. It is because \nHadiya Pendleton was in the wrong place at the wrong time, even though \nshe had the right to be in the park. It is because Reverend Pinckney \nheld Bible study, and a journalist and cameraman in Virginia woke up \nand did their job. It is because a couple of teens wanted to see an Amy \nSchumer movie.\n  We have had no votes on legislation to stop this. Mr. Speaker, for \nall the talk about needing to improve our mental health system, we have \nyet to take a single vote on a comprehensive mental health bill.\n  I have had multiple bills that will reduce gun violence; but the \nsimplest one, H.R. 224, will require the Surgeon General to submit to \nCongress a report on the public health impact of gun violence.\n  Simple, right? After all, we can't have a conversation about gun \nviolence without data on the death and disability it causes, its mental \nhealth effects, its community impact, and its economic costs. Mr. \nSpeaker, this Congress has no appetite for conversations about gun \nviolence. After all, there are A ratings to protect.\n  The American people are tired, tired of their representatives paying \nlipservice to tragedies they were elected to help prevent. They are \ntired of their peace of mind being held hostage by those we should be \npreventing from ever getting their hands on a gun in the first place.\n  I am calling everyone out here today. You have talked the talk; it is \ntime to walk the walk. You say that you want to save lives, then do it.\n  Where is the background check legislation that 90 percent of \nAmericans support, including NRA members?\n  Bring my bill, H.R. 224, up for a vote, and let the Surgeon General \nsee if gun violence is a threat to public health, which I know it is. \nShow that you care. Stop pivoting. Stop punting. Start leading.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6897-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6897-H6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       HIGHWAY BEAUTIFICATION ACT\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Speaker, I rise on a lighter note, a very positive note \nbecause I represent a very beautiful and positive part of the United \nStates: the central coast of California. This is a place where you hear \nthe towns of Santa Cruz, Monterey, Pacific Grove, the beautiful fertile \nSalinas Valley, and the magnificent Big Sur coastline, which this \nposter here shows a photograph of.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today because the House of Representatives, 50 \nyears ago, passed marvelous legislation called the Highway \nBeautification Act, and that act came about because the States were \nruining the aesthetics of America. It was a bill that First Lady Lady \nBird Johnson so much supported. In fact, it became known as Lady Bird's \nbill.\n  So 50 years ago, this House of Representatives took a bold move to \nprotect and improve our scenic highways. Why are those important?\n  We sell scenery where I live. This is another picture of a scenic \nhighway in the South, in the Southern States. When you drive through \nthese, you don't see any billboards, you don't see the urban clutter, \nor, as my friend Ansel Adams said: ``You don't see the urban acne that \nis covering our roads.''\n  It is Big Business that we are fighting, because the billboard lobby \nin the United States is very powerful. It was powerful then, but the \nFirst Lady was more powerful.\n  I have a personal story in that because my father, who was in the \nCalifornia State Senate, authored the first legislation to create the \nCalifornia Scenic Highway Program. In 1966, this time of the year, Lady \nBird Johnson came all the way to California, not to campaign for a \nGovernor or United States Senator, but to recognize the work that my \nfather, State Senator Fred Farr, had done by dedicating Highway 1 in \nCalifornia, the Big Sur highway, as California's first State scenic \nhighway and perhaps the first State scenic highway in the United \nStates. It was a great day.\n  What Congress did is they ensured that States would be able to have \nmoney to enforce this billboard ban. They would give them more money if \nthey would incorporate in their State, county, and city laws billboard \nbans.\n  Now, we have a $7 billion industry out there, the outdoor advertising \nindustry, and it has been fighting highway beautification for over 50 \nyears. They have been unsuccessful at repealing the Federal law, but \nthey have made incredible progress in being able to find exemptions for \nit.\n  They have prevented the 10 percent penalty that States would receive \nfor not adopting highway beautification. They have encouraged \nlocalities to change zoning laws in rural areas, calling them \ncommercial or industrial or anything to bypass the act. And they have \nbeen able to loosen the rules on repairing old signs, allowing them to \nremain forever rather than being torn down.\n  We now have approximately 700,000 billboards in the United States, \nand yet this is a country that will be celebrating its 100th \nanniversary of our National Park System. We advertise around the world: \n``Come to beautiful America. See the scenery of America.'' In many \nplaces in America, all you see is billboard scenery.\n  So as we celebrate the 50th anniversary of this act--which is not \nwell\n\n[[Page H6898]]\n\nknown in Congress, nor in the country, yet is a very significant act \nbecause of what it did to empower States and local communities to have \nthe ability to prevent billboards from going up and giving them funds \nfor taking them down and to make sure that people are sensitive to why \nthis is important for our scenery--let's recommit to strengthening the \nprogram.\n  As I said, we sell scenery. We sell watchable wildlife. The economy \nof the central coast depends on the beauty. As long as the beauty is \nthere, people are going to come to the Carmels and Pacific Groves and \nMontereys, where California history began.\n  People are spending more money on watchable wildlife. More people are \nwatching wildlife in America than watch all of the sports combined. It \nis an unbelievable figure: of all the sports, all the football, all the \nbaseball, all the hockey, basketball, you name it, more people look at \nwildlife.\n  So let's protect what is really unique to America, something that God \ngave us and only we can destroy. These hundreds of thousands of signs \nare robbing America of its scenic view, of its iconic images that once \ndefined the open road.\n  I would like to quote Ogden Nash, who summed it up wonderfully in a \npoem, ``Song of the Open Road'':\n\n     I think that I shall never see,\n     A billboard as lovely as a tree.\n     Indeed, unless the billboards fall,\n     I will never see a tree at all.\n\n  Let's help protect America's beauty. Let's ban billboards.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6898-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       GTMO TRANSFERS TO COLORADO\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Coffman) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. COFFMAN. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the Obama \nadministration's announcement last week that the President is \nconsidering transferring detainees held at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, into \nmy home State of Colorado.\n  Closing Guantanamo Bay was an ill-advised campaign promise in 2007 \nmade by the President, a promise made before he began receiving \nclassified intelligence updates.\n  In fact, as of March 2015, the Director of National Intelligence \nreported that 29 percent of detainees released from Guantanamo have \nengaged in or were suspected of engaging in terrorist or insurgent \nactivity. Those who remain in Guantanamo are ``worst of the worst.'' So \nit is safe to presume that, if released, an even higher percentage of \nthem will remain a threat to our national security.\n  I struggle to understand why we would close the Guantanamo Bay \ndetention camp only to finance the incarceration of enemy combatants \nwithin the United States.\n  Ever since 2012, Congress has passed and President Obama has signed \nannual restrictions against the transfer of prisoners at GTMO to the \nUnited States. The same restrictions are found in the FY 2016 National \nDefense Authorization Act passed by the House last week, despite \nPresident Obama's promise to veto that bill.\n  There is broad bipartisan opposition to President Obama's plans to \ntransfer GTMO prisoners into the United States, both among Members of \nCongress and the American people.\n  For our Nation's security, I implore President Obama to sign the \nNational Defense Authorization Act when it reaches his desk and halt \nhis reckless plan to place many of the world's worst terrorists on U.S. \nsoil, where they will have all of the due process protections provided \nto the American people and, thus, could be released through our court \nsystem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6898-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6898]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CRISPUS ATTUCKS MEN'S BASKETBALL TEAM\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIndiana (Mr. Carson) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CARSON of Indiana. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to pay tribute to \nthe 1955 Crispus Attucks men's basketball team, the first all-African \nAmerican high school athletic team to win a championship, not only in \nthe great Hoosier State, but in the United States.\n  Although the school was initially constructed out of pressure to \nsegregate Indianapolis high schools, Crispus Attucks High School \nquickly became a source of pride for the African American community in \nIndianapolis and across the great Hoosier State.\n  However, despite its historic championship victory, the Crispus \nAttucks High School basketball team did not receive the praise and \nrecognition traditionally bestowed upon previous State champions.\n  After its win, the team took the traditional ride on a fire truck \nfrom Butler Fieldhouse to Monument Circle in downtown Indianapolis, but \nthe team was not allowed to get off the truck at the Circle for the \ntraditional photo sessions. Instead, the fire truck took one more lap \nand then headed back into the city's Black neighborhood.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, 60 years later I stand along all Hoosiers to \nrecognize these men for their trailblazing efforts in bringing our city \ntogether through high school sports. Their win was a major first step \nfor African American athletes across our country, breaking the barriers \nof segregation and setting the stage for the diversity that we see \ntoday.\n  Mr. Speaker, today I am joining my colleague in the Senate, Senator \nJoe Donnelly, to give these men the recognition they deserve. It is \nlong overdue, but I hope it helps to bring some attention to their \namazing accomplishments.\n  I ask that my colleagues join us today in recognizing the 1955 \nCrispus Attucks men's basketball team and thank them for bringing \ntremendous pride to the citizens of Indianapolis and to people of all \nraces across our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6898-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6898-H6899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      ZADROGA ACT REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Crowley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Speaker, I wish I could count how many times Members \nof Congress have come to this floor about the need to ``never forget'' \nSeptember 11, 9/11, its victims, and our first responders.\n  Members have offered resolutions, have given speeches, have come to \nthe floor with shocking images that are already seared into our minds \nforever. Through it all, we hear this refrain of ``never forget.'' I \nknow I will never forget. I will never forget the friends and the \nfamily member I lost that day.\n  I have constituents who will never forget. They will never forget the \nphone call they may have received that day of a loved one lost or the \nneighbor they saw for the very last time. When I visit a firehouse in \nWoodside, in Maspeth, in Sunnyside in Queens, or in Throgs Neck in the \nBronx, I know they will never forget.\n  I also know this is not just about my constituents, not just about my \ncity of New York, not just about my State of New York, but this is \nabout the United States of America. I know that Americans will never \nforget the days, the weeks, the months spent, by the men and women who \nworked on the pile, trying to rescue and save lives, the recovery, and \nthe eventual cleanup efforts that took place in Lower Manhattan.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, the only people I believe who seem in danger of \nforgetting are my colleagues right here in the House of \nRepresentatives. That is the only explanation I can give for why they \nlet the James Zadroga 9/11 Health Act expire last week.\n  They are forgetting the promise that this Congress, that our country, \nmade to these first responders, the survivors, and other volunteers in \nthe days that followed September 11.\n  We all made a promise to them that they would not be left behind, \nthey would not be ignored, left to fend for themselves. It took far too \nlong for the Zadroga Act to become a law in the first place.\n  Those are difficult years to have to keep telling 9/11 heroes: Just \nwait a little longer. We will get there. But, eventually, we did get it \ndone because it was the right thing to do.\n  It would be easy for my colleagues to shrug their shoulders and say \nthey did their part, to think that we have wiped our hands of the \nentire issue. But the need is still there. The pain and the suffering \nare still there. So we must act and we must act now.\n  A few weeks ago hundreds of first responders came to Washington, \nD.C.,\n\n[[Page H6899]]\n\nfrom all over the country--not just New York--who were affected by 9/11 \nto look Members of Congress in the eye and ask them to renew this \nworthy program. They had meetings. They held press conferences. They \neven brought a celebrity spokesperson to draw attention to their cause.\n  Toward the end of the day, one gentleman said that he probably \nwouldn't be coming back to push Congress on this issue in the future. \nNow, I wish that none of them would have to come back because we would \nbe able to tell them that we took action and permanently established \nthis program.\n  But the reason he is not going to be coming back is because he has \nstage 4 cancer, stage 4 cancer as a result of his work on the pile, \nlooking for his friends. He may not be coming back at all. That is what \nthis is about. That is who we are talking about.\n  Every day first responders, cleanup workers, and volunteers are \nstruggling with health conditions caused by the effects of the attack \nof 9/11. They have doctors' appointments, tests, treatments, \nchemotherapy.\n  And they can't do it alone. That is why we put this program in place \nin the first place, to help those who can't do it alone, to not just \nthank them for their service, but to give back to them what they have \ngiven to us.\n  These heroes should be thanked every day for what they have done. \nThey deserve our thanks. They deserve to be honored and applauded and \nto have floor speech after floor speech given in their name.\n  But they deserve more than just words. They deserve action by this \nHouse, action that we must--not just should--but we must take to ensure \nthat this program will continue to be there for those who need it.\n  Our heroes deserve better. We hear a lot about ``never forget.'' I \nwant to suggest that we never use the term ``never forget'' here on the \nfloor, ``never forget 9/11,'' until we pass a permanent extension of \nthe James Zadroga Health Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6899-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6899]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        GUN VIOLENCE PREVENTION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Speier) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. SPEIER. Mr. Speaker, I am sick to my stomach this morning because \nwe have just witnessed the 45th school shooting this year. There have \nbeen more than 294 mass shootings this year, and we have only had 272 \ndays this year.\n  I am not going to stand for another moment of silence on this floor \nunless it is joined with meaningful action. It is a hollow gesture to \nact like we care for these families when the truth is we don't care \nenough to act.\n  Twenty-six times since Sandy Hook we have paused on this floor, we \nhave paused to give our prayers and our sympathy to the families who \nhave lost loved ones. But what are we doing for the next set of \nfamilies that are going to lose loved ones?\n  We are going to do nothing, absolutely nothing. In fact, we create \nmore credibility in the fictionalized ``death panels'' than we do about \nthe actual deaths of innocent schoolchildren, college students, and \nmoviegoers.\n  This is the truth: In America, more preschoolers are shot dead each \nyear than police officers killed in the line of duty. Ninety-two \nAmericans are shot to death each and every day. Ninety-two will be shot \nto death today. Do we care enough to do anything?\n  If there were that many people dying each day due to terrorism, \ndisease, faulty consumer products, you bet we would do something, but \nnot when it comes to guns. When it comes to guns, we can only muster \nenough to stand up on this floor and be silent. What a tragedy.\n  Our inaction means we are willing to let thousands of our fellow \ncitizens die so we can prop up the myth that gun violence measures, \nwhich the Supreme Court has ruled ironclad under the Constitution, will \nsomehow undermine the Second Amendment.\n  By refusing to adopt the mental health and background check measures \nsupported by 90 percent of the population and 74 percent of NRA \nmembers, we are doing the bidding of the NRA lobbyists and the gun \nmanufacturers. We are not standing side by side with the victims of \nUmpqua and Charleston and Sandy Hook. We are shrugging and saying, \n``Eh, stuff happens.''\n  Stuff does not just happen. As you can see on this chart, gun \nviolence is dramatically down in States that have passed strong gun \nviolence prevention laws. You can see the trends in other \nindustrialized countries that have reacted wisely to gun violence.\n  Australia had 13 mass shootings over 18 years. But then they put in \nstrong laws to protect against gun violence, and they haven't had one \nmass shooting since then.\n  In Canada and Norway, also, they tightened their gun laws in the wake \nof mass shootings, and gun violence rates are a fraction today of what \nthey were. These countries are our closest allies. They are not Fascist \nregimes. If they can do it, we can do it.\n  We need to make mental health reporting laws universal and enforce \nthe ones already on the books. It is shameful that eight States have no \nmental health reporting laws and 13 States have submitted fewer than \n100 mental health records each to the national background check system.\n  By the way, Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn says that his measure is \nthe solution. He has even introduced his own bill, but he and his \nCaucus have declined to advance it.\n  We have to make background checks universal by closing the gun show \nloophole and the loophole for online sales. These loopholes allow \ncriminals, drug abusers, and mentally ill people who are already banned \nfrom having guns to get guns. Finally, we need to lift the ban on NIH \nand CDC research.\n  Mr. Speaker, I will not stand for another one of these hypocritical \nmoments of silence, but I will stand up for any effort we make to pass \nsensible and genuine gun safety laws. Lipservice alone is a disservice \nto these families and the next families who don't want our prayers, but \nwant the lives of their loved ones back.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6899-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6899-H6900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                  CALIFORNIA DROUGHT CAUSING SUFFERING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Valadao) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VALADAO. Mr. Speaker, today I had the opportunity and the honor \nto represent my district on the Senate side in a committee to talk \nabout water, and it was to talk about the bill that we passed off this \nHouse floor just a few months ago back in June. Obviously, I was very \nexcited to move that forward and excited to see the debate move \nforward. This is something that I think we need to talk about a little \nbit more here on the floor, not just in the Senate because I think \npeople need to remember what we are talking about.\n  I had this picture taken just last week in my district. When people \nsay a picture is worth a thousand words, you look at this picture, and \nyou try to think of just a few different words that this brings to \nmind. You see houses here in the background, but you obviously see \nshacks here. You see a child's stroller, a child's toy, cans of food, a \nbox from one of our local food banks.\n  These are people who are suffering today. This is in the United \nStates of America. These are people who so many in this body claim to \nrepresent, so many in this body talk about, but when we see so many in \nthis body sign letters, speak out in opposition to legislation that \ncould help solve this problem, these people are suffering not because \nof a lack of the will to work but because we are facing a drought, and \nalso because of legislation, because laws are in place that prevent us \nfrom delivering water to these communities.\n  These are people who want to make a difference. A lot of them might \nbe immigrants. Some of them probably are people born in this country, \nbut they are people that want to achieve the American Dream. A couple \nweeks ago when the Pope was here, he said so many things that both \nsides agreed with and some things that both sides disagreed with, but \nwhat he said was that every man has the right to work, to earn an \nhonest day's wage. These people are being denied that opportunity.\n  Just beyond these shacks, you see homes. They look relatively new. \nYou see a business here. You see trucks. Those are all people who have \nthe ability to support themselves, but they are also people who right \nbehind, in their own backyard, that don't have the ability to work that \nhonest day's wage, to supply for their family, to buy new toys for \ntheir kids, to actually afford\n\n[[Page H6900]]\n\nfood that was grown and produced by their own hands. Some of these food \nproducts might even be from other countries.\n  When we have that conversation here about helping the less fortunate, \ndo we just throw money at a problem? Is that what Washington does? Is \nthat what we expect to have here? Is that what builds a great society? \nOr is it people working hard, providing for their families, educating \ntheir next generation on what it is like to actually grow food, what it \nis actually like to put in a hard day's work, to inspire and actually \nshow what it is to work hard and produce something for yourself?\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  The pride that comes with earning that paycheck and purchasing that \nhouse or purchasing those vehicles or purchasing food for your family \nis what we want to provide for Americans. That is something that I \nthink every single person--immigrant or American citizen by birth or \nwho has been here for 20 generations, whatever it may be--wants to \nhave, the opportunity to provide for their families and for a better \nlife.\n  When you look at this picture, it is insane that this is going on \ntoday. And when people sign and put their names on or trash legislation \nthat can help solve this problem, I think it is an embarrassment for \nthis House and for this country.\n  There was water flowing through the delta that we had the opportunity \nto pump earlier this year. Would it have solved all of our problems? \nNo, because we are in a drought. But there was still some water there. \nWe missed out on that opportunity because of laws that are in place \ntoday.\n  These people don't have to be in this position. These people don't \nhave to live like this. Their children do not have to live in those \nshacks and play with their toys outside of their home. Think of what \ntype of society allows this to happen, by allowing legislation or laws \nto take effect that have done nothing to actually protect the species \nthey claim to protect, as that species continues to be in decline. We \nsee what is going on here and how it does nothing for these people.\n  We talk about the environment. Is this an environment to raise a \nfamily? How are these children going to be successful in school? I have \ngot three young children of my own. I have nieces and nephews. I would \nnever, ever want to see this happen to them, and I would never want \nthem to see this happen to their friends.\n  This is something that is happening today because of the laws that \nthis building protects. And we have got to continue to fight and we \nhave got to continue to work together so that we can deliver solutions \nthat actually help these people have that American Dream, just like the \nrest of us want for our children.\n  Today, at the end of my speech to a Senate committee, I invited the \nSenators to come take some time and meet with some of these folks or \nsee what it is like to actually live like this. I extend that invite to \nevery Member of this House, especially those who speak out in \nopposition to legislation that can help prevent things like this from \nhappening.\n  I want them to come, knock on these doors, and talk to these people \nand see what they want more than anything. Do they want a handout or do \nthey want the ability to produce and to provide for their families and \nshow their children what the next generation should do, which is work \nhard and help build that American Dream for all of us?\n  I want every single person who speaks out in opposition to take a \ngood, hard look at this and see what we have created in the United \nStates unless we speak up and do what is right: pass legislation that \ncan help solve this problem so we can deliver water for these families, \nfor these farmers, for our communities, and do what is right for our \nNation and do what is right for the American people.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6900-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            HONORING OUR WWII MERCHANT MARINERS ACT OF 2015\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, words cannot explain the singular \nhonor it is to stand in the well of the House of Representatives in the \nCongress of the United States of America.\n  Mr. Speaker, I stand here today on a mission of mercy. I believe a \nbrief vignette can best explain what a mission of mercy is as I apply \nit to the circumstances for which I rise.\n  Mr. Speaker, prior to coming to Congress, I served for more than a \nquarter of a century as a judge of a small claims justice court. I can \nremember an occasion when a mother testified on behalf of her son. Her \nappeal to me was along these lines. She said: Judge, I am not asking \nyou for justice. I know he was wrong. But he is my son. I know he was \nwrong. I am not asking for justice. I am asking you for mercy. You have \nwithin your power to do justice or you can grant mercy, and I beg that \nyou grant mercy to my son.\n  That was her hue and cry.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, as I rise today, I rise in support of H.R. 563, \nsponsored by the Honorable Janice Hahn. I rise in support of this \nlegislation, which is the Honoring Our WWII Merchant Mariners Act of \n2015.\n  This bill would establish the Merchant Marine Equity Compensation \nFund. It would accord each person who served between certain dates--\nDecember 7, 1941, through December 31, 1946--a sum of $25,000.\n  Why should they receive the $25,000? Well, Mr. Speaker, when they \nserved in World War II, they were not accorded the benefits other \nmembers of the various Armed Forces were. In fact, it took litigation \nto bring them under the purview of benefits that the other members of \nthe Armed Forces have received and are now receiving.\n  It was in 1988 that they finally, after litigation, received these \nbenefits, but the benefits were not applied retroactively. As a result \nof them not being applied retroactively, some of them didn't receive GI \nBill benefits. They didn't receive home loans. Many of them, still \nalive, can be compensated if we grant mercy.\n  I know that there are those who would say that they already received \ntheir just compensation as a result of the litigation and as a result \nof being brought within the purview of the laws that allow them to \nreceive certain benefits, but they didn't get them retroactively.\n  I believe, Mr. Speaker, they served honorably. As a matter of fact, \napproximately 9,500 of them died in service. They served their country. \nThey bled the same blood as others when they were attacked and \nassaulted and when they lost limbs and their lives.\n  They are Americans, Mr. Speaker. And I believe we should show some \nmercy to these Americans. We ought to accord them the opportunity to \nhave these benefits because they were willing to risk their lives so \nthat we could have the quality of life that we have today.\n  So I make this hue and cry and appeal. I base it upon mercy, not \njustice. The arguments can be made as to whether just compensation has \nbeen accorded; but I believe that, if we show mercy, we will do the \nright thing for people who have done the right thing for their country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6900-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6900]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in \nrecognition of October being Domestic Violence Awareness Month.\n  Domestic violence affects people across the Nation, including one in \nfour women and one in seven men who have suffered severe physical \nviolence.\n  In my district, I want to recognize the efforts of the Clothesline \nProject, an initiative which features T-shirts decorated by domestic \nviolence survivors. In preparation for Domestic Violence Awareness \nMonth, people from across the Clarion County, Pennsylvania, area have \nparticipated in this project, decorating shirts which were displayed \nduring last Saturday's Autumn Leaf Parade in Clarion.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is such an important effort because last year 97 \npeople died as a result of domestic violence in Pennsylvania. It is a \nwide age range. In fact, one was an infant.\n  I appreciate the efforts of the Clothesline Project and all the \nnonprofit and community organizations across my district working to \nbring attention to this critical issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6901-8", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n      RECOGNIZING 90TH ANNIVERSARY OF PHINEAS BANNING HIGH SCHOOL\n\n  (Ms. HAHN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. HAHN.

It was named after General \nPhineas Banning, known as the ``Father of the Port of Los Angeles,'' \nthus the school's mascot, the Pilots.\n  Banning has earned a reputation as an athletic powerhouse. The Pilots \nhold the title for the second-most CIS championships in the entire city \nof Los Angeles.\n  Over the past 90 years, Banning High School hasn't lost sight of its \ncore mission: to educate the young people of Wilmington and to prepare \nthem for their future.\n  It is an impressive alumni that have gone on to be NFL stars, Olympic \nathletes, actors, CEOs, scientists, and educators. Many of my friends \nand members of my staff went to Banning High School. They can trace \nlifelong friendships and some of their fondest memories to their time \nthere.\n  Tomorrow night Banning will celebrate its milestone at its homecoming \nfootball game against the San Pedro Pirates. Both schools are in my \ndistrict, however; so, I am not taking sides. But I want to wish both \nteams good luck and wish the Pilots a happy 90th birthday.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6901-9", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6901]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LIFTING THE CRUDE OIL BAN\n\n  (Mr. ZINKE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of lifting the ban on crude \noil exports. It means jobs, 500,000 to 1 million jobs across the \ncountry and 2,400 jobs in Montana, with a revenue of at least $120 \nmillion.\n  As a former Navy SEAL commander, I understand the importance of \nnational security. I do not want this Nation to be reliant on foreign \nenergy sources and be held hostage by foreign countries for our energy \nneeds.\n  It has been a longstanding policy of this country to be energy \nindependent, and lifting the crude oil ban is part of that.\n  Lowering gas prices: All estimates look at lowering the gas prices by \n1.5 to 13 cents a gallon. That is real savings to every American \nfamily.\n  I urge the Senate to take this up. This is not a partisan issue. This \nis not a Republican or a Democrat issue. This is a national security \nissue. So I ask the Senate to take it up. I am confident it will come \nout of the House in numbers that are bipartisan.\n  Anyone who votes against releasing the ban--there is only one country \non the face of the planet that has a ban on crude oil, and that is \nhere. Even Iraq and Iran can export their crude.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6901-10", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6901-H6902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          ENDING GUN VIOLENCE\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize October as Domestic \nViolence Awareness Month.\n  Violence against women is not a partisan problem. It is an American \nproblem. So it demands a bipartisan solution.\n  As a father, son, and husband, to me, this issue is about protecting \nfamilies, plain and simple. Unfortunately, debate in Washington is \noften dominated by the same tired politics, divisive rhetoric, and by \nthe misguided notion that some issues are just too tough to take on.\n  We can't allow this gridlock to stop us from working to ensure that \nevery woman feels safe and every child lives free from fear.\n  That is why I helped introduce the Zero Tolerance for Domestic \nAbusers Act. This bill is a commonsense solution to bring Federal law \nin line with over 30 States that already have protections in place to \nkeep guns out of the hands of abusers, to protect families, and to curb \ndomestic abuse by preventing domestic violence from becoming domestic \nmurder.\n  Together, we can make our country safer, which is why I encourage my \ncolleagues to join me on this important legislation, supporting safety \nand security for all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6902-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6902]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n    HONORING DOLORES HUERTA FOR A LIFETIME OF SERVICE AND THE 85TH \n                        ANNIVERSARY OF HER BIRTH\n\n  (Mr. McNERNEY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. McNERNEY.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. \n702, to lift the outdated ban on U.S. crude oil exports.\n  This 40-year-old ban was enacted during the time of oil scarcity in \nthe 1970s in an effort to preserve domestic oil reserves and discharge \nforeign imports. Today the ban is driving up the price at the pump \nwhile discouraging American energy independence.\n  The United States is now the largest oil producer in the world, \nproducing more barrels per day than Saudi Arabia or Russia, but we \ncannot take full advantage of this strength without the ability to \nexport crude oil as the boom in domestic oil production has surpassed \nthe ability for our domestic refiners to process crude oil for export.\n  The ban on crude oil exports was created in reaction to market \nconditions at the time. These conditions no longer exist. While the \nPresident is opening up oil markets for Iran with a nuclear agreement, \nU.S. oil producers should have the same access to the global market.\n  It is time to lift the ban on crude oil exports.

Thanks to her \nvision, ``The Beth'' instituted a number of community service programs \nthat continue to this day, including Adopt a Child Christmas Program.\n  Last month, I had the honor of participating in a ceremony to change \nthe name of Newark's Osborne Terrace to ``Alma Beatty Way.''

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, I yield the \ncustomary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Hastings), \npending which I yield myself such time as I may consume. During \nconsideration of this resolution, all time yielded is for the purpose \nof debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alabama?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, H. Res. 466 provides for consideration of \nH.R. 538, the Native American Energy Act, and H.R. 702, which would \nrepeal the ban on exporting crude oil. H. Res. 466 calls for a \nstructured rule which makes in order 12 total amendments, including 7 \nminority amendments and 2 bipartisan amendments. Both of these bills \ndeal with easing the regulatory burden when it comes to the energy \nsector.\n  Being from coastal Alabama, I have a great appreciation for the \nimpact the energy sector has on our economy, and I am a strong \nsupporter of an all-of-the-above approach to energy production. \nUnfortunately, Washington has a bad habit of putting up costly barriers \nthat make it harder for the energy sector to grow and create new jobs. \nToday is about getting some of these barriers out of the way and \nunlocking our Nation's energy potential. One of the bills, the Native \nAmerican Energy Act, would roll back the overregulation of Indian lands \nand encourage energy development by Indian tribes and Alaska Native \nCorporations.\n  From streamlining duplicative Federal processes to increasing tribal \ncontrol over natural resource development, this bill includes important \nreforms to unlock the precious energy resources on tribal land and to \nallow these tribes to take more control of their energy assets. In \nfact, a 2015 report from the Government Accountability Office found \nthat ``Indian energy resources hold significant potential for \ndevelopment, but remain largely undeveloped.''\n  Mr. Speaker, they remain largely undeveloped because the Federal \nGovernment is standing in the way. This has resulted in lost revenue \nfor Indian tribes, and it is time we fix this problem.\n  This commonsense legislation has strong support from tribes across \nthe Nation, including the Southern Ute Indian Tribe, the Confederated \nTribes of the Colville Reservation, the Intertribal Timber Council, the \nNavaho Nation, Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation \nin North Dakota, and the National Congress of American Indians. It is \ntime the Federal Government gets out of the way and allows tribal \nnations to manage their land how they see fit, without the heavy hand \nof government getting in the way.\n  The second bill covered by this rule would end the outdated ban on \ncrude oil exports. The ban was first put in place in 1975 as a response \nto the Arab oil embargo, but it is clearly no longer necessary, and it \nis tying our hands both economically and strategically around the \nworld.\n  Over the last decade, the United States has become the leading \nproducer of oil and natural gas in the world, which is good news for \nthe countless Americans who work in the oil industry, and it is even \nbetter news for the American economy.\n  Mr. Speaker, there is broad, bipartisan support for lifting the 40-\nyear-old ban on crude oil exports. Leading economists, including former \nObama economic policy adviser Lawrence Summers, and leading scholars at \nHarvard University support lifting the ban. Former U.N. Ambassador and \nEnergy Secretary under President Clinton Bill Richardson said that the \nU.S. needs to export our oil and gas in order to ``help us \ngeopolitically in Eastern Europe against Russia.''\n  Recently, 135 senior legislative leaders from 40 States and Puerto \nRico sent a letter calling on Congress to lift the ban. The letter \nnotes that ``the outdated Federal export restrictions on crude oil and \nLNG are detrimental to American workers, our collective security, and \neconomic recovery in our States.'' There were three signers of the \nletter from Mr. Hastings' home State of Florida.\n  Numerous editorial boards around the country, including those at The \nWall Street Journal, The Washington Post, The Detroit News, The Denver \nPost, The Washington Times, and the Houston Chronicle have touted the \nbenefits of ending the ban.\n  Most notably, 69 percent of American people support lifting this ban. \nShouldn't we stand with the American people?\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, let's talk about some of the benefits from lifting \nthe outdated ban.\n\n[[Page H6904]]\n\n  First, it is estimated that this legislation would create 630,000 \nadditional U.S. jobs by 2019. Lifting the ban would also benefit U.S. \nmanufacturers and boost our GDP.\n  Second, the Congressional Budget Office estimates that lifting the \nban would generate $1.4 billion from oil and gas leases over the next \n10 years. That is really a significant number.\n  Third, the Government Accountability Office found that lifting the \nban would lower gas prices by anywhere from 1.5 to 13 cents per gallon. \nEven President Obama's own Department of Energy found that increased \noil exports would help lower gas prices.\n  Fourth, lifting the ban will allow the United States to help our \nallies abroad. For example, Russia has continuously used their control \nover oil to pressure European countries to comply with Russia's wishes. \nIf a country refused, Russia would threaten to cut off their energy \nsupply. By lifting the ban, the United States can begin supporting our \nallies and, in turn, weaken Russia's grip on many European countries.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is very interesting that this administration has \nworked hard to open up oil export capabilities for Iran, yet they are \nrefusing to allow the United States to do so. By allowing Iran to \nexport oil, the President has essentially given the Ayatollah a leg up \nin the global marketplace, placing the strategic interests of Iran over \nthose of the United States. This is yet another example of the \nPresident of the United States standing with the people of Iran and the \nAyatollah and not standing up for the people of America. These are four \nvery clear benefits for repealing the ban and unlocking our Nation's \nenergy potential.\n\n  Now, the White House has said they believe lifting the oil export ban \nis a decision that should be made by the Commerce Department, not by \nCongress. So let me get this straight: The Obama administration would \nrather unelected, unaccountable Federal bureaucrats at the Department \nof Commerce make this decision instead of the democratically elected \nCongress? I think that speaks to a far larger problem with this White \nHouse and how they believe our government should work.\n  Ultimately, Mr. Speaker, both of these bills are about empowering the \nAmerican people and getting the government out of the way. These bills \nboth have broad support, and I urge my colleagues to approve this rule. \nLet's move forward on passing these commonsense bills.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Alabama for yielding me the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of both H.R. 702, \nlegislation to adapt to the changing crude oil market conditions, and \nH.R. 538, the Native American Energy Act.\n  As we have seen time and again in what can only be described as \ntypical Republican fashion, we have again skirted regular order. As a \nmatter of fact, whatever happened to regular order in this institution? \nIt seems to have gone by the boards. Here we are considering two \nunrelated pieces of legislation under one grab-bag rule.\n  What is more, instead of striving to roll back environmental \nprotections, we should be working in a bipartisan manner to avoid a \ngovernment shutdown in December, address the debt ceiling, pass a long-\nterm transportation bill so that we can rebuild our crumbling \ninfrastructure and put Americans back to work, and reauthorize the \nExport-Import Bank, the charter of which Republicans allowed to expire \n100 days ago.\n  Mr. Speaker, the 1973 oil embargo sparked a crisis in our country \nthat continues to influence our energy policies today. H.R. 702, the \nfirst of the bills we are debating today, makes significant changes to \nthe Energy Policy and Conservation Act, the primary statute for \nrestricting the export of domestically produced crude oil that was \nenacted in the wake of the embargo.\n  It goes without saying that the energy situation in the United States \nis far different today than it was in the 1970s when the oil export ban \nbegan. Global crude oil prices fell to 6\\1/2\\-year lows in August. We \nhave such a surplus of oil that the number of rigs drilling for oil in \nthe United States dropped to 614 last week, down from 1,609 last \nOctober. Based on these facts, it would behoove us to reexamine this \nexport ban.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  But, Mr. Speaker, H.R. 702 unwisely repeals the authority of the \nPresident to restrict the export of petroleum products or natural gas \nand prohibits any Federal official from imposing or enforcing \nrestrictions on the export of crude oil.\n  Last night in the Rules Committee I asked the question whether \nPresident Obama deserves any credit for the lower gas prices. \nCertainly, when gas prices were higher, he received an awful lot of \ncriticism and blame. It would seem to me that, with the increased \nnumber of leases that he has allowed, he should get some credit at \nleast.\n  Moreover, the bill makes it virtually impossible to limit exports of \ncoal, natural gas, petroleum products, and petrochemical feedstocks. \nRepealing this authority would eliminate our ability to restrict the \nexport of any of these products.\n  Lifting this ban would provide a gift to oil companies on top of the \ndecades of lucrative subsidies the industry already receives by the \nAmerican taxpayers. Enough is enough.\n  I would also note that the term--and I brought it up in the Rules \nCommittee last night and didn't get a clear answer--the term \n``restriction'' is undefined. Let me quote my good friend Frank Pallone \nof New Jersey, the ranking member of the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce.\n  He said: Since the term ``restriction'' is undefined, any Federal \naction that could potentially impede the efficient exploration, \nproduction, storage, supply, marketing, pricing, and regulation of \nenergy resources--including fossil fuels--could be considered a \nrestriction.\n  For instance, an order to shut down a pipeline that has been \ndetermined to be a hazard to public safety and the environment under \nthe Pipeline Safety Act could be seen as a restriction.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 538 suffers from similar deficiencies. H.R. 538 has \nthe stated purpose of empowering Native American tribes to utilize and \ndevelop energy resources on their lands.\n  I hesitate because I don't understand what part of sovereignty with \nreference to Native Americans in this country we do not understand; \ntherefore, they should not have to be here hat in hand about their own \nresources.\n  But tribal lands often hold great potential for domestic energy \nproduction; yet, tribes often cannot harness the full economic \ndevelopment potential of their natural resources. But this bill tries \nto solve this problem by undercutting important environmental \nprotections.\n  In the name of encouraging energy production on tribal lands, this \nbill severely restricts public involvement and comment on proposed \nenergy projects, prevents the recovery of attorneys' fees in cases \nchallenging these new energy projects, effectively chilling the \npublic's ability to bring bona fide claims to seek judicial redress for \nenvironmental harms in their community.\n  And just for good measure, this legislation blocks any commonsense \nhydraulic fracturing rules. Instead of undermining the bedrock of our \nNation's vital environmental protections, we should focus on real, \nconstructive reforms that will achieve tribal self-determination in \nenergy development without sacrificing commonsense environmental laws.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the esteemed gentleman \nfrom Montana (Mr. Zinke).\n  Mr. ZINKE. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 538, the Native \nAmerican Energy Act.\n  Mr. Young, my esteemed colleague from Alaska, I commend him on his \nefforts over the years. This represents a significant step for tribes \nacross the country, especially in my State of Montana.\n  I have only been in the seat for a few months, and I can tell you \nthat the Federal Government has infringed on the sovereignty of our \ntribes to develop their own natural resources.\n  What is sovereignty? Sovereignty is not going through a labyrinth of \nrules that are far greater than other Federal\n\n[[Page H6905]]\n\nlands or State lands. It is not right. It is not right for the Crow \npeople. It is not right for every Indian nation across this land.\n  The government has infringed. The GAO report examines it and states \nas much. The Crow tribe, a proud tribe in Montana, wants to be self-\nsufficient. They want to make sure that they have a prosperous economy \nand do right by their people; yet, the chairman, Old Coyote, has said a \nwar on coal is a war on the Crow people. And he is right.\n  There is no better job on the Crow reservation than a coal job. There \nis no better future than to have access to the 9 billion tons of coal \nthat are locked in the ground that they can't develop and they can't \ndevelop in the interest of their own people because the Federal \nGovernment is in the way.\n  This bill doesn't skirt environmental rules or laws. What it does is \nit streamlines a position, streamlines their sovereignty and their \nrights, and that is important.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, my colleagues, this is not a Democrat or a \nRepublican issue. This is an American issue, and it is about respect.\n  I ask all Members to respect the native tribes, respect their right \nto sovereignty, respect their right for self-determination.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Background checks are the first line of defense to keep guns out of \nthe hands of criminals. If we defeat the previous question, I am going \nto offer an amendment to the rule to bring up legislation that would \nexpand the current background check system to include all commercial \nsales of firearms.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Florida?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 5 minutes to \nthe gentleman from California (Mr. Thompson), my good friend, to \ndiscuss our proposal. He is the chair of the House Gun Violence \nPrevention Task Force.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of California. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule today and in support of \nbringing the bipartisan King-Thompson background check bill to the \nfloor for a vote.\n  Let me give you some numbers: 278, the number of mass shootings in \nour country since Newtown; 275, the number of days this Congress has \nbeen in session; 16, the number of gun-related moments of silence \nCongress has held since the start of last year; and 0, the number of \nvotes this body has taken to help prevent or lessen gun violence.\n  Just a week ago we endured another mass shooting. This time it was \nnine people at a community college in Oregon. Six weeks ago it was a \nnews reporter and cameraman in Virginia. Five weeks before that it was \ntwo people at the movies in Lafayette. Five weeks before that it was a \nprayer group in Charleston.\n\n  Every single time a mass shooting happens we go through the same \nroutine--thoughts and prayers are sent; statements are made; stories \nare written; moments of silence are held--and nothing changes. No \naction is taken. No votes are cast.\n  It has been said that insanity is doing the same thing over and over \nagain and expecting different results. The majority leadership has done \nnothing over and over again. Predictably, the results have been the \nsame: more innocent lives lost, more families forever changed, and more \nmass gun violence.\n  The five Republican coauthors of our background check bill \nnotwithstanding, my colleagues on the other side of the aisle have done \nnothing as mass gun violence has become commonplace. No bills have been \nbrought to the floor. No ideas have been brought to the table. No \nproposals have even been considered.\n  You have the majority in the House and in the Senate. You have a \nWhite House and a Democratic Caucus willing to work with you. You are \npresumably here to govern and lead. A big part of that means stepping \nup when children, students, and families are routinely put in danger.\n  Gun violence takes the lives of 30-plus Americans every single day. \nIt constitutes a public health emergency that demands action from the \npublic's leaders. We have it in our power to do something. Let's not \nwaste that.\n  We don't know what laws could have prevented the shooting in Oregon \nor Virginia or Charleston, but we do know that every day background \nchecks stop more than 170 felons, some 50 domestic abusers, and nearly \n20 fugitives from buying a gun. We know they help keep guns from \ndangerous people, and that saves lives.\n  This isn't about the Second Amendment. I am a hunter and I am a gun \nowner. I support the Second Amendment. If the King-Thompson background \ncheck bill undermined the rights of gun owners, my name wouldn't be on \nit.\n  This is about keeping guns from criminals, domestic abusers, and the \ndangerously mentally ill. It is about taking a simple, commonsense step \nto keep spouses, kids, and communities safe.\n  All this bill does is require a background check for people buying a \ngun online or at a gun show. Why would anyone not want to make sure the \npeople buying guns on the Internet or at a gun show are sane, law-\nabiding citizens? We do it at licensed dealers, why not for all \ncommercial sales? Why do we want to give criminals, domestic abusers, \nand the dangerously mentally ill a huge loophole through which they can \nbuy guns? It makes no sense.\n  We can do one of two things here today. We can wait out the new \ncycle, allow the horror of Oregon to fade into our minds, do nothing, \nwait for the next tragedy, and then offer thoughts and prayers. That \nwould be nothing new.\n  It is what the majority did with Newtown. It is what they did with \nNavy Yard. It is what they did with Isla Vista, Charleston, and \nVirginia. This time could be different. We could actually pull together \nand do something to make our country safer.\n  No legislation will stop every shooting. But passing commonsense gun \nlaws like background checks will at least stop some, and that makes it \nworth doing. Don't sit here and let America's new normal become mass \ngun violence followed by thoughts and prayers, but no action. We are \nhere to govern. This is happening on our watch, and it is within our \npower to save some lives. Let's do it.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to yield 2 minutes to the \ngentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Boustany), who is a tireless advocate for \nthe energy interests of his State of Louisiana.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, let's look at the facts. I support this \nrule and I support the underlying legislation, H.R. 702, which would \nlift the ban on oil exports for this country.\n  The United States is the only oil-producing country that has a self-\nimposed ban, and it makes no sense. It doesn't fit within our own views \nof open trade, open energy markets.\n  Why did this come about? It came about because in the 1970s we moved \ninto an age of scarcity with regard to energy. Our producers could not \nkeep up with demand.\n  American innovation, American technology, has solved that. Now we \nhave moved into an era of abundance. This is a time where we can \nactually change the entire landscape of energy security not only for \nthe United States, but also for our allies, and reap major economic \nbenefit by lifting the ban.\n  When we came out of the recession, energy jobs helped lift us out of \nthat recession. The shale revolution was a major factor. What we are \nseeing now with slack demand and the abundance and a lot of oil sitting \nthat is not being used in refineries has caused slacking in prices and \njob loss.\n  We can reverse that by lifting the ban and giving American producers \naccess to the market, just like everybody else that produces oil. Why \nshould the Iranians be able to sell oil on the open market and we have \na self-imposed ban on American energy producers? It makes no sense at \nall.\n  Secondly, if we lift the ban, this is a first and necessary step, I \nbelieve, in building out a whole new energy strategy for the United \nStates that leads to an American view, an American imprint, on energy \nsecurity, not a Russian and not an OPEC view of this.\n\n[[Page H6906]]\n\n  Why? Because we embrace open markets, we embrace diversity of \nsources, we embrace transparency and pricing. That is what we want. \nLifting the ban is that first step.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Thirdly, if we couple this with building out more pipelines that help \nus integrate the Mexican energy market and the Canadian, the North \nAmerican area can clearly take care of all of our domestic demands \ncollectively and have plenty to export.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  Mr. BOUSTANY. Mr. Speaker, this will then move us in a position of \ndominating energy strategy globally, putting OPEC and Russia on the \ndefense. They cannot keep up with American energy producers. They don't \nhave the innovation; they don't have the technology; and they are \nrunning budget deficits that are harmful to their countries. They will \nhave to change, and we will dominate the energy sector.\n  Further, if we integrate this with our trade policies, we then start \nto eliminate the abusive practices that national oil companies \nperpetrate and put American open-market companies, multinational \ncompanies, back in the driver's seat. But we also help American \nproducers and producers in my home State of Louisiana, small companies \nthat are suppliers, small companies that provide the services: the boat \ncompanies, the maritime companies that help facilitate all of this.\n  This is about job creation. This is about American energy production; \nit is about American energy security; and it is about having leverage \nin our foreign policy. That is why I support this first step of lifting \nthis ban on crude exports.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, before yielding, I would like to speak \nvery briefly about process, because a lot of times people don't \nunderstand that the base bill that we are discussing today, the two \nrules, the process allows the minority an opportunity to present a \nmotion. One is a motion to recommit. One of the parts of that process \nthat we are discussing here today has to do with gun violence. Mr. \nThompson, who just spoke about it eloquently, I add to what he had to \nsay.\n  Here in Washington, D.C., in the last 6 days, five people have been \nkilled by guns. In Chicago and in my hometown and around this Nation, \nin addition to the mass killings, there have been a number of killings.\n  David Satcher was Surgeon General of the United States from 1998 to \n2002. In the year of 2000, he was the first person that I know that \nraised publicly the fact that we have a gun violence epidemic in this \ncountry. There were people that wanted to run him out of office because \nof that. We need to pay attention.\n  For the purpose of discussing this further, I yield 2 minutes to the \ngentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. Esty), someone who has had a real \nexperience with gun violence.\n  Ms. ESTY. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the rule and in \nsupport of the opportunity to vote for commonsense, bipartisan gun \nviolence prevention legislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I represent Newtown, Connecticut; and on December 14, \n2012, almost 3 years ago, 20 precious children and 6 dedicated \neducators were ripped from us by gun violence.\n  After Newtown, America said ``never again.'' But just 2 days ago, we \nobserved another moment of silence in this House, this time for the \ncommunity of Roseburg, Oregon.\n  As with every other mass shooting since Newtown, families and first \nresponders in my district are retraumatized. In fact, by my count, we \nhave held 16 moments of silence on the House floor to honor those \nAmericans taken from us by gun violence since the tragedy at Sandy \nHook. Sixteen times we in this House have come together and bowed our \nheads in silence and then refused to do anything substantial to prevent \ngun violence.\n  Mr. Speaker, we can and we must do better. We must be allowed a vote \non the bipartisan bill that will close background check loopholes and \nsave lives.\n  Ninety percent of Americans support background checks. Background \nchecks keep guns out of the hands of dangerous people. That is why \nevery gun purchase should be allowed only after a successful background \ncheck.\n  We are not dealing with a natural disaster. This is not an \nearthquake. This crisis is manmade, and it is up to us to take action \nto save lives.\n  The time has passed for moments of silence. We need hours of action. \nI urge all my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to vote today to \nbring the bipartisan background check to the House floor.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I think what the gentleman from Florida said \nat the beginning was inaccurate. He said that we brought two things \ntogether in this rule that are not related to one another. They are. \nThey are both related to energy production in this country, and that is \nwhat the rule is about.\n  Now, I am standing here today as the grandson of a man who was shot \nand killed by someone who was mentally ill in 1920. I know the \nimportance of that issue. I know what it means to families who have \nbeen victimized by it. There may be a day and a time for us to have \nthis debate, but it is not today.\n  Today, we are talking about the energy security of our country. \nToday, we are here to talk about freeing up the American economy and \nfreeing up domestic producers so that they can sell their product \nabroad, as we are now going to allow Iran to sell their product abroad. \nI would like for us to get back to the debate on energy. That is what \nwe are here today about.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, the gentleman doesn't have the prerogative \nof what the minority has, and that is an opportunity to offer a motion \nto recommit.\n  He is correct that there are two bills that are being brought here in \nthis grab-bag rule, but if he says that today is not the day for us to \ndiscuss gun violence, then I want to ask him: What day is it that we \nare supposed to discuss gun violence? People are being killed all over \nthis Nation, and we have an epidemic, and we are constantly not doing \nanything about it. If it is not today, when? And if it is not us, who?\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Mrs. Napolitano), my distinguished colleague and good friend.\n  Mrs. NAPOLITANO. Mr. Speaker, I would like to say I agree with my \ncolleague. If not now, when? We have been asking that for many, many \ngenerations.\n  Because of the mass shootings, American families are demanding \nCongress to act. They want action, but Congress has not heard any \nbills. They refuse to hear them. There is nothing. There is no \nopportunity to have the light of day or to have some transparency to \nit.\n  The last meaningful gun violence prevention bill was in 1994, and \nthat was the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act.\n  Shootings, as was pointed out, are now an everyday occurrence. It is \ncommonplace, so people are becoming numb, except for those who are \nimmediately affected and are asking us to move and pass legislation, \ngive it the light of day, discuss it, bring it up, start some \nmethodology to be able to understand what this House is looking at \ndoing for our American people, for our children, and for our families.\n  Now, collective action, we need it. Transparent discussion is \nnecessary and much needed. Enough of skirting this issue. What is more \nimportant, gas and oil or the lives of human beings?\n  Keep guns away from people that should not have them and/or would use \nthem to harm others.\n  H.R. 1217 mandates universal background checks for all purchases. It \nis a step in the right direction. It would move our country forward in \nbeginning the process of addressing this epidemic that we are facing.\n  We need real, constructive legislation. We need to prevent and lessen \nviolence. We must keep guns out of the hands of people who should not \nhave access to them, such as the dangerously mentally ill. Now, \ndomestic abusers and people with violent histories also should not have \naccess to them, and they currently do.\n  Now, without stigmatizing those with mental illness because then you \nhave a problem on your hands, we need to inform, educate, and help \nyoung people, families, and educators. We need to help those who are \nexhibiting emotional disturbances and help them\n\n[[Page H6907]]\n\nlearn how to access information and assistance.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North \nDakota (Mr. Cramer).\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Speaker, I don't want to disrespect in any way the \nminority's opportunity that they have, but I did come here to talk \nabout the energy bills.\n  I chose to go last on this side because I would like to address some \nof the thoughtful concerns that were raised by Mr. Hastings from \nFlorida. I call them concerns because I didn't hear real objections. I \nthink they are legitimate concerns that some people have had, and they \ndeserve discussion. We are talking about the rule here.\n  He made a suggestion that somehow this lifting of the oil export ban \nbill, H.R. 702, takes the President's prerogative away to deal with a \nsituation at all costs or in every situation. The reality is it does \nreserve a right for the President to reinstate the ban in some sort of \nan emergency. I want to make sure that that is clarified.\n  I also want to clarify that he mentioned we are not in regular order, \nand perhaps he is referring to the Native American Energy Act. I know \nwe have had a couple of hearings since I have been in Congress on that, \nperhaps not this Congress. I don't know. I am not on that committee.\n  I can tell you that the Energy and Commerce Committee has had a \nhearing on H.R. 702, and two other committees have had hearings on \nsimilar bills: the Agriculture Committee and the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. So this has been a thoroughly vetted issue. In fact, with \nthe admonition of Speaker Boehner, we really did take a long time with \nthis issue to help educate one another, those of us from energy States. \nSo I do think we have had a thorough debate on the topic, and I think \nit is time to have this discussion.\n  Coming from North Dakota, I just want to tell you that I come from a \nState that, prior to the energy revolution, or the Bakken revolution, \nthe shale revolution, we were experiencing outmigration and low \npersonal per capita income. Today, we have the second highest personal \nper capita income in the country. We can't accept people fast enough to \ndeal with the jobs that are available. We are at a bit of a standstill \nright now because we are overproducing light sweet crude in this \ncountry, which is the type of crude that the global markets are \ndemanding, but our domestic markets, because of our refining capacity, \nare not.\n  This is the time to lift this ban, and this is the body to do it. I \nhope we can get to it this afternoon.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, before yielding, I would like to correct \nmyself.\n  When I spoke, I spoke about the minority's right for a motion to \nrecommit, which indeed we do have; but in this particular instance, it \nis the minority's right to offer up the previous question, and that is \nwhat we are proceeding under.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from North Carolina \n(Mr. Price), a gentleman I have known a very long time in this \ninstitution and care greatly about, a very thoughtful Member.\n  Mr. PRICE of North Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the \nrule and in protest to the Republican leadership's failure to bring \ncommonsense legislation to the floor to stem our Nation's tide of gun \nviolence.\n  In the wake of seemingly endless mass shootings, Americans of all \nbackgrounds and diverse political beliefs are urging elected officials \nto stop merely wringing our hands and actually do something that \nprotects our communities.\n  One measure that has virtually unanimous support is background checks \nto keep guns out of the hands of criminals, domestic abusers, and the \ndangerously mentally ill. The problem is that our current background \ncheck system is rife with loopholes: background checks are not required \nat gun shows; they are also not required when individuals purchase \nweapons online.\n  The bipartisan King-Thompson background checks bill would close these \negregious loopholes. It is an entirely sensible reform that would have \na measurable impact on the safety of our schools and neighborhoods \nwithout preventing law-abiding citizens from using guns for self-\ndefense or for recreational purposes.\n  I wholeheartedly reject the defeatist notion that we cannot do \nanything about our Nation's gun violence. I ask my colleagues: How much \nlonger must we wait? How many more people have to die to get our \nattention? How many more American towns and cities must be added to the \ngrowing list of places like Columbine, Aurora, Charleston, and Newtown?\n  In the last 3 years, we have had some 20 moments of silence here on \nthe House floor to honor victims of gun violence in the United States. \nMoments of silence are not enough. Thoughts and prayers are not enough. \nWe need action, and I call on my colleagues to bring the background \nchecks bill to the floor for a vote and to do it now.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nColorado (Mr. Perlmutter), my good friend and a former member of the \nCommittee on Rules.\n  Mr. PERLMUTTER. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago I was here for a moment of \nsilence on behalf of the 12 killed and the 70 injured in the Aurora \nmovie theater. Since that time, we have had at least 55 mass shootings \nwhere four or more people were killed and we have had at least 22 \nmoments of silence.\n  How many more senseless acts of violence and hatred must occur before \nwe stand up and take action? How many more young, bright lives are \ngoing to be cut short because of loopholes in the law? How many more \ntimes must we stand on this floor in moments of silence, solemnly \nremembering another victim? How many more times must the flags be \nlowered at half staff in honor of servicemembers gunned down in their \nown backyard?\n  As important as these moments of reflection are, they happen with \nsuch regularity, we become numb to their significance. When will this \nviolence end? Why is it we are paralyzed by the very laws that are \nmeant to protect us?\n  It is incumbent upon us, as Members of Congress, to act and protect \nour citizens from unnecessary gun violence. I appreciated the gentleman \nfrom Alabama mentioning the violence that his own family has \nexperienced.\n  It is time for a dialogue in the spirit of civility and compassion, \nbringing all Americans together to have a discussion about peace and \nsafety in our schools, churches, and community centers. We have to \nbegin. We can do this. It requires courage, but we can act to reduce \nthis violence by passing meaningful gun violence prevention legislation \nthat respects the Second Amendment.\n  Last week I joined 147 other Members of this body in writing to the \nSpeaker, demanding action on gun violence prevention legislation. We \ndemand a vote. Action is needed. I urge the defeat of the rule.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, would you be so kind as to advise how much \ntime is remaining on both sides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 8 minutes \nremaining. The gentleman from Alabama has 15 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 4 minutes to the distinguished \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Tonko), a good friend of mine. He is the \nranking member of the Energy and Commerce Subcommittee on Environment \nand the Economy.\n  Mr. TONKO. Mr. Speaker, I oppose the rule, and in particular I oppose \nH.R. 702. Apparently, we have learned nothing over the past 40 years \nbecause this bill asks that we forget about oil shortages, oil \nrecessions, and painfully high energy bills.\n  Do we really believe that the days of $100 per barrel of oil are \ngone? Do we really believe that our military will never again be called \nupon to keep vital oil trade routes or production areas open? I wish \nthat were true, but I doubt it.\n  Until we reduce our dependence on oil, we should retain control over \nour domestic oil resources. Our Nation is not energy independent. We \nstill use a great deal of oil and other petroleum products.\n  Our transportation sector is still extremely vulnerable to price \nincreases, whether we are talking about certainly\n\n[[Page H6908]]\n\nindividual drivers, certainly our airlines or freight companies.\n  Our manufacturing sector is vulnerable, also. China may now be the \nlargest importer of oil, but we are still the world's largest consumer \nof oil. This policy is not just about whether we open up trade on \nanother commodity. It is a matter of national security and economic \nsecurity. It is in our national interest that we can and do export \ncrude oil and refined petroleum products now.\n  When we export refined products, we gain the extra benefit of jobs in \nthe refining industry as well as those in oil production. This bill \neliminates Presidential authority to restrict trade in crude oil.\n  It allows decisions about oil exports to be made by the oil \ncompanies, and they put a higher value on their profits than on our \nnational security, our United States consumers, or our environment.\n  The oil companies see this window of low global oil prices as the \nopportunity to lift the ban on crude exports. The advocates for this \npolicy point to the current slowdown in new drilling activity as \nevidence that our export policy is eliminating jobs in oil production.\n  The fact remains that oil is a global commodity and the global market \nprice for a barrel of oil is no better than the price here in the \nUnited States. When oil is under $50 per barrel, wells that are \nmarginal or with higher costs will be capped until the price rises. \nThat situation will not change by exporting to any already oversupplied \nglobal market.\n  But what happens when Asia's demand for oil increases, as it surely \nwill, and the global price again climbs into the $100 per barrel range? \nThat is an excellent opportunity to sell as much as possible on the \nglobal market, a windfall for the oil companies and an economic \ndownturn for us.\n  This policy change benefits a few of the wealthiest companies on this \nplanet. There is no benefit for consumers. We will put our national \nsecurity at risk, and certainly jobs and infrastructure in the refining \nindustry and other industries as well will be hurt.\n  Exports of oil, in fact, and any of our strategically important \nresources should be in our national interest. Big Oil gets more than \ntheir share of subsidy from the United States' taxpayers. They do not \nneed this additional windfall, and consumers and taxpayers cannot--\nsimply cannot--afford to provide it.\n  I urge you to reject this rule and to oppose H.R. 702.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I was listening to the gentleman talk, and he \nwas talking about how this might have a negative impact on American \nconsumers with regard to gas prices. I would remind the House that even \nPresident Obama's own Department of Energy found that increased oil \nexports would help lower gas prices.\n  The gentleman also mentioned what this might do to the security of \nthe United States. A member of President Clinton's Cabinet has said \nthis will enhance the security of the United States by strengthening \nour hand in Central and Eastern Europe.\n  I have listened to the gentleman. I respect his views, but I must say \nthat I think the evidence that comes to us from Democratic \nadministrations proves that what he said is really not accurate.\n  Mr. Speaker, we have no additional speakers. So if the gentleman is \nprepared to close, he may do so. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  My Republican friends argue that these bills will encourage growth \nand investment in our Nation's energy markets, local communities, and \neconomy and are, therefore, important measures that we must address \neven as we face a highway trust fund that will become insolvent in a \nmatter of weeks as well as another looming government shutdown in \nDecember.\n\n  All the while, those same individuals refuse to authorize the Export-\nImport Bank's charter, an entity that has created and sustained 1.5 \nmillion American jobs since 2007 at no cost to the taxpayer.\n  Passing a responsible budget, delivering on a long-term \ntransportation bill, and reauthorizing the Ex-Im Bank will encourage \nthe growth and investment that my friends speak of. The time to deliver \non our promises to the American people is long overdue.\n  I call on House Republicans to stop wasting our time with legislation \nthat rolls back long-held environmental protections--and stand almost \ncertain veto threats--and take up the important measures that I \nmentioned.\n  In closing, Mr. Speaker, I want to return to this notion of the \nprevious question with reference to gun violence.\n  I believe in the Second Amendment. I own a gun. When I was a child, \nat age 7, I had a Red Ryder BB gun. When I was 12, I had a single-shot \n.22 rifle. I believe in every citizen's right to own a gun, and I \nbelieve my colleagues here on this side believe the same thing.\n  If every man, woman, and child is accounted for in the estimate of \nguns that are in this country, that would be more than 330 million. \nThere are some people in our society who believe that somebody is going \nto come and take their guns. I wonder who that person would be.\n  Would it be a President of the United States? Would it be the \nmilitary? Are they going to go and take the guns from their moms, their \nbrothers, their sons, their fathers? That is foolish.\n  We need to stop this madness. Doing nothing in the face of all of \nthis epidemic violence that we are experiencing allows that not only is \nthis House dysfunctional in many of its particulars, but it is frozen \nin its indifference to the gun violence in this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  American technology is a marvel in the world. We Americans figure out \nhow to solve problems by using technology.\n  Just a few years ago we were struggling with how we were going to get \nenough energy into this country from other places, and now, because of \nthe changes to the American people, we figured out the technologies it \ntakes to be able to exploit energy resources right here.\n  It is almost like a miracle. We get to become energy independent \nwhere we won't have to get energy from other places. In fact, we found \nso much energy that we are in a position where we can export it and \nbenefit our economy and people in America with more jobs.\n  Now, I have got to tell you something: I am proud to be American for \na lot of reasons, but there is a great reason right there.\n  Our ingenuity solved this problem and created opportunities that we \ncouldn't have dreamt of, but the Federal Government is standing in the \nway. We can't fully do what we need to do here.\n  There are many things in the way, but we are trying to deal with just \ntwo of them today. One of them is the limitations we put on the \nsovereign tribal nations that my friend from Florida so eloquently \nspoke about.\n  We put limitations on them and their ability to develop energy \nresources on their land. It is their land. Let them develop it. There \nare a couple good things from that. One of them is all of us in America \nget the benefit from that. As we develop any part of our energy sector, \nit benefits all of us.\n  Secondly, it benefits those people in those tribal nations. They are \nnot asking for the Federal Government to give them something. They are \nasking for the Federal Government to get out of the way so they can do \nsomething for themselves. I think we ought to celebrate that in America \nand give them that opportunity.\n  The second bill removes a decades-old ban on oil exports. I am old \nenough to remember the 1970s. I remember waiting in a gas line and not \nbeing able to get gas, but that was then with the technology we had \nthen, not now with the technology and the proven reserves we have now.\n  I don't want to shoulder my children with limitations based upon \ntechnology or technological understanding we had when I was their age. \nAs they tell me all the time: Daddy, we have moved on. We have moved on \nin a very positive way in this particular aspect.\n  So it is time to get the dead hand of the past off of our energy \nindustry so it can start doing the things it has so miraculously proven \nthat it can do.\n  I urge everybody in this House to support this rule. I urge everybody \nin this House to support both of these underlying bills.\n\n[[Page H6909]]\n\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. Hastings is as follows:\n\n     An Amendment to H. Res. 466 Offered by Mr. Hastings of Florida\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec. 3. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     1217) to protect Second Amendment rights, ensure that all \n     individuals who should be prohibited from buying a firearm \n     are listed in the National Instant Criminal Background Check \n     System, and provide a responsible and consistent background \n     check process. The first reading of the bill shall be \n     dispensed with. All points of order against consideration of \n     the bill are waived. General debate shall be confined to the \n     bill and shall not exceed one hour equally divided among and \n     controlled by the chair and ranking minority member of the \n     Committee on the Judiciary and the chair and ranking minority \n     member of the Committee on Veterans' Affairs. After general \n     debate the bill shall be considered for amendment under the \n     five-minute rule. All points of order against provisions in \n     the bill are waived. At the conclusion of consideration of \n     the bill for amendment the Committee shall rise and report \n     the bill to the House with such amendments as may have been \n     adopted. The previous question shall be considered as ordered \n     on the bill and amendments thereto to final passage without \n     intervening motion except one motion to recommit with or \n     without instructions. If the Committee of the Whole rises and \n     reports that it has come to no resolution on the bill, then \n     on the next legislative day the House shall, immediately \n     after the third daily order of business under clause 1 of \n     rule XIV, resolve into the Committee of the Whole for further \n     consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 4. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 1217.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. BYRNE. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I \nmove the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 9 of rule XX, the Chair \nwill reduce to 5 minutes the minimum time for any electronic vote on \nthe question of adoption of the resolution.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 244, \nnays 183, not voting 7, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 541]\n\n                               YEAS--244\n\n     Abraham\n     Aderholt\n

Mr. Speaker, fellow Members of \nCongress, the people of South Carolina have faced an unprecedented, \ncatastrophic weather event, also known as a 1,000-year rain, exceeding \n20 inches virtually overnight, causing flooding and widespread damage. \nWe are grateful for your thoughts and prayers.\n  The flooding and rain destroyed homes and roads, collapsed bridges, \nand broke dams across the State; 400 roads and bridges are still \nclosed. Tragically, to date, the flooding has claimed the lives of \nnearly 20 citizens across the Carolinas. We ask for your thoughts and \nprayers for their families.\n  We are grateful for the strength of the people of South Carolina, led \nby Governor Nikki Haley and Adjutant General Bob Livingston.\n  We are inspired by people like Aaron and Amy Dupree, with their four \nsmall children, who were rescued by boat from their home in Columbia's \nLake Katherine community by their neighbor, Brian Boyer.\n  You will hear stories of incredible acts of volunteerism, like Kassy \nAlia, the widow of Forest Acres Police Officer Greg Alia who was \nmurdered last week, leaving her and their 5-month-old son, Sal. Despite \nher grief, she joined others in distributing food to those in need.\n  Wherever you go, you will find heroes like these and hear about the \nservice of the first responders, emergency personnel, officials, and \nState employees who have worked tirelessly to aid our community.\n  We appreciate that Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson will lead \na fact-finding delegation with members of our delegation to our State \ntomorrow.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Clyburn). If he is \nnot available, I just want to thank him for his service. We look \nforward to being on the delegation with him tomorrow.\n  God bless South Carolina, and I ask my colleagues to stand and join \nme in a moment of silence.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Members will rise for a moment of silence.\n  Without objection, 5-minute voting will continue.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to House Resolution 466 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 538.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Rouzer) to \npreside over the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1458\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 538) to facilitate the development of energy on Indian lands by \nreducing Federal regulations that impede tribal development of Indian \nlands, and for other purposes, with Mr. Rouzer in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young) and the gentleman from Arizona \n(Mr. Grijalva) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  H.R. 538 has been in the works for several years. This is not a bill \nthat came out of nowhere. Its provisions are the result of oversight \nhearings and consultation with Indian tribes and Alaska Native \nCorporations. The bill streamlines Federal permitting for, and \nincreases tribal control over, energy and other natural resource \ndevelopment on Indian lands. It gives tribes options to perform or \nwaive appraisals of their lands and prohibits the Interior Department's \nhydraulic fracturing from applying to Indian lands without the consent \nof the tribe.\n  It also contains provisions to streamline judicial review and deter \nfrivolous lawsuits concerning Federal permitting for Native American \nenergy projects. The judicial review provisions are crucial for Alaska \nNatives, whose ability to develop their land claims settlement lands \nhas been abused by special interest groups filing lawsuits.\n  The bill also authorizes a pilot project for the Navajo Nation to \nhandle mineral leasing of its trust lands if Interior approves its \ntribal leasing program.\n  Finally, Mr. Chairman, H.R. 538 promotes tribal forest stewardship \ncontracting on Federal lands adjacent to Indian reservation land to \nprovide a full supply of biomass energy for the tribes.\n  This summer, the GAO issued a report called ``Indian Energy \nDevelopment--Poor Management by BIA Has Hindered Energy Department on \nIndian Lands.'' Here a couple of the highlights:\n  ``The BIA does not have comprehensive data to identify ownership and \nresources available for development, does not have a documented process \nor data to track and monitor its review and response times, and some \noffices do not have the skills or adequate staff resources to \neffectively review energy-related documents.''\n  ``In 2012, Interior's inspector general found that weaknesses in \nBIA's management of oil and gas resources contributed to a general \npreference by industry to acquire oil and gas leases on non-Indian \nlands over Indian lands.''\n  This is a jobs bill. It provides energy for America, and more than \nthat, it takes care of the tribal community that has been blessed with \nresources. In some Indian reservations, where unemployment rates are 50 \npercent, energy jobs are the only high-wage, private sector jobs \navailable for members. These energy jobs dollars go a long way in \nsupporting families.\n  The Native American Energy Act is strongly supported by a broad array \nof Native organizations as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, \nspecifically, the National Congress of American Indians, the Affiliated \nTribes of Northwest Indians, the Intertribal Timber Council, Navajo \nNation, Southern Ute Indian Tribe, Confederated Tribes of the Colville \nReservation, Three Affiliated Tribes of the Fort Berthold Reservation, \nand the Ute Tribe of Utah.\n  I am a little bit surprised that the White House has issued a \nstatement against this bill. Really, it is not anything new. I always \nlisten to this administration's ``all of the above but none of the \nbelow'' as far as energy goes. In other words, the administration \npromotes only wind and solar, while opposing oil, gas, and coal on \nNations' lands--Nations' lands.\n  In the Dakotas, it takes 15 permits on tribal lands and 2 off of \ntribal lands. That is a disgrace, and I suggest, with 56 million acres \nof land, there ought to be the ability to be self-determined, be the \nfirst Americans, with the ability to take and produce energy, and help \ntheir tribal members out.\n  Those that oppose this, it is the same old story: don't get too \nsmart; we will give you a side of beef and a blanket. Don't let us help \nourselves, let the government tell you what to do.\n  This is a good piece of legislation. This did not come from me. This \ncame from the Native tribes themselves. It is an example, as we have \ntrust authority, we should let them control their own destiny.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, frankly, we are still not addressing the most pressing \nneeds in Indian Country. Six years later, the Carcieri decision still \nhas not been fixed, despite much lipservice that has been given to it \nfrom the majority.\n  Our colleague Mr. Cole and our colleague Ms. McCollum both have \nlegislation, bipartisan legislation, that would deal with that \nimmediately. We should call that up. We should have a hearing, and we \nshould deal with this decision that has left so much doubt and \nconfusion in Indian Country.\n  Sacred sites are in need of identification and protection rather than \nmidnight riders attached to unrelated legislation that violates tribal \nsacred site protections, as has happened already. Lack of funding from \nthis body coupled with sequestration has left Indian health and \neducation really with no relief in site.\n  Yes, barriers to energy development on Indian land are among the most \npressing needs, both as an economic driver for tribes and for the \nenergy needs of the United States. But this bill does not address the \nreal energy needs on tribal lands, and while we are wasting time on it, \nthese other, and even more pressing needs, just continue to grow more \nurgent.\n  The legislation claims to facilitate energy development, but, \ninstead, it short-circuits the review process set up by the National \nEnvironmental Policy Act, NEPA, and limits judicial review of \ndevelopment decisions. Instead of helping tribes develop energy \nresources on their lands, this approach will lead to less environmental \nprotection on Indian lands and less judicial recourse to those \naffected.\n  These proposals are not new. We have seen and debated them before as \npart of the failed Republican energy bills last Congress, and here they \nare again. The legislation would amend NEPA, one of the Nation's \nbedrock environmental laws, to limit review of and comment on proposed \nprojects to members of the affected Indian tribe and other individuals \nresiding within an undetermined affected area. This limitation severely \nrestricts public involvement in proposed Federal projects that may \naffect the environment, a central tenet of NEPA.\n  Arbitrarily limiting such review and comment would prevent even other \nIndian tribes with cultural ties in the so-\n\n[[Page H6912]]\n\ncalled affected area from commenting on a proposed project. Limiting \nthe universe of members of the public who can participate in the NEPA \nprocess but then failing to actually define that universe is not \nreform. It is not reform at all.\n  Additionally, this restriction is not just applicable to energy \nprojects; it applies to any major project on Indian lands. This could \nmean proposed mining contracts, proposed water development projects, \nconstruction of solid waste facilities, and even construction of tribal \nclass III gaming facilities all would slip through this undefined \nloophole. Nontribal partners would also reap this benefit as well, as \nlong as the project is located on Indian lands.\n  The legislation also throws up insurmountable barriers to those \nseeking to hold the Federal Government accountable for its actions in \ncourt. It prevents the recovery of attorney's fees in cases challenging \nenergy projects, and it makes a claimant who fails to succeed on the \nmerits of a suit potentially liable to the defendant for attorneys' \nfees and costs. This makes it extremely difficult, if not impossible, \nfor members of the public--even tribal members whose homelands may be \nimpacted by a major Federal action of any kind--to seek judicial \nreview.\n\n  The other side will say this is in response to frivolous lawsuits \nthat have been filed in these cases in the past, but according to the \nDepartment of the Interior Solicitor's Office, very few approved \nenergy-related projects have ever been challenged in court. This is \ntruly a solution in search of a problem. It is clear the real intent of \nthis provision is to chill legitimate litigation and to undermine the \nreal teeth of NEPA by making the availability of injunctive relief all \nbut disappear.\n  Furthermore, this applies even to non-Indian land. If an energy \ncompany is developing natural resources anywhere in the United States \nand they get a tribal partner, they can fall under this provision. This \ncould incentivize energy companies to partner with tribes simply for \nthe benefit of skirting NEPA and profiting from restricted judicial \nreview.\n  The legislation is opposed by the administration, as well as many \nenvironmental and conservation groups. I enter the following letter of \nopposition to this legislation into the Record, which has been signed \nby the Alaska Wilderness League, Center for Biological Diversity, \nDefenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Green Latinos, The Lands Council, \nLeague of Conservation Voters, National Parks Conservation Association, \nNatural Resources Defense Council, Northern Alaska Environmental \nCenter, San Juan Citizens Alliance, Sierra Club, Western Environmental \nLaw Center, and The Wilderness Society.\n\n         Alaska Wilderness League, Center for Biological \n           Diversity, Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Green \n           Latinos, The Lands Council, League of Conservation \n           Voters, National Parks Conservation Association, \n           Natural Resources Defense Council, Northern Alaska \n           Environmental Center, San Juan Citizens Alliance, \n           Sierra Club, Western Environmental Law Center, The \n           Wilderness Society,\n                                                September 9, 2015.\n     Chairman Rob Bishop,\n     Ranking Member Raul Grijalva,\n     House Natural Resources Committee, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Chairman Bishop and Ranking Member Grijalva: On behalf \n     of our millions of members and supporters, we write to \n     express our strong concerns with H.R. 538, the ``Native \n     American Energy Act.'' The bill purports to promote and \n     encourage increased energy production on tribal lands by \n     reducing government barriers and streamlining burdensome \n     procedures. While we are not opposed to the development of \n     energy projects on tribal lands under the law, this bill goes \n     far beyond that by severely limiting public involvement in \n     the development of any major project on tribal lands, as well \n     as by insulating potentially environmentally devastating \n     energy projects on tribal lands (or even projects done in \n     partnership with an Indian tribe on non-tribal lands) from \n     judicial review. It further erodes the public interest by \n     diminishing its full authority to conduct appraisals, \n     especially in the context of land exchanges between the \n     federal government and an Alaska Native Corporation. Given \n     the problems with these provisions, we ask that you oppose \n     H.R. 538.\n       We are particularly concerned with Sections 2, 4, and 5 of \n     this legislation.\n       Section 2 would diminish the public interest by allowing \n     state-chartered, for-profit corporations to gain full \n     authority to conduct appraisals, especially in the context of \n     land exchanges between the federal government and an Alaska \n     Native Claims Settlement Act (ANCSA) corporation. Many land \n     swaps have been very controversial in Alaska, including in \n     the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.\n       Section 4 would amend the National Environmental Policy Act \n     of 1969 (NEPA) by mandating that Environmental Impact \n     Statements (EISs) for any federal action on tribal lands by \n     an Indian tribe ``shall only be available for review and \n     comment by the members of the Indian tribe and by any other \n     individual residing within the affected area.'' This \n     provision would severely undermine one of the most basic \n     tenets of NEPA: to facilitate public involvement in decision \n     making. Additionally, this limitation is applicable to more \n     than energy projects; it applies to any major project on \n     tribal land by a native community. By its terms, section 4 \n     applies to the lands of Native Corporations transferred under \n     the provisions of ANCSA, or associated land trades. For \n     example, if passed into law, this section would limit public \n     participation in a broad range of EISs: Clean Water Act 404 \n     permits for any purpose; highway projects; energy or any \n     other federal project; or funding of any project on tribal \n     lands by an native community. Furthermore, the provision \n     would allow for significantly limiting the defined ``affected \n     area'' such that some members of the public would be excluded \n     from commenting on a draft EIS. This would artificially limit \n     what the agency might learn about the potential impacts of \n     its project, leading to uninformed decision making.\n       Section 5 aims at insulating energy related projects from \n     judicial review by placing severe restrictions on the time in \n     which to file claims and making the pursuit of any legal \n     challenge overwhelmingly cost-prohibitive. In addition to \n     curtailing the amount of time an individual or group has to \n     challenge the decision to only 60 days, Section 5 further \n     restricts judicial review by requiring plaintiffs to pay the \n     attorney's fees and costs of the defendants if they do not \n     ``ultimately prevail.'' Furthermore, even where plaintiffs \n     are successful in their challenge, this section precludes \n     them from winning awards typically provided for through the \n     Equal Access to Justice Act (EAJA) and the Treasury \n     Department's Judgment Fund. EAJA and the Judgment Fund costs \n     are incredibly important in cases which seek non-monetary \n     relief, such as those involving environmental protection and \n     public health issues. These funds make the courts accessible \n     to the individual citizen, non-profit organization, small \n     business, or public interest group that would otherwise lack \n     the financial ability to challenge large corporations or the \n     federal government, who are harming their communities or \n     environment in the name of energy development. For over three \n     decades, the financial backstop provided for under EAJA and \n     the Judgment Fund has meant that access to the courts is not \n     limited to those with deep pockets. By eliminating the \n     ability of parties to utilize EAJA or the Judgment Fund, H.R. \n     538 prevents such individuals or organizations from bringing \n     cases that challenge harmful or illegal energy related \n     projects. Section 5 creates insurmountable barriers to \n     justice at the expense of the American public and rejects \n     equal access to the courts in favor of a perverse pay-to-play \n     system.\n       Additionally, Section 5 defines ``energy related action'' \n     broadly so as to ensure the restrictive judicial review \n     provisions of this section apply equally to projects on \n     tribal land as well as those energy projects on non-tribal \n     lands where at least one tribe is involved. This invites the \n     partnering of energy corporations with native communities for \n     the purpose of limiting judicial review.\n       Finally, Section 9 of the bill would eliminate health and \n     environmental protections established by the Department of \n     the Interior in rules regarding hydraulic fracturing. Those \n     living on and near tribal lands would possibly be subjected \n     to heightened risk of spills, underground contamination from \n     toxic chemicals, weakened air quality, reduced well \n     construction standards, and other benefits from DOI's updates \n     to long out-of-date rules.\n       We recognize the self-determination framework for federally \n     recognized tribal governments and tribal members, but it is \n     important to ensure that development decisions adequately \n     address all of the impacts of those decisions, some of which \n     occur well beyond the project site, and that the public has \n     the ability to participate. H.R. 538 eliminates broad public \n     participation for projects on tribal land, including ANCSA \n     Corporation lands. Further, it will have a significant \n     chilling effect on the ability of the public (including \n     tribal members) to seek judicial review of a decision related \n     to an energy project on Indian land or proposed by (or done \n     in partnership with) an Indian tribe to ensure that the \n     project complies with the law. For these reasons, we ask that \n     you oppose H.R. 538.\n           Sincerely,\n       Alaska Wilderness League, Center for Biological Diversity, \n     Defenders of Wildlife, Earthjustice, Green Latinos, The Lands \n     Council, League of Conservation Voters, National Parks \n     Conservation Association, Natural Resources Defense Council, \n     Northern\n\n[[Page H6913]]\n\n     Alaska Environmental Center, San Juan Citizens Alliance, \n     Sierra Club, Western Environmental Law Center, The Wilderness \n     Society.\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, instead of using energy development on \nIndian land as an excuse to weaken NEPA and judicial review, we should \nbe concentrating our efforts on real reform that would achieve tribal \nself-determination and energy development. We should be dealing with \nthe disparities in the Tax Code that stymie investments in Indian \nCountry and create an unfair playing field. Tax credits and incentives \nfor energy development that cities and communities have long used to \ntheir benefit, these need to be available to tribes as well. We should \nbe encouraging investment in the future of renewable energy on tribal \nlands.\n  According to the Department of Energy Office of Indian Energy, Indian \nland contains an estimated 5 percent of all renewable energy resources, \nand the total energy potential from these resources is almost 14 \npercent of the total U.S. potential. In my home State of Arizona, there \nis a great potential for solar, wind, and geothermal energy on Indian \nland. We just need to fix the real issues that prohibit the investment \nin these projects.\n  But this bill doesn't do that. Instead, the majority is here today to \nonce again attack NEPA and judicial review, this time attempting to use \nthis as a wedge issue, attempting to drive a wedge between people that \ncare about tribal self-determination as well as environmental \nstewardship.\n  Picking between tribal sovereignty and responsible energy development \nis a false choice. We can have both. We can have successful energy \ndevelopment in Indian Country while retaining the environmental \nprotections that will ensure future generations of Native Americans \nthat they, too, can enjoy the benefits of that economic development.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to abandon this irresponsible \nproposal in favor of a real tribal energy bill. In the meantime, I \nwould plead with my colleagues to bring legislation to the floor \naddressing Indian health care, Indian education programs, a codified \nprocess for tribal consultation with Federal agencies that respects \nsovereignty and upholds the trust responsibility that we have to Indian \nCountry, and a fix--finally, a fix--for the current cloud hanging over \nthe status of so many trust lands.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, I would like to mention one thing. \nI do have an amendment for a future day--I am speaking to the \ngentleman--on NEPA. We don't change the NEPA policy at all, other than \nthe fact that only those affected can have comments on how it affects \ntheir land, not a bunch of people from New York or Maine or Dallas or \nFlorida. So that is really a red herring that was drug across this \nbill. This is to help the tribes.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman \nfrom Utah (Mr. Bishop), my good chairman of the full committee.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Utah. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from \nAlaska yielding.\n  There are some Native American tribes that do not rely on gaming \nalone for their source of revenue. They can't. It is amazing how often \nwe hear, dealing with North American Native tribes, all of a sudden \ngive lipservice that we would like to empower them, until they actually \nhave a chance to do so; and then, all of a sudden, we change. We are \ntalking about a lot of tribes who have a great deal of land but very \nlittle employment.\n  This bill, in fact, is based on recommendations that come from Indian \nCountry. By that, I don't mean the Bureau of Indian Affairs, because \nthey, shamefully, oppose this bill. I do mean groups like Southern Utah \nUtes, the Confederated Tribes of Colville, the National Congress of \nAmerican Indians, the Affiliated Tribes of Northwest Indians, and \ncommunity groups like the Chamber of Commerce. All of those people are \nrealizing the importance of this particular bill in empowering Native \nAmericans in this Nation.\n  I hope we do not turn this into a partisan affair by saying, by \nvoting ``no'' on this bill, you might get three Democrat callers on C-\nSPAN to support your vote. But it still does not make that right. We \nneed to do something differently.\n  In these areas in which the potential employment is based on \nagriculture, mining, and energy, we don't need more regulations on the \nNative Americans than there are on everybody else. We don't need \nduplicative regulations on them more than anybody else. Instead, we \nneed to streamline that so they can be successful in charting their own \ndestiny and making their own choices.\n  Far too often we have too many people, unfortunately, with titles \naround this place that still have a paternalistic attitude toward \nNative Americans. That attitude has to change. This is what this bill \ndoes.\n  It is amazing. Sometimes when this administration says, well, if it \ndeals with marijuana, they are a Native tribe, they are a sovereign \ncountry, let them do what they want to; but if it deals with \nagriculture and mining, well, not so fast. That is public lands. We \nstill need to have some kind of control over that.\n  That is the problem: pot, yes; energy, no. That doesn't work. We need \nthese people to be able to make decisions for themselves.\n  I appreciate the chairman of the subcommittee mentioning that he does \nhave an amendment on NEPA which does solve those problems. This is not \na NEPA issue. This is an issue on whether we truly believe in \nempowering Native Americans so they can make decisions for themselves \nand help their own people.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  I had a chairman of a tribe who sat in my room and wisely said: I \ndon't care what game we play. I just want to know what the ball looks \nlike.\n  This bill gives them a chance to see the ball. It gives the Native \nAmericans a chance to approve the design of the ball. More importantly, \nit gives them a chance to win.\n  So, Lucy, please, just before contact, don't pull the ball away. Let \nthe Native Americans win. This bill gives them an opportunity to win \nand chart their own destiny. That is why they support it, and that is \nwhy we should vote for it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  The GAO report has mentioned many times about the rationale behind \nand the catalyst behind this particular legislation; yet, the \nconclusion, which I agree with, is that we are not living up to our \nresponsibilities as it applies to energy development on Indian land.\n  But reading the recommendations, nowhere does it say that the \nsolution to the problem is to gut NEPA or to stifle judicial recourse. \nInstead, the recommendations talk about resources that are needed by \nIndian Country to successfully fulfill their obligations and \nresponsibilities to their members. It talks about staffing shortages, \noutdated mapping systems, and the need to ensure that the BIA can \nprovide support to the tribes on energy programs.\n  These are things the BIA has asked for in their budget and that the \nPresident's budget sent over has requested time and time again. Funding \nthese requests go unheeded by this majority.\n  So it is disingenuous, as the majority does time and time again, to \nstarve an agency or a program of needed funding and then to complain \nthat that agency program is ineffective.\n  It is also disingenuous to say that the responsibility to work with \nand honor our trust responsibility to Indian Country is down to the \nchoice in this legislation whether you vote ``yes'' or ``no.''\n  As I stated in my opening statement, there is a litany of pressing \nissues that face Indian Country and Native Americans in our Nation, a \nlitany of benign neglect for many, many years, of which all bear \nresponsibility.\n  But with that responsibility comes also the opportunity to act. The \nfix is necessary so that fact is quelled on a bad Supreme Court \ndecision. We need the adequate funding so that the trust responsibility \nthat we inherit as Members of Congress is upheld.\n  We need programs of infrastructure in Indian Country. We need many, \nmany issues to address not only the human need, but the economic needs \nof Indian Country.\n\n[[Page H6914]]\n\n  To say that this bill is the watershed moment that is going to turn \nall that benign neglect and irresponsibility backwards is disingenuous \nat best.\n  I would suggest let's talk about a real comprehensive approach to the \nissue of Indian Country and the support this Congress needs to give to \nour trust responsibility.\n  If we do that, I am sure all of us collectively can come to the same \nconclusion, that we need to do something and that there is before us \nlegislation from both sides of the aisle that begin to address it.\n  This legislation is not it. It is not a panacea. And to pit the trust \nresponsibility this Congress has and to question whether sovereignty is \nsupported or not by Members that oppose this is not fair.\n  The fairness in this would have been an energy bill that is \ncomprehensive. The fairness would have been not to gut NEPA, judicial \nreview, and present a bill that is clean and upholds bedrock \nenvironmental laws and--and it is not complicated--uphold the trust \nresponsibility that we have when we swear an oath of office to serve in \nthis Congress.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentlewoman from Washington (Mrs. McMorris Rodgers).\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Native \nAmerican Energy Act.\n  Having an all-of-the-above energy policy means all people in all \ncommunities. Each community across the country should have the \nopportunity to unleash the natural resources closest to them to help \nmeet their energy needs. For those of us in the Pacific Northwest, it \nmeans encouraging biomass.\n  We have just had a devastating wildfire season, and the issue of \nforest health continues to be on the forefront. Fallen trees, \novergrowth, and general mismanagement have led to worsening fire \nseasons.\n  By encouraging forest products for biomass, we would add and have a \nbenefit of reducing forest fire risk by keeping our lands healthier, in \naddition to creating a stable energy source.\n  This legislation allows a pilot project to encourage greater biomass \nproduction on tribal forestland. In my district in eastern Washington, \nit would help the confederated tribes of the Colville Reservation, who \nalready play a very active role in forest management, get new tools at \ntheir disposal to maintain the health of the adjacent forest to the \nreservation. It would help them develop energy and, most importantly, \nhelp them protect their homeland.\n  I am proud to support this legislation and encourage my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton).\n  Mr. TIPTON. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to give my voice in strong \nsupport for the Native American Energy Act.\n  I would also like to be able to thank Chairman Young and Chairman \nBishop for their leadership and support of Native American energy \ndevelopment.\n  Energy resource development on Native American lands is important and \nbecoming increasingly significant year after year. For example, in \n2014, responsible conventional energy development on Native American \nlands alone generated revenues of $24 billion.\n  This revenue figure does not include renewable energy development on \ntribal lands, which is the potential to increase revenues, jobs, and \nhousehold incomes for Native American communities.\n  I am privileged to be able to represent the Southern Ute Indian Tribe \nlocated in southwest Colorado. Some of my colleagues know that the \nSouthern Ute Indian Tribe is a model of tribal governance and economic \ndevelopment. The tribe is widely known as the premier natural gas \ndeveloper and the largest employer in the region.\n  I am extremely proud that the Southern Ute Indian Tribe continues to \ntake the lead in demanding that the Federal Government respect self-\ndetermination and tribal decisionmaking when it comes to energy and \nenvironmental regulation.\n  To his credit, Chairman Young continues to hold numerous oversight \nhearings and legislative hearings to allow tribal leaders to illustrate \nthe challenges they face daily as they attempt to develop their natural \nresources so that they can provide programs, services, and jobs for \ntheir nations.\n  The result is H.R. 538, which will remove a number of these barriers. \nThe legislation streamlines the appraisal process that must be \nundertaken by the Department of Interior because the status quo has \nresulted in delays that have caused the tribe to miss out on royalty \npayments totaling more than $95 million.\n  The legislation also amends the Tribal Forest Protection Act of 2004, \nto direct the Department of Interior to enter into agreements with \ntribes to carry out demonstration projects that promote biomass energy \nproduction on Native American forestland and in nearby communities by \nproviding tribes with reliable supplies of woody biomass from Federal \nlands.\n  It also prohibits the Interior rule regarding hydraulic fracturing \nfrom having any effect on land held in trust or restricted status for \nNative Americans, except with the express consent of the Indian \nbeneficiaries. The Southern Ute's repeated attempts to ensure tribal \nlands were not included in this misguided rule were completely \ndisregarded by this administration.\n  Fortunately, H.R. 538 promotes Native American self-determination, \nstrengthens tribal sovereignty, and reinforces our commitment to tribal \nself-sufficiency.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this vital legislation.\n  Once again, I thank Chairman Young for his leadership and Chairman \nBishop on this issue.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from Arizona (Mr. Gosar).\n  Mr. GOSAR. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to express my support of this \ncommonsense legislation.\n  This bill empowers Native Americans to invest in their communities, \ntheir people, and their resources as they see fit without the heavy \nhand of Washington bureaucracy trying to insert itself between them and \ntheir own land.\n  Under current policy, potential resource development on tribal lands \nface many obstacles that projects on private or State lands do not.\n  Before entering into a lease agreement with energy developers on \ntheir own land, a tribe must first attempt to navigate the long, slow, \nand duplicative process of the Department of Interior's approval. This \nprocess can be fraught with litigation and delays that chase away \npotential investments and crush otherwise viable projects.\n  The Native American Energy Act streamlines many of the duplicative \nFederal regulatory hurdles that prevent tribes or individuals from \nprofitably developing energy resources on their land.\n  This will provide tribes with greater control over how they best \ndevelop their own natural resources and allow them to do so in ways \nthat will best benefit their communities, not a D.C. bureaucrat's \nideology.\n  Because of the commonsense and empowering reforms it contains, this \nbill has widespread support from the Indian tribes. It is odd that the \nonly groups on record in opposition to this bill are the Obama \nadministration and some Democratic members of the Natural Resources \nCommittee.\n  Why does the administration continue to insist that bureaucrats from \ntheir comfy leather chairs and marble offices in Washington, D.C., know \nmore about how to manage Indian land than the tribes themselves?\n  If Congress is actually serious about supporting tribal efforts to \ngenerate high-paying jobs and improving the everyday standard of living \nin American Indian communities, this bill is a real, concrete way to \nempower them to do so.\n  I commend the chairman and the committee for their work on this bill. \nI strongly urge my colleagues to support it.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n\n[[Page H6915]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to \nthe gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Alaska for \nbringing this legislation forward.\n  In my hometown of Hobbs, New Mexico, truck drivers are making \n$100,000 a year. They don't have to have a college degree, not even a \nhigh school diploma. And, yet, we limit this sort of opportunity on \ntribal lands. This bill is fairly simple. Simply let them free. Let \nthem free to develop their lands in the way they want to.\n  I heard one of my colleagues say that there are no frivolous \nlawsuits. Just this week the WildEarth Guardians were found to have \nfiled a frivolous lawsuit on matters such as these, trying to stop \ndevelopment, trying to hold things up. The judge said this is \nfrivolous. It is the WildEarth Guardians v. Kirkpatrick decision that \nis very recent.\n  We are told that there are a litany of issues that we should be \ndealing with. I will tell you that Native Americans are sophisticated \nenough to take care of their own problems. They just need the \nopportunity to have jobs. They need the opportunity for economic \ndevelopment inside their own nations.\n  Just recently we hosted in New Mexico a gathering of different tribes \nwho are looking at investments in oil and gas. One lady said: My son is \nworking in North Dakota for $60,000 a year, and he should be working \nhere on the reservation in the oil and gas industry for $60,000 a year. \nThat is the urgency that I am sensing on the reservations.\n  The reservations are beginning to build their own houses, and they \nare doing magnificent work. They are becoming self-determined. But we \nhere in Washington say we know better. Mr. Young's bill says that we \ndon't know better.\n  Just let them develop what they want. Take the shackles off, take the \nchains loose, and let the American spirit that is on the reservations \nlive and breathe. It is a very simple concept, but one some have a very \ndifficult time accepting.\n  I say vote for H.R. 538 and put them free.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume. I \njust want to note that the Democrats on the Natural Resources Committee \nfiled several amendments to this bill. We felt our Members were \nsquarely within the House rules.\n  Sadly, the majority on Rules failed to make any of their amendments \nin order. One of these rejected amendments would have fixed the \nterrible mess created by the decision in Carcieri.\n  If you want to help tribes in a legitimate, coequal way control their \nown lands and move closer and closer to self-determination, you have to \naddress this problem. It is telling that my friends on the other side \nhave refused to even address the bill or to have a legitimate hearing \non the bill.\n  Let me just in closing address the Statement of Administrative \nPolicy.\n\n       While the administration supports the need to facilitate \n     energy development in Indian Country, it does not support \n     H.R. 538, the Native American Energy Act. This bill would \n     undermine public participation and transparency of review of \n     projects on Indian lands under the National Environmental \n     Policy Act, set unrealistic deadlines, and remove oversight \n     for appraisals of Indian lands or trust assets, and prohibit \n     awards under the Equal Access to Justice Act or payment of \n     fees or expenses to a plaintiff from the judgment fund in an \n     energy-related action.\n       By foreclosing the judgment fund, this provision would \n     negatively impact the Indian Affairs budget that is intended \n     to serve all tribes. In addition, this bill's changes to \n     mineral leasing loss applicable to Navajo Nations land may \n     adversely affect energy development on these lands.\n       The bill also stipulates that Indian lands are exempt from \n     the Department of the Interior's hydraulic fracking rule. \n     That rule already contains the provision allowing for \n     variances from the rules requirements when tribal laws meet \n     or exceed the rule standards.\n       The rule approach both protects environmental and trust \n     resources while also protecting decisionmaking of the tribes. \n     Overall, H.R. 538 would not ensure diligent development of \n     resources on Indian land.\n       The administration appreciates the committee's efforts to \n     address energy needs in Indian Country. Income from energy \n     development is one of the largest sources of revenue \n     generated from trust lands, and delays in development \n     translate to delays in profits to Indian mineral rights \n     owners.\n       The administration has been taking meaningful action to \n     update the leasing process for lands held in trust for Indian \n     tribes and is actively working to expedite appraisals, \n     leasing, and permitting on Indian lands, and to provide \n     resources to ensure safe and responsible development.\n       The administration looks forward to working with Congress \n     to develop the reforms necessary to support this development.\n\n  The point is that this legislation is a rush to judgment. It is a \ngift, in a sense, when you exempt from the judicial review and from \nNEPA the exploration and production of energy on Indian land. As \ncoequals, these environmental protections and public processes are \nintended for all.\n  So rather than be patronizing, as coequals and within our trust \nresponsibility, this bill should be rejected. We should work on \ncomprehensive energy opportunity legislation that truly recognizes \nself-determination for all members of tribes, provided the \nenvironmental, public health, and judicial processes would guarantee \nthem that they would be treated equal under the law.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chair, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  In closing, I suggest one thing. This bill came from the tribes, not \nfrom the Sierra Club and not from the friends of this and not from the \nfriends of that. All 28 organizations had nothing to do with the \ntribes.\n  I have said all along--and I am pretty well related to the Athabascan \nTribe in Alaska--it is time they are given the opportunity to fulfill \nthe self-determination act that we passed. Words do not do that.\n  This administration has these great conferences, and we invite \neverybody down and winky, winky, and now have a good time. Nothing \nhappens administratively.\n  Now, I know there is some legislation and I am working very hard to \nget legislation, but I can't do it all. I have to do it one little step \nat a time.\n  This bill is requested by American Indians to have more control over \ntheir land.\n  I have to remind this Congress that I sit in that we are now ranked \nin the nations around the world 20th in the freedom category. We have \ngone from number 1 to 20th. Think about that. The American Indians, our \nfirst people, are 13th in freedom because of our so-called free \ngovernment. Now, there is something wrong with that.\n  We are doing an indirect thing, as trustees, by not allowing them to \nexpand their God-given right, their ability, their intellectual \ncapability, to expand their self-worth and keep their identity.\n  Every time we try to bring a bill to the floor to do that, it is, \nfirst of all, ``We can do it better administratively.'' That is why \nthey are ranked 13th in freedom because of our government.\n  Now, I want everybody to think about this in Congress, from number 1 \nfreest nation in the world to right now 20. That is not a good thing.\n  In the last 5 years, we have dropped three spaces in that freedom \nchart, mainly because of overreach, regulation, and dictation by our \ngovernment. That is what it is based on. Individual freedoms are lost.\n  Try that as a tribe and have to go through all the other steps that \nthe other person doesn't have to. Well, they dropped down to 13th.\n  I am asking the people in this body to support this bill if you \nbelieve in self-determination, if you believe in self-sufficiency, if \nyou believe in the right to get ahead, especially in nations by this \nCongress that gave them the ability to be self-determined. They really \ntake it away.\n  So this is a good piece of legislation, a piece of legislation that \nshould be voted ``yes'' on. We should give a chance for the American \nIndian to go forth as I know they have the capability of.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeFAZIO. Madam Chair, today I will vote against H.R. 538, the \nNative American Energy Act. The bill makes needed changes to allow \ntribes to fully manage their lands which I strongly support. \nUnfortunately, it goes too far by weakening bedrock environmental \nprotections, and makes it difficult for those with legitimate legal \ngrievances to seek justice.\n  Technically the 2005 Energy Act allows tribes to enter into energy \ndevelopment leases\n\n[[Page H6916]]\n\nthrough what are called Tribal Energy Resource Agreements, which must \nbe approved by Interior. I say technically because no tribe has ever \nbeen successful in doing so. Tribes have submitted proposals that have \nsat with Interior for as long as eight years and then were never \napproved. Interior has never clarified what requirements are needed to \ngain approval. Potential business partners cannot and will not sit wait \nto see if the federal government will do its job. They will find \npartners that are able to move forward.\n  One of most laudable parts of the bill is the creation of biomass \ndemonstration projects. Our forests are overgrown and are infected with \ninsects and disease. Fuel reduction is vital to forest health and \nreducing the severity of fires. Often overgrowth is not suitable for \ntimber production, but can be suitable for energy production. Many \ntribes are ready to take advantage of these resources; they have their \nown processing facilities, trained work force and infrastructure in \nplace to discover benefits to improve forest health, maintain fish and \nwildlife habitat, and create renewable energy.\n  Tribes, lest we forget, are sovereign nations. Yet they regularly \nencounter obstacles not experienced by private landowners. The federal \ngovernment already has the tools to solve this inequity, but refuses to \ndo so. The lack of urgency to correct what amounts to bureaucratic \nindifference is not acceptable. America's first stewards of the land \nhave the right to manage and develop their lands, and the federal \ngovernment's inaction to ensure their rights is deplorable.\n  Because the bill goes beyond necessary reforms by curtailing \nenvironmental and judicial review, the president has issued a veto \nthreat. I look forward to the Senate removing those provisions which \nunnecessarily hinder what could be a good bill and sending it back to \nthe House.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Ms. Foxx). All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-30.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-290.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chair, I have an amendment that was made \nin order under the rule.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, strike lines 9 through 15, and insert the \n     following:\n       ``(1) Review and comment.--\n       ``(A) In general.--Except as provided in subparagraph (B), \n     the statement required under subsection (a)(2)(C) for a major \n     Federal action regarding an activity on Indian lands of an \n     Indian tribe shall only be available for review and comment \n     by the members of the Indian tribe, other individuals \n     residing within the affected area, and State, federally \n     recognized tribal, and local governments within the affected \n     area.\n       ``(B) Exception.--Subparagraph (A) shall not apply to a \n     statement for a major Federal action regarding an activity on \n     Indian lands of an Indian tribe related to gaming under the \n     Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentleman \nfrom Alaska (Mr. Young) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Alaska.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chairman, this amendment clarifies who may \nsubmit public comments on a NEPA study concerning a Federal permit or \nland approval for Indian lands. It also preserves current NEPA \nrequirements concerning tribal gaming proposals.\n  When a NEPA study is done on Federal action, like a mineral lease \napproval on Indian lands, the agency must consider comments received by \nany member of the public, regardless of whether they are affected. This \nis unfair to the tribe because tribal lands are not public land. They \nare private lands.\n  Section 4 of the bill limits public comment in these situations to \nthe tribe and individuals who live within the affected area of the \nproject.\n  Section 4 was drafted. We expected an individual living within the \naffected area would include State, tribal, and county officials, but no \none from New York or San Francisco. It is none of their business.\n  To address any ambiguity, the amendment would clarify that tribe, \nStates, and county governments within the area affected may have their \ncomments considered along with those of individuals.\n  Finally, the amendment provides that section 4 will not affect \nFederal actions related to tribal gaming. Gaming is a unique area of \nlaw. Gaming facilities have a significant impact outside the local \narea.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I rise to claim time in opposition to the \nmanager's amendment, although I am not in opposition.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Arizona is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GRIJALVA. Madam Chair, I just want to tell Chairman Young that I \nappreciate the lipstick on this particular\n\n[[Page H6918]]\n\npiece of legislation, but the content is still haphazard.\n  It does not fix the underlying problem with public review and \njudicial review. We are not in opposition, but I appreciate the \nlipstick.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chair, I hope it is the right color for \nRanking Member Grijalva.\n  I yield back the balance of time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Alaska (Mr. Young).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n  Amendment No. 2 Offered by Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part A of House Report 114-290.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Madam Chair, I have an \namendment made in order under the rule.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 12, after line 6, insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 4.

Pursuant to House Resolution 466, the gentlewoman \nfrom New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham) and a Member opposed each \nwill control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico. Madam Chair, I yield myself \nas much time as I may consume.\n  I rise in support of my amendment that allows the Forest Service to \nestablish a pilot program to execute contracts with tribes under the \nIndian Self-Determination and Education Assistance Act, known as 638 \ncontracts. 638 contracts allow tribes to manage and implement Federal \nprograms in Indian Country.\n  When I was the New Mexico Secretary of Health, I witnessed how \nsuccessful and beneficial these contracts can be at efficiently \ndelivering services to tribes. Through these contracts, tribes can \noperate hospitals, health clinics, mental health facilities, and a \nvariety of other community health services.\n  Having tribes manage and operate programs in their communities not \nonly recognizes tribal self-determination and self-governance, but it \nalso helps ensure that tribal needs are being met through traditionally \nand culturally appropriate methods.\n  Although several agencies have the authority to execute 638 \ncontracts, such as the Bureau of Land Management, Bureau of \nReclamation, Bureau of Indian Affairs and Indian Health Services, the \nForest Service does not have this authority. Several tribes have \nexpressed to me that they would like to see the Forest Service have \nthis authority.\n  Many of the Pueblos in New Mexico have land and tribal forests \nadjacent to national forests, and we know that wildfires in the past \ncan quickly affect entire regions, regardless of who owns the land.\n  In fact, the Las Conchas wildland fire, which was one of the largest \nwildfires in New Mexico history, started on June 26, 2011, in the Santa \nFe National Forest and burned more than 156,000 acres in New Mexico, \nincluding land belonging to Pueblos of Santa Clara, Ohkay Owingeh, San \nIldefonso, Pojoaque Jemez, Cochiti, and Kewa.\n  So it is imperative that the Forest Service and tribes actively work \ntogether to co-manage forests.\n  This amendment previously passed by voice vote as part of the \nResilient Federal Forest Act, which the House passed this July.\n  I urge my colleagues to once again support my amendment, which will \nimprove the Forest Service's ability to partner with tribes to work on \nprojects that impact tribal lands and forests.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chair, I ask unanimous consent to claim \nthe time in opposition to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Alaska?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Madam Chair, I yield myself as much time as I \nmay consume.\n  Madam Chair, I do not oppose the amendment. I just want to \ncongratulate the lady on backing up what is in the bill, making this \ncorrect.\n  We have had testimony from a lot of the timber tribes on how well \nthey have managed their timber, and right next door will be the Forest \nService land that is managed terribly. That is a threat to the tribal \ntimber, too.\n  I really think, if we want to get back on this track of the freedoms \nI was talking about, if we allow the tribes to contract with the Forest \nService, make it a contract for thinning, encouraging growth, managing \ngrowth for future timber needs--you know, the native tribes are doing \nso much better than the Federal tribes. So I compliment the lady on \nthis deal.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  I compliment the gentlewoman on this view, and I accept the \namendment. I think the gentlewoman is doing a great job, and I \nappreciate it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from New Mexico (Ms. Michelle Lujan Grisham).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Under the rule, the Committee rises.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHolding) having assumed the chair, Ms. Foxx, Acting Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 538) to \nfacilitate the development of energy on Indian lands by reducing \nFederal regulations that impede tribal development of Indian lands, and \nfor other purposes, and, pursuant to House Resolution 466, she reported \nthe bill back to the House with an amendment adopted in the Committee \nof the Whole.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to \nrecommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentleman opposed to the bill?\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. I am opposed in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mr. Ben Ray Lujan of New Mexico moves to recommit the bill \n     H.R. 538 to the Natural Resources Committee, with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, \n     with the following amendment:\n       At the end of the bill, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 10. PHYSICAL INTEGRITY OF SACRED SITES.\n\n        Nothing in this Act shall contravene the authority of the \n     President to avoid adversely affecting the physical integrity \n     of any site, identified as sacred by virtue of established \n     religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, an Indian \n     religion, under Executive Order 13007 (May 24, 1996).\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, this is the final \namendment to the bill, which does not kill the bill or send it back to \ncommittee. If adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final \npassage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to offer an amendment to protect sacred \nsites across America. This issue is not a new one. We have been part of \nmany debates here on the floor and in committee on this important \nissue.\n\n[[Page H6919]]\n\n  The amendment is straightforward. It reads: ``Nothing in this Act \nshall contravene the authority of the President to avoid adversely \naffecting the physical integrity of any site, identified as sacred by \nvirtue of established religious significance to, or ceremonial use by, \nan Indian religion, under Executive Order 13007.''\n  Mr. Speaker, as we come from different faiths, we all have respect \nfor one another. Just as we worship in different places, like churches \nor temples, so, too, should we have respect for these sacred places. \nJust as we would honor the sanctity of where our loved ones have been \nlaid to rest, so, too, should we honor the sanctity of tribal sacred \nsites.\n  Sacred sites are an essential part of the culture and heritage of \ntribal communities, and the degradation of these sites means a loss of \nidentity as well as disrespect for the faith and religion and the \nculture and the history of our tribal brothers and sisters who are \nconnected to these lands. Sacred sites should not be desecrated. They \nshould be protected.\n  I know it is a sentiment that many of us in this Congress share. \nProtecting sacred sites is the right thing to do. I ask my colleagues \nto join me in supporting this very important amendment.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to the motion \nto recommit.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. YOUNG of Alaska. Mr. Speaker, there is nothing in this act that \nchanges the President's authority. I go back to self-determination. \nThese are tribal lands owned by the tribes, controlled by the tribal \ncouncil, and they will make a decision about the sacred sites; not \nsomebody, again, in Miami or New York that wants to stop the project.\n  These are tribal sites, and that is the thing I don't quite \nunderstand. This affects nothing of the present law. If they decide \nthis is a sacred site, that will be their decision, instead of someone \nelse.\n  I urge people to reject his motion to recommit, and let's pass this \nlegislation, this one little, tiny step forward for our first \nAmericans. This bill came from them and they support it. They are not \nworried about these sacred sites because they will control them, not \nsomebody who is an official. We take no authority away from the \nPresident.\n  Very frankly, Mr. Speaker, this is a motion to recommit to slow the \nbill down. They say it doesn't, but this is an attempt to do so. I urge \na ``no'' on the motion to recommit and a ``yes'' on the passage for \nthat little, tiny step for the American Indians, our first people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. BEN RAY LUJAN of New Mexico. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the \nyeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Socialist Party militants are dispatched to \nintimidate voters under the guise of assistance. And the Maduro regime \nis using military forces to keep citizens from voluntarily auditing \nelectoral precincts, as it is stated by law.\n  As the Maduro regime continues to refuse allowing international \nmonitors, the United States must be even more vigilant of the threat of \nthe fraud before and during election day in Venezuela.\n  We should also be ready to sanction any regime official who \nperpetuates human rights violations because of this electoral process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6920-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6920]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n            REPUBLIC OF CHINA NATIONAL DAY AND HO FENG-SHAN\n\n  (Mr. DEUTCH asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. DEUTCH. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to celebrate Taiwan's National \nDay, or Double Tenth Day, on Saturday, October 10.\n  Taiwan and the United States have shared a close relationship since \npassage of the Taiwan Relations Act in 1979. With deep trade ties and \nclose security cooperation between our two countries, Taiwan is going \nto be an important regional and global actor and friend to the United \nStates.\n  One famous diplomat from the Republic of China, Mr. Ho Feng-Shan, \nperfectly embodied the bravery and the heroism of so many in this \ncountry. Mr. Ho, consul general in Vienna during Nazi occupation, \ndefied orders from his superiors and issued hundreds of visas to Jews \nwho, without his efforts, would have been forbidden from leaving \nAustria and would likely have fallen victim to Hitler's plans to \nexterminate the Jews.\n  For his selfless and courageous actions, he rightfully earned the \ntitle of Righteous Among the Nations from the Yad Vashem Holocaust \nMuseum.\n  Please join me in celebrating Taiwan's National Day and paying \ntribute to Mr. Ho's sacrifices and actions.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6920-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6920-H6921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       LIFT CRUDE OIL EXPORT BAN\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Mr. Speaker, with just one change in the law, we could \ncreate nearly 400,000 American jobs, potentially help lower gas prices, \nand\n\n[[Page H6921]]\n\nexert soft power that keeps bad actors around the world from \ndestabilizing the price of oil. That change would be lifting the ban on \ncrude oil exports.\n  With all of these benefits for America, it makes sense that we should \nembrace that change and put it on the President's desk right away. The \nexport ban is a relic of the past that needs to be lifted to help \nestablish the United States as a preeminent energy leader in the world.\n  The United States is the only country in the world that has a ban on \nexporting oil. With countries like Iran and Russia flexing their muscle \non the world stage, lifting the ban would help enhance both our energy \nand our national security. But even more than that, removing the crude \noil export ban means helping our economy with more good-paying jobs for \nhardworking Americans.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is time to lift the crude oil export ban.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6921-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         HONORING HO FENG-SHAN\n\n  (Ms. FRANKEL of Florida asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida.

At great risk to his own life, Feng-Shan issued thousands of \nChinese visas to Jews, allowing them to escape Nazi camps. Ho Feng-\nShan's courage is just one example of the Republic of China's proud \nheritage celebrated on National Day.\n  A vital U.S. trading partner, Taiwan helps maintain peace and \nstability in the western Pacific and shares our values for freedom, \ndemocracy, and respect for human rights.

Mr. Speaker, next week marks the 18th annual international \nEarth Science Week. Today I am introducing a House resolution to \nrecognize Earth Science Week to highlight the importance and broad \nimpact of earth science research.\n  Geoscientists and researchers in our country continually push the \nfrontier of human knowledge; help develop and incubate the concepts and \nprograms that keep us at the innovative forefront of the world's \neconomy; and inspire future generations of researchers, scientists, and \ninformed citizens. Earth science funding is a stimulant to the American \neconomy and an investment into our future global leadership.\n  The devastating drought in my home State of California highlights the \nneed for earth science research, which can address major gaps in our \nunderstanding of water availability, quality, and dynamics. Having a \nbetter understanding of natural systems allows for more informed \npolicy.\n  I am committed to working with my friend and fellow science advocate, \nChairman Culberson, to ensure that Federal earth science research is \ngiven robust support and is not hindered by misguided legislation that \nmicromanages and places funding caps on these critical fields. It is \ncritical that we study and understand our ``pale blue dot,'' our one \nand only home.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6921-3", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             REMEMBERING SENIOR AIRMAN QUINN JOHNSON-HARRIS\n\n  (Ms. MOORE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. MOORE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today with a heavy heart to mourn the \nsix servicemembers and five civilians killed in the recent crash of an \nAir Force transport plane in Afghanistan. Yesterday, the House held a \nmoment of silence to mark their sacrifice.\n  One of those who died was Senior Airman Quinn Johnson-Harris, whose \nfamily now calls Milwaukee, Wisconsin, their home. He and his fallen \ncomrades join the list of the 2,300 heroes who have given their lives \nin Afghanistan.\n  As a Member of Congress, there is no more difficult moment in our \njobs than this. My heart and prayers go out to family.\n  There is no question that Quinn made our community in Milwaukee \nstronger and our Nation safer because of his service. This young man \nmade a difference wherever he went. I hear it in the stories that have \ncome out after his death from his family, his friends, his teachers, \nand others about his dedication to them and his country.\n  His mother said: ``Quinn dared to be different. He beat by his own \ndrum.''\n  When his family, community, or country called, this young man stood \nup and did not shrink back. According to his sister, when she heard he \nwas being deployed to Afghanistan, ``he was ready to go,'' and this \nsurprised no one.\n  He came from a military family. His grandfather served in Vietnam. \nHis older brother was a marine, and another older brother is a 2015 \ngraduate of West Point and is in the Army.\n  Mr. Speaker, I join his family, his friends, and his fellow \nservicemen in mourning his life, yet celebrating the life of this young \nhero, Senior Airman Quinn Johnson-Harris.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6921-4", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                     MEDICARE PREMIUM FAIRNESS ACT\n\n  (Ms. TITUS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Ms. TITUS. Mr. Speaker, without congressional action, Medicare \npremiums and deductibles will increase in 2016 by 52 percent for an \nestimated 7.5 million American seniors and people with disabilities. \nBecause these folks will not be receiving a Social Security cost of \nliving adjustment for 2016, 30 percent of beneficiaries will not be \nheld harmless, and their premiums will increase from $104 to $159 per \nmonth.\n  To stop rates from increasing, I have introduced the Medicare Premium \nFairness Act, which will protect seniors and people with disabilities \nby capping premiums at 2015 levels for a year. I urge my colleagues to \njoin me in cosponsoring this important legislation.\n  Seniors in our communities worked hard all their lives and saw our \ncountry through a war, Depression, and dramatic social change. At a \ntime when every dollar counts, this critical legislation will ensure \nthat seniors can put food on the table and buy lifesaving medication.\n  So let's stand up for America's seniors.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6921-5", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6921]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1645\nAPPOINTMENT OF MEMBER TO THE CONGRESSIONAL-EXECUTIVE COMMISSION ON THE \n                       PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Babin).

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n\n[[Page H6922]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, this past spring Congress passed \nlegislation that authorized the President to negotiate and sign \nsweeping trade agreements with limited input from Congress.\n  When I say ``the President,'' I am not just talking about Mr. Obama, \nMr. Speaker. I am talking about anyone who sits in the Oval Office from \nnow on.\n  This body then went on to pass a trade adjustment assistance package \nthat falls far short of what is necessary and, in and of itself, \nacknowledges the loss of employment that comes from the trade \nagreement. Those steps set the stage for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, \nthe final language of which was announced earlier this week. That deal \nwas built from years of secret negotiations between corporations and \ntrade representatives, with little to no input from the working \nfamilies who will have to bear the loss of jobs here at home.\n  Mr. Speaker, back in New Jersey, we know what happens when trade \ndeals don't consider American workers. Factories close, employees are \nlaid off, and whole cities that used to pump out products for consumers \naround the world are suddenly faced with stunted economies and \nincomprehensible unemployment.\n  While I am not opposed to free trade, our priority can't simply be \ncorporate gains under the guise of economic growth; it must be the \nwelfare of working families. But working families are going to find \nthemselves out of luck if they are forced to compete with salaries of \njust cents an hour overseas.\n  TPP is a very bad deal. It lacks prohibitions to address currency \nmanipulation; it lacks environmental standards that will keep \nmanufacturers accountable and ensure we are preventing some of the \nhuman causes of climate change; and it lacks labor standards that \nprotect the human rights of workers in places like Mexico, Vietnam, and \nMalaysia, running against even the most basic human American values. It \ndoes all this based on the flawed philosophy that supporting \nmultinational corporations somehow helps the middle class.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me state for the record that no trade deal is ever \ncrafted to support the American middle class, and any suggestion \notherwise is a flat-out, bold-faced lie.\n  International trade is always marketed as the key to economic growth, \nbut we are told that opening new markets means more opportunities for \nU.S. businesses. That is true in part. But the businesses that profit \nmost are multinational corporations, and part of that profit comes from \nsending American jobs overseas. We will allow those same companies to \ncontinue to enjoy tax loopholes that maximize their bottom line and \nallow them to keep much of their profits stashed away elsewhere. If \nNAFTA and CAFTA are any example, these profits will never make it down \nthe line to Americans striving to get to the middle class.\n  If we are serious about growing our economy in a way that supports \nevery American, there are plenty of policy changes that we could make:\n  We could give our workers a living wage that would allow them to \nsupport their families;\n  We could provide better primary and secondary education and more \naffordable higher education;\n  We could offer employment through the hundreds of thousands of jobs \nwe could create by investing in infrastructure repairs and upgrades;\n  And we could do a lot better than TPP.\n  So before we move forward, my congressional Progressive colleagues \nand I have come to the floor to urge Members on both sides of the aisle \nto take what limited time we have to change the course. We have just \none last opportunity to fix this deal, to protect American workers, and \nto ensure a deal that will actually boost our economy, not just the \nprofit margins of multinational corporations, and we need to take that \ntime.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to a Member who has been as outspoken \nas any of us as we talk about the need to reexamine this flawed \nagreement. I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Ms. Slaughter), \nour ranking member on the Rules Committee.\n  Ms. SLAUGHTER. Mr. Speaker, I do appreciate the gentlewoman yielding \nto me.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a debate I seem to have had before. I was here \nfor the NAFTA debate.\n  Congressional districts throughout this country, including my own of \nRochester, New York, will find it very difficult to survive another \ntrade deal that sends our jobs overseas to countries that ignore human \nrights violations and undermine our laws in public health here at home. \nDuring my time in Congress, I have never seen a trade agreement that \nthe United States participated in that benefited either the American \nmanufacturer or the American worker, and everything I know about Trans-\nPacific Partnership suggests it will be more of the same.\n  Despite a bipartisan push by 158 Democrats and Republicans in the \nHouse of Representatives, the trade deal announced this week will do \nnothing to address the largest trade barrier our manufacturers face, \nwhich is currency manipulation. As with past trade deals, a side \nagreement in the TPP related to currency manipulation is window \ndressing that is unlikely to be enforced at all, as most of the NAFTA \nside agreements were not, and will do little to stem the flow of \nAmerican jobs overseas. As with past trade deals, this will force \nAmerican manufacturers to compete with foreign companies that receive \nunfair advantages from their governments. For this reason, Ford Motor \nCompany has come out in opposition to this trade agreement.\n  The TPP has been negotiated under a cloud of secrecy--by the way, \nthey all are--by multinational conglomerates, and we know from the \nUnited States, the financial services industry and the pharmaceutical \ncompanies--both have only one priority, their bottom line--were very \nimportant in those negotiations. Now that an agreement has been \nreached, the negotiators will no longer be able to keep the contents of \nthe bad trade deal hidden from the public.\n  As you know, Mr. Speaker, were any of us to look at the trade bill \nthat they did make available over here, we were not able to take a \npencil or paper with us. We had to have somebody with security \nclearance go with us--our own staff could not go--and we could not \nspeak about it. That is some strange idea, I think, of democracy.\n  I have been in conversations with parliamentarians from Australia and \nfrom Canada who have had the very same problem. As a matter of fact, in \nAustralia, if any of the parliamentarians wanted to see the trade bill, \nthey had to sign a paper they would not discuss it for 4 years. For \nthree of the greatest economies and democracies in this trade \nagreement--the United States, Canada, and Australia--to allow their \nparliamentarians to be put into that kind of restraint is one of the \nmost egregious parts of these trade agreements.\n  Now that we will be able, since it has been signed, to look at it, \nnegotiators are going to have a lot of explaining to do. Because as \nAmericans learn more in the coming weeks and months about how this \nagreement will impact their day-to-day lives with things like unsafe \nfood imports--we are pretty certain about that because we already \nturned around a great number, tons of seafood coming in; 98 percent of \nthe seafood that we eat is imported, and about 2 to 3 percent of it is \ninspected--the momentum of a bad trade deal will continue to grow.\n  Let me tell you why we, the Canadians, the Australians, the European \nUnion, and the United Nations are upset about this. There is a thing \ncalled the investor-state dispute settlement, and it is onerous. It \ngives to three corporate lawyers the right to settle disputes.\n  Any investor-state in this agreement can bring a case against any of \nthe other countries in the agreement if they think that a law or a \npractice in that country affects their bottom line. We know that \neverybody is worried about that here because one committee of the \nHouse, just in talking about it, did away with country-of-origin \nlabeling.\n  So, as I have pointed out, both the United Nations and the European \nUnion have done papers on the fact that this is a very bad way to run \nanything, to let three corporate lawyers make that decision; but we are \ngoing to be stuck with that, unfortunately, unless we can kill the \nbill.\n\n[[Page H6923]]\n\n  What is even more abhorrent is that some of our trading partners, \nMalaysia--Malaysia has the worst human rights record on the face of the \nEarth. We know that. The State Department has always given them a very \nlow grade. They have slave labor. We know that they do sex trafficking, \nand they just recently took the Prime Minister off on some kind of \ncharges. There is no reason in the world that we would include them in \na trade agreement. Then there is also Brunei, which practices sharia \nlaw. These two countries, under the investor-state dispute settlement, \ncan make sure that our laws do not interfere with their making a \nprofit.\n  We are better people than that, Mr. Speaker. We are going to be \nlooking at this very closely. It is really not a trade deal. In my \nview, it is a race to the bottom.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I would like to thank the \ngentlewoman from New York for her comments and for being with us today \nas part of the Progressive Caucus.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to a Member who has been outspoken on behalf of \nworking families and American workers, Mr. Pocan from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. POCAN. Mr. Speaker, I am really glad to be here today with the \nProgressive Caucus Special Order hour, and I would like to thank the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) for all her hard work \non behalf of the Progressive Caucus and on behalf of this issue on the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership.\n  As we know, over the weekend and all last week, the U.S. Trade \nRepresentative Office's cooks have been in the kitchen, and they have \ntold us now the Trans-Pacific Partnership is done; but from everything \nthat we can tell, it is not fully baked. In fact, at best, it is half-\nbaked when it comes to labor, environmental, and consumer concerns.\n  Now that a final deal has been reached, we asked the administration \nto let the American public immediately see the full text of this \nagreement. This negotiating process has not been transparent up to this \npoint, despite claims from the U.S. Trade Representative Office. We \nknow that about 600 people, largely corporate CEOs, have been involved \nin the drafting of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, but not Congress, and \ncertainly not members of the public. The secretive nature of these \nnegotiations is compounded by the pressure to throw together this deal \nbased on the political timelines of our negotiating partners rather \nthan with the regard of the U.S. worker in mind.\n  Reports throughout the course of the negotiating process have raised \nserious questions about the impact of this agreement on a number of \nareas ranging from workplace and environmental protections to food \nsafety, but, most importantly, jobs and wages. We all know this economy \nhas been rebounding. The stockmarket is significantly up from the 2008 \ncrash. Corporate profits are up. CEO pay is up. Productivity is up. But \nwages for the American worker have, unfortunately, been dead flat, and \nthe Trans-Pacific Partnership will lead to the loss of good-paying jobs \nright here in the U.S.\n  Through several decades of unfair trade rules, corporations have \noutsourced production and offshored jobs, and the TPP will only \nexacerbate this problem. In fact, on Tuesday, in its initial analysis, \nThe Wall Street Journal has projected an increase in the manufacturing \ntrade deficit of $38.2 billion. That means jobs and wages right here in \nthe United States.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Additional reports have also said that the labor standards will \nremain subpar, that currency manipulation has not been adequately \naddressed, rules of origin for autos have been weakened, and human \nrights issues with countries like Malaysia and Brunei have not been \ndealt with properly.\n  Among these concerns, corporations still have the ability to \nsupersede laws of our country through the investor-state dispute \nsettlement process, something that Representative Slaughter explained \nvery aggressively in her comments.\n  This agreement has nothing to do to effectively address currency \nmanipulation, which that alone has contributed to the loss of up to 5 \nmillion U.S. jobs.\n  Despite claims by the administration that this agreement is the most \nprogressive high standard deal that we have ever negotiated, the labor \nenvironmental rules in our free trade agreements are rarely enforced in \nour partner nations.\n  In fact, 4 years ago, when we passed the Colombia Free Trade \nAgreement, to the letter of the law the Colombian Government has put \nthe provisions within Colombian law and not one bit of that has \nactually been implemented and over 100 labor leaders in the last 4 \nyears have been killed just in Colombia.\n  So these trade agreements haven't worked based on past practice, and \nwithout changes they are not going to work in future progress as well.\n  In addition, the administration has gone out of its way to help cover \nup human rights atrocities in order to conclude these negotiations.\n  Malaysia was demoted in the State Department's 2014 Trafficking in \nPersons Report due to its grossly inadequate response to the perverse \ntracking of minority groups throughout the country.\n  By downgrading them within the same year that mass graves were found \nof workers in Malaysia is an insult to human rights conditions, and to \ninclude them and countries like Brunei that still stone gays and \nlesbians and single mothers is a further evidence that this deal is not \nready for the public or for Congress to accept for the public.\n  The Trans-Pacific Partnership is neither free trade nor fair trade. \nIn reality, it is a system of rules crafted by multi-national corporate \ninterests and their lobbyists that work for a select group of powerful \npeople at the expense of everyone else. This just isn't about jobs or \nwages. This is an agreement about corporate profits. Past trade deals \nhave been a disaster for American workers. So it is imperative that \nCongress rigorously review this deal to ensure that the American people \naren't yet taken for a ride again.\n  Again, I will renew my call and the Progressive Caucus' call to \nimmediately release the text of the agreement. Six hundred corporate \nCEOs know what is in the deal, but the 435 Members of this House and \nthe American public don't. That is simply wrong.\n  If this deal is as good as they say it is, put the language on the \ntable and let's review it with the public. My fear is that it is not. \nIf it is going to cost American jobs and wages, it is the wrong thing \nto do, and we have to reject the Trans-Pacific Partnership.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania for taking the time to be with us to talk about what is \nsuch an important issue for us.\n  Mr. Speaker, it isn't often that we get a second bite at an apple in \nrealtime, but this is one of those opportunities that we do have. There \nhave been a number of issues that have been raised that I believe \nvalidate from our perspective that this is not a good deal.\n  It is not a good deal for American families. It is not a good deal \nfor American workers. It is only a good deal for multi-national \ncorporations.\n  We are engaging in a trade relationship with countries whose values \nwe do not share and who, on occasions, we have actually had the \nopportunity to shame.\n  I believe, Mr. Speaker, that we, as Members of Congress, can find \nthis as an opportunity to work together to do something collectively, \nwhich is better for the American family and the American worker. We can \ndo that at the same time we have an opportunity to have fair trade \nagreements and just trade agreements.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Connecticut \n(Ms. DeLauro), a Member who has been as outspoken as any other Member \nin this House about the need to turn back from this flawed agreement, a \nleader on workers' rights and human rights and women's rights and \nbuilding an economy that works for average Americans.\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, I want to say thank you to my colleague and \nwhat an honor for me to join with you and to thank you for your \nsteadfast efforts in fighting for working families, for the American \nworkers, men and women, and not being afraid to stand up and say no to \nwhat would be injustice for our American workers and their families.\n\n[[Page H6924]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been 4 days since the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nwas announced. We have not yet been shown the text, but we have heard a \nchorus of spin about the supposed benefits of this secret agreement.\n  After more than 5 years of talks, the parties have announced a deal \nwithout having released a single word to the public. The negotiations \ntook place under unprecedented secrecy.\n  Corporate special interests had a place at the table. Congress and \nAmerican families were locked out. The American people and their \nelected representatives in Congress are forced to rely on leaks to find \nout what is in this agreement.\n  But the truth is that, on vital issues like workers' rights, \nenvironment, and human rights, the standards are only valuable if they \nare enforced. If experience is any guide, we will do little to enforce \nthose provisions.\n  I remember in 2007 when my Democratic colleagues in this Chamber \nforced the Bush administration to renegotiate a number of trade \nagreements to include enhanced labor standards.\n  In the 8 years since, neither the current administration nor its \npredecessor has taken meaningful action to enforce those provisions. So \ndozens of Colombian union organizers are being murdered despite labor \nprovision in the U.S. Colombia Free Trade Agreement. Thousands of acres \nof Peruvian forests are being destroyed despite the environmental \nprovisions in the U.S.-Peru Free Trade Agreement.\n  Why would we assume that the Trans-Pacific Partnership will be any \ndifferent when it comes to Brunei's persecution of LGBT people, \nMalaysia's human trafficking and forced labor, or Vietnam's abundant \nuse of child labor?\n  In fact, the administration has already shown us how little regard it \npays to these issues by upgrading Malaysia's classification on human \ntrafficking in order to sign the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement.\n  Past experience tells us what to expect in other areas as well. The \nlast big trade deal, the U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement, cost this \ncountry 75,000 jobs in just 3 years, according to the Economic Policy \nInstitute.\n  The TPP will be even worse. Not only is it far bigger, it will throw \nAmericans into competition with Vietnamese workers who make less than \n65 cents per hour. These provisions will offshore jobs, lower our \nwages, and increase income inequality. Americans workers have seen this \nhappen to them year after year after year.\n\n  To compound these problems, it has been reported that the TPP will \nremove support from green jobs and American industry by outlawing buy \nAmerican and buy local standards in government procurement contracts \nand potentially opening the door for Chinese state-owned enterprises to \ntake those contracts.\n  In common with every previous trade agreement, the TPP does nothing \nto curb currency manipulation, which basically allows countries to keep \ntheir goods and the price of their goods at artificially low prices. \nThat means, if they lower their prices and their currency, ours are \nmore expensive.\n  This abuse, not in my words, but in the words of economists C. Fred \nBergsten at the Peterson Institute, Jared Bernstein at the Center for \nAmerican Progress--they believe that currency manipulation and its \npractice by China, by Singapore, and Vietnam, who are all part of the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership agreement--that currency manipulation has led \nto the loss of almost 5 million jobs in the United States of America.\n  One of the biggest historical manipulators, as I said, Japan, is a \nmember of the TPP. The administration has even floated the idea of \nadding China, probably the worst currency manipulator in history.\n  China's recent devaluation just a few short weeks ago of the yuan \ncost up to 640,000 American jobs, according to the Economic Policy \nInstitute. And after the administration decided to take no action \nagainst China, TPP partner Vietnam followed suit, and they devalued \ntheir own currency.\n  In other words, with this agreement, we are rewarding the cheats. No \ncurrency forum, as the administration has talked about, because \ncurrency and enforceable currency regulations are not in the \nlegislation.\n  But they say there is going to be a forum, that we will have the \nopportunity to discuss this. Well, you can have a lot of forums, but \nunless you have an enforcement mechanism to say no, it is not going to \nbe fixed. It has to be fixed in the agreement, and it is not. So the \nforum is meaningless.\n  The predictable calamities do not end there. Earlier this year, WTO \ntrade agreements led to the dismantling of American food labeling laws, \ncountry of origin labeling, so that the American public will know where \ntheir food is coming from.\n  Again, the TPP goes even further by allowing multi-national \ncorporations, as well as foreign governments, to challenge U.S. law. It \nwill not be long before we start to see challenges to our food safety \nsystem, a system already strained to the breaking point by a flood of \ntainted contaminated seafood from the TPP countries like Malaysia and \nVietnam.\n  Finally, we know that the TPP will establish rules that give Big \nPharma different monopoly periods across partner nations. That makes no \nsense in a free trade agreement. Why would you do this? That is only to \nkeep drug prices high.\n  One commonly used combination of HIV drugs cost $10,000 per year when \nbought from a Big Pharma monopolist, from the big pharmaceutical \ncompany, but as a generic, it only costs $250. What this agreement will \ndo is to delay generics coming to the market.\n  And by locking in these corporate monopolies, the agreement \ncompromises our access to medicines for the people who need it the \nmost: your constituents, my colleague, and mine, and all of our \ncolleagues.\n  President Obama said on Monday that the Trans-Pacific Partnership \nagreement ``reflects American values.'' But the administration's \napproach has been the opposite. It has put corporate special interests \nbefore the interests of the American people instead of learning from \npast experience. We are being railroaded into yet another trade \nagreement that risks our jobs, our wages, and the health of our family.\n  But, under the law, there is still time for Congress to reject the \nTrans-Pacific Partnership agreement, and that is what we need to do in \na bipartisan way. There are people on both sides of the aisle in this \ninstitution that oppose this agreement.\n  We need to come together and we need to come together for the sake of \nthe working men and women that we represent all over this country. That \nis what our job is to do right now. We have a moral responsibility. We \nhave an obligation to the people who elect us and send us here to \nrepresent their best interests.\n  Everything that we know from past agreements and what limited amount \nof information we know from this agreement will put the economic \nsecurity at risk for American families.\n  I want to say to my colleague, thank you for doing this. We need over \nthe next several weeks to be doing this every single day because the \nword has got to go out to the American public of just what is at stake \nin this trade agreement, and they will be calling their representative \nand telling them to vote ``no.''\n  Thank you very, very much for the opportunity to participate tonight.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from \nConnecticut for her eloquent and compelling words. Whenever she speaks \nup for the American people, she does so in such a convincing way and a \nway that is backed by empirical data, not just anecdotes and not just \nsort of dreams, but that which she already knows.\n  So I appreciate and feel particularly honored to represent the \nCongressional Progressive Caucus here this evening to speak out on \nissues that we know are very important, vitally important, to the well-\nbeing of the American worker and our American families.\n  I do pray that our congressional body can come together around an \nissue that affects all of us in any district that we might represent, \nin any corner of the United States of America, and at any economic \nstrata that we might represent.\n  With that, Mr. Speaker, I have no more speakers who want to address \nthis issue this evening. I thank you for your indulgence.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H6925]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6925-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6925-H6931]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                       LIFTING BAN ON OIL EXPORTS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Conaway) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the leadership allowing me to \nvisit with you about something that is near and dear to my heart. I \nhope we spend the better part of the next hour discussing a bill \ntomorrow that will be before this body, which is H.R. 702, which would \nlift the 40-year-old, decades-old ban on exporting a domestic product, \na domestic commodity, called crude oil.\n  As you look at the things that America buys and sells around the \nworld, the only commodity that we produce here in the United States \nthat we cannot export is crude oil. It harkens back to 40 years ago, \nand I will talk about it in a second.\n  There are no restrictions on imports. You could import all the crude \noil that you would like, but we have a restriction on exporting that \ncrude oil.\n  Now, the administration recently signaled a bit of a change in that \nin that they licensed a swap of certain number of barrels of heavy \ncrude from Mexico for light sweet crude coming to the United States. So \nthere was at least one opportunity recently where the Department of \nCommerce authorized that swap and, in effect, began to export some of \nthis crude that we produce every single day.\n  Forty years ago the Arab oil embargo and all the things that happened \nwith that--most of the folks in this Chamber, except maybe you and I, \ndon't necessarily recall the long lines at the gas station and the \nrationing and the way that even-numbered license plates were okay one \nday and odd-numbered license plates were okay the next day to buy \ngasoline.\n  I can remember living in Dallas at the time. I would have to get up \nat 5 o'clock in the morning and go sit in line at a gas station in \norder to fill up the car so that I could make it downtown and back and \nforth. It was somewhat disruptive to our quiet lives.\n  The price of oil went from $3 a barrel to $12 a gallon, a fourfold \nincrease. That shock hammered the economy with a lot of things that \nwere going on.\n  As a part of that response, in addition to the response, just before \nthe Arab oil embargo in the 1973-1974 timeframe, the United States had, \nthrough a secret study, determined that American crude oil production \nmay have peaked in 1970 and that the wells in the United States that \nwere then producing and the new ones that were going to be drilled and \nbrought online--that the daily production in the United States would \nslowly decline from that point on and that that scarce resource of \nstrategic value needed to stay here in the United States.\n  So while we were even a net importer at that point in time, the \nwisdom of this House, the Senate, and the President at the time was: \nLet's just don't export any U.S. crude. Let's use all of it here. And \nthen we will buy from other folks the crude oil that we need to make up \nthe difference in our refinery loads.\n  That held true for 35 years. Then something pretty stunning happened, \nand that was this incredible renaissance in the oil and gas business \nthat has occurred over the last 5 years.\n  When history writes about this era of the oil and gas business, it \nwill talk about these incredible breakthroughs in technology and the \nscience associated with it and the risk taking of the private sector.\n  The current President likes to brag about the oil and increased \nproduction. Quite frankly, this has all come in the private sector, \nprivate lands, and private initiatives, where this has happened. \nPermitting on public property, public lands, has slowed down, and \nactual production off our Federal lands has shrunk from where it has \nbeen.\n  So for 35 years it was a policy that was out there. It was never an \nissue because we didn't produce enough every day to export.\n  Then about 5 years ago this process of increased production was \ndriven by the shale oil play in the Bakken, the shale oil play in west \nTexas, and the shale oil play in the Eagle Ford shale in south Texas, \nbig frac jobs, technologies that broke the rock up or allowed the oil \nto escape out of that rock in quantities heretofore not really \ncontemplated or known.\n  The oil was in the rock. Everyone knew that. They just didn't know \nhow to get it out of the rock. This wonderful renaissance began to \noccur, and U.S. production began to increase every day to the point now \nthat the estimates, had the price not dropped, were that, by 2020, we \nwould be the largest exporter and that we would have an excess.\n  So we already had a bit of an excess of crude oil in the United \nStates because it had to go through U.S. refineries. U.S. refineries \nare set up to process heavy crude, which is not what is produced out of \nthis oil shale. That is light, sweet crude. So, consequently, we had \nmore light sweet. We are still importing crude every day from Venezuela \nand other countries that feed heavy crude into our refineries.\n  So it got on everybody's radar screen that we need to figure out a \nway to unlock this market and eliminate the inefficiencies associated \nwith not being able to export U.S. crude.\n  As a result of that, there are two sets of prices in the world \nmarkets. There is a Brent price of crude, which is North Sea crude, and \nthere is also a West Texas Intermediate price that is in the markets.\n  There has been for a long time now a differential between those two \nprices. The West Texas Intermediate price, which is what our local \nAmerican producers get, was less than the Brent crude.\n  That differential was driven by the fact that we had no market for \nU.S. crude, other than U.S. refineries, given the laws and the \nrestrictions that were in place. So the movement began to explore the \nopportunity for lifting this decades-long ban on crude oil.\n  Throughout the years that Harry Reid was in charge of the Senate, it \nwas a nonstarter because it was not likely we could get a bill like we \nare going to vote on tomorrow in the House through the Senate. With the \nRepublican victory last November and control in the Senate by \nRepublicans, it then became an opportunity for us to examine this \npolicy and see if it makes sense.\n  Just to set the record straight, even without the bad deal the \nPresident has foisted on us, we treat Iran better than we treat \nAmerican producers. Because even before the sanctions are lifted in \nIran, they can produce and export about a million barrels of crude oil \na day. The U.S. is zero.\n  So as you step back to look at the big picture, we treat Iran--with \nall the mischief they do and the bad actor they are and the threat to \nworld peace that they are, they get better treatment than domestic \nproducers, and that makes no sense whatsoever when you look at the \noverall issue.\n  So we are at a point now where, with this drop in prices to almost \nhalf of what it was, we have begun to see that crude oil production \nwill probably tail off here in the United States this quarter.\n  But the oil is there. We know how to get it. The science is \navailable. It is just simply driven by the price. Recovering the \ndrilling and completion costs is what is causing the current decline in \nproduction, but we know where it is and how to go get it.\n\n  When a well comes online, from day one, it will begin to produce less \noil today than it did yesterday. That process, that decline, will move \nforward throughout the life of that well until it reaches its economic \nlimit.\n  The economic limit of a producing well is driven by the price versus \nhow much it costs you to get it out of the ground, the taxes associated \nwith the barrel, the royalties associated with it. Those have got to be \nin positive circumstances or it doesn't make any sense to produce that \ncrude oil.\n  In the drilling and the completion of a well, you have got to be able \nto recover that investment from the total number of barrels that you \nexpect to produce out of that well. When you know those fixed costs \ngoing in, there are very few of those costs that are recoverable once \nyou drill a well.\n  Your only return is to sell the crude oil. And given how much you \nthink that each well will produce, it has got to be at a price where \nyou can recover that investment as well as cover your incremental costs \neach day of producing that crude oil.\n  So there are some sound economic reasons why, at current prices of \ncrude\n\n[[Page H6926]]\n\noil, there is less drilling going on and certainly less completions \ngoing on in the market.\n  That oil is not going anywhere. That shale is just the way it was \nwhen the prices were a lot higher. So if prices were to recover and it \nmade sense, then our American domestic producers could go back to \nproducing more and would then reset that decline on an upward slope so \nthat we are, in fact, producing more oil each day than we did yesterday \nbecause we are bringing on more wells every single day to offset the \nnatural decline that each well will experience. While we have got this \nwindow of opportunity, it is time now to lift this crude oil ban.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am joined by my neighbor, who represents the southern \ntwo-thirds of New Mexico. More importantly, he represents my three \ngrandsons who live in Las Cruces, New Mexico. So I watch him like a \nhawk to make sure he is doing a good job representing my grandsons.\n  I yield to the gentleman from New Mexico (Mr. Pearce).\n  Mr. PEARCE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to bring to attention that we \nare engaged in a very important activity here. We are talking about \nAmerican jobs.\n  Now, some people dismiss jobs as being a four-letter word. Well, I \nmean it kind of is, but not that kind of four-letter word. It is an \nimportant piece.\n  When I was born, my father was a sharecropper. In 1947, the year I \nwas born, he made $200. The next year, the drought year, he made 50 \nbucks.\n  Mom said, ``We are leaving the farm.'' She jumped in the pickup \ntruck. Dad jumped in the back, along with us kids. There were three \nkids at that time, later to become six.\n  They headed to the West. I don't think they knew where they were \ngoing. I guess they would have stopped when they got to California. But \nthey got 75 miles down the road and broke down 3 miles outside of \nHobbs, New Mexico. They hitchhiked into Hobbs, and that is where I grew \nup.\n  Dad was able to find a job almost immediately in the oilfield. He got \nin at the lowest level, a roustabout, making $2.62 an hour.\n  Now, to them, to my family who had made $200 for a full year's work \nand $50 for the next year's work, $2.62 an hour was the absolute \npinnacle.\n  They never moved from Hobbs. They stayed there and raised their six \nchildren on $2.62 an hour. And, of course, it graduated through the \nyears.\n  That is why I am passionate about this export ban. Because right now \nwe have people in my home county who are being laid off because our oil \nis sitting in the pipelines. The pipelines going to Houston are filled \nup. And so companies are having to shut down wells. They are having to \nstop production.\n  Now, some of the countries in the Baltics have come to Eddy County, \nwhich is one of the counties I represent, and they have said, ``We \nwould buy your light, sweet oil. That crude oil is better than what we \nbuy from Russia. We would stop buying from Russia and buy from you,'' \nexcept we have this ban in place. We can't ship oil out of this \ncountry.\n  Now, we have to understand that 95 percent of the world's consumers \nare outside the United States. So when we have this self-imposed \nproblem, this self-imposed restriction on sending a product that is \nvery needed out there, know that we are penalizing American jobs.\n  The President has been very, very ardent in his willingness to create \nIranian jobs because he insists that Iran should be able to export \ntheir oil while all the time saying that he is opposed to the idea of \nthis bill.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  We are going to consider this bill tomorrow, and I think in my heart \nthat we are doing things that would benefit people like my parents, \npeople who did not have the option to move to New York and be on Wall \nStreet. They didn't have the option to move to Albuquerque or Dallas. \nThey were where they could get to, and they were able to find work and \nraise a family. That is the people that I am fighting for, the people \nthat don't have other choices.\n  Now, the oilfield provides very good jobs. In this current energy \nrevolution that is taking place in the country, this explosion of shale \noil production, truck drivers in my hometown were receiving $100,000 a \nyear to drive a truck. If you wanted to work overtime, you could get up \nto $120,000. That is the sort of job that is now available to people \nlike my father. If he were still working, those jobs would be out \nthere.\n  But it is not just the people in the oil and gas industry. It is the \npeople who work in the convenience store at the corner. They are busy \n24 hours a day, and the local convenience store operator may have to \npay $15 an hour just to attract people in. It benefits everyone, \nregardless if they are in oil and gas or not.\n  In New Mexico, oil and gas provides about 40 percent to our State's \nbudget. I tell teachers on the other side of the State: With no oil and \ngas, you should be vitally interested in this export bill because, if \nwe put people back to work in the oil industry, that money goes \nstraight to the State government, and it helps pay your salary.\n  Up and down the spectrum, people are benefited when we have a vital \nenergy economy.\n  If we are going to allow our light sweet crude to be exported, people \nwonder: Are we going to run out of energy? Absolutely not. It is not \ngoing to get more expensive.\n  Back when my father was working for Humble, which later became Exxon, \nthey had a company philosophy. They were the largest energy company in \nthe world. They simply said this area, the Permian Basin here in New \nMexico, is going to run out of oil in the late 1980s, so they sold \nevery producing well in that area. They simply moved out.\n  Just a couple of years ago, a discovery was made in southern New \nMexico--keep in mind, some of the majors moved out, said there was no \nmore future in this area; it is going to be out of oil--and a discovery \nwas made that is going to produce more oil from that one field than has \nbeen produced in New Mexico through the whole of New Mexico in all of \nits history, from one field that was discovered recently.\n  We have this kind of thing where people are saying, well, we have got \nto worry and we have got to think about the future and save it for the \nfuture. No, there is as much oil out there unused as we have used in \nNew Mexico. So let us have New Mexico jobs. Let us continue to export \nnow instead of allowing the oil to fill up the pipelines and shut down \njobs. That is the main reason that I am supporting this.\n  Obviously, I appreciate the fact that energy is national security. \nThe low energy prices now are rebuilding the manufacturing economy. As \nwe drive the price of oil down--and keep in mind that the consumers \nbenefit from that. Gasoline had gotten to over $4. Now, then, it is \nright down in the $2 range. So it benefits the consumers.\n  It is also attracting back industries that manufacture. That is \nessential for that kind of business. If you are going to manufacture, \nyou need affordable, reliable energy. Firms are moving back here in \norder to produce. That is creating even other jobs that don't even seem \nassociated with the energy business.\n  So, again, you have many, many reasons for supporting this energy \nexport bill, and I urge my colleagues to do that.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from New Mexico for \nhis thoughts and comments. He and I are blessed to share a group of \npeople who work across that State line between Texas and New Mexico--\nour districts are contiguous with each other--who live in one State, \nwork in the other, vice versa, some of the hardest working, most \ndedicated, patriotic folks on the face of the Earth, like his dad and \nhis mom who have built wealth, raised a family, protected that family, \nand produced a U.S. Congressman. It makes them easy to talk about and \neasy to defend.\n  I want to flush out this idea of the geopolitical aspects of lifting \nthe ban. I was recently in a Baltic country in conversations with one \nof the top two leaders, and I had the chance to ask a question of the \nPrime Minister. I said: Mr. Prime Minister, if you could buy crude oil \ndirectly from the United States, would it make your issues with Putin \nand all the mischief and things he is up to less difficult to deal \nwith?\n  He lit up like a Christmas tree. He said: Oh, absolutely, absolutely. \nWe would love to buy U.S. crude and not spend that money with Putin and \nRussia and help lift the boot--the Russian\n\n[[Page H6927]]\n\nboot off their neck--that is driven by crude oil and natural gas.\n  If they could supply to these countries that can't supply themselves, \nthen there is absolutely no reason whatsoever that they shouldn't be \nrunning our light sweet crude through their refineries at this point in \ntime.\n  Steve talked about his dad. My dad was the same way in the sense that \nif rigs--he was a roughneck, and roughnecks are that hardy group of \nindividuals who work on a drilling rig. It is dangerous. It is hard. It \nis 24 hours a day. They work 8-hour shifts.\n  My dad would pull doubles in order to get the extra time and a half \nso the cash flow to the family would be enough to feed my brother, \nsister, me, and my mom. He lost a part of a finger as a part of that \nexperience. If the rigs were running in Borger, Texas--we lived in \nBorger, Texas, where I was born. If the rigs were running in Odessa, \nTexas, we moved to Odessa, Texas, because my dad thought it was more \nimportant to have a job than necessarily where we lived because that \nwas key.\n  In the early 1990s, I was part of a group that did a needs assessment \nin Midland, Texas. And we sometimes lose sight of why jobs are \nimportant because we talk a lot about it. But that needs assessment did \na scientifically sound, statistically sound survey of Midland, asking \nfolks what are the issues within your home, what are the issues within \nyour neighborhood, what are the issues within your community that have \na problem, that create this problem? We then winnowed those down to the \ntop 10.\n  If you looked at that list of top 10 needs of Midland, Texas, at the \ntime, 9 of those would have been positively impacted by somebody having \na job. Whatever that need was, it was less of a problem if a family had \na job than if they didn't have a job.\n  The jobs that this will create, jobs that this will protect and \nmaintain are important. The unemployment rate in Midland, Texas, is \nstill in the 3, 2 range, and Odessa is the lower 4. That hides some \nother issues associated with this problem; and that is, before the drop \nin the price of oil, not only were there a lot of jobs, but a lot of \nthose jobs were providing some 10, 15, 20 hours of overtime each week \nto the people that were working. Overtime is a real boost because it is \ntime and a half.\n  Now, then, these folks still have a job, and with the decreased \nactivity, the decreased drilling and all the other activity associated \nwith the crude oil business, that overtime has evaporated. These folks \nstill have a job, but they built commitments and bought trucks and \nother things based on that overtime, and they are now not getting it. \nSo while they still have a job, the cash flow to their families is \nimpacted.\n\n  I had another opportunity to see the impact of that recently when I \ntoured our local food bank and was discussing with them what was going \non. They said that the elderly population coming to the food bank had \ndramatically increased over the last 4 or 5 months as a result of this \ndrop in prices.\n  I asked, Well, why is that? They said that many of these adults, \nthese elderly adults, their families had been helping them with their \nmonthly bills. Because they had this extra overtime, they had extra \nmoney that they were able to help their families with, and now that \nthat has evaporated, that trickle-down effect is impacting these \nelderly who are on fixed incomes and are having to now go to the food \nbank. Creating jobs, you just can't overstate how important that is.\n  I have now been joined by my fellow Texan from the Dallas area, Pete \nSessions, current chairman of the Committee on Rules. I yield to my \ngood friend.\n  Mr. SESSIONS. Chairman Conaway, I want to thank you for leading this \neffort tonight as we talk to the American people about what we are not \nonly doing in Washington, D.C., but about what we began several years \nago, a process of talking to our colleagues about how important it was \nthat America have a strong energy policy. America is the only nation in \nthe world that has a provision that does not allow the export of crude \noil.\n  Crude oil is something that we have been told for a long, long time, \nsince the mid-1970s, that we are running out of. It is a natural \nresource that America has an abundance of, but over the years that we \nare running out of oil, we are running out and depleting what we have.\n  Then a few years ago, some bit of reality took place because a change \nin technology, a change in technology that was called horizontal \ndrilling, allowed those people who were in the oil patch actually \ndrilling and doing the hard work necessary to extract this gift that we \nhave in this country, developed a process that would allow them to get \n60 percent more oil than what had previously been provided for through \nthose existing processes.\n  Overnight, Americans saw that we also gained the advantage of getting \nmore natural gas. The proven reserves of not only natural gas, but also \ncrude oil shot up dramatically; and it became very apparent not only to \nthe marketplace, because we have seen consumer prices fall over the \nlast few years from over $4.40 per gallon in lots of places to last \nweek, in Dallas, Texas, 2 weeks ago, gasoline at $1.97. It is true, \nlast weekend that I was home, it was $2.18. Mr. Speaker, I would sooner \nbe paying between $1.99 and $2.18 for the gasoline that I use as \nopposed to the scare tactics of where we were just a few short years \nago of over $4.\n  What does this mean to the American consumer? What does this mean to \nfamilies all over the United States? More importantly, what does it \nmean to America? It means that in testimony that was gathered yesterday \nat the Committee on Rules, on which I have a chance to serve as the \nchairman, that we heard that they are expecting at least 400,000 \nregular jobs that would be added to the economy. That would be all \nacross the United States of America--New York, Illinois, Florida, North \nCarolina, all over this country--because it would encourage us to do \nmore work, to be able, instead of taking these places and putting a \nstop on their production, we would now do more production, get it into \nthe worldwide market, sell it overseas, and it becomes a product just \nlike a farm product that can be sold around the world that would help \nAmerica's exports.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am here today to thank not only Chairman Joe Barton, \nbut also Chairman Michael Conaway for the hard work that they have done \nto sell the ideas and the reality that America can have it both ways, \nand that is: we can produce our natural products; we can get more than \n60 percent more out of the ground than we were getting before because \nof the technology; and we can help the American consumer, moms and dads \nwho need to get to work, who need to go to softball and football \npractice, and also to work and back and church and back, all in a way \nthat they can meet their budget.\n  I am pleased and proud to say, Chairman Conaway, you can count on me \ntomorrow, that I will be there to support this great piece of \nlegislation. I want to thank you for allowing me to be with you to talk \nabout the importance of this bill and to wish you good luck tomorrow.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the chairman of the Committee on \nRules, Pete Sessions, for his kind words and also his support tomorrow.\n  I think the bill that went through the Committee on Energy and \nCommerce that started life as a Joe Barton bill will be the one that \nmakes it to the floor tomorrow.\n  We are expecting to have a really solid, bipartisan vote, by the way. \nThis is not a partisan issue, per se, but the White House might try to \nmake it that. This is a bipartisan issue.\n  I yield to my colleague from Arkansas, French Hill. French.\n  Mr. HILL. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this commonsense bill, \nwhich has been a long time in coming.\n  I want to thank Mr. Conaway for his leadership in bringing it to the \nfloor tomorrow, and the process the committee used, which was a series \nof hearings through the process, supported by our chairman, supported \nby members on both sides of the aisle.\n  I want to thank Joe Barton and Mr. Cuellar of Texas for their \nleadership in recruiting cosponsors, a large bipartisan group of \ncosponsors, to bring this longstanding bill to the floor and the \npositive efforts it will have on our economy.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  I would like to say to my friend, Mr. Sessions--and I invite him to \ncome to\n\n[[Page H6928]]\n\nLittle Rock--that I filled up last week for $1.82. So, perhaps Arkansas \nis a more competitive gas pricing market than even Texas. That may be \nthe biggest economic news of the day here on the floor.\n  We have touched on the importance of American jobs. All of our \nAmerican jobs in the oil patch right now are suffering due to low \nprices and low development budgets. I don't have any doubt that when \nreserves are revalued September 30 for our publicly traded companies, \ntheir oil and gas exploration lines of credit will be down because of \npricing in the U.S.; and, therefore, this is a boost for the economic \nopportunity for jobs in the United States in development.\n  I want to touch on the national security aspects of this bill that I \nthink are so important, Mr. Speaker. Early in the year, this House \npassed ways to improve liquefied natural gas to be developed and \nshipped overseas to international markets. We have an abundant amount \nof natural gas in this country. We are now the world's leading \nproducer, and we have the opportunity to provide natural gas in \nliquefied form around the world to our allies in Asia and Europe. \nLikewise, eliminating the ban on crude oil, long outgrown by North \nAmerican production and our economic success, will allow us to now, \nfrom a national security point of view, to have liquefied natural gas \nand crude oil as export potential and as economic job potential for the \nU.S.\n  But more importantly, to our NATO allies and to our Asian allies, we \noffer them North American gas and crude oil as an alternative to the \nMid East and, most importantly, Europe to Russia. For too long, our \nallies in Europe have been held hostage by the politics of the Mid East \nor the politics of Russia. This allows us to be a much better not only \neconomic partner, but national security partner with our allies in \nEurope and our allies in Asia.\n  I want to thank you, Mr. Chairman, for the opportunity to come to the \nfloor and speak in strong support of this bill to remove the export ban \non crude oil in the United States. I urge my fellow Members, both \nDemocrat and Republican, to provide a good, strong, bipartisan vote and \nsend that message to the United States Senate to join us in passing \nthis lifting of the ban, and to send a message to White House, Mr. \nChairman, that a veto message here is not appropriate.\n  I invite the President and the OMB and the Department of Energy to \nreconsider that, in fact, this is a national security benefit to the \nUnited States and a jobs and economic benefit to the United States, and \nit is not the kind of thing that our President should issue a veto \nthreat on.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from Arkansas for his comments and \nopinions on this issue. I hope his support draws Members of the other \nside of the aisle to our arguments and to make this happen.\n  The gentleman mentioned the price he paid in Arkansas recently. I \ndare say, there is not another commodity in America that we don't check \nthe price on more often than gasoline. You may not buy gas every day, \nbut every time you drive by a gasoline station, you check the price \nbecause it is right there for everybody to see. We don't put the price \nof bread and milk up like that, but we do put the price of gasoline up.\n  I have got a district that has 29 counties and is 300 miles wide and \n200-plus miles north to south. We do a lot of driving. My district \ndirector and I are always looking for that better gasoline price deal \nin the district as we are moving around, because hardwired into most \nall of us that drive very much is to check those prices.\n  This increased production in the United States will also help protect \nconsumers from price shocks. I mentioned that in 1974, the price of \ncrude oil went from $3 a barrel to $12 a barrel, a fourfold increase. \nThe more production you have from a stable environment like the United \nStates, the less whipsaw you will get in the market from disruptions in \nsupplies from places and part of the world where it is not quite as \nstable, such as the Middle East and others.\n  So, this increased U.S. production will also help protect American \nconsumers from being whipsawed by dramatic increases in the price of \ncrude oil because we have got that supply.\n  I now yield to the gentleman from North Dakota (Mr. Cramer), who is \nfrom another State benefitting from the shale play and someone that is \nprobably more familiar with the Bakken Shale than anybody else.\n  Mr. CRAMER. Mr. Chairman, your leadership on this has been great.\n  As I think about what Mr. Hill from Arkansas was saying in expressing \nhis appreciation for regular order and the committee process, this \nreally is probably one of the greatest examples since I have been in \nCongress of a piece of legislation and a concept that has gone through \nthe process the way it is supposed to go through the process. Because \nnot only did the Energy and Commerce Committee have hearings on H.R. \n702, which we are going to vote on tomorrow which lifts the ban, I know \nyou had a bill that similarly lifts the ban. You had hearings in the \nAgriculture Committee, which I think, by the way, the hearing you had \nwas probably the best hearing on the entire topic. You honed in on that \nimpact on the consumer and the input costs for producing another \nimportant product: food.\n  And we are pretty good in the United States in places like Texas and \nNorth Dakota and lots of places in between at growing food--enough food \nto feed not just Americans, but a hungry world, and enhance our trade \nbalance and enhance our economy in using the peaceful tool of food \nrather than weapons of war.\n  I think, similarly, the shale revolution presents the same \nopportunity that food does, and that is to use the peaceful tools of \nenergy development in place of or to enhance weapons of war.\n  One doesn't need to be too creative to see that in the world today \nthere is some chaos. When you have Vladimir Putin pushing further into \nEastern Europe, when you have him now bombing in Syria, when you have \nhim selling arms to Iran, you have Iran being able to get arms and now \nbeing able to sell their oil in the global marketplace, to have this \nstabilizing impact of U.S. production into the global marketplace, I \nthink it can only benefit everybody. And that is true of not just \nstabilizing price, as we see the Brent global price much higher than \nthe domestic WTI price. On average, over the last 5 years, that spread \nhas been $11--a spread that is not enjoyed by consumers, but certainly \nharms economic opportunity and job opportunity in the United States. \nYour hearing really honed in on that cost to consumers and the benefit \nto consumers. Also, the hearing in the Foreign Affairs Committee as \nwell.\n  So we have had three committees of jurisdiction talking about this \nissue and this bill coming to the floor tomorrow, going through the \nRules Committee, and the Rules Committee allowing a number of \namendments to be debated and voted on tomorrow. Many amendments were \nintroduced by Democratic Members as well as Republican Members. It has \njust been a rich experience. There are a number of issues related to \nit.\n  Coming from North Dakota, I can tell you firsthand that not that many \nyears ago I was the economic development and finance director in the \nState of North Dakota at a time when we were just stabilizing out-\nmigration. But part of the reason we were stabilizing it was because we \nlost so many of our young people. Our small towns were shrinking. While \nwe were diversifying our economy a little bit here and there, the shale \nrevolution that came along with the technology that combined fracking \nwith horizontal drilling dramatically changed our State.\n\n  Probably my favorite anecdote of the whole situation--while there are \nmany--is the fact that the little town of Killdeer hadn't had a \nfootball team for 20 years because they couldn't field enough young \nmen, and now they have a football team. And that is just illustrative \nof what has happened in many of our small towns; because in the supply \nchain in the oil and gas industry, the jobs are not only numerous, they \nare really good. They pay, on average, 25 percent higher than the \nnational average.\n  So it really is a grand opportunity that is somewhat being lost--\ncertainly, its potential is being lost--because we are now sort of \nhemmed in with light sweet crude being produced more than we can use in \nour refineries in the\n\n[[Page H6929]]\n\nUnited States, especially the light sweet crude which our refineries \nare not set up to take, for the most part, but refineries outside the \nUnited States are set up to take, for the most part. In fact, 92 \npercent of the oil refined outside of the United States is light sweet \ncrude. Only about 25, 30 percent of the refining capacity in the United \nStates is set up to take light sweet crude. So that distinction is \nimportant to understand when you see that we are now overproducing for \nthe refinery capacity we have in our country.\n  I want to address, Mr. Speaker, some comments made earlier this week \nby Secretary of Energy Ernie Moniz, a man I have great respect for--\nclearly, an intellect. He made some comments in the Senate Commerce \nCommittee that, while technically accurate, I suppose were certainly \nincomplete. He had said that now is not the time to lift the oil export \nban; and he said that according to the EIA, somehow we weren't really \nhemmed in because we were still importing some oil.\n  It ignores so many things, not the least of which is that distinction \nbetween light sweet and heavy sour that I talked about just moments \nago; the fact that our refineries, for the most part, in the United \nStates are set up for the heavy sour that we aren't producing an excess \nof--and, by the way, about 30 percent of which are owned by vertically \nintegrated companies outside of the United States who have more of an \ninterest in buying their oil than ours. But the world is really where \nthe opportunity exists.\n  The other thing that he ignores in his statement saying that we are \nnot yet hemmed in, he ignores just the natural order of things, that \nglobal markets, global demand being accessible to domestic producers, \nU.S. producers, will grow the production. You can't expect people to \nproduce more of something than they can sell or than can be used in \ntheir limited market. If we have access to the global demand, of course \nwe are going to produce more--that is the whole point--creating more \njobs, more entrepreneurial opportunities.\n  The other thing that bothers me about what Secretary Moniz said about \nnow not being the time is that it ignores so many things. It ignores \nthe fact that we still have a very low workforce participation rate in \nthis country. We need more jobs. We have many people that are either \nunderemployed, unemployed, no longer looking for work, and these are \ngood, high-paying jobs up and down the supply chain.\n  And lest we forget, they are not just jobs in the oil patch. It is \nnot just in west Texas; it is not just in Houston; it is not just in \nNorth Dakota or Oklahoma or New Mexico. These jobs are in every State \nin the country.\n  In fact, according to the Energy Equipment and Infrastructure \nAlliance, which did a vast study on this, the third leading recipient \nof new jobs, if this export ban is lifted, is the State of Illinois. \nAnd you might wonder, well, why is it? Well, because Illinois has a lot \nof manufacturing, especially a lot of large equipment manufacturing. \nThose manufacturing jobs are great for families. They are great for the \neconomy. They are great for startup business opportunities. So it is \nevery State in the country that benefits. Secretary Moniz certainly \ndismisses that, or at least ignores it, in his statements.\n  I want to wrap up with this point. I always like to say that \nAmerica's national security and America's economic security are tied \ndirectly to America's energy security. I touched on it earlier, but \nthere has never been a time certainly in my public service when the \nworld was in a more fragile state, and certainly chaos is reigning.\n  I talked about Vladimir Putin's push into Eastern Europe, his bombing \nof Syria, his alliance with Iran.\n  Iran, by the way, is another major producer of oil, who, as per the \nIran nuclear deal, now gets to sell their oil onto the global \nmarketplace. But our President thinks it is a better idea for them than \nhe does for United States producers. He ignores the opportunity that, \nagain, the peaceful development of oil and gas and the production of it \nand then the marketing of it in the global marketplace, the opportunity \nthat has to spread influence and create peace in places that \ndesperately need it, especially for our allies.\n  It is interesting. I doubt that the folks that scheduled the floor \ntime for tomorrow's bill had this in mind, because this was more of a \nprocess of regular order than it was the calendar; but we are, right \nnow, in the middle of the 42-year recognition of the Yom Kippur War.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  The Yom Kippur War was what sort of began, really started, the energy \ncrisis that led to the 1973 embargoes. We are reliving, in many \nrespects, some of the geopolitical aspects of that time and that \nsituation.\n  Our friends in Israel are not sure whether we are with them or not as \na country, whether we are going to be with them on big issues, \ndependent on Russian oil largely, a Russia that is playing bad in the \nneighborhood, and uncertainty as to who is going to fill the leadership \nvacuum in places like Syria, a very important player, 42, 43 years ago.\n  There is a lot adding up to this being a very, very important vote \ntomorrow on lifting the export ban on H.R. 702. There are things adding \nup that we didn't even contemplate at the time that the bill was \nintroduced.\n  But it is a grand opportunity to secure America's economy, secure \nAmerica's national security while at the same time spreading our \ninfluence of freedom and free enterprise around the world.\n  So I am looking forward to, hopefully, a lot of bipartisan votes \ntomorrow, a big vote, so that we can send that over to the United \nStates Senate, who I know has a different standard than we have. But, \nhopefully, we can show them the way.\n  I thank the gentleman for yielding so much time to me.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman from North Dakota, clearly, a \nState that is a major player in this oil and gas renaissance that has \noccurred over the last 5 years.\n  I would also like to point out that the oil and gas business, per se, \nis an incredibly fertile ground for small business development. And my \ndad, I mentioned earlier, was a great example of this.\n  There are lots of narrow-focused aspects of the service side of the \nbusiness. We all think of the drilling rigs and the big investments \nthere, but there are various aspects, whether it is hauling things or \nmud or whatever is the deal, where entrepreneurs, men and women who \nwant to take a little risk, can put a little capital together, put some \ntools together, and begin servicing an aspect of the business that is \nthere.\n  So it is incredibly fertile in terms of setting up new businesses. I \nhave got one group in Eastland, Texas, that, just as the renaissance \nwas beginning to start, they thought it was a good idea to get into \nsome aspect of the fracking business and, over a very short period of \ntime, built that business into a multi-billion-dollar deal and sold it.\n  So incredible wealth was created as a result of small businesses \nturning into a medium-sized business, turning into a big business, and \nthen, ultimately, sold to another bigger business for an awful lot of \nmoney.\n  And every time that happens there are jobs created associated with \nthat and wealth created with that that benefits not only those \nindividual communities, but all of us that are involved.\n  We failed to mention that there is no ban on exporting product. Crude \noil that is refined, turned into gasoline, turned into diesel, there is \nno ban on that.\n  So refiners today can take that heavy crude that they use and the \nlittle bit of light, sweet crude that they use, turn that into a \nproduct that they then can sell into the world market, and the same \nfolks can sell it back into our communities for us to use in our cars \nand in our trucks.\n  That gasoline, in the main, particularly by folks, individuals, is \nbought with after-tax dollars. That means they have had to earn a buck, \npay the taxes on it, and then take what is left out of that dollar to \nactually buy gasoline.\n  As we have seen over the last several months, these lower gasoline \nprices have been a big boon to folks in our country that have to drive \na car to get to work or take their kids to school, whatever it might \nbe.\n  So if you have got a $1 or a $2 drop in the price of gasoline and you \nare buying 15 gallons a week or 15 gallons\n\n[[Page H6930]]\n\nevery so often, that is $15 to $30 of after-tax dollars that you can \nthen spend somewhere else to benefit you and your family.\n  Another aspect of what is happening is not related to what will go \ninto the bill tomorrow, but it is something we have talked about on \nthis floor ad nauseam, and that is the XL Pipeline. This pipeline is \ndesigned to haul Canadian oil sand oil, bitumen oil, that is, in \neffect, heavy crude south to the United States.\n  This is the kind of crude that could run our refineries and our \nrefineries would desperately like to have rather than buying the heavy \ncrude from Venezuela and other places where the recipients of our \nchecks when we buy that crude oil aren't necessarily friends of ours, \naren't necessarily on the same geopolitical page that we are on.\n  So having that pipeline would be another aspect of freeing up this \nmarket. The more efficient you can make markets, the less artificial \nrestraints, the less goofy things you have got in there, then the \nbetter pricing mechanisms you get, the better and the more efficient \nthose markets are, and then everybody up and down that chain benefits \nfrom that.\n  As I mentioned earlier, we have got this odd circumstance where the \nproducers in the United States sell on the West Texas Intermediate \nnumber to a refinery. That refinery then turns it into gasoline, and \nthey sell it based on the Brent crude.\n  So there is a differential being made by somebody, and shrinking that \ndifferential is what will keep the price of gasoline and diesel from \nincreasing.\n  One of the arguments for folks who don't represent producing \nprovinces is: Why would I be in favor of something that would increase \nthe folks I represent gasoline and diesel prices?\n  Every study has shown that that will not happen. Now, the price of \ngasoline and diesel will go up by the world market. But as a result of \nlifting this export ban, it will, in fact, not increase the price of \ngasoline as we produce it.\n  This is a win on every level. It is a win for consumers, as I have \nmentioned, it is a win for taxpayers, and it is a win for taxing \nentities.\n  My colleagues from North Dakota and from Arkansas mentioned that \nreserves in the ground are valued for property tax purposes, and those \nproperty taxes that are generated from that then support our schools \nand other county, city, and State functions.\n  As that developed crude oil is explored and those producing wells \ncome online, that creates a property tax base that benefits all of the \ntaxpayers in those particular entities.\n  So it is a win across the world. It is a win for our allies and the \ngeopolitical issues that we have talked about. So it is good for this \ncountry. It is good for jobs. And it is something that I hope my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle can thoroughly look at. They have \nhad plenty of time to do it.\n  As was mentioned, it went through regular order, several hearings on \nthe issue, actual legislation went through the subcommittee and the \ncommittee, the normal regular order, as we like to say around here, and \neveryone has had a chance to weigh in.\n  Tomorrow there will be some amendments made in order under the rule. \nFolks will be able to weigh in. Some of those I will support. Some of \nthose I will be against. But they were all presented as a way to get \nsomeone else's idea about this issue to the floor to have us debate it. \nI think that is a healthy thing, that we will be able to do that \ntomorrow. Some of those will perhaps pass, and some of them won't.\n\n  But whatever happens, I have got great confidence that the bill that \nwe will pass tomorrow with a big bipartisan vote can then go to the \nSenate and move the ball and move the initiative over there.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Texas, whose work on \nthis issue started his career in this business and has just joined us \nand is the lead sponsor on the bill that we will be voting on tomorrow.\n  We have got probably 4 or 5 minutes left. I yield to the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Barton), my chairman emeritus of the Energy and \nCommerce Committee, the Dean of the Texas delegation, for whatever \nthoughts he might care to share with us.\n  Mr. BARTON. I thank the gentleman from Midland, Texas, the chairman \nof the Agriculture Committee and a stalwart original sponsor of the \nbill. I appreciate your leadership, and I appreciate you doing this \nSpecial Order.\n  Mr. Speaker, tomorrow we are going to have a debate on H.R. 702. It \nis a bill to repeal the ban on crude oil exports. This is the last \nremnant of the 1970s era energy policy for America that said we were \nrunning out of energy and that the only way to use the energy we did \nhave was to keep it in the United States.\n  As a consequence of the Arab oil embargo, we had price controls on \noil. We had price controls on natural gas. We had limits on what \nnatural gas could be used for. We had a very restrictive, defeatist, in \nmy opinion, energy policy.\n  All that has been repealed except for one thing, and that is this ban \non crude oil exports. There are a number of opinions about why that has \nnot been repealed, but I think the primary reason is that, until the \nlast 5 years, Mr. Speaker, we really didn't have a significant amount \nof oil that could be exported.\n  But a funny thing happened. Some engineers in Texas--I have to give \nmy State credit--developed two technologies, one called hydraulic \nfracturing where you pressurize a formation, and another where you can \nturn the drill bit and drill horizontally.\n  The combination of hydraulic fracturing and horizontal drilling has \ntransformed what were considered to be uneconomic reserves, i.e., these \ntight shale formations in south Texas in the Eagle Ford, in North \nDakota in the Bakken, in Louisiana, and up in through Pennsylvania, \nOhio, and New York, into economically producible oil and gas \nformations.\n  The consequence is, in the last 5 years, U.S. oil production has \ndoubled. It got as high as almost $10 million a barrel about a year \nago. Because of the collapse in oil prices, that production level has \ndeclined some, but the capacity is still there.\n  So we have created a surplus in the domestic market of this light, \nsweet shale oil, but we can't export it. So what has developed is a \ntwo-tiered price market. You have a domestic price for oil in the \nUnited States that is anywhere from $2 to as much as $30 below the \nworld price, which is set by North Sea oil called Brent.\n  That price differential is causing wells in the United States to shut \nin. It is preventing new wells from being driven.\n  If we can pass our bill tomorrow and the Senate pass it and the \nPresident sign it, that price differential, Mr. Speaker, will go away, \nand we will be competitive to export oil into the world market.\n  If we are able to do that, good things happen. We create jobs in the \nUnited States. We put pressure on OPEC and Russia in the world market. \nWe probably bring that world price down slightly, which will result in \nlower gasoline prices for United States consumers.\n  We will be competitive in the energy markets everywhere in this \nworld. In Asia, in South America, in Western Europe, Central Europe, \nU.S. oil will be used as an economic product, but also as a strategic \nasset for the security of our country.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, we hope to have a big vote on that tomorrow, \nsomewhere between noon and 1:00. We have, I think, 10 amendments the \nRules Committee has made in order. Some of those we will accept. Some \nof them we will oppose.\n  But it has been an open process, hearings in a number of committees, \nincluding your committee, Mr. Chairman, the Agriculture Committee, open \nmarkup in subcommittee of Energy and Commerce, full committee, and \namendments accepted from both sides of the aisle that will be on the \nfloor tomorrow.\n  So H.R. 702 is good for America, good for the country. It is a job-\ncreation bill, and we hope that we will get a big vote tomorrow \nafternoon.\n  Mr. CONAWAY. I thank the gentleman.\n  I want to brag on the House for having conducted this business with \nrespect to this bill the way it has.\n  If you go back to your grade school or your junior high civics \nclasses, I'm a bill on Capitol Hill trying to become a law, this is \nexactly what happened with this deal. It went through the process the \nway it is supposed to, kind of the old-fashioned deal.\n\n[[Page H6931]]\n\n  We hope to see tomorrow a big bipartisan vote so the American people \ncan at least in this one glimmer look and say, hey, the House of \nRepresentatives functioned the way that the Founding Fathers intended \nit to and moved an important piece of legislation forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I look forward to a big vote tomorrow. I yield back the \nbalance of time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6931-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H6931-H6932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n             WATER PROBLEMS IN THE CITY OF FLINT, MICHIGAN\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Bishop of Michigan). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Kildee) for 30 minutes.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that I have 5 \nlegislative days--and any other speaker who may arrive--to revise and \nextend remarks and include extraneous material on the subject of my \nSpecial Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor today just to take a few \nminutes to call attention to a problem that I have been trying to raise \nin this body and in my work before I came to Congress for some time, \nspecifically, to describe the conditions in my own hometown of Flint, \nMichigan.\n  The subject that I am addressing is the unique and really difficult \nchallenges facing America's older industrial cities, cities like my \nhometown of Flint, Michigan, a city that is the birthplace of General \nMotors. It is where the first UAW contract was created, was signed. But \nit is a city that has really struggled as it has made this transition \nfrom the old to the new economy.\n  It is a city that had 200,000 people just a couple of decades ago and \nnow hovers right around 100,000 citizens, a poorer city than it once \nwas, a city that has lost 90 percent of its manufacturing jobs.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  I raise this because I believe that this Congress and the Federal \nGovernment have an obligation to reinvest in these communities, \ncommunities that helped build this country and that can have a \nsignificant effect on our future. These are the cities where innovation \ntook place and where it can take place again.\n  But my own hometown right now is struggling, struggling with a \nproblem, unfortunately, that is not entirely of its own making. My home \nof Flint, a city that was once really the center of the auto \nmanufacturing universe, can't even guarantee to its citizens one of the \nmost essential functions of government. It can't guarantee to citizens \nthat it can deliver clean, drinkable water to their households.\n  We have elevated lead levels in the city of Flint in their water \nsystem. It has been known for some time, for about a year that there \nhave been significant problems with water quality in Flint. And despite \nprotests, really, at the State and Federal levels, public officials \nsaying that there is no problem with the water, that it is completely \nsafe to drink--in fact, one State official told city of Flint residents \nthat they just needed to simply relax.\n  It has been revealed recently through independent studies, now \nconfirmed by the State government, that we have lead levels far in \nexcess of what is allowed under the Federal lead and copper rules. This \nis completely unacceptable.\n  In fact, what makes this even more troubling is that this is a tragic \nset of circumstances that has public health implications for the \ncitizens of my community that were completely avoidable, that are the \nresult of decisions that were made by the State of Michigan when it \ntook over control of this fiscally stressed city.\n  This is a city that is struggling in a lot of different ways. Twice \nin the last decade, it has been under the control of a receiver, of a \nState-appointed emergency manager that takes away the authority of \nlocal government officials to make decisions for themselves, takes away \nthe authority of the Flint citizens to elect their own representatives \nto govern themselves, and places authority to control the city in the \nhands of a single master, an emergency manager.\n  Well, it was during the period of time that one of those emergency \nmanagers was in control that the State decided for the city of Flint \nthat, for a temporary period of time, simply to save money, it would \nbegin to draw water, rather than from the city of Detroit water system, \nwhich had a water source from Lake Huron, but it would begin to draw \nwater from the Flint River, a small river that passes through our \nhometown, a river that is the namesake of our own community.\n  The sad thing is--and this tells you a little bit about how some \nfolks in different levels of government at the Federal and State level \nthink about these older cities. There was no robust review, no testing, \nno examination as to whether or not this river water would result in \nclean water being delivered to homes, drinkable water delivered to \ncitizens. As a result, this water drawn from the Flint River is \nsubstantially more corrosive and has led to lead leaching from the \npipes in the delivery system into the drinking water in Flint homes.\n  In fact, there was a study that was just done in the last day or two \nthat shows that in Flint school district buildings, water being \ndelivered to Flint schoolchildren has lead levels far above the \nactionable level under the EPA lead and copper rule.\n  Think about this. In the 21st century in the United States of \nAmerica, we have a city, a great, old city that was a part of the \nindustrial revolution, that can't even deliver clean and safe drinking \nwater to its citizens, not only because of our failure to invest in \ninfrastructure in this country, which is a big part of the problem, but \nlargely because officials at the State government simply decided, well, \nthat Flint River water, that will be good enough. There was no real \nscientific research that determined whether or not that water would be \nsafe--``it will be fine.'' And even when evidence was presented \nindicating that that water might be unsafe, Flint citizens were told by \nthe State government to just relax; don't worry about it.\n  Well, that is a complete failure of government. It is a failure of \ngovernment, frankly, at the Federal level because, for almost a year \nnow, I have been asking the EPA to intervene; to, first of all, help \nthis old city of Flint rebuild itself and rebuild its water system by \nproviding some relief through the clean drinking water revolving loan \nfund, some degree of loan forgiveness, which is allowable under Federal \nlaw; but in this case, a technicality has prevented the EPA from \nallowing the State of Michigan to grant that kind of relief. That could \nmake a huge difference for the city and its ability to rebuild its own \ninfrastructure. But so far, all we get from the EPA is ``no,'' and we \nasked for technical assistance from the EPA.\n  Now, recently we have had more attention; but, frankly, it is not \nenough. I mean, where is the urgency?\n  If the role of the U.S. EPA is to ensure adherence to this rule, this \nlaw that requires clean and safe drinking water to be available to its \ncitizens, they ought to do more than sit back and offer opinion. They \nneed to be engaged. So I call on the EPA to take a much more focused \nrole in making sure that the citizens of Flint have clean drinking \nwater.\n  I mentioned that this was not an accident. This decision to use this \nquestionable water source was done when the city was under financial \nreceivership, when an appointed emergency manager was making the \ndecisions for the city of Flint. So here we had a situation where this \nemergency manager, this outside new management is appointed to come in \nand deal with the issue of fiscal insolvency and, by only looking at \nthe short-term balance sheet, made a decision to get cheaper water that \nturned out to be dangerous for the residents of the city and, actually, \npotentially has handed the city a huge cost to fix what could be \nhundreds of millions of dollars of permanent damage to the water system \nas a result of that decision.\n  So an emergency manager comes in with the idea that somehow outside \nmanagement is the only problem that this city faces, makes decisions \nthat not only ruin the reputation of the city but also cause \nsignificant health risks,\n\n[[Page H6932]]\n\nand then hands the city a bill, potentially to the tune of hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, and at the same time, over the last decade, has \ncontinued to cut direct support to that very city. I mean, this just \ndoesn't make sense.\n  The citizens of the city are not responsible for the fact that its \ninfrastructure has been allowed to deteriorate. They are not \nresponsible for the fact that at the Federal level and at the State \nlevel we have not supported redevelopment in these places. In fact, \nthrough transportation policy, housing policy, tax policy, land use \npolicy at the Federal and State levels, we have actually, \nunfortunately, contributed to the hollowing out of these older cities, \nand now the citizens of this place have to pay the price.\n  The failure to reinvest in these older cities is not without victims; \nand right now, it is the people of the city of Flint that are the \nvictims of a failure at the Federal, frankly, and at the State level. \nIt is something that just cannot be tolerated.\n  So when we think about this question, when we think about this \nparticular case of the city, my hometown of Flint, and the fact that \nthese decisions have been made for them by people at the State capital, \nthey are paying the price. And almost inexplicably, even though today \nin a complete reversal, an admission of failure by the State, the State \nhas come in and said now they are going to help facilitate the \nreconnection temporarily to the Detroit water system until a permanent \nLake Huron line can be established. Inexplicably, there they are \nactually asking the city government to empty out its remaining \nresources, financial resources, and put millions of dollars up to help \ncontribute to pay for fixing a problem that the State government is \nactually responsible for making. The State broke the system, and now, \nyet again, it is the city residents who are being asked to contribute \nto pay for a problem that they did not create in the first place.\n  Sadly, while this may seem like an extreme case, it is a pretty \nconsistent tale all across this country, but especially in the \nNortheast and Midwestern United States. But in the South and West as \nwell, there are older cities that have, in the past, contributed \ngreatly to economic growth in this country and have been allowed--in \nsome ways, encouraged--to wither, to be hollowed out, and we can't let \nthis continue.\n  So here when we see before our very eyes 30, 40, 50 American cities--\nas I said, including my own hometown--continue to fall farther and \nfarther behind, have their infrastructure continue to deteriorate, what \ndo we spend our time talking about here in the United States Congress? \nPetty fights between Democrats and Republicans and, frankly, more \nrecently, petty fights between Republicans and other Republicans.\n  We haven't even touched the idea of a big infrastructure bill that \ncould help places not just like my hometown of Flint, but other places \nacross the Midwest and across the country that could be much more \nproductive if we simply had 21st century infrastructure, a water system \nthat can deliver clean water to its residents.\n  There is no excuse. There is no excuse at the Federal level for us \nnot providing the kind of help that would make a place like Flint a far \nmore productive place with decent roads, good schools, and a water \nsystem that delivers clean water. I mean, that seems pretty \nfundamental, and it is. Without that, these older communities, these \nolder cities have no chance of connecting to the new economy, no chance \nof contributing the way they are capable of to the next economy of this \ncountry. It is shameless that we haven't seen the urgency that I think \nis required in order to deal with this enormous problem.\n  There are victims of this failure. There are victims, individuals who \nhave been really left behind because of the failure at the Federal and \nat the State level.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I know I have taken a few moments. I don't need to \ntake the full half hour that has been allotted to me because we will \ncontinue this discussion. We will continue this conversation.\n  I just want to make sure that the folks who are listening, the people \nin this body, people across the country understand that unless we take \ntime, unless we make the effort in this body to address the problems of \nthese older cities, we will not have done our job. It is important that \nthe American people know that this Congress is willing to stand up for \nthem and stand up for America's cities.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6932-1", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            LEAVE OF ABSENCE\n\n  By unanimous consent, leave of absence was granted to:\n  Mr. Hudson (at the request of Mr. McCarthy) for today and October 9 \non account of family reasons.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "08"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/10/08/house-section/article/H6932-2", "month": "10", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H6932]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         SENATE BILLS REFERRED\n\n  Bills of the Senate of the following titles were taken from the \nSpeaker's table and, under the rule, referred as follows:\n\n       S. 32.
