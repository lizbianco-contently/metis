The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Gutierrez) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GUTIERREZ. Mr. Speaker, we understand that the Speaker of the \nHouse is receiving a special visitor today: the heavyweight, undisputed \nchampion and leader of the Republican Party, the person who speaks for \nevery single House Republican, the Presidential nominee of the \nRepublican Party. And just so that we are clear on how important this \nvisit is, I hold in my hand the actual menu from the cafeteria today. \nThis is the menu from the Senate Carryout, and today's special is--wait \nfor it--taco salad. They even have little pictures of the taco salad.\n  The Republicans love the Hispanics so much that they put taco salads \non the menu so that we can honor the love and affection that their \nPresidential nominee feels for each and every one of us--the Hispanics. \nI am sure that that love and respect extends to all the working men and \nwomen in the cafeterias, not just one part of Hispanics, but the other \nworking men and women who are part of the Blacks, the Asian, and the \nWhites. They work hard every single day in the cafeterias of the \nCapitol and the surrounding buildings. It is not something I am proud \nof, but the reality is many of them don't even make a living wage.\n  Oh, and, look, it says here that May is Strawberry Festival Month in \nthe cafeterias. Now, let's see if we can guess who picks the \nstrawberries that will be served in the cafeterias, shall we, Mr. \nSpeaker? I would venture to guess that every single strawberry that is \nserved on yogurt to Members of Congress will have passed through the \nhands--rough hands--of an undocumented immigrant. Whether it was \ngrowing them, picking them, packing them, shipping them, unloading \nthem, or some other part of the process, the Strawberry Festival Month \nreally means ``undocumented farm worker month.''\n  We are all complicit. Any food you eat will have been touched by \nundocumented immigrant hands, immigrants that the Republican Party \nwants to remove from our country by the millions--11 million people, \ntheir families, their businesses, their homeownership, their consumer \nbuying power, their U.S. citizen wives and husbands, and their U.S. \ncitizen children. They have all got to go.\n  Now, it was less than 2 years ago, upstairs in this building, that \nthe respected chairman of the House Rules Committee said to me, in a \ncommittee hearing, that he was unaware of anyone in the Republican \nParty, he said: ``There is no one in responsible Republican leadership \nwho would suggest or support mass deportation.'' He said it was \n``inflammatory'' for me to suggest otherwise, just 18 months ago. He \nsaid it was ``extremely distasteful'' of anyone, including me, to \nsuggest Republicans would favor driving out 11 million immigrants.\n  Now the standard bearer, the leader, the nominee, Orange Chief--El \nJefe Anaranjado--who is leading the party into the November election is \ncalling for the mass deportation or removal of 11 million people, in \ndetail, out loud.\n  So as we eat our taco salads today or have a sweet, delicious \nstrawberry, I hope my colleagues chew on the words and keep in mind the \nphilosophy and values your leader is espousing on the campaign trail on \nyour behalf, the de facto head of the Republican Party.\n  Just taste the immigrant labor, the hands of Mexicans--and a lot of \nother people with and without papers--that went into every morsel of \nthe food that you taste today. I also want you to think about the \nnearly 1 million American-born Latino citizens who have turned 18 in \nthe last 12 months and the half a million more that will turn 18 before \nNovember.\n  Think about the 82,000 Puerto Ricans who have left the island of \nPuerto Rico--most of them moving to Florida, a very important electoral \nState--and the tens of thousands more who will arrive before the \nelection as citizens of the United States.\n  As you eat your last strawberry, please, please, please, Mr. Speaker, \nI\n\n[[Page H2286]]\n\nhope you will think about the 25 percent increase that we have seen in \nthe first quarter of 2016 in citizenship applications, the 8.8 million \neligible immigrants who can apply for citizenship today, and the \nthousands more who will be eligible before November.\n  Sure, you can chomp on your taco salad, Mr. Speaker, and you can \nconcentrate on the 11 million or so undocumented immigrants who are \ndaily targets of lies and slander on the campaign trail, but come \nNovember, the Latinos you will really have to worry about are the more \nthan 27 million Latino citizens, like me, of the U.S.A. who are your \nconstituents, who are eligible to vote, and who are fired up to vote \nmore and more with each passing day.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2286-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2286]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n  ATROCITIES IN SYRIA AND AMERICA'S MISSION TO BE AN EXEMPLAR OF SELF-\n                               GOVERNANCE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Kinzinger) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. KINZINGER of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, Bill Clinton once said, when \nasked what his greatest regret was of his time in office, that his \ngreatest regret was the failure to act on the genocide in Rwanda.\n  Mr. Speaker, today, over a half million Syrians have been killed by a \nbrutal dictator, Bashar al-Assad. What I think is important to note is \nthat a lot of times when we talk about something happening somewhere \nthat is not here, we think of it as something that doesn't affect us \nbecause these people may look different, maybe they speak a different \nlanguage, maybe they worship a different God, and, frankly, it is \noceans away.\n  Mr. Speaker, right here is just a picture of a number of Syrian \nchildren. These are children who are having their lives torn up by war. \nIt is children, in fact, just like these that in past years were gassed \nby Bashar al-Assad.\n  I want you to imagine that, gassing. As you drown, knowing that you \nare taking among your last breaths; as your mom and dad sit there and \nare affected by the same chemical weapons and are watching their \nchildren die. It is tragic. That was done indiscriminately by Bashar \nal-Assad.\n  But that is nothing new for him. Bashar al-Assad learned from the \ngreatest man he knew--his father--who leveled cities and killed tens of \nthousands who dared disobey his will, the will of one man.\n  So in 2011, these generations of repressed Syrians who do not like to \nlive under dictatorships--humanity does not like to be oppressed and \nlive under dictatorship--these millions of citizens rose up and began \nto peacefully protest their dictator. How did the dictator respond? Did \nhe talk about reforms that could be done to government? No. He \nresponded with tanks, with armies, and with murder. He responded with \nchemical weapons.\n  The United States and other countries were rightfully concerned with \nwhat was going on, and a red line was placed by our President. That red \nline was not adhered to. Bashar al-Assad got away with using chemical \nweapons at no cost and no penalty. So this brutal civil war continues.\n  Children and women are among the chief targets, by the way, of the \nregime because they believe it inflicts more pain per capita on the \npopulation than killing a man. So they target them specifically. They \ncontinue to die.\n  The West thought they had negotiated--and the President thought he \nhad negotiated--a cease-fire; but yet, in the end of April, a Doctors \nWithout Borders hospital was bombed. Was it the one we hear so much \nabout in Afghanistan, the mistaken bombing of a Doctors Without Borders \nhospital that was tragically done by the American military? No, not \nthat one, as tragic as that is. But it was the regime of Bashar al-\nAssad that killed over 60 people in a Doctors Without Borders hospital, \ndespite a cease-fire that is occurring. Now we are back at the table \nhoping to make this one cease-fire actually stick.\n  Mr. Speaker, unfortunately, in this campaign season people have been \nseductively lured into the idea that America's responsibility now is \njust to come home and lick our wounds. I believe that America has a \nmission that is a God-inspired mission. It is a mission to be an \nexample to billions of people of self-governance and to be an example \nof human rights and dignity. But it is also in our self-interest to be \ninvolved.\n  What has the brutal dictator Bashar al-Assad done besides tragically \nkill almost a half million people, as if that is not bad enough? Bashar \nal-Assad has created an area for ISIS to spawn and breed. ISIS wouldn't \nbe in existence today if Syria was a stable country potentially under \ndemocratic rule because the people wouldn't turn to it. Bashar al-Assad \ncreated and incubates ISIS--fact. Bashar al-Assad brutalizes his \npeople, and you can not fix the situation in Syria with Bashar al-Assad \nremaining in existence.\n  It may not be popular to say. People may say: Do you want to \nintervene in another Middle Eastern war? No, I don't want to. But I \nwill tell you, Mr. Speaker, America has a mission; and if we forget \nthat mission, if we wake up and if the President some day in an \ninterview says, ``My greatest regret was inaction in Syria,'' that is \non all of us, too.\n  These children want to be teachers, they want to be police officers, \nand they want to have kids of their own some day. Don't forget their \nvoices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2286-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2286-H2287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n     HONORING THE RETIREMENT OF DR. PHIL SMITH OF NEBRASKA MEDICINE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Ashford) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in honor of the retirement of \nDr. Phil Smith of Nebraska Medicine at the University of Nebraska \nMedical Center.\n  Over 35 years ago, Dr. Smith established the Nebraska Infection \nControl Network to educate healthcare professionals regarding infection \ncontrol in nursing homes and hospitals.\n  Dr. Smith is a pioneer in the field of infectious disease, and his \nperseverance and dedication led to the establishment of the very \ncritical biocontainment unit at Nebraska Medicine in 2005. Commissioned \nby the Centers for Disease Control, the unit was at ground zero in the \nfight against Ebola, providing Ebola training to more than 30 of the \ncountry's top hospitals while successfully treating several Ebola \npatients. Dr. Rick Sacra, who contracted the disease in West Africa, \ncredits the Omaha unit with saving his life.\n  Recently, Dr. Smith codeveloped the Center for Preparedness \nEducation, a coalition between the University of Nebraska Medical \nCenter and Creighton University Medical Center.\n  It is very difficult to sum up this career that he has had. What is \ncritical, though, is that the Ebola problem and crisis is not going \naway.\n  The University of Nebraska Medical Center, the community that I come \nfrom, Omaha, Nebraska, and the entire State of Nebraska are committed \nto fighting Ebola. It will continue to do so by developing an even more \nsignificant biocontainment center, developing teaching regimens, and \ndeveloping research regimens at the University of Nebraska Medical \nCenter to fight Ebola and other infectious diseases.\n  It is difficult to sum up the career that Dr. Smith has had, but I \nwill quote this. He says: ``Patient care has been part of my life. It's \na noble profession, and nothing beats the gratification of making a \ndiagnosis and helping a patient.''\n  Nothing is more critical than the treatment of the Ebola crisis at \nthe University of Nebraska. Saving lives, creating an atmosphere for \nfurther research, and creating a facility for training healthcare \nprofessionals from around the world is the mission that the University \nof Nebraska has taken up.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  Dr. Smith's contributions to Nebraska and our Nation are \nimmeasurable, and we are grateful for his service.\n  Interestingly enough, the University of Nebraska biocontainment unit \nis now in the capable hands of Dr. Angie Hewitt, who is the daughter of \none of our colleagues, Representative Gene Green of Texas. Dr. Hewitt \nwill continue the work that Dr. Smith has begun and will continue to \nenlarge and engage the world in the fight against infectious disease.\n\n[[Page H2287]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2287-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2287]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n           ISRAEL AND U.S. MUST FACE COMMON THREATS TOGETHER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Poe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, Israel has always been surrounded by \nthreats. Since it was established, Israel has survived Arab armies \nwaiting at its borders to destroy the Jewish state. It has persisted in \nthe face of suicide bombers and terrorist onslaughts like no other \ncountry in history. Recently the threats to Israel have increased and \nbecome even more dangerous.\n  Iran's Supreme Leader has stated clearly that he wants to destroy \nIsrael. Thanks to the nuclear deal made by the administration, it is \nonly a matter of time before the mullahs in Iran develop a nuclear \nweapon.\n  The Iran deal will go down in history as one of the administration's \nworst foreign policy mistakes. This Neville Chamberlain deal ensured \nthat Iran gets to keep enriching uranium. It does not have to dismantle \nany of its nuclear infrastructure. So, in 10 years, Tehran just has to \nflip a switch to get a nuclear bomb, and Israel is the first target. \nTehran wants to put the entire Middle East under its thumb.\n  Iran continues to defy U.N. security resolutions on ballistic \nmissiles. Since the nuclear deal was signed, Iran has conducted three \nballistic missile tests. Some of the previously launched missiles were \neven marked in Hebrew with the words ``Israel must be wiped off the \nEarth.''\n  There is more. Iran has announced that it would give $7,000 to \nfamilies of Palestinians who murder Israelis and an additional $30,000 \nto every family whose home Israel demolished due to the family's \ninvolvement in terrorism.\n  The Iranian mullahs have hate and murder in their souls, and they \nwant to eliminate Israel. The fact that the administration gave a $100 \nbillion signing bonus in sanctions relief to a regime that consorts \nwith North Korea and sends terrorist proxies to do its bidding is a \nreally bad foreign policy.\n  There is more. Iran has sent Hezbollah to go after Israelis around \nthe world. Hezbollah now has an estimated 150,000 rockets and missiles \nin its stockpile. That is enough to rain down thousands of rockets a \nday on Israel for months.\n  In fact, Iran has transferred new game-changing advanced weapons to \nthe terrorist group Hezbollah. This includes antiship cruise missiles, \nair defense systems, and precision-guided surface-to-surface missiles.\n  Then there is Hamas in the south. In Gaza, Israeli officials now \nbelieve that Hamas has completely replenished all of its rocket supply \nthat Israel destroyed 2 years ago.\n  Hamas is building a sophisticated network of tunnels under the Gaza \nStrip for the purpose of securing arms and supplies. This tunnel \nnetwork has only one purpose: to strike at the heart of the Israeli \npopulation centers.\n  More. Since September, Palestinian lone-wolf terrorists have carried \nout hundreds of vicious attacks against Israeli citizens. These \nterrorists will do anything to kill. They ram vehicles into civilians, \nshoot indiscriminately, and stab anybody in the way.\n  Immediately following the first attack, Palestinian Authority \nPresident Mahmoud Abbas proclaimed: ``We welcome every drop of blood \nspilled in Jerusalem. This is pure blood, blood on its way to Allah.''\n  This latest wave of attacks has killed 34 people and injured 400. \nAmong those killed were two Americans, and one of them was a citizen of \nTexas, Taylor Force. These terrorists are only happy when they have \ndestroyed Israeli and American families wherever they find them.\n  ISIS, which is even more brutal than al Qaeda, controls large parts \nof Syria. These terrorists no doubt view Israel as a threat and will \nlikely turn to attacking the Jewish state in due time.\n  Those who threaten Israel, Mr. Speaker, threaten the United States. \nThe same terrorist groups that want to destroy Israel want to destroy \nthe United States. The same Iran that calls Israel the ``Little Satan'' \ncalls the United States the ``Great Satan.''\n  Mr. Speaker, Israel is a bright star, the lone star of liberty, \nfreedom, and democracy in the Middle East. The villains that want \nIsrael destroyed are picking a fight with the wrong folks. They will \nlose that fight because Israel and the United States will work \ntogether, no matter who the enemy is, for liberty, justice, and freedom \nnot only for Israel, but for the United States.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2287-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2287-H2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           DR. KENT SCRIBNER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Veasey) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. VEASEY. Mr. Speaker, before I get into my remarks, I want to \nshare a story about a conversation that I had with one of my colleagues \nhere on the House floor. It was a colleague from Arizona.\n  I asked the colleague: How is the new superintendent that is coming \nto the Fort Worth Independent School District, Dr. Scribner?\n  The colleague told me how lucky we were to be getting Dr. Scribner \nfrom the Phoenix Independent School District because he has done such a \nremarkable job there and that the community was really saddened, but \nhappy for him that he was given the opportunity to come and work in one \nof Texas' largest independent school districts.\n  I want to rise today to lend my unwavering support for a respected \neducator that has made a mark very quickly in the Fort Worth community, \nand that is Dr. Kent Scribner.\n  Dr. Scribner is a dedicated educator who is leading, again, one of \nthe largest school systems in the entire State of Texas. But recently \nhe has come under attack from centralized forces in Austin that don't \nbelieve in local control and, by the way, would like to actually take \nmoney out of the Fort Worth ISD and let that money be used for poor-\nperforming schools in the form of school vouchers.\n  What Dr. Scribner is under attack for from Austin is by trying to \nprotect transgender students. Under the guidelines issued by Dr. \nScribner, transgender students are allowed to use the bathroom and \nlocker room of their choice.\n  Teachers are to address them by the pronoun that reflects the \nstudent's gender identity. Staff are to protect a student's privacy \nabout decisions to transition from one gender to another. An employee \nwho does not comply with these rules could face discipline.\n  It also protects other students. It says that students who do not \nfeel comfortable using a bathroom with a transgender student are \nprovided a reasonable and safe accommodation for them as well.\n  These guidelines, unlike it was first reported, were not developed in \nisolation. The Fort Worth School Board has been working on these \npolicies since 2014 and drafted a new set of guidelines last summer.\n  Instead of condemning Dr. Scribner, we should applaud his leadership \nbecause it encourages an environment that protects our children's \nsafety. Dr. Scribner has children, also, I want to make clear, in the \nForth Worth Independent School District, and I doubt that he would want \nto subject his children to an environment that he didn't feel was safe.\n  Many transgender students simply cannot use the restroom or locker \nroom of the gender they were assigned at birth. Asking transgender \nstudents to use a separate restroom, like a faculty restroom, singles \nthem out and increases the risk of bullying. Transgender students \nshould not also have to face bullying from government officials.\n  Allowing transgender students to use the correct restroom is just \ntelling them that they can use the restroom like anyone else. Doing \notherwise would tell them that they are unwelcome at the school they \nattend. Restricting restroom access for transgender students goes \nagainst the consensus of medical professionals and mental health \nexperts.\n  The guidelines that Dr. Scribner has issued are similar to those \nadopted by hundreds of school districts around the country. Let me just \nalso tell you that Dr. Scribner has a lot of good backup in what he is \ndoing. These best practices are supported by the Child Welfare League \nof America, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the Texas Association \nAgainst Sexual Assault, and the Texas Council on Family Violence.\n  Dr. Scribner's leadership is especially commendable at a time when we \nare\n\n[[Page H2288]]\n\nseeing a dramatic increase in hateful, discriminatory, and anti-LGBT \nlegislation across the United States. It is imperative that we stand \ntogether to ensure that no one is discriminated against because of \ntheir sexual orientation or gender identity.\n  That is why I am a proud sponsor and a proud cosponsor of the Quality \nAct and I am also a member of the Quality Caucus. I wholeheartedly \nbelieve that preventing this type of discrimination only makes our \ncountry a better place.\n  The fight for LGBT equality has seen tremendous progress, but we \nstill have a lot of work to do to make sure that all of our students \nfeel safe in school.\n  I am honored to stand in solidarity with Dr. Scribner. I ask my \ncolleagues to stand with me as we support the rights of all Americans.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2288-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2288]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OPIOID ADDICTION\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Blackburn) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACKBURN. Mr. Speaker, opioid addiction has proven to destroy \nhope, it destroys opportunity, and it is destroying families.\n  Certainly we see this across the country, but we are also seeing the \ndevastating effects of addiction in Tennessee. Tennessee has the second \nhighest rating nationally for opioid addiction.\n  As many States are exceedingly aware, drug overdose is the leading \ncause of accidental death in this country. As we started working on \nthis issue in the Committee on Energy and Commerce, so many people did \nnot realize that prescription drug abuse is the leading cause of \naccidental death in our country, with over 18,000 fatalities last year. \nAddiction does not care about race, gender, or politics. It is an issue \nthat affects all of us, and it affects the people that we are here to \nserve.\n  Together many of us--families and those that we love in our \ncommunities--are working to find solutions that will combat this \nepidemic and help remedy those who are suffering from addiction the \nmost. Just this week--and you can look at the bills that have been on \nthe agenda and have passed the House; many of these are being done with \nbipartisan support--there have been 15 amendments to these bills. They \nhave all passed by voice vote.\n  What the bills will do is to streamline the burdensome bureaucracy \nwhich currently debilitates finding a solution for this crisis.\n  I commend my colleagues for focusing on this issue and for saying: \nWhat do we do to get to the root cause of this problem and put the \ntools in place so that, at the local, State, and Federal levels, this \ncan be addressed and it can be solved?\n  One of the things that we have done is to improve the situation with \nthe VA and the oversight mechanisms that they have to make certain that \nour veterans are being protected and that the issues of addiction are \nbeing appropriately addressed and dealt with.\n  Earlier this year we achieved a success that is one way that the \nFederal Government can help in the work that our State legislators are \ndoing. In my State of Tennessee, State Senator Dr. Joey Hensley and \nState Representative Barry Doss have been the leaders on these issues \nfor our general assembly.\n  The legislation that I authored along with Congressman Tom Marino was \nsigned into law and ensures access to proper medication for patients \nwith legitimate needs while allowing us to continue battling the drug \ndiversion and abuse problem that exists here in our country. It will \nenable our local and State officials to move forward, address the pill \nmills, and, at the same time, make certain that patients with needs \nhave access.\n  The legislation is called the Ensuring Patient Access and Effective \nDrug Enforcement Act of 2016. What it will do is to combat the \ninappropriate use of prescription drugs by bringing greater clarity--\nsomething that is needed in so many laws and rules--but bringing \ngreater clarity and transparency to the requirements needed for safe \nand secure distribution of medications.\n  Mr. Speaker, the people battling addiction are moms and dads, \nbrothers and sisters and children, neighbors and friends. They are \nsaying: We need your help. Our healthcare professionals and our \npharmacists have said: We need clarity. That is what we in the House \nare seeking to do this week.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2288-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2288-H2289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1030\n              2016 CALL TO ACTION: COMBATING OPIOID ABUSE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nHawaii (Ms. Gabbard) for 5 minutes.\n  Ms. GABBARD. Mr. Speaker, in the United States, 2.1 million people \nsuffer from dependency and addiction to prescription opioid drugs. \nEighty percent of the world's pain pills are consumed in the United \nStates, but we only have 5 percent of the world's population. This is \nan epidemic that reaches every corner of our Nation, transcending \nregional, State, community, and neighborhood lines. More people died \nfrom drug overdose in 2014 than ever before. Over 60 percent of those \ndeaths involved the use of an opioid. Seventy-eight Americans die every \nsingle day from an opioid overdose. There are more people dying from \nprescription drug overdoses than from car accidents.\n  This week, the House is considering 15 bipartisan measures that seek \nto address some of the widespread problems that have caused and \nperpetuated this national crisis; but as we look at treatment options \nand support for those who are dealing with this addiction, it is \nimportant that we actually focus on the root cause of the problem.\n  We have seen for decades major pharmaceutical companies that have \nmisled the FDA, doctors, and patients about the safety and risks of \nopioid dependence on commonly prescribed prescription drugs in their \nefforts to sell more drugs. Three top executives from Purdue Pharma \neven pleaded guilty to criminal charges.\n  Just last week, the LA Times revealed how Purdue Pharma has made over \n$31 billion off of OxyContin, America's best-selling painkiller, by \nadvertising the drug's 12-hour pain relief. Investigations have found \nthat for many people the drug actually doesn't last for 12 hours. In \nfact, it wears off hours earlier for most people. This often leads to \n``excruciating symptoms of withdrawal, including an intense craving for \nthe drug.''\n  Despite multiple complaints from doctors, sales representatives, and \nindependent research showing that many patients don't experience this \n12-hour pain relief, the company has continued to market the drug's 12-\nhour relief and is even encouraging doctors to prescribe stronger doses \nwhen patients complain about its shortened effects. According to the \nNational Survey on Drug Use and Health, more than 7 million Americans \nhave abused OxyContin.\n  Many abusers then turn to heroin, which is made from the same poppy \nplant and has the same effect. After people are addicted to opioid \nprescription drugs, they turn to heroin when they can't get their hands \non those pills. To give you some context, one 60-milligram pill costs, \non average, around $60. To get the very same amount of heroin, you will \npay one-tenth of the price.\n  The problems created by companies like Purdue are felt deeply by \nfamilies all across the country. It is happening to our police \nofficers, to teachers, to nurses, and to others in our communities who \nall share the same stories. They used to take prescription drugs, but \nnow they inject heroin. In my home State of Hawaii, the rate of pain \nmedicine abuse is more than 10 percent above the national average. \nAccording to the Hawaii State Department of Health data, opioid-related \ndeaths have increased 133 percent from 2000 to 2016.\n  Veterans, people who have served our country in uniform, have been \ndisproportionately impacted by this epidemic. I have heard from some of \nmy friends and fellow veterans of how, during their visits to the VA in \ntheir seeking treatment, even after telling their doctors ``I don't \nwant drugs,'' they received prescriptions for those drugs. Up until \nrecently, the VA prescribed opioids almost exclusively to veterans who \nwere experiencing chronic pain.\n  Prescriptions for opiates spiked by 270 percent over 12 years, \naccording to the 2013 analysis by the Center for Investigative \nReporting. This led to addictions and to a fatal overdose rate\n\n[[Page H2289]]\n\namongst veterans at a rate of twice the national average. The VA is \nbeginning to start to change some of its practices by offering \nalternative modes of treatment, but even so, that change is not \ncomprehensive and it is not happening everywhere across the country.\n  A national health crisis of this magnitude requires leadership, \ncommitment, resolve, and partnership at every level of government, \nwithin our medical community and within our community itself. I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in calling for further action to hold \npharmaceutical companies accountable that are profiting off of \nAmerica's addiction problems, to hold doctors accountable who are \nirresponsibly overprescribing these addictive drugs, and to focus \ninstead on finding real solutions that can truly help people.\n  I urge the U.S. Surgeon General to make combating opioid abuse the \n2016 Call to Action, which is a yearly initiative that helps to \nstimulate nationwide action to solve a major public health program in \nthe U.S. In the past few years, the national Call to Action has \naddressed exercise and walkable communities, skin cancer prevention, \nbreastfeeding, deep vein thrombosis, and underage drinking. With 78 \nAmericans dying every single day from opioid overdose, this is an issue \nthat demands our national attention and action.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2289-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2289]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 SAUK RAPIDS' 2016 CITIZEN OF THE YEAR\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and \ncongratulate April Meyers for being named the 2016 Citizen of the Year \nin Sauk Rapids, Minnesota.\n  The Sauk Rapids Citizen of the Year was created by the Sauk Rapids \nChamber and is meant to recognize individuals who have impacted the \ncommunity for the better.\n  Meyers, who was unaware that she had even been nominated, was \nselected by a committee made up of city staff, local businesses, and \nprevious Citizen of the Year recipients. Since 1992, April has been \ninvolved with the Great River Rotary, the Living Waters Lutheran \nChurch, the Sauk Rapids School District, and she is also the director \nof housing for the Good Shepherd Community.\n  Thank you, April. Thank you for your dedication to the less \nfortunate, to our children, and to the elderly. Thank you for being an \ninspiration to others. Thank you for making Sauk Rapids such a great \ncity in the Sixth Congressional District. It is because of people like \nyou that Minnesota is such a great place to live and raise a family.\n\n\n                         A 100-Year Celebration\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to recognize and honor \none of the great families in Minnesota's Sixth Congressional District, \nthe Bernicks, and their business that is celebrating an incredible 100 \nyears of operation.\n  Bernick's was founded in 1916 in St. Cloud, Minnesota, by Elizabeth \nand Charles Bernick. Originally a soda pop bottling company, Bernick's \nused to deliver their products in a horse-drawn wagon. The company has \ncome a long way since then. Over the past century, this family-owned \ncompany has passed from generation to generation, expanding into a \nbooming business with more than 650 employees. Today, Bernick's \nprovides full beverage, vending, and food services to the central \nMinnesota area while maintaining its family roots in St. Cloud.\n  Running a business is no small feat. Running one successfully for a \ncentury is something that we can all be proud of. Congratulations to \nthe Bernick family for their five generations of success.\n  Thank you for all you do for our community.\n\n\n                      Remembering Fallen Officers\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to commemorate National \nPolice Week, a time when we remember the men and women in blue who paid \nthe ultimate sacrifice in order to protect and serve our great Nation.\n  The great State of Minnesota is home to many phenomenal law \nenforcement officers--men and women who put their lives on the line \neach and every day to ensure the safety and security of our \ncommunities. They live their lives to serve, and some tragically lose \ntheir lives in the line of duty. These are the true heroes.\n  Just this past year, an officer named Deputy Steven Sandberg was shot \nand killed in the line of duty in St. Cloud, Minnesota. While his death \nwas both senseless and tragic, today we remember the courageous way \nthat he and many other fallen police officers chose to live and serve \ntheir communities. This week, in honoring fallen officers like Deputy \nSandberg, we remember and we honor their service and their sacrifice.\n\n\n                      Addressing the Opioid Crisis\n\n  Mr. EMMER of Minnesota. Mr. Speaker, I rise to address a national \nepidemic: opioid addiction and abuse.\n  Addiction is a disease that does not discriminate based on age, \neducation, or wealth, and it even happens in small town Minnesota. \nRecently I learned firsthand that addiction knows no bounds. \nUnfortunately, like too many people today, I have seen the danger and \nthe devastation caused by addiction up close and personal.\n  I come from a small town in Minnesota with a population of, \napproximately, 5,000 people. We pretty much know everybody. I have had \nthe great fortune to raise seven kids in this great little town, and as \na youth hockey coach for almost 20 years, I have had the opportunity to \nwork with and to get to know many of the kids in our community--kids \nwho have big hopes and dreams. Unfortunately, because of the opioid and \nheroin crisis in this country, two of them left us way too soon.\n  Today, nearly one person dies every 12 minutes of a drug overdose. \nThis must stop. It is going to take more than government policy to \nfight this epidemic, but I am so grateful for the efforts here in \nWashington, on both sides of the aisle, to take on this epidemic. I \njust want to thank my colleagues for all of their work on this \nimportant issue.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nIllinois (Mr. Quigley) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. QUIGLEY. Mr. Speaker, nearly 700,000 people in the United States \ntoday are living with a brain tumor. Sadly, over 16,000 of them will \nlose their battles this year alone. Many of them will be children, with \nbrain tumors being the leading cause of death from cancer for those who \nare under 14.\n  Unfortunately, the treatment and removal of brain tumors presents \nsignificant challenges because of the brain's uniquely complex and \nfragile nature, due, in no small part, to there being more than 120 \ndifferent types of tumors. While brain tumor research is supported by a \nnumber of private nonprofit research foundations and by institutes at \nthe National Institutes of Health, there still remain daunting \nobstacles in the development of new treatments. Moreover, there are \ncurrently no strategies for screening or for the early detection of \nbrain tumors.\n  Despite the number of new people who are diagnosed with brain tumors \nevery year and their devastating prognoses over the past 30 years, \nthere have only been four FDA-approved drugs and one device to treat \nbrain tumors. On top of that, the four approved drugs have provided \nonly incremental improvements to patient survival, and mortality rates \nremain little changed over the past 30 years.\n  It is clear that much more must be done. That is why I am proud to \nintroduce a resolution designating this May as National Brain Tumor \nAwareness Month.\n  Throughout the month, advocates around the country unite to educate \nthe public about brain tumors and to advocate for policies that are \nvital to the discovery of a cure. Their efforts are crucial for shining \na light on the difficulties that are associated with research on brain \ntumors and the opportunities for advancements in brain tumor research \nand treatment.\n  I ask my colleagues to honor those who have lost their lives to a \nbrain tumor and to please support this resolution so we can move one \nstep closer to ending this devastating disease.\n\n[[Page H2290]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2290-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              OPIOID BILLS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from \nTennessee (Mrs. Black) for 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. BLACK. Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong support of the action the \nHouse is taking this week to combat the crisis of opioid abuse.\n  As a registered nurse, I have seen the grim reality of the addiction \nfrom all sides. I have witnessed its grip on families--the way it \nslowly steals the life behind its victims' eyes and how what was \nthought to be a quick fix can easily spiral into a deadly experience.\n  We all know that addiction is an equal opportunity destroyer of \npotential. It does not care about your race, gender, income, or \npolitical party. Therefore, the solutions that we offer in Congress \nmust also reach across artificial boundaries to help all who are \ntouched by this epidemic to get back on their feet.\n  I am proud that, all told, the House will take up 18 bills this week \nthat are aimed at combating opioid abuse. Among these solutions is a \nbill creating an interagency task force to ensure healthcare \nprofessionals have up-to-date guidelines and best practices for \ntreating patients with acute and chronic pain. This is critically \nimportant as 17 percent of opioid users today get their highs from \nmedications that are legally prescribed to them by a doctor.\n  The House also passed legislation that makes it safer for veterans to \nseek pain management care. Specifically, the bill would require the VA \nemployees who prescribe opioids to receive education and training on \npain management while also calling for a government watchdog report on \nthe VA opioid use and treatment.\n  Importantly, for me as a nurse, Congress has additionally taken steps \nto protect newborns from the exposure to addictive opioid drugs while \nin the womb. This includes legislation to authorize residential \ntreatment grant programs for pregnant and postpartum women who have \nsubstance abuse problems, as well as a bill calling for a government \nstudy on the prevalence of neonatal abstinence syndrome and offering \nrecommendations to improve access to treatment.\n\n                              {time}  1045\n\n  While these bills offer an important starting point, Congress cannot \nsinglehandedly legislate away the threat of opioid abuse. It takes \nwilling partners in our community to help raise awareness and intervene \nbefore addiction sets in.\n  I was reminded of this recently when I visited and met with the Smith \nCounty Anti-Drug Coalition back in my district. This organization is \ngoing into schools to arm young people with the facts about drug abuse. \nThey are providing drop boxes in the public spaces so citizens can \nsafely dispose of unused medication, and they are working with law \nenforcement to ensure that their efforts are as effective as possible. \nWe can never underestimate the importance of nonprofits and volunteer-\nsupported organizations like this.\n  Mr. Speaker, opioid addicts are not bad people trying to be good. \nThey are sick people trying to get well. When we come together with an \neye on the solution and an emphasis on personal responsibility, we can \nfind victory over this preventable disease and help those who are \nhurting to reassemble their lives and regain their pursuit of the \nAmerican Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2290-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2290]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            HOUSTON FLOODING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Al Green) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I and a host of colleagues find \nourselves on a mission of mercy. This is a mission of mercy, Mr. \nSpeaker, for people who are suffering in Houston, Texas, and the \nsurrounding area.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Congressman Gene Green, the original \ncosponsor of H.R. 5025, the 2016 Tax Day Floods Supplemental Funding \nAct. I want to thank Congressman John Culberson for being the first \nperson to sign on, such that the bill has become bipartisan. It is a \nbipartisan piece of legislation.\n  I want to talk about suffering today, Mr. Speaker, because a good \nmany people in Houston, Texas, are suffering for a multiplicity of \nreasons. I will share just a few.\n  Before I do this, I want to remind friends and colleagues that \ntonight, after the Republican hour and the Democratic hour, my \ncolleagues and I will take to the floor to say much more about what is \nhappening in Houston, Texas.\n  For now, I want to mention the suffering, because suffering can teach \nus that which we can learn no other way. Some things bear repeating. \nSuffering and pain can teach us that which we can learn no other way. \nIt is one thing to sympathize and to say, ``There but for the grace of \nGod go I'' and understand that there is suffering associated with that \nstatement, but it is another thing to empathize because you had the \nexperience associated with the suffering that goes along with the \nstatement, ``There but for the grace of God go I.''\n  So in Houston, Texas, a good many people are suffering because they \nhave had their homes flooded not once, but twice--some even more. They \nare suffering because some of them were just getting back into their \nhomes, and their homes were flooded again. They are suffering because \nthey have lost their means of transportation, the ability to get to \nwork, to sustain the livelihood that causes them to have the ability to \ntake care of themselves and their families.\n  There is suffering in Houston, Texas. They are suffering because they \ndon't know what the future holds. They don't know what next year will \nbring or next month will bring because these 100-year floods are \nhappening quite regularly in Houston, Texas. So they are suffering in \nHouston.\n  I want my colleagues and my friends to know, Mr. Speaker, that this \nsuffering is something that we can mitigate. We may not be able to \neliminate it totally, completely, and absolutely. No one can stop all \nof the flooding all of the time, but there are projects that have been \nauthorized that we are currently funding on a piecemeal basis. There \nare projects that, if completed, Mr. Speaker, would mitigate the \nflooding. We have a piecemeal approach to a problem that requires a \nwholesale solution. There is suffering, and we could eliminate much of \nthis suffering. That which we cannot eliminate, we can mitigate.\n  The suffering I have called to your attention thus far, Mr. Speaker, \ninvolves property, real and personal. But I also want to mention the \nultimate pain that is being endured by a good many in Houston, and that \nis losing someone whom you love to circumstances that could have \npossibly been eliminated.\n  Eight lives, possibly nine--I am told that there may be another--\neight lives were lost, Mr. Speaker. Eight people lost their lives to \nflooding in Houston, Texas, in the tax day flood, so-called because it \noccurred on the last day to pay your taxes. Eight lives were lost. The \nfamily members of these persons who lost their lives are suffering in \nHouston, Texas.\n  So I come to the floor with an appeal to my colleagues. We ask that \nyou kindly give consideration to H.R. 5025, the 2016 Tax Day Floods \nSupplemental Funding Act, that has now some 60 cosponsors. But it is \nmore than a bill, Mr. Speaker. It is an opportunity to eliminate \nsuffering in Houston, Texas.\n  I will close with this. I mentioned that suffering can teach us that \nwhich we can learn no other way. One of the things that I have learned \nis that, when a storm hits the East Coast and people are suffering, as \na Member of Congress, I have to be there for them. When we have the \ntornadic activities and people suffer, I have to be there for them. Mr. \nSpeaker, I want people to remember that suffering will teach you that \nwhich you can learn no other way.\n  God bless you, and God bless our great country.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2290-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2290-H2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      TENNESSEE RADIO HALL OF FAME\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor this year's \ninductees to the Tennessee Radio Hall of Fame.\n  Tennessee has a long history in the radio broadcast industry, dating \nback to the early 1920s. It has since grown to nearly 450 stations \nwhich, collectively, reach almost 7 million people.\n\n[[Page H2291]]\n\n  Tennessee's radio outlets have served as a shining example, providing \na consistent source of quality information, while never forgetting the \ncore reason for their existence, which is to serve our growing \ncommunities. In light of that, I would like to take a moment to \nrecognize this year's Radio Hall of Fame inductees--Harry Chapman; \nWarren Medley; Dave Overton; Aaron Robinson, Sr.; Charlie Scott; and \nCal Young, Jr.--all of whom, collectively, made decades of significant \nbroadcast contributions prior to their death.\n  In addition, I would like to recognize Maxine Humphreys, Cathy \nMartindale, and Bart Walker.\n  Also, I would like to highlight those from my district in \nChattanooga--Chattanooga's very own Billy Joe Poindexter of WUSY, US \n101; Keith Landecker of Power 94; Earl Freudenberg of WDYN AM 980; and \nstation of the year, WUSY, US 101--all of whom continue to make \nsignificant contributions to the radio industry.\n  On a personal note, when I was a lawyer in my district, I had a radio \nshow. During that time, I had the privilege of working with Earl \nFreudenberg on the Dynamo of Dixie on AM 1310. I learned much from Earl \nduring that time, and I am proud to call him a friend. Needless to say, \nI enjoyed my radio years in the Chattanooga community immensely.\n  Again, I would like to congratulate this year's Tennessee Radio Hall \nof Fame inductees.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2291-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              POLICE WEEK\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. Ratcliffe) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. RATCLIFFE. Mr. Speaker, this is Police Week, a week which offers \nall of us an opportunity to honor those who selflessly keep our \ncommunity safe.\n  ``To protect and serve,'' that is more than just a slogan on the side \nof police cars across the country. It is a promise, a promise that \nbrave men and women in uniform keep every day as they uphold law and \norder in our cities and towns.\n  But to be able to protect and serve us, our law enforcement needs the \ntools and resources that are vital to successfully doing their job. \nAnd, unfortunately, some of that essential lifesaving equipment that \nthey need to protect us and to protect themselves has been stripped \naway.\n  Last June, President Obama arbitrarily and unilaterally decided to \nlimit the 1033 surplus equipment program, a Federal program that \nprovides lifesaving Defense Department equipment to State and local law \nenforcement agencies.\n  Because of this ill-conceived action, I am hearing from the sheriffs, \npolice chiefs, and law enforcement officials throughout the 18 counties \nthat I am fortunate to represent. I am hearing about how the safety of \nthe brave men and women in blue and their departments are being \ncompromised by the President's action.\n  It is clear that the President's decision to unilaterally cut access \nto lifesaving equipment was a knee-jerk reaction that put politics in \nfront of public safety, and that is something that we simply can't let \nhappen.\n  So in response, Mr. Speaker, I have introduced the Protecting Lives \nUsing Surplus Equipment Act to stop this action dead in its tracks and \nto ensure that any changes to this program are the result of a data-\ndriven debate here in Congress, not through some arbitrary, unilateral \naction by the President.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in standing up \nagainst this administration's attack on law enforcement safety by \nsupporting my bill and making sure that our police have the equipment \nthey need for their own safety and for the safety of the American \npeople. They deserve nothing less.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2291-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2291]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        NEW YORK STATE'S REJECTION OF THE CONSTITUTION PIPELINE\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOklahoma (Mr. Bridenstine) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BRIDENSTINE. Mr. Speaker, during the winter months, natural gas \ndemand in New York City outstrips the ability of existing pipelines to \ndeliver natural gas from the nearby Marcellus gas field in \nPennsylvania. This capacity limitation can cause gas prices to spike \nduring cold weather. For example, on January 22, 2014, when the price \nin the Marcellus was $3.50 per thousand cubic feet, the New York City \nprice was $123. I want to repeat that; $3.50 in the Marcellus, and in \nNew York City the price was $123.\n  Constraints on natural gas make electricity more expensive. High \nenergy prices are especially hard on the poor. Businesses suffer and \njobs are lost when they lack abundant supply of affordable, clean \nenergy. However, there is a shovel-ready solution: build the \nConstitution pipeline to bring more of Pennsylvania's Marcellus gas to \nNew York.\n  You would think that New York would welcome a new supply of clean, \neconomical natural gas to lower consumer costs. However, on April 22, \nNew York's State Department of Environmental Conservation denied the \nconstruction of the Constitution pipeline needed to deliver more \nPennsylvania gas.\n  For several years, the Constitution Pipeline Company, a group led by \nWilliams Partners, located in my district, has been developing an $875 \nmillion privately funded project to build a pipeline from Pennsylvania \nto Albany to deliver gas to the Iroquois pipeline and to consumers in \nNew York State and in New England.\n\n                              {time}  1100\n\n  The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission issued a certificate of \npublic convenience and necessity for the Constitution pipeline in 2014. \nI want to repeat that. FERC approves of the pipeline. According to the \ncompany, FERC's final environmental review of the proposed pipeline \nconcluded that environmental impacts would be reduced to ``less than \nsignificant levels.'' A year and a half later, the State of New York \ndecided to deny certification necessary to issue construction permits.\n  The Williams Group worked with the State for 3 years, including two \n1-year extensions requested by the State, and yet the State asserted \nthat information provided by the company concerning the 250 or so \nstream crossings was incomplete.\n  The company refuted the State of New York's assertions, saying: \n``Completely contrary to the New York DEC's assertion, we provided \ndetailed drawings and profiles for every stream crossing in New York, \nincluding showing depth of pipe. In fact, all stream crossings were \nfully vetted with the DEC throughout the review process. We are \nappalled . . .''\n  Amazingly, Federal regulations provide no recourse to challenge a \nState's rejection of a section 401 certification, so Constitution \nPipeline may need to initiate legal action to contest the decision. The \ndecision has every appearance of political motivation. The Wall Street \nJournal called it ``Cuomo's Energy Jobs Veto.''\n  One has to wonder if the Governor of New York really wants to help \nthe poor and if he can recognize a shovel-ready job when he sees one. \nThis pipeline project would create 2,400 construction jobs and infuse \n$130 million of labor income into the region, in addition to providing \na reliable supply of clean energy. The real victims in this matter, Mr. \nSpeaker, are the people of New York.\n  Hopefully, political agendas that threaten to deny New Yorkers the \nbenefits of the Constitution pipeline will be confounded. In the \nmeantime, the message from New York's executive branch is that would-be \nenergy suppliers to New York State need not apply. It appears to be \ntime for consumers and their representatives to make their views known \nin Albany and for Congress--that is us--to revisit the pipeline \npermitting process.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2291-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2291-H2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Now there is chaos. The U.S. gave its blessings as arms were \nshipped into the Libyan tinderbox. Then Libya quickly exploded. Now \nLibya is a state of perpetual anarchy, civil war, and death.\n  Al Qaeda and ISIS have since infiltrated Libya, exploiting the power \nvacuum United States policy created. At least 6,500 ISIS fighters \ncontrol over 150 miles of the coast. ISIS will not stop in Libya. They \nare using the Libyan base as a hub from which to create mayhem across \nNorth Africa.\n  To be clear, the United States has no plan when it comes to Libya. \nLibya is another example of an overall weak and indecisive U.S. foreign \npolicy. Meanwhile, more terror by ISIS and evildoers will continue.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2292-9", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2292]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                               ZIKA VIRUS\n\n  (Mr. RUIZ asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RUIZ.

Madam Speaker, the opioid abuse epidemic has tragically \ntouched every corner of this Nation with over half of all drug \noverdoses linked to prescription opioids. At least once a day someone \nin my home State of Colorado loses a friend or family member due to \ndrug abuse.\n  In 2013, Colorado was ranked as having the second most prevalent \nepidemic prescription drug abuse in the country. The Colorado \nConsortium was created that year to form a collaborative group \ndedicated to finding solutions to opioid addiction and abuse. Efforts \nlike the Colorado Consortium can help supplement existing programs in \nareas where they already operate.\n  However, without raising national awareness of the heroin and opioid \nepidemic, these local efforts will continue to struggle to gain the \nresources they need. There is no silver bullet. It will take \nmultifront, coordinated approaches to aid communities in combating the \nopioid epidemic.\n  Beyond securing our borders and enabling law enforcement to do their \njobs, expanding opioid abuse prevention and education efforts and \ntreating those afflicted with addiction are the most important actions \nthat Congress can take. That is the focus of our work in the House on \nthe bipartisan heroin task force.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2293-5", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2293]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        10TH ANNIVERSARY OF CRYSTAL JUDSON FAMILY JUSTICE CENTER\n\n  (Mr. KILMER asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILMER.

Domestic violence knows no race, no age, no \ngender, sexual orientation, or income status. It affects all of us \nevery day right where we live.\n  Our community stepped up to support this center, a place that \nprojects our best values as a community. This is a place that fosters \ntruth and seeks justice for those who deserve it. It is a place of \nempowerment with caring staff who change the trajectory of lives and of \nfamilies.\n  Centers like this deserve our continued support, whether it be with \nour time, our donations, or with our public investments.\n  This matters. I applaud the Judsons for carrying the memory of their \ndaughter with advocacy rather than with anger.

Madam Speaker, 78 Americans die every day from an opioid \noverdose in this country. This trend is not an isolated problem. It is \nan epidemic that now outpaces deaths from motor vehicle accidents and \nis found in every geographic region across the country, from small farm \ntowns, like in my district, to New York City.\n  Statistics we have been hearing reveal a troubling reality. Addiction \ndoes not discriminate. It impacts the young, old, poor, rich, male, \nfemale, and it ruins the lives of all those involved.\n  The package of bipartisan bills on the floor this week include two \nimportant elements. They ensure Federal dollars are allocated to the \nmost effective programs and methods to reduce drug abuse while also \nproviding doctors, law enforcement, and treatment facilities the better \ntools they need to combat this growing epidemic. These are solutions \nAmericans in all walks of life need right now.\n\n[[Page H2294]]\n\n  Just last month, for example, Sacramento saw 10 people lose their \nlives in just 12 days from pills laced with fentanyl, a highly potent \nopioid, as well as in my own rural district, the continued push of \nheroin into the area especially as a higher value substitute for \ncartels as marijuana becomes more and more legal.\n  We can and must do better.

Madam Speaker, I believe everyone \nin this Chamber will agree with me that when we invest in our students \nand in our schools, we invest in the future success of this Nation.\n  Yet, as I hear from so many of my students back home, the rising \ncosts make affording college harder and harder for them and their \nfamilies. On average, the class of 2016 will graduate with about \n$37,000 in student debt, up about 6 percent from last year. The number \nof students graduating from college with debt is about 70 percent of \nthem.\n  For this reason, comprehensive higher education reform should be at \nthe forefront of our legislative agenda here in Congress. Programs such \nas the Pell grant and the Perkins Loan Program should be increased so \nthat we can increase the availability of the American Dream.\n  Next week I plan to reintroduce the Middle Class CHANCE Act, which \nwill aid our students in affording college by increasing the strength \nof the Pell Grant.\n  It is time for this Congress to address the increasing costs of \ncollege and make college more affordable for future generations and \nworking families.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2295-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2295]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   CELEBRATING THE LIFE OF HANK LEVY\n\n  (Mr. CARTER of Georgia asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia.

This early interest in architecture, along with the guidance of \nhis father, led Mr. Levy to attend Georgia Tech, and then architectural \nschool in France. After graduation, Mr. Levy made numerous, significant \nimprovements to the Savannah community.\n  He led the effort to build the Harry S. Truman Parkway, a project \nthat is now a major thoroughfare for Savannahians. Furthermore, he was \nawarded the project to build the oceanography center for Savannah, now \ncalled the Skidaway Institute of Oceanography. His other projects \ninclude designs for the Savannah Airport Terminal, Levy's department \nstore, the Great Southern Federal Bank building, and more than two \ndozen churches.\n  Mr. Levy not only built structures for the Savannah area, but he had \na generous heart and would help anyone in need. Once, he paid for the \ncap and gown of a student who couldn't afford it when he graduated from \nSavannah State University.\n  Mr. Levy died on Monday, May 2, 2016, at the age of 89.

Madam Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Today the United States is in the throes of an epidemic of \nprescription opioid and heroin abuse. Every Member of this body has \nheard a tragic story about a constituent who has become addicted to \nopioids, and, tragically, many have lost their lives to the addiction.\n  The statistics are shocking. In 2014, 47,055 Americans died from a \ndrug overdose. Of those deaths, 18,893 were attributable to \nprescription pain relievers and 10,574 were related to heroin. The \nnumber of opioids prescribed nearly tripled from 1991 to 2013.\n  Though the United States has 5 percent of the world's population, \nAmericans consume 80 percent of the global opioid supply. More than \nhalf of chronic prescription drug abusers obtain those pills from \nprescriptions written for them or for friends or family members. In \n2014, nearly half a million teenagers used prescription painkillers for \nnonmedical purposes.\n  My home State of Virginia is not immune to the ravages of opioid \naddiction. In 1999, approximately 23 people died from abuse of \nfentanyl, hydrocodone, methadone, and oxycodone, the leading \nprescription opioids abused. By 2013, that number jumped to 386 \nprescription opioid deaths, a staggering increase of 1,578 percent.\n  In 2013 alone, deaths attributed to fentanyl use increased by more \nthan 100 percent. Data also shows a sharp rise in heroin deaths in \nVirginia. In 2010, 49 deaths were attributed to heroin use. By 2013, \njust 3 years later, that figure had risen to 213, an increase of 334 \npercent. The number of drug overdose deaths in Virginia surpassed the \nnumber of traffic fatalities for the first time in 2014.\n  This is a problem that affects Americans in all regions of the \ncountry, across all socioeconomic levels, and one that Congress will \naddress with passage of H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse \nReduction Act of 2016, and other opioid legislation approved by the \nHouse this week.\n  H.R. 5046, sponsored by Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations Subcommittee Chairman Jim Sensenbrenner, provides \nresources to States, localities, Indian tribes, and others to help \nfight the historic problem of opioid abuse. I am pleased to be an \noriginal cosponsor of this bill.\n  H.R. 5046 is an important, reasonable piece of legislation that will \ndo a great deal to combat the opioid epidemic. It creates a \ncomprehensive opioid abuse reduction program at the Department of \nJustice, which will direct Federal resources for drug abuse programs \ntargeted at the opioid problem within our criminal justice system. By \nstyling this as a competitive grant program for opioids, this bill will \ngive States and localities maximum flexibility to attack opioid abuse \nissues unique to their communities.\n  States will be able to use the grant funds for a variety of important \ncriminal justice programs, including alternatives to incarceration, \ntreatment programs for incarcerated individuals, juvenile opioid abuse, \ninvestigation and enforcement of drug trafficking and distribution \nlaws, and significant training for first responders in carrying and \nadministering opioid overdose reversal drugs like naloxone.\n  States will also be allowed to enlist nonprofit organizations, \nincluding faith-based organizations, in the fight against opioid abuse. \nThe bill authorizes this new program at $103 million annually over 5 \nyears.\n  Importantly, the comprehensive grant program created by H.R. 5046 is \nfully offset in accordance with the House CutGo protocol. This means \nthat Congress has successfully directed funds to address the opioid \nepidemic by taking advantage of existing funding streams to Department \nof Justice grant programs. The result is no net increase in spending \nauthorizations and no additional burden on the American taxpayer, which \nis a responsible, good government approach to this epidemic.\n\n[[Page H2297]]\n\n  H.R. 5046 is thoughtful, historic legislation that, once enacted, \nwill help fulfill Congress' duty to protect the American people.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important bill.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairwoman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I am pleased to rise in support of H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive \nOpioid Abuse Reduction Act.\n  H.R. 5046 is an important complement to a wide range of legislation \nbeing considered in the House this week that is aimed at combating the \ndevastating impact of drug abuse and addiction that is afflicting \ncommunities across our Nation.\n  We are, in fact, in the midst of a major public health crisis caused \nby prescription and opioid abuse. It is a crisis that affects Americans \nof all ages, races, and income levels in our cities, suburbs, and rural \nareas across the United States.\n  Drug overdoses are now the leading cause of death in our Nation. In \nmy State of Michigan, for example, there were 1,745 drug overdose \ndeaths in 2014, and more than half of these overdose deaths were \nattributed to opioids and heroin. In fact, 78 Americans die from an \nopioid overdose every single day. I am very familiar with the \ndevastation heroin can exact over people and their communities.\n  Heroin took a deadly toll on Detroit in the 1970s and is now \nthreatening to take hold of a new generation of addicts. Armed with \nlessons learned from that era and the crack epidemic of the 1980s, we \nare wiser and more capable. This time we can and must do more to \nrespond to this crisis.\n  Fortunately, a number of States have undertaken various innovative \nmeasures to better respond to the rapid increase of individuals \naddicted to prescription opioids and heroin and to prevent individuals \nfrom dying as a result of drug overdose.\n  For instance, the Judiciary Committee's Crime, Terrorism, Homeland \nSecurity, and Investigations Subcommittee held a hearing last year that \nexamined, among other things, the promising use of the law enforcement-\nassisted diversion approach employed in cities such as Seattle and \nSanta Fe.\n  We have learned that there are successful ways to get addicts to \ntreatment and to quickly provide them with needed services that address \ntheir addiction and prevent recidivism. We know that evidence-based \ntreatment and treatment alternatives to incarceration work.\n  The Comprehensive Opioid Addiction Recovery Act, as authorized by \nH.R. 5046, would establish a competitive grant program to provide funds \nto State and local governments to continue and improve their efforts to \nprotect Americans from the dangers of opioid and heroin abuse and to \nmake sure that addicts have access to the services that are provided.\n  Funds from the new grant program could be used for the following \npurposes: treatment alternatives to incarceration, collaboration \nbetween State criminal justice agencies and State substance abuse \nsystems, for first responders to purchase and be trained in the use of \nnaloxone, medication-assisted treatment programs by criminal justice \nagencies, investigating the legal distribution of opioids, prescription \ndrug monitoring programs, addressing juvenile opioid abuse, and for \ncomprehensive opioid abuse response programs.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Our communities need our assistance in meeting the threat of opioid \nabuse, and this bill before us will fund innovative approaches to the \nproblem such as the LEAD program developed in Seattle that I mentioned \nearlier.\n  H.R. 5046 would go a long way toward providing that critical help, \nand so, accordingly, I support this bill. I urge all my colleagues to \ngive it their support as well.\n  Madam Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chair, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nWisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner), the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, and the chief author of this legislation.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Madam Chairman, I rise in support of H.R. 5046, \nthe Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act.\n  The misuse of and addiction to opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and \nother prescription pain medications, has had a devastating hold on this \ncountry. It affects every State and every district. Prescription \npainkillers and heroin are the primary driving forces behind this \nepidemic. According to the Federal Centers for Disease Control and \nPrevention, in 2014, 45 percent of the people who used heroin reported \nthat they were also addicted to prescription painkillers.\n  Additionally, drug overdoses now surpass automobile accidents as the \nleading cause of injury-related death for Americans between the ages of \n25 and 64. Nearly a half million Americans lost their lives to drug \noverdoses in 2015. More than 800 of those deaths occurred in my home \nState of Wisconsin, double the number of deaths from overdoses in 2004, \njust 11 years earlier. Yet, despite these staggering numbers, the \ncrisis is getting worse. Drug overdose deaths have increased 137 \npercent since 2010, with opioid-related overdose deaths increasing by \n200 percent.\n  The moment to reverse our current course and make a genuine and \nlasting impact in the fight against addiction is here. All over the \ncountry, people are calling on Congress to find solutions. In townhall \nmeetings, on the campaign trail, and through social media, lawmakers \nare hearing heartbreaking stories from families and friends of addicted \nindividuals and leaders of impacted communities.\n  There is no single solution to this epidemic. The most effective way \nto approach addiction is to pursue a comprehensive response, which must \ninclude a strict focus on prevention, law enforcement strategies to \nstop drug dealers and traffickers, a plan to address overdosing, and a \nplan to strengthen opioid abuse treatment and recovery options for \nthose struggling with their addiction.\n  The Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act is an important piece of \nthis puzzle. While State and local officials and community \norganizations must be at the forefront of confronting this challenge, \nthe Federal Government should help support these efforts. My \nlegislation authorizes the Attorney General to make grants available to \nStates and localities for a number of services related to opioid and \nheroin abuse.\n  The grant program contains eight allowable uses of the grant funds, \nwhich are broadly construed to give States flexibility in responding to \nthe epidemic within their borders, meaning not a one-size-fits-all \nprogram. These include alternatives to the incarceration programs; \ncollaboration between criminal justice agencies and substance abuse \nsystems; training for first responders in carrying and administering \nopioid overdose reversal drugs, including naloxone; and prescription \ndrug monitoring programs.\n  It is imperative that we pursue aggressive measures to stint opioids' \ndangerous progression, for a stronger, more prosperous America. The \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act is a commonsense and \nbipartisan approach that addresses the issue head-on and will make a \npositive impact on our fight against addiction. H.R. 5046 is fully \noffset and contains strong accountability provisions to ensure funding \nis spent wisely.\n  I want to thank Chairman Goodlatte and my colleagues in the Senate \nfor their tremendous work while addressing the opioid epidemic. I am \noptimistic that, with passage of this bill and the additional opioid \nmeasures the House of Representatives is considering this week, we can \ngo quickly to conference and send meaningful legislation to the \nPresident for his signature. I urge my colleagues to vote for H.R. \n5046.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chairwoman, I yield 5 minutes to the gentlewoman \nfrom Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), the ranking member on the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations of the \nCommittee on the Judiciary, who has done tremendous work on this \nsubject.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Madam Chair, I thank the distinguished ranking \nmember and the dean of this institution for yielding and for his \nleadership; but it is\n\n[[Page H2298]]\n\neven more powerful that the leadership joins with our distinguished \nchairman of the full committee, Mr. Goodlatte, because this is the \nbeginning of our effort of criminal justice reform that certainly has \nbeen one of the guiding focuses of the chairman of the Subcommittee on \nCrime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and Investigations, Mr. \nSensenbrenner, who has, likewise, been a former chair of the full \ncommittee but has steadily worked on thoughtful legislation dealing \nwith the overall issue of criminal justice reform.\n  I am delighted to be a partner in this legislation and to be a \ncosponsor and to work on this whole concept of dealing with opioids \nbut, as well, to deal with the question of criminal justice reform with \na whole new attitude.\n  I might say that I heard words from Leader Pelosi yesterday evening \nas she received the Hubert H. Humphrey Civil and Human Rights Award. \nShe indicated that there are three major issues that we should be \ngoverned by in this Congress: number one, children; number two, \nchildren; and number three, children.\n  One might ask: Why are we discussing children? I thought we were \ndiscussing the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act of 2016, and \nthat we are. I am very pleased that it is a very forthright and \nthoughtful approach to this issue. I support it. But it is a \ncompilation, if you will, of many thoughts about how we should deal \nwith the question of mass incarceration.\n  What does mass incarceration deal with? It deals with human beings. \nIt deals with men and women. It deals with families. It deals with \nmothers who have children. Previously, if you were on any manner of \ndrugs or you possessed drugs, you were nonviolent, you were \nincarcerated. If you were on crack or cocaine, you were incarcerated.\n  I commend the chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, \nHomeland Security, and Investigations, Mr. Sensenbrenner, for his work, \nas I said, and Chairman Goodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers because we \nnow have, from the Committee on the Judiciary, a legislative initiative \nthat does not have mandatory minimums. In fact, it deals with a \npassionate and compassionate approach, and it deals with the issue of \naddiction and recovery, the bill that I was a sponsor of earlier, a \npredecessor to this one, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  I would be happy to see the committee pass that bill, but I am \npleased that we have been able to work together to produce an \nalternative bill that will help address issues related to opioid \nabuse--again, I emphasize, no mandatory minimums, but a way of \naddressing this question, Madam Chair, that I think will be long term.\n\n  I look forward to continued collaboration with my colleagues to find \nadditional solutions to the drug crisis America now faces. We must take \naction because today a leading killer of Americans is drug overdose. \nBetween 2000 and 2014, almost a half million people died from drug \noverdoses. Many of these deaths were preventable. In 2014 alone, more \nthan 47,000 people died of drug overdoses. The largest percentage of \noverdose deaths in 2014 was attributable to opioids like prescription \npainkillers, methadone, morphine, and heroin. Therein lies the origin \nof this massive impact, including our juveniles, who find them in many \ndifferent ways. Specifically, 28,647 people overdosed and died because \nof an opioid in 2014.\n  We are experiencing an emergency that impacts citizens in every \nState, city, and town in this country--that is, prescription painkiller \nand opioid abuse. This emergency is compounded due to the perilous \nconnection between prescription painkillers and heroin. I get it. We \nunderstand that physicians who did take their oath very seriously \nwanted to provide the medical care, the legitimate medical care when \nthere was a massive response to pain from all of their patients and \nothers.\n  Prescription painkiller abuse is the strongest risk factor for future \nheroin use, but it came about maybe not through the prescription and \nthe initial prescription, but from lack of information that patients \nshould have about the impact of opioids: what it does to the brain, \nwhat it does when you do not have it, how you become addicted. So out \nof this, approximately three out of four new heroin users report that \ntheir use began with their abuse of prescription painkillers initially \ngiven to them legitimately for medical reasons.\n  Heroin use becomes appealing to those addicted to prescription \npainkillers because it is cheaper and easier to obtain. Due to its \npotency, heroin use tends to lead to addiction. The same kind of lack \nof information maybe led to a young woman, in my district, on \nhydrocodone with two little babies in the car driving and sideswiping \ntwo cars and killing an innocent person on a motorcycle.\n  The CHAIR. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Madam Chair, I yield the gentlewoman an additional 2 \nminutes.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Or the mother who gave hydrocodone and alcohol as a \nprom gift to her son and his date. That date wound up dead at the end \nof that prom.\n  The rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths increased \nis cause for alarm. In the 4 years between 2010 and 2014, heroin \noverdoses more than tripled.\n  This legislation encourages the development of alternatives to \nincarceration that provide treatment as a solution to the underlying \nmotivation for criminal behavior or conduct associated with mental \ndisorders. We must make our best efforts. It puts police in a position \nto be trained to use those drugs that will help when they come upon an \nunconscious person, like naloxone. It allows the criminal justice \nsystem to talk to the substance abuse system. In essence, it increases \nthe use and availability of those drugs. Addiction is a disease; we \nrecognize that.\n  Finally, if I might say, I started with children, children, children. \nJust today, Dr. Phil is here discussing the foster care system. He said \nthat most children are taken away because of neglect, and that neglect \nis based upon the use of drugs. That is a wrong direction. The \ndirection should be that we keep families together, we invest, and we \nprovide the training to provide them parental skills and, if they are \naddicted, to get them off of those addictive ways to be able to keep \nfamilies together.\n  Today I will introduce a bill that provides for nurseries in the \nFederal prison system for women in short-term nonviolent offenses, \nmostly drug offenses, to reinforce the value of mothers and children \nbeing together. This bill, even though it may not point to that, is an \noverall change of attitude that looks to America and says: We want you \nnot to be addicted. We don't want you to be on prescription drugs and \nlead you to addiction after your illness is over. We want you to be \ncared for medically, but we don't want you to become addicted. In order \nto do that, we are not going to criminalize you. We are going to give \nyou treatment and allow the criminal justice system--police, \nprosecutors, and others--to have an alternative to ensure that that can \nbe done.\n  I am very pleased that we are on the floor today. I know that we will \nhave an omnibus tomorrow. I hope that you will support the underlying \nbill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Madam Chairman, it is now my pleasure to yield 2\\1/2\\ \nminutes to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of \nthe Committee on Appropriations.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Madam Chair, I thank the chairman and \ncongratulate him on a great bill.\n  When the abuse of prescription medications silently took hold of \nrural towns in Appalachia over a decade ago, we knew we had to do \nsomething to curb the rising tide of addiction and overdose deaths.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  We gathered individuals from all disciplines and backgrounds--\nteachers, preachers, parents, judges, cops, doctors, pharmacists, \ncommunity leaders, and others--to brainstorm as to what we could do to \naddress the staggering problem.\n  We quickly realized there was no silver bullet that could easily \nsolve the crisis, but we responded by creating a holistic, \nmultidisciplinary organization called Operation UNITE: Unlawful \nNarcotics Investigations Treatment and Education.\n  Since 2003, UNITE's law enforcement agents have confiscated more than \n$12\n\n[[Page H2299]]\n\nmillion worth of these drugs and arrested over 4,300 bad actors. But we \nalso established 30 drug courts so that the nonviolent offenders could \nget their lives back on track.\n  UNITE established a toll-free treatment referral helpline, receiving \n1,200 calls a month. We have provided 4,000 free vouchers to \nindividuals who otherwise would be unable to access treatment for their \naddiction.\n  UNITE also works hard to engage our young people through community \ncoalitions of thousands of people as well as UNITE clubs in our \nschools. Over 100,000 students have taken part in antidrug education \nactivities to warn about the dangers of prescription drugs.\n  Today it is difficult to imagine a single town in the country that \nhas eluded the devastating grasp of opioid addiction. So UNITE took its \nmodel to the national stage.\n  Over the past 5 years, the National Prescription Drug Abuse and \nHeroin Summit in Atlanta has brought together thousands of our \ncountry's brightest, most dedicated minds.\n  At the Federal level, we should be replicating UNITE's holistic, \nmultipronged approach. I am, therefore, proud to support this bill, \nwhich will enable communities around the country to unite to implement \nsimilar strategies, incorporating law enforcement, treatment, and \neducation.\n  There is no silver bullet, Mr. Chairman, to bring an end to \naddiction, but together we can certainly save lives and restore hope in \nevery community. I think this bill allows that to occur.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nOhio (Mr. Ryan), who is very concerned about this issue.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman from \nVirginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and Mr. Sensenbrenner for all their good work \non this. This is really one of the great days, great weeks, I think, on \nthis House floor because of what we are doing here to address the \nheroin and opioid crisis in America.\n  It is sad to watch someone from Virginia and someone from Wisconsin \nand someone from Michigan and someone from Ohio and someone from Texas \nall get up and really kind of embody and express how deep this problem \nis in our country today. I know we have all been to calling hours and \nwe have all been to funerals and seen up close and personal how \ndevastating this epidemic is here in the United States.\n  Like many of my colleagues, unfortunately, Ohio has now seen \naccidental deaths by overdose surpass even car accidents. So we all \nneed to come together, Democrats and Republicans, to try to solve this \nproblem. I think this week is a major step in that direction.\n  I am supporting the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act and many \nother bills that are coming to this floor this week.\n  In Trumbull County alone, one of my biggest counties, a few months \nback we had 22 overdoses and, of that, 7 deaths in that one county. \nThis is pervasive in Cuyahoga County, which is Cleveland. We have \nalmost one death a day that we are dealing with in Ohio.\n  So the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act program creates at \nthe Department of Justice a real opportunity for us to fix this \nprogram. It focuses on how we can tackle substance abuse through \npreventative programs, expansion of the prescription drug programs, and \nresources for veteran treatment court programs. That is one of the key \nelements of this: how we are going to make sure our veterans can get \ndiverted through veterans courts.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Donovan). The time of the gentleman has \nexpired.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield the gentleman an additional 1 \nminute.\n  Mr. RYAN of Ohio. In Ohio alone, we have seen first responders use \nnaloxone. In 2013, over 12,000 doses were administered. This is a huge \nproblem. We have seen the men and women and we have seen the families \nthat have been destroyed because of this.\n  I hope that, as we get the Senate bill out of conference, we make \nsure that it is comprehensive, that it is addiction, treatment, and \nrecovery, and, as we move through the budget process, through the \nappropriations process, we make sure that there is the appropriate \nrevenue, the appropriate amount of money, going to these programs that \nwill ultimately hit the ground and help us get our arms around this \nprogram.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Mimi Walters), a member of the Judiciary Committee.\n  Ms. MIMI WALTERS of California. Mr. Chairman, across the United \nStates we are faced with a substance abuse epidemic that results in \noverdoses, addiction, and, for too many, death. From opioids to heroin, \nno community--not even Orange County, the place I have called home for \n50 years--is immune.\n  Statistics show that nearly 130 people die every single day from drug \nabuse. Though this is a nationwide epidemic, there is not a one-size-\nfits-all cure to addiction. That is why the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse \nReduction Act is so important.\n  This bill will create a grant program to help State and local \ngovernments combat opioid addiction in their communities and give them \nflexibility to dedicate resources to the needs of their specific \ncommunity, whether that means prescription drug monitoring programs, \noverdose treatment training for first responders, or rehabilitation \nprograms.\n  This legislation passed the Judiciary Committee with unanimous \nsupport. I urge my colleagues to join me in supporting this bill \nbecause its passage will save lives and help Americans suffering from \naddiction reclaim their lives.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield 3 minutes to the distinguished \ngentlewoman from Florida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this critical legislation to \naddress the nationwide opioid epidemic which has affected south \nFlorida, where I am from, as it has communities from California to New \nHampshire.\n  Today I want to tell you about a related crisis that is obstructing \nthe recovery of addicts and damaging the character of south Florida \nneighborhoods, and neighborhoods across the Nation. I am talking about \nthe overproliferation in residential areas of group homes for \nrecovering addicts called sober homes.\n  In theory, it is a very good thing, a way to reintegrate addicts back \ninto the community. It is activity protected by two historic laws that \nprohibit discrimination in housing against persons with disabilities.\n  But this civil rights protection is being abused by two many \nunscrupulous actors who are luring young adults away from their \nfamilies and placing them in group homes that have no standards and \nthen leaving them to their own devices until their insurance runs out. \nThe result is an overdosing nightmare as well as an increase in \nhomelessness, code enforcement violations, and crime.\n  Making matters worse, cities and towns feel regulation and consumer \nprotection would be in violation of Federal law. As a consequence, we \nare seeing thousands of sober homes in south Florida disrupting \nservices and the health and safety of neighborhoods and leaving young \npeople who are trying to repair their lives spiraling back into \nhopelessness.\n  Mr. Chair, I urge this Congress and the President to work with folks \nin my area and around the country to find the proper balance between \nprotecting the rights of addicts and getting them recovered and keeping \nthe integrity and character of our neighborhoods.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Arkansas (Mr. Westerman).\n  Mr. WESTERMAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5046. I \nthank the gentleman from Wisconsin for his work to combat the Nation's \nopioid epidemic.\n  This legislation is important to the whole country and will \nespecially have positive impacts in Arkansas by freeing up new grants \nfor funds for drug courts. Drug courts have a positive impact on \npeople's lives and are integral to countering our Nation's opioid \nepidemic.\n  Drug courts in Arkansas have a strong record of success. Last week I \nvisited with Judge Berlin Jones in Pine Bluff, Arkansas. His Jefferson \nCounty drug court has a recidivism rate of only 4.9 percent.\n  Drug courts have also saved billions of taxpayer dollars, on average, \nbecause it costs $14 a day to send a person to a drug court whereas \nincarceration costs $58 per day in my State of Arkansas. Taxpayers also \nsave money because these individuals can return to\n\n[[Page H2300]]\n\nthe workforce and provide for their families.\n  Mr. Chairman, I ask my colleagues to support H.R. 5046 to counter \nthis epidemic ruining our families and communities.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nNew Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I am proud to rise in support of H.R. 5046, \nthe Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, which will provide more \neffective cooperation between our law enforcement and treatment \nagencies, grow our treatment capabilities, and strengthen programs for \ntraining and veterans. This bill is an important step in combating the \ngrowing costs of the terrible opioid epidemic.\n  Just last year, in my home State of New Hampshire, deadly overdoses \nfollowing the abuse of heroin killed over 430 people. That staggering \nfigure marks the rising toll of this epidemic.\n  I commend my colleagues for offering this legislation as part of the \nresponse to the epidemic and as part of a wider plan moving through the \nHouse this week.\n  This bill aims to bring sorely needed resources to different groups \nand agencies working to help families and individuals in need, \nsometimes in desperate need.\n  For too long, too many of those helping our sons and daughters and \nour veterans have been underfunded in their efforts. This week we have \nheard and shared stories of people suffering from this epidemic all \nover the country. These stories help us draft and pass effective \nresponse to the needs of our communities.\n  We know that no one bill or amendment on its own is equal to the \nmassive scale of this epidemic, but together they can begin to address \nsome of its worst effects and harshest consequences. We need to \nincorporate the best practices that have emerged across disciplines and \ndifferent agencies, and we need to ensure cooperation between actors on \nthe ground.\n  As part of the House response to the Senate-passed Comprehensive \nAddiction and Recovery Act, this bill represents our commitment to \nrestoring hope in shattered communities. I have been a proud sponsor of \nmany of the bills coming forward this week, and I am pleased that so \nmany have passed and many more are expected to pass today.\n  We provide a cohesive, unified, and far-reaching legislative package \nto meet the enormity of this epidemic, and I believe we have begun to \nmove in that direction. I thank my colleagues for their dedication and \ntireless work to support this effort.\n  I particularly want to commend Chairman Goodlatte on his leadership \nand his efforts as we continue to help and provide hope for people not \njust in New Hampshire, but all across the country.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nGeorgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive \nOpioid Reduction Act of 2016, because we need to ensure that every \nState has the tools they need to fight the opioid abuse epidemic.\n  H.R. 5046 establishes a comprehensive opioid abuse grant program to \nprovide training to first responders, criminal investigation for the \ndistribution of opioids, resident treatment centers, and drug courts.\n  Approximately 47,000 Americans died from drug overdoses in 2014, and \napproximately 21.5 million people ages 12 and older suffer from \nsubstance abuse. As a lifelong pharmacist, I have seen firsthand the \nstruggles that these people face.\n  H.R. 5046 seeks to fight the opioid epidemic through a grant program \nthat would provide States with the resources to provide programs to \nhelp Americans fight this disease.\n  It would help improve prescription drug monitoring programs, help \naddress juvenile opioid abuse, give first responders the training to \nreverse opioid overdoses, and improve access for veterans in treatment \ncourt.\n  The only way we are going to be able to fight this battle is if we \nwork together as a team to educate and help victims of the opioid \nabuse.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this bill.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield \n1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Michigan (Mr. Walberg).\n  Mr. WALBERG. Mr. Chairman, like many States across the country, \nheroin and opioid addiction is shattering people's lives in my State of \nMichigan as well.\n  To the families that are suffering, we are here to offer solutions, \nto provide hope, and help them recover and get back on their feet.\n  There are many community-based programs and groups in my district \nworking on the front lines to raise awareness and combat this public \nhealth crisis; groups like the Monroe County Substance Abuse Coalition, \nthe Eaton County Substance Abuse Advisory Council, Andy's Angels in \nJackson, and many more.\n  In Lenawee County, my home county, community stakeholders recently \ncame together to hold an addiction summit, and a recovering addict from \nMonroe County recently organized a march to show there is hope after \nheroin. Their work on the local level is absolutely critical.\n  Here at the Federal level, we must work side-by-side with our State \nand local partners to stop the damaging trends of addiction in its \ntracks.\n  The bipartisan legislation we are considering today establishes a \ncomprehensive opioid abuse reduction program, and gives State and \nlocalities the flexibility to tailor prevention and treatment efforts \nto the specific needs of their communities.\n  I want to thank my colleague, Representative Sensenbrenner, for his \nleadership on the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act, and I \nencourage its passage so we can help rebuild and save lives in our \ncommunities.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield \n1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Meehan).\n  Mr. MEEHAN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlemen from Virginia \nand from Wisconsin for their great work on this important issue.\n  I rise in strong support of the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction \nAct for many reasons, but one in particular, for the support that it \nnow gives to Veterans Treatment Courts.\n  As a former prosecutor, I saw firsthand the effectiveness of this. \nBut we are also seeing amongst those who are struggling with opioid \naddiction a unique cohort being veterans. Many of them are returning--\nin fact, 67 percent of our returning vets face mental health \nchallenges, and too many of them are choosing to self-medicate, or are \ndealing with injuries that they have acquired, through opioids. It has \nled to not only addiction, but other kinds of behaviors.\n  When we are able to bring them into the court system under the \nguidance, it creates not only the oversight of the system but, as well, \nthe promotion of this peer-to-peer in which other veterans enable them \nto work together to get back not only their dignity and their lives, \nbut they take advantage of the kinds of resources that we have within \nthe veterans system to deal with the underlying addiction and other \nkinds of issues.\n  This is a tremendous additional effort to authorize a program which \nwe have been able to support here in Congress and create permanence for \nit. I believe this is another important opportunity for us not to leave \nour injured back on the battlefield.\n  I thank the gentlemen for their support.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I continue to reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, at this time, it is my pleasure to yield \n2 minutes to the gentleman from Illinois (Mr. LaHood).\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this measure.\n  As a former State and Federal prosecutor who has been in charge of \nprosecuting narcotics cases, I have seen\n\n[[Page H2301]]\n\nfirsthand the devastating effect that opioid and heroin addiction has \nhad. This nationwide opioid and heroin epidemic stretches home into my \ndistrict in central and west central Illinois.\n  Seventy-eight people die from heroin or opioid overdoses each day. \nThat has quadrupled since 1999. Now it is the leading cause of death, \nfar surpassing deaths by motor vehicle accidents.\n  Just last week I hosted a series of roundtable forums across my \ndistrict to personally hear from law enforcement officers, medical \nprofessionals, treatment providers, local government officials, and \nthose who have lost loved ones due to overdose.\n  They shared with me the reality of the situation back home. Law \nenforcement has had to double its on-hand stock of Narcan, and expand \ntraining for police officers when it comes to these overdoses.\n  Heroin is now the primary abused substance in drug court programs \nlike the one in Springfield, Illinois, but those programs are at \ncapacity. Treatment centers have waitlists over 40 days.\n  The consensus is clear. This is a public health crisis. To end it, we \nneed to do a number of things. Update medical best practices for coping \nwith pain. We need to expand access to addiction specialists and \ntreatment centers. We need to give law enforcement the tools they need, \nand we must continue to promote programs like drug courts.\n  Because this problem is complex, it must be addressed from all \nangles, and that is precisely what we are doing in the House this week.\n  This bill will address this epidemic, and the concerns I heard last \nweek. It would establish a comprehensive opioid abuse reduction program \nat the Department of Justice, target Federal resources directly at the \nopioid problem, give States flexibility, and create a streamlined \ncomprehensive opioid abuse grant program.\n  Without raising taxes, this measure authorizes $103 million each year \nfor a variety of programs, including residential substance abuse \ntreatment, drug courts, training for law enforcement and first \nresponders.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, it is my pleasure to yield an additional \n1 minute to Mr. LaHood.\n  Mr. LaHOOD. Mr. Chairman, this funding includes treatment for law \nenforcement and first responders, and criminal investigations for the \nunlawful distribution of these opioids.\n  Opioid addiction transcends socioeconomic boundaries, racial, gender, \nregional, and educational boundaries. We need to address this crisis \nnow.\n  I thank my colleague, Mr. Sensenbrenner, and Chairman Goodlatte, for \nbringing this legislation forth. This is a problem that is preventable, \nand we are doing something about it this week in the Congress.\n  I am proud to support this legislation. I look forward to supporting \nit.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased now to yield as much time as \nshe may consume to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, it has been refreshing and important \nto listen to the many Members from all over the country discussing this \nimportant initiative and, more proudly, it is from the Judiciary \nCommittee, which is the holder of the laws and the Constitution of this \nland. We are here indicating an admittance and a recognition that \naddiction, and opioids, and all kinds of addictions are not necessarily \na crime, and that we do not come to this floor, in this bill, with \nmandatory minimums.\n\n  So I want to follow up on some statements that I made on the floor \nyesterday and also in the Rules Committee concerning the contrast in \nthe way we are dealing with the opioid crisis and the way we addressed \ncrack cocaine in the 1980s.\n  Many of those individuals from neighborhoods like mine, many of them \nstill are incarcerated. And at that time, we--I was not here--Congress \ntook action that we are still trying to rectify.\n  At one point, more than 80 percent of the defendants sentenced for \ncrack cocaine offenses were African Americans, despite the fact that \nmore than 66 percent of crack users were either White or Hispanic.\n  As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and \nsentencing disparities related to crack issues, we must reexamine our \napproach to that and other drug issues. I think we are on the right \ntrack. I think we are being fair.\n  This week, the House has been engaged in a comprehensive approach to \naddressing a serious public health crisis involving heroin and other \nopioids.\n  In my earlier statement, I complimented my chairman of the full \ncommittee and my chairman of the subcommittee because we are working \ntogether.\n  Overdoses and deaths involving heroin are on the rise. While law \nenforcement has an appropriate role, the bills, including H.R. 5046 \nbefore us now, reflect a broader strategy that reflects the fact that \nthis is an addiction issue.\n  I know that Mr. Conyers and many others who are on this floor, Mr. \nDavis, we come from inner-city communities, and we have watched the \nyoung people of our community die and lose their future life through \ncrack cocaine.\n  Accordingly, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory \nminimums, but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as \ntreatment alternatives to incarceration, and we are bringing in the \npolice persons, the police departments. What a great idea: criminal \njustice and substance abuse and police persons dealing with this issue \nin a non-incarceration mode.\n  We are not adding to mass incarceration with all of the related and \ndevastating collateral consequences but, instead, we are incentivizing \nState and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal. That is what \nwe should be doing, and that is what we should have done for crack and \ncocaine addicts.\n  We are learning. We understand now that we have a different pathway, \nbut it is not too late. So I am saying to my colleagues here as we are \nworking together, we should find a way before Congress has completed \nits work on this legislation and send a bill to the President that \napplies a more comprehensive approach, or a comprehensive approach that \nadds to this very strong foundation, including treatment alternatives \nfor those who may still be suffering from crack and cocaine addiction.\n  I remember signing the sentencing, the reduction bill that we had in \n2009 dealing with the crack cocaine disparities. We came together as a \nbipartisan group. So I know that these are things that we can do.\n  I have had this issue and discussed it with the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers), and I hope that we can work together as we move \nforward and that our colleagues can work together as we move forward to \nlook at these issues because if we walk our neighborhoods today, from \none inner city to the next, and maybe our rural communities, we will \nfind those crack cocaine addicts.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Will the gentlewoman yield?\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I yield to the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I just want the gentlewoman to know that her \nrecollection of the years before, where we have come from a more narrow \nfocus, more punitive, and we now are seeing a newer strategy that is \nfar more useful, far more successful than before. And I want to \ncongratulate her for her perseverance and determination that we will \nstill get it even better under control through our looking carefully at \nthe results of our activities.\n  I thank the gentlewoman.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman. I look forward to working \nwith all of my colleagues.\n  As I finish, let me just say that today, again, I will be introducing \nthe recidivism--to End Infant Mortality and Reduce Recidivism bill \ndealing with incarcerated women. Many of those women are incarcerated \nbecause of drug addiction issues that involve the possession or sale of \nnarcotics.\n  What we are attempting to do, if a baby is born in prison, we are \nattempting to recognize that they should not be separated from that \nmother, and to have some postnatal nursery situation in a pilot program \nto examine how that works, because we know that addiction, in many \ninstances, has caused women to be incarcerated.\n  There are many issues that we can look at, and I hope, as we work our \nway through this, we will find some solutions for those who are still \naddicted to crack cocaine and need some of the\n\n[[Page H2302]]\n\nsame or similar services that this underlying legislation has.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 5046, the Comprehensive Opioid \nAbuse Reduction Act of 2016, of which I am an original cosponsor.\n  I commend the Chairman of the Subcommittee on Crime, Jim \nSensenbrenner, for his work on this bill and I also commend Chairman \nGoodlatte and Ranking Member Conyers for their ability to find common \nground on this very important issue.\n  I also note that I was a cosponsor of a similar bill that was the \npredecessor to this one, the Comprehensive Addiction and Recovery Act.\n  I would have been happy to see the Committee pass that bill, but I am \npleased that we have been able to work together to produce an \nalternative bill that will help address issues related to opioid abuse.\n  I look forward to continued collaboration with my colleagues to find \nadditional solutions to the drug crisis America now faces.\n  We must take action because today a leading killer of Americans is \ndrug overdose.\n  Between 2000 and 2014, almost half a million people died from drug \noverdoses.\n  Many of these deaths were preventable.\n  In 2014 alone, more than 47,000 people died of drug overdoses.\n  The largest percentage of overdose deaths in 2014 was attributed to \nopioids--like prescription painkillers, methadone, morphine, and \nheroin.\n  Specifically, 28,647 people overdosed and died because of an opioid \nin 2014.\n  We are experiencing an emergency that impacts citizens in every \nstate, city, and town in this country--that is prescription painkiller \nand opioid abuse.\n  This emergency is compounded due to the perilous connection between \nprescription painkillers and heroin.\n  Prescription painkiller abuse is the strongest risk factor for future \nheroin use.\n  Approximately three out of four new heroin users report that their \nuse began with their abuse of prescription painkillers.\n  Heroin use becomes appealing to those addicted to prescription \npainkillers because it is cheaper and easier to obtain.\n  Due to its potency, heroin use tends to lead to addiction.\n  Heroin addiction is often deadly, leading to overdose or other \nchronic diseases.\n  The rate at which the occurrence of heroin overdose deaths increased \nis cause for alarm.\n  In the four years between 2010 and 2014, heroin overdoses more than \ntripled.\n  More than 10,500 people died from heroin overdoses in 2014.\n  In 2013, more than 8,200 people died from heroin overdoses.\n  In that same year, 11 million people admitted to improper use of \nprescription of painkillers.\n  Not only were 11 million people at risk of overdosing due to their \nabuse of prescription painkillers, 11 million people were also at high \nrisk of becoming addicted to heroin--with its attendant risks and \ndangers.\n  This current crisis requires an immediate and comprehensive response \nand the bill before us today is one element of a broader strategy.\n  This bill will establish a grant program, to be administered by the \nDepartment of Justice, to assist states and local governments, \nparticularly by helping criminal justice agencies to tackle the opioid \nproblem from a variety of angles.\n  This bill encourages the development of alternatives to incarceration \nthat provide treatment as a solution to the underlying motivation for \ncriminal behavior or conduct associated with mental disorders.\n  We must make our best efforts to prevent individuals from moving from \npainkillers to heroin by making treatment for addicts more accessible \nby encouraging the use of evidence-based programs, such as medication-\nassisted treatment.\n  Life-saving overdose reversal drugs, like naloxone, are most valuable \nin the hands of trained individuals who regularly come in contact with \nindividuals who are prone to drug overdoses.\n  This bill will increase the use and availability of naloxone and \nother overdose reversal drugs to first responders.\n  Addiction is a disease that affects the brain and eventually changes \nthe behavior of addicts, causing them to experience mental health \nissues and encounter legal problems.\n  Treatment is the most reasonable and effective approach to diverting \nthese individuals away from homelessness and prison.\n  There are also specific provisions in this bill that allow for a wide \nrange of services to be offered to our veterans who tend to suffer from \nmental health issues and addiction.\n  I support this bill because I believe that it will help save lives \nand prevent and treat opioid addiction.\n  The approach Congress is taking with the crisis of heroin and other \nopioids is thoughtful and comprehensive.\n  I hope it signals a departure from some of the failed approaches \nconcerning other drug crises in the past.\n  For instance, our response to the surge in crack cocaine in the 1980s \nwas to enact draconian mandatory minimum penalties with vastly \ndisparate treatment for crack and powder cocaine.\n  Unfortunately, that exacerbated the disproportionate minority impact \nof our drug laws and their enforcement.\n  Today, no matter who is suffering from the effects of illegal drugs, \nwe must learn from the past and embrace new ways of addressing the \nproblem.\n  The bill before us today, and the approaches contained in other \nlegislation passed by the Senate and introduced in the House, reflect \nour experience in dealing with drug prevention, addiction, treatment, \nand recovery.\n  While there is still work to do in Congress to address the mistakes \nof the past with respect to mandatory minimum sentences that are \nunjust, unwise and financially unsustainable, I commend my colleagues \nfor embracing drug treatment, alternatives to incarceration, and \nimproved training to first responders and the criminal justice system \non how to put substance abusers on a better path.\n  With those considerations in mind, and a hopeful note about the \nprogress we are making in our approach to these issues, I ask that my \ncolleagues join me in voting in favor of this important bill.\n  I want to follow up on my earlier statement concerning the contrast \nin the way we are dealing with the opioid crisis and the way we \naddressed crack cocaine in the 1980s.\n  At that time, we Congress took action that we are still trying to \nrectify.\n  At one point, more than 80% of the defendants sentenced for crack \noffenses were African American, despite the fact that more than 66% of \ncrack users are white or Hispanic.\n  As we work on other legislation to address the enforcement and \nsentencing disparities related to the crack issue, we must re-examine \nour approach to that and other drug issues.\n  This week, the House has been engaged in a comprehensive approach to \naddressing a serious public health crisis involving heroin and other \nopioids.\n  Overdoses and deaths involving heroin are on the rise.\n  While law enforcement has an appropriate role and the bills' \nrecognize that, the bills--including H.R. 5046 before us now--reflect a \nbroader strategy that reflects the fact that this is an addiction \nissue.\n  Accordingly, we are not raising sentences or impacting mandatory \nminimums but we are funding anti-addiction mechanisms such as treatment \nalternatives to incarceration.\n  We are not adding to mass incarceration--with all of the related and \ndevastating collateral consequences--but instead we are incentivizing \nstate and local governments to prevent, treat, and heal.\n  That is what we should be doing, and that is what we should have done \nfor crack and cocaine addicts.\n  But it is not too late--we should find a way, before Congress has \ncompleted its work on this legislation and sends a bill to the \nPresident, to apply this more comprehensive approach, including \ntreatment alternatives, to those suffering from crack and cocaine \naddiction.\n  I urge my colleagues to work with me to do this.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to yield back after \nthe gentleman from Michigan yields back.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1330\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Members of the Committee, we have had a very interesting and \nimportant discussion. As an original cosponsor of H.R. 5046, we see \nmore clearly how it will provide critical grants to prevent and treat \nopioid abuse and addictions, and, most importantly, because it will \nhelp save lives.\n  So, in closing, I want to commend my colleagues on the Judiciary \nCommittee in particular for their work on this measure, starting with \nour chairman, Mr. Goodlatte, and our subcommittee chairman, Jim \nSensenbrenner, for his extraordinary leadership in crafting this \nimportant bill, and, of course, our gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson \nLee) for her continuing vigilance to improve our approaches towards \ndealing with this opioid abuse and addiction challenge.\n  This bill before us has the power to fortify America's fight against \nthe opioid epidemic. I am extremely proud to not only support it, but I \nurge all of my colleagues to join with me.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H2303]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. Chairman, let me say I appreciate the huge, bipartisan support \nthat this legislation has attracted.\n  I have been working on legislation to deal with Department of Justice \ngrants in the opioid addiction area for over 2 years. It took a while, \nand, unfortunately, it took the expansion of a problem into an epidemic \nto show this Congress that we have to act, we have to act \ncomprehensively, and we have to act in a manner that actually goes down \nto our communities to help out those communities and, more importantly, \nthe people who are addicted and their families.\n  The package of bills that the House has debated yesterday and is \ndebating today does exactly that. For those who criticize Congress for \nnot doing anything, this is something that is probably going to have a \nvery, very meaningful impact on the lives and livelihoods of people who \nhave gotten hooked on something, and it gives them a way out in a \ncompassionate and effective manner.\n  Let me say I am not sure that the American public is going to realize \nthe importance of what we are doing today, because I see the wide-open \nspaces in the press gallery above the Speaker's rostrum. I think that \nis unfortunate because this is something, number one, that is \nimportant; number two, it will help people; number three, it is \nbipartisan, which shows very clearly that we don't spend all of our \ntime here arguing and fighting amongst ourselves; and number four, it \nis bicameral. This is Congress the way it should work and the way it is \nworking in a lot more cases than many in the American public think it \nis.\n  So I guess my message to everybody today is, number one, we are doing \nour job, and we are doing our job with this legislation in a vitally \nimportant manner to help turn some lives around and to prevent tragedy; \nand number two, the fact that we can get together to deal with a \nnational problem in a bipartisan manner shows that we take our job \nseriously, whether we sit on the Democratic side of the aisle or the \nRepublican side of our aisle, and we are rising to the occasion.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Thompson of Pennsylvania). All time for general \ndebate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  It shall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose \nof amendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-52.

The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 6, strike ``part HH'' and insert ``part DD or \n     HH''.\n       Add at the end of the bill the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. INCLUSION OF SERVICES FOR PREGNANT WOMEN UNDER \n                   FAMILY-BASED SUBSTANCE ABUSE GRANTS.\n\n       Part DD of title I of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe \n     Streets Act (42 U.S.C. 3797s et seq.) is amended--\n       (1) in section 2921(2), by inserting before the period at \n     the end ``or pregnant women''; and\n       (2) in section 2927--\n       (A) in paragraph (1)(A), by inserting ``pregnant or'' \n     before ``a parent''; and\n       (B) in paragraph (3), by inserting ``or pregnant women'' \n     after ``incarcerated parents''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Donovan) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of the amendment \noffered by myself and Mr. Turner. This amendment expands eligibility \nfor existing family-based substance abuse treatment grants to include \npregnant women.\n  In New York State alone, over 1,700 pregnant women pass through our \ncorrections system each year. On any given day, there are 12 to 15 \npregnant women in New York State prisons and 110 in local jails, and \nmany of these women are coming in with drug addictions that pose harm \nto not only themselves, but to their unborn children.\n  States across the country have passed laws and implemented programs \nto provide community and family-based alternatives to incarceration for\n\n[[Page H2305]]\n\nnonviolent parent offenders. However, State programs targeting \noffenders who are parents-to-be are not currently eligible for grants. \nThis peculiarity makes it difficult for States to develop programs \naddressing the particularly vulnerable population of nonviolent \npregnant offenders. This amendment would make clear that such funding \ncould be provided to States to develop and expand family-based \nsubstance abuse treatment programs that focus on expectant mothers.\n  When a drug-addicted pregnant woman comes through the criminal \njustice system, we make every effort to help that expectant mother beat \nher drug addiction both for herself and for her child.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Ohio (Mr. \nTurner), my friend and cosponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleague from New \nYork (Mr. Donovan) for yielding and for his work on this amendment, \nwhich I am proud to cosponsor.\n  Mr. Chairman, the purpose of this amendment is simple: increase \naccess to substance abuse treatment for pregnant women. We accomplish \nthis by making clear that States receiving grants from an existing \nDepartment of Justice program may use them to provide family-based \ntreatment.\n  Currently, nonviolent mothers and fathers have access to family- and \ncommunity-based substance abuse treatment options that help keep their \nfamilies together, and that should be true for expectant mothers as \nwell. Our amendment would help provide this access to the 60 pregnant \nwomen in Ohio State prisons last month and countless others across the \ncountry, all of whom are ineligible for it today.\n  I have met with doctors, nurses, hospitals, law enforcement, and \ntreatment professionals, and have seen firsthand the devastating \neffects that heroin and opioid abuse have inflicted on pregnant women \nand newborns in my own southwest Ohio community. In December of 2013, I \ntoured Soin Medical Center in Beavercreek, Ohio, and discussed the \nconcerning trend the hospital was observing: increasing numbers of \ninfants born addicted to opiates.\n  At the Dayton Children's Hospital neonatal intensive care unit, I \nwitnessed the hardship that heroin and opioid addiction inflicts on \nboth women and their babies. I met with mothers struggling with \nsubstance abuse who had given birth to infants who had become addicted \nin the womb. I watched newborns just starting their lives suffering \nthrough the painful symptoms of neonatal abstinence syndrome.\n  At the Women's Recovery Center in Xenia, Ohio, I spoke to young women \nparticipating in opiate abuse intervention and treatment programs. One \nformer heroin user I spoke to shared with me her story about how the \nintervention and treatment she received at the center allowed her to \novercome her addiction before giving birth to her son.\n  It is vital that we provide women access to this treatment--for their \nown health and for the health of the children that they will bring into \nthe world.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge adoption of this amendment.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, \nalthough I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from Texas is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Chairman, let me congratulate the proponents of \nthe amendment and indicate to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan) \nthat I think many of us are on the same page.\n  The Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act authorizes the \nAttorney General to make grants to State and local governments for \nprison-based family substance abuse treatment programs for the \nincarcerated parents of minor children.\n  These programs can provide a comprehensive response to the needs of \nincarcerated parents of minor children, not only substance abuse \ntreatment, but also a range of family-related services. These can \ninclude child early intervention services, family counseling, medical \ncare, mental health services, parental skills training, pediatric care, \nphysical therapy, and prenatal care.\n  The importance of the value of these programs to pregnant women who \nfind themselves incarcerated as well as to women who are already \nmothers is beyond dispute. We want to give our children--no matter who \nthey are and where they are born in this country--a great and wonderful \npathway to success. This amendment makes pregnant women equally \neligible to participate in such programs.\n  As indicated earlier on the floor today, I am planning to introduce \nthe Stop Infant Mortality and Recidivism Reduction Act of 2016, which \nis to respond to women who have children while they are incarcerated, \nto provide them with some sort of support system where their babies are \nnot separated from them. Those babies may be born addicted. I think it \nis important that this amendment looks at those pregnant women who may \nbe incarcerated; and in this instance, this looks at pregnant women to \nprovide them alternatives. It can be of tremendous benefit to these \nmothers-to-be as well as their children and families.\n  This effort has my wholehearted support, and I strongly urge my \ncolleagues to support this amendment to the underlying bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ndistinguished gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. Sensenbrenner).\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for yielding \nand commend him for offering this amendment.\n  The amendment makes reasonable and appropriate changes to the Justice \nDepartment's Family-Based Substance Abuse Treatment Program, a program \nauthorized under the Second Chance Act. The program supports State and \nlocal government agencies and federally recognized Indian tribes in \nestablishing or enhancing residential substance abuse treatment \nprograms in correctional facilities that include recovery of family \nsupportive services. This amendment ensures that the program's \ndefinition of an incarcerated parent with minor children includes \npregnant women.\n  As a person who believes life begins at conception, I believe it is \nentirely appropriate for this program to provide services to pregnant \nwomen to meet their unique needs and those of their unborn children.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. DONOVAN. Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Donovan).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n       Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Danny K. Davis of Illinois\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at \nthe desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 14, strike ``and''.\n       Page 2, line 17, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; and''.\n       Page 2, after line 17, insert the following:\n       ``(F) a focus on parents whose incarceration could result \n     in their children entering the child welfare system.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis) and a Member opposed each will \ncontrol 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Illinois.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I am pleased to join \nwith my colleague from Indiana, Representative Todd Young, in offering \nour amendment to strengthen families by addressing parental substance \nabuse and decreasing the number of children entering foster care.\n  Our amendment is common sense. It simply allows the CARA substance \nabuse treatment diversion grants to focus on parents whose \nincarceration could result in their children entering foster care.\n  I am deeply troubled that almost 8 percent of children placed into \nfoster care each year enter due to parental incarceration. This is \napproximately\n\n[[Page H2306]]\n\n20,000 young children every year. In some States like Arkansas, Idaho, \nIndiana, and South Dakota, over 20 percent of children enter foster \ncare due to parent incarceration.\n  We also know that substance abuse underlies a substantial percentage \nof child welfare cases.\n\n                              {time}  1345\n\n  Aside from neglect, alcohol or other drug use is the number one \nreason for removal from the home. In 2014, over 77,000 youth were \nremoved from their homes due to drug abuse.\n  What is exciting is that we have strong, empirical evidence that \nworking with parents experiencing substance abuse significantly helps \nchildren and families experience fewer days in foster care, higher \nreunification rates, less recurrence of child maltreatment, and better \npermanency over time.\n  Neither the Senate nor the House CARA bill addresses this critical \nintersection of criminal justice, substance abuse, and foster care. \nYet, this intersection underlies the surging numbers in both the \njudicial and child welfare systems.\n  The Annie E. Casey Foundation, an amazing champion for foster youth, \njust released a report 2 weeks ago that recommended that judges \nconsider the impact on kids and families when making sentencing and \nconfinement decisions.\n  Our amendment is necessary to demonstrate congressional intent that \nthe Department of Justice improve our judicial system to decrease the \nhorrible family impact of incarceration that swells our child welfare \nsystem and undermines child well-being.\n  That is why over a dozen key child welfare advocates support our \namendment, including the American Public Human Services Association, \nthe American Psychological Association, Children's Defense Fund, \nChildren's Home Society of America, Child Welfare League of America, \nNational Association of Counsel for Children, National Foster Family-\nBased Treatment Association, National Foster Parent Association, North \nAmerican Council on Adoptable Children, Ray E. Helfer Society, Voice \nfor Adoption, and Zero to Three.\n  I urge support of our amendment that will do much to strengthen \nfamilies and improve child welfare.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering \nthis amendment, and I support it.\n  The opioid epidemic has victimized countless Americans, including the \nmost vulnerable among us--our children. We are all aware of the grim \nstatistics surrounding prescription opioid abuse by teenagers. However, \na young child who loses a parent to addiction is also a victim that \nneeds our help.\n  I support this effort, which will promote family unity while holding \ncertain offenders accountable and ensuring community safety.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume \nto the gentleman from Indiana (Mr. Young).\n  Mr. YOUNG of Indiana. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nIllinois for introducing this amendment, shedding light on one of the \nmost vulnerable populations affected by this national opioid epidemic: \nour children.\n  As communities, non-profits, and policymakers search for solutions to \naddress this harrowing drug epidemic, it is essential that we not lose \nsight of the children whose lives have been fundamentally and forever \naltered by this nationwide crisis.\n  Kids across the country are having their lives turned upside down. \nThey are watching parents taken into custody. They are forced to leave \nhomes, wondering whether they will ever be able to see their father or \nmother again. These are things children shouldn't have to worry about \nand shouldn't have to go through.\n  The national opioid epidemic has hit my home State of Indiana \nparticularly hard. A small Hoosier community of 4,300 was catapulted \ninto the spotlight last spring. We had over 190 Hoosiers diagnosed with \nHIV primarily due to intravenous drug use. It is a tragedy the CDC has \ncited as one of the worst documented HIV outbreaks among users in the \npast 2 decades.\n  This localized epidemic, similar to others across the country, is \nlinked to the use of a powerful painkiller, a very highly addictive \nopiate.\n  In addressing this nationwide problem, we are going to have to \novercome the negative stigmas of drug addiction. We need to treat these \nindividuals--and I say this literally--treat them as patients who need \nour encouragement and our support to get well.\n  That is what this amendment accomplishes. Under this amendment, \nthousands of children who would otherwise see their parent destined for \na prison cell will instead see the parent they love and depend on get \nthe treatment they need.\n  The need for this amendment is urgent. The Indiana Department of \nChild Services estimates 2,600 children had to be removed from homes \ndue to parental drug abuse in just a 6-month period that ended last \nMarch. That is a 71 percent jump from 2 years earlier.\n  We, as legislators, have a real responsibility to look out for these \nchildren.\n  When States develop a substance abuse treatment program that can be \nan alternative to incarceration, this amendment allows them to focus on \ntreating parents whose incarceration could result in their children \nlanguishing in an overwhelmed child welfare system. More than a dozen \nchild welfare organizations support this bipartisan endeavor.\n  I want to thank Mr. Davis, as I close here, and his staff for \ncollaborating with me and Jaymi Light in my office in order to ensure \nthat we can help this vulnerable population.\n  I ask my colleagues to support the amendment and help us ensure our \nmost vulnerable children are no longer caught up in this epidemic.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the \nbalance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Illinois (Mr. Danny K. Davis).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Ms. DelBene\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 2, line 14, strike ``and''.\n       Page 2, line 17, strike the period at the end and insert \n     ``; and''.\n       Page 2, after line 17, insert the following:\n       ``(F) a community-based substance use diversion program \n     sponsored by a law enforcement agency.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman \nfrom Washington (Ms. DelBene) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Washington.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a simple clarifying \namendment to ensure that State, local, and tribal governments can \ndevelop and implement community-based programs that have demonstrated \nsuccess in reducing recidivism and getting people the help that they \nneed. I am hopeful everyone in this Chamber can support it.\n  The growing epidemic of heroin use and prescription drug abuse is \nhaving a devastating effect on the health and safety of our families \nand our communities both in my home State of Washington and across the \ncountry.\n  The problem has become so severe that adults in the United States are \nnow more likely to die from a drug overdose than a car accident. With \nmore than 120 deaths occurring from drug overdoses in this country \nevery day--more than half of which are from prescription drugs--it is \nclearer than ever that Congress must take action.\n\n[[Page H2307]]\n\n  That is why I am so pleased to see my colleagues on both sides of the \naisle coming together to combat the epidemic of addiction. This \nlegislation represents an important first step. It authorizes much-\nneeded funding for the opioid abuse reduction programs that will expand \nsubstance abuse prevention and intervention efforts, boost resources \nfor law enforcement officers and first responders to administer \noverdose reversal drugs, improve substance abuse treatment for \nindividuals in the criminal justice system, and help prevent the \nillegal distribution of opioids in our streets.\n  Among the programs authorized under the bill are treatment \nalternative to incarceration programs, an important tool for law \nenforcement agencies in the fight against opioid abuse. My amendment \nsimply clarifies that this provision includes a model with demonstrated \nsuccess in Seattle and King County.\n  First launched in 2011, the Law Enforcement Assisted Diversion \nprogram, or LEAD, is a community-based pilot program that offers a \nhelping hand rather than jail time for those suffering from substance \nabuse.\n  According to an initial study, it successfully reduces recidivism by \nas much as 60 percent. Other cities have taken notice, with Santa Fe \nand Albany already working to implement the model in their communities.\n  Instead of arresting and prosecuting low-level drug offenders, we \nshould be supporting successful programs like LEAD that direct them to \nthe community-based services and help that they need.\n  My amendment will do just that. It will ensure resources are \navailable to expand successful models that are already working and make \na meaningful difference in addressing this crisis.\n  I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to support it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman from \nWashington for offering this amendment, and I support it.\n  This amendment clarifies that grant monies authorized by H.R. 5046 \ncan be used to fund community-based substance abuse diversion programs \nsponsored by law enforcement agencies.\n  There are a variety of programs across the country administered by \nState and local law enforcement and prosecuting agencies that offer \ndiversion to drug treatment and other services as an alternative to \nincarceration.\n  In my home State of Wisconsin, Treatment Alternatives and Diversion, \nor TAD, programs ``offer offenders the opportunity to enter and do \nvoluntary substance abuse treatment, case management, and other risk \nreduction services as a safe alternative to jail or prison confinement. \nDiverting nonviolent offenders into substance abuse treatment keeps \nthem out of jail and correctional facilities, thereby saving bed space \nand taxpayer dollars, as well as treating the underlying addiction that \nmay have influenced the commission of a crime or may contribute to \nfuture criminal behavior.''\n  These are precisely the types of treatment alternatives to \nincarceration programs that I believe should be eligible for funding \nthrough this new Department of Justice grant.\n  I thank the gentlewoman from Washington for working with us on \ndrafting the amendment.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in support of it.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman. I rise \nin support of her amendment. I also rise to state my unyielding support \nfor the underlying legislation introduced by my friend, Jim \nSensenbrenner from Wisconsin, literally an institution of statutory \nproduction in the halls of this Congress. I appreciate it.\n  This DelBene amendment would enable States and local governments to \nuse grant monies for treatment alternatives to incarceration programs, \nincluding community-based abuse diversion programs sponsored by a law \nenforcement agency.\n  H.R. 5046 authorizes the attorney general to make grants to State and \nlocal governments for the development, expansion, or implementation of \nopioid abuse treatment programs as an alternative to incarceration. \nThis amendment would expand eligibility for such grants to community-\nbased substance abuse diversion programs sponsored by a law enforcement \nagency.\n  The cooperation and involvement of local law enforcement agencies is \nan important component in any comprehensive effort to combat opioid \nabuse. Diversion programs can play a key role in improving outcomes and \nrehabilitating opioid drug offenders.\n  Diversion programs also benefit law enforcement by conserving law \nenforcement resources, judicial and penal resources, while enabling \npolice agencies and courts to focus on drug traffickers and other \nserious criminals.\n  Based on those facts, I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Ms. DelBENE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Washington (Ms. DelBene).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n               Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. DeSaulnier\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 3, line 21, insert after ``providing for'' the \n     following: ``interoperability and''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. DeSaulnier) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n\n                              {time}  1400\n\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, let me say how happy I am to be here in \na bipartisan spirit on this important issue of the opioid epidemic in \nthis country.\n  I rise, obviously, to support this particular amendment, and I thank \nmy colleague from Georgia (Mr. Carter) for being a partner in this \neffort.\n  Our amendment simply clarifies that grants authorized under this bill \nmay be used to develop multi-State interoperable Prescription Drug \nMonitoring Programs. PDMPs are one of the most important tools in the \nfight against prescription drug abuse.\n  All of us come here today from separate starting points. For me, like \nmany others, it was because of parents of children who were lost to \nthis epidemic.\n  Bob and Carmen Pack were constituents in an affluent suburb of San \nFrancisco, which is in my district and is formerly in my State \nlegislative district, who took their two young children, Troy and Alana \nPack, out for a walk to the local ice cream shop for a treat on a \nbeautiful Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately, a woman, who was later \nconvicted of abusing and doctor shopping for opioids and also of using \nalcohol, swerved across the street, killing Troy and Alana and almost \nkilling Carmen Pack, who was expecting at the time. Fortunately, she \nsurvived and had a child.\n  Bob, a software engineer, proceeded to put his energies into updating \nthe California PDMP to make it electronic, to make usable in realtime, \nand to make it effective in trying to control opioid addictions. He \npartnered with multiple attorneys general in California to see this \neffected.\n  As a State senator, I was able to partner with them to institute a \nprogram and fully fund CURES, the California PDMP that allows for the \nrealtime monitoring of prescriptions. It went from 13,000 users in the \ncourse of a year to over 200,000 users, and it is now fully \nimplemented.\n  One of the weak points of the CURE system in California is its \ninability to\n\n[[Page H2308]]\n\ncommunicate with other systems as they are developed around the country \nand the ability for people who abuse these products, including \norganized crimes, to go to other States. So it is important at this \npoint, as States start to develop these sophisticated but very cost-\neffective systems, that we establish them in such a way that they are \ninteroperable.\n  While doctors and pharmacies work hard to prevent anyone from filling \nunneeded orders, it is more difficult to stop doctor shopping by \nindividuals who visit multiple doctors and pharmacists in an attempt to \nobtain more opioids. Some individuals who are addicted will cross State \nlines--and, obviously, organized crime will do so--to avoid their \nStates' prescription drug monitoring systems. Unfortunately, many State \nprograms are not interoperable with neighboring States and do not \ncoordinate and share this information effectively.\n  To improve the success of these programs, our amendment explicitly \nstates that these funds can be used to promote interoperability and \ndata sharing between States. Our amendment is a small step towards \nimproving existing systems, and it will help States better understand \npatterns of interstate drug trafficking.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR (Mr. Westmoreland). Is there objection to the \nrequest of the gentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I thank the gentleman from California and the gentleman from Georgia \nfor offering this amendment.\n  This amendment makes a small but important change to H.R. 5046 to \nclarify that grants can be used to improve the interoperability of \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Programs, or PDMPs, which are a valuable \ntool in combating the opioid epidemic and have been established across \nthe country. This amendment will help medical practitioners see what \npotentially dangerous medications a patient has received in another \nState before writing a prescription.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to \nthe gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Carter).\n  Mr. CARTER of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank him for his support of what I consider to be a very important \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment to H.R. 5046 \nbecause Prescription Drug Monitoring Programs and their effectiveness \nare key to fighting prescription drug abuse in this country.\n  As a lifelong pharmacist and as the author of the Georgia \nPrescription Drug Monitoring Program while I was a member of the \nGeorgia General Assembly, I believe PDMPs are one of the most important \ntools in the fight against prescription drug abuse. To increase the \nsuccess of these programs throughout the country, interoperability and \ndata sharing between States is paramount.\n  I commend Chairman Goodlatte and the Judiciary Committee for their \nwork on this bill; but to continue the growth and the success of PDMPs, \ninteroperability should be included in any discussion to improve these \nsystems so States can better share information about patients and the \npatterns that occur with interstate prescription drug trafficking.\n  I thank the gentleman from California for his work on this important \nissue, and I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment.\n  Mr. DeSAULNIER. I thank Mr. Carter and my colleagues on the other \nside of the aisle for supporting this commonsense amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from California (Mr. DeSaulnier).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n           Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Bishop of Michigan\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Developing, implementing, or expanding a program \n     (which may include demonstration projects) to utilize \n     technology that provides a secure container for prescription \n     drugs that would prevent individuals, particularly \n     adolescents, from gaining access to opioid medications that \n     are lawfully prescribed for other individuals.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Michigan (Mr. Bishop) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Michigan.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. I thank the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee, Chairman Goodlatte, and Mr. Sensenbrenner, the chairman of \nthe Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, and \nInvestigations, for their leadership in bringing this bill to the floor \ntoday.\n  Mr. Chairman, I am also pleased to be here in the spirit of \nbipartisanship because, as you all know, this problem affects all \nMembers' districts. It is a problem that sheriffs and local law \nenforcement in my district deal with on a daily basis. Admittedly, my \namendment is not the silver bullet that will end this epidemic, but it \nis a commonsense step in the right direction, something we can take to \naddress the problem at its roots, which is within the home.\n  The National Institutes of Health estimates that 800,000 children \nbetween the ages of 12 and 17 try opioids for the first time each year \nand that 70 percent of the opioids obtained by kids are from their \nfamilies, friends, and relatives. It also found that 62 percent of kids \nsay prescription medicines are easy to get from their families' \nmedicine cabinets and that one in two kids, alarmingly, thinks pills \nare available everywhere.\n  In response to these statistics, my amendment would allow the State \nand local governments to invest in programs that utilize secure \ncontainers for prescription drugs. It is important to note that this \namendment does not mandate such programs; it merely makes available the \nopportunity should local governments voluntarily choose to take \nadvantage of the program.\n  While there may not be an easy fix to cure all of the alarming \nstatistics, there are things that we can do and have done. In fact, in \nthe 1960s, children were dying at an alarming rate from ingesting \nmedications that were not meant for them. Congress responded, and it \nresponded by passing the Poisoning Prevention Packaging Act of 1970, \nwhich requires child-resistant caps for a number of different \nmedications. That was the last time major changes were made to drug \ncontainers.\n  As we all know, technology has advanced significantly in every \ncategory since 1970. Today, new technologies exist that make it harder \nto steal medications out of the family medicine cabinet, but they are \nnot widely used. Secure containers, clearly, will not fix this problem, \nbut they will act as a deterrent to the source of the problem.\n  As a father of three, I know that kids face all sorts of pressures at \nschool and in their daily lives. Oftentimes, they don't respond in the \nappropriate way, and they sometimes give in to those pressures. That \ndoesn't make them bad kids, but we cannot continue to turn a blind eye \nin denial while it is happening. My amendment would allow for the \nimplementation and the development of a program that utilizes secure \ncontainers for prescription drugs.\n  This is a commonsense solution that addresses a problem at its \nsource. It is a common practice to lock up things that we deem valuable \nand that could be dangerous to others. We lock up our cars, we lock up \nour bikes, we lock the doors of our homes; some of us may\n\n[[Page H2309]]\n\neven lock the drawers of our desks or lock up valuables and weapons in \nsafe places in our homes. Therefore, it only makes sense when it comes \nto dangerous pills that are being stolen and that are leading us down \ndangerous paths to addiction, that we lock up these medicines and deter \nthem from being stolen in the first place.\n  This is not a mandate and it is not a directive for anyone to do \nthis. My amendment simply allows States and localities to utilize funds \nor programs that provide for secure containers. Again, it is not to be \nconsidered the be-all and end-all solution, but it is a genuine step in \nthe right direction to thwart this tragic epidemic.\n  I urge all Members to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the \ngentleman's amendment, though I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment authorizes \ngrants for programs to develop secure prescription drug containers to \nprevent individuals, particularly children, from gaining access to \nopioid medications that have been lawfully prescribed to others.\n  This amendment addresses a serious problem--the unauthorized access \nto or use of lawfully prescribed prescription opioid medications by a \nperson other than the individual for whom the drugs were prescribed.\n  The use of prescription opioid medications is controlled for a good \nreason. The misuse of such medications can have serious, even fatal, \nconsequences. Perhaps the most tragic situation is one in which a child \nfinds and, out of innocent curiosity, takes a prescription medication \nthat is in the home, with the drugs having been prescribed for a parent \nor other family member, and that person then suffers an overdose. This \namendment will help prevent this problem by providing funding for \nprograms that utilize technology to help develop secure containers for \nprescription drugs.\n  The advancement of such potentially lifesaving technology deserves \nour full support. For that reason, I urge my colleagues to support this \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may \nconsume to the gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte), the chairman of \nthe Judiciary Committee.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I commend the gentleman from Michigan for offering this \namendment and for his commitment to combating opioid abuse, including \njoining as an original cosponsor of H.R. 5046.\n  In a recent poll, 62 percent of American teenagers stated that \nprescription drugs are easy to get from the family medicine cabinet. \nAccording to the Drug Enforcement Administration, a full 70 percent of \nprescription drug medications that are obtained by adolescents are \nacquired from family, relatives, or friends.\n  According to the National Institute on Drug Abuse, of the 2.4 million \npeople annually who use prescription drugs nonmedically and for the \nfirst time, a shocking 800,000 are aged 12 to 17. Often, the drugs are \npilfered, which means a child or a visitor takes one or two from a \nbottle at a time in order to escape detection from a parent or a \nfriend.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment that addresses this \nproblem.\n  Mr. BISHOP of Michigan. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Michigan (Mr. Bishop).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Guinta\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, line 3, insert before the period at the end the \n     following: ``, including prevention and recovery programs''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New Hampshire.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of my amendment that I \nintroduced with my colleague, Congresswoman Kuster.\n  This amendment would add prevention and recovery programs to the list \nof allowable uses in this legislation.\n  While the opioid misuse and overdose epidemic is taking a terrible \ntoll on our Nation, with proper treatment and recovery support systems, \nindividuals can and do recover.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  Today, 23 million Americans are in recovery from substance use \ndisorders and are contributing to our society and to our economy.\n  In my home State of New Hampshire, over 430 people died of opioid \noverdose just last year. This number, unfortunately, is expected to \nrise in 2016.\n  By allowing prevention and recovery programs to receive this \nimportant grant money, individuals who need the long-term recovery \nsupport have a better chance of surviving and thriving as they beat \ntheir addiction.\n  Beyond the work that we are doing here in Congress, I would like to \nthank all of those heroes who are helping our communities to address \nthis widening crisis. Specifically, in New Hampshire, people like my \nfriend, Melissa Cruz, are among the many who are working behind the \nscenes to end this epidemic. Her work with Hope for New Hampshire \nRecovery to create another treatment and recovery center in our State's \nlargest city, Manchester, my hometown, is essential to getting addicted \nGranite Staters back on their feet for long-term success.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GUINTA. I yield to the gentleman from Wisconsin.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman for offering \nthis amendment.\n  As the gentleman knows, addiction treatment and recovery in a \nnoncriminal justice context are not within the Judiciary Committee's \njurisdiction and, therefore, were not included in H.R. 5046, as \nreported by the committee, since this bill establishes a grant program \nin the Department of Justice.\n  I do not oppose the amendment since I recognize that treatment and \nrecovery are important functions in addressing this epidemic. However, \nI would like to work with the gentleman in going forward to ensure that \ntreatment and recovery are appropriately tailored to DOJ functions or \nare otherwise addressed through appropriate grant programs, such as \nthose administered by the Department of Health and Human Services.\n  We must ensure that the grant programs to address the opioid epidemic \nare appropriately tailored to and administered by the Federal agencies \nwith expertise in the areas for which they will be awarding funding. \nOtherwise, we are not fulfilling our duty to use taxpayer dollars \nefficiently.\n  With that caveat, I support the amendment and urge my colleagues to \ndo the same.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nSensenbrenner) for his support in this area and appreciate his \nwillingness to continue to work in this arena. I certainly will \ncontinue to do that.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentlewoman from New \nHampshire is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Ms. KUSTER. Mr. Chairman, I thank Congressman Guinta for introducing \nthis amendment. As my partner and as co-chair of the Bipartisan Task \nForce to Combat the Heroin Epidemic, we appreciate his tireless work on \nthis issue. I also want to thank the authors of this important \nlegislation, Congressman Sensenbrenner and Congressman Conyers, for \nbringing forward the bill that\n\n[[Page H2310]]\n\nmakes such important progress in authorizing $103 million annually in \ngrants through the Department of Justice.\n  I am proud of the work that we are accomplishing here together this \nweek. But that being said, we have many areas in which we have an \nopportunity to improve upon the legislation on the floor. And one of \nthose areas is improved assistance for prevention, treatment, and \nlifelong recovery programs.\n  Substance use disorder can be a lifelong challenge, and those \nstruggling with this illness need access to the lifelong support \nrequired, just as we assist those with diabetes or heart disease.\n  This critical amendment makes a simple change that would allow the \ngrants authorized by this legislation to be used for prevention and \nrecovery programs. We must address this crisis in a holistic way that \nincludes efforts to treat addiction and strengthen lifelong recovery.\n  I urge my colleagues to pass this critical amendment and to pass the \nunderlying legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GUINTA. Mr. Chairman, I thank Chairman Goodlatte for his \nleadership and work in this area.\n  Prevention and recovery is incredibly important as we try to help \nthose who deal with substance abuse challenges and addiction \nchallenges, not just in New Hampshire, but around the country.\n  I would urge again support of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New Hampshire (Mr. Guinta).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Rothfus\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Developing, implementing, or expanding a program to \n     prevent and address opioid abuse by veterans.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) and a Member opposed each will control \n5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Pennsylvania.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank my friend from Wisconsin for his \nleadership on this very important piece of legislation, and the \nchairman and ranking member of the Judiciary Committee for working \ntogether to bring it to the floor today.\n  The United States is being ravaged by skyrocketing levels of \nprescription opioid and heroin abuse. This brutal epidemic accounted \nfor more than 28,000 American deaths in 2014. It is destroying families \nand devastating our local communities.\n  Tragically, our Nation's veteran population has been particularly \nhard-hit by this crisis. Veterans suffer significantly higher rates of \nopioid abuse than their civilian counterparts. And according to some \nestimates, the number of opioid use disorders among veterans has \nincreased 55 percent in the past 5 years. Worst of all, the death rate \nfrom opioid overdose among veterans is nearly double the national \naverage. Clearly our veteran population has a unique set of needs when \nit comes to dealing with addiction that must be addressed through \nspecialized programming. We need meaningful and evidence-based \nsolutions, including treatment for co-occurring illnesses, such as \ndepression and PTSD.\n  I have been working to help develop those solutions as part of the \nBipartisan Task Force to Combat the Heroin Epidemic and by holding a \nseries of roundtables with stakeholders in my district. I strongly \nbelieve that the legislation we are considering here today is another \nstep forward in that process.\n  Specifically, the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act will \ndirect $103 million in Federal funds toward abuse programs focused \nsquarely on addressing the opioid epidemic. By structuring this funding \nas a competitive grant program, the bill provides States and localities \nwith maximum flexibility to attack opioid abuse that is unique to their \ncommunities.\n  Among other things, States will be able to use the grant funds for \nvarious types of anti-opioid programs, including veteran treatment \ncourts. These specialized courts, which seek to divert veterans away \nfrom traditional justice systems and provide them with both treatment \nand tools for rehabilitation, are certainly worthwhile and should be \nsupported. But it is also my sincere hope that we can reach many \nveterans who are at risk of opioid or heroin abuse long before they \nenter our court system in the first place. And that is the goal of my \namendment.\n  Specifically, my amendment would expand the list of permissible uses \nfor funds from the newly created Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant \nProgram to include efforts to develop, implement, or expand programs to \nprevent and address opioid abuse by veterans. As currently drafted, the \nlegislation permits similar funding for efforts to prevent and address \nopioid abuse by juveniles. My amendment will simply ensure that the \nsame resources are available to treat our veterans.\n  We have a solemn obligation to stand with our veterans. It is the \nprinciple of solidarity. They stood for us; we need to stand for them. \nLet us keep that commitment today by ensuring that our veterans have \nthe resources and support they need to combat this horrible epidemic.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nSensenbrenner).\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from \nPennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for yielding and for offering this \namendment.\n  The amendment adds a purpose area to the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse \nGrant Program established under H.R. 5046, which would allow grantees \nto use funds awarded under the program to develop, implement, or expand \nthe program to prevent and address opioid abuse by veterans.\n  I strongly support programs to provide services to our Nation's \nveterans, who have done so much to protect our freedom and our way of \nlife. As the gentleman is no doubt aware, the underlying bill \nrecognizes that many veterans, particularly those who have been wounded \nin defense of our Nation, in a tragic irony, have become addicted to \nthe medications they were prescribed to deal with pain from their \nwounds of war. And the bill includes provisions supporting Veterans \nTreatment Courts and other mechanisms to provide services to veterans.\n  I would like to work with the gentleman going forward as we move to \nconference with the Senate to streamline the provisions in my bill with \nthe gentleman's amendment and to ensure that the bill contains \nappropriate, non-redundant provisions to protect our Nation's veterans.\n  I support the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the same.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Wisconsin (Mr. \nSensenbrenner) for his work on this important legislation.\n  To close, I simply urge my colleagues to support this commonsense \namendment to ensure that the funds provided in this legislation can be \nused for programs that will provide direct assistance to our veterans \nin the fight against opioid and heroin abuse.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, although \nI don't oppose the underlying amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman is recognized for \n5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. Mr. Chairman, this amendment would expand the \nlist of eligible grant uses for the new program under H.R. 5046 to \ninclude efforts to develop, implement, or expand a program to prevent \nand address opiate abuse by veterans. This amendment would add programs \nfor veterans to prevent and address opiate abuse to the list of grants \nauthorized under H.R. 5046.\n  The bill creates a grant program geared toward addressing opiate \nabuse. As currently drafted, the bill defines eight areas of uses for \nwhich grants may be awarded.\n  This amendment makes clear that veterans programs are among the \npurposes for which the grants may be used. Our veterans have sacrificed \nfor us, and we should take appropriate\n\n[[Page H2311]]\n\nsteps to assist those veterans who suffer from opiate abuse and heroin \nabuse.\n  I support this amendment and I encourage my colleagues to support it.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  The Acting CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment to H.R. 5046 \nto include drug take-back programs in the list of funds made available \nunder the bill's Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program.\n  The Centers for Disease Control reports that healthcare providers in \nthe U.S. write 259 million prescriptions for opioids a year, enough for \nevery American adult to have their own bottle of pills.\n  In Massachusetts alone, 4.4 million opioid prescriptions, including \n240 million pills, capsules, or tablets were dispensed in 2014. \nFurther, nearly half of the people in my State report that it is too \neasy to get prescription opioids from those who have leftover pills. \nAnd the people who share these leftover pills are usually unaware of \nthe significant dangers that they represent.\n  The National Institute on Drug Abuse reports that nearly 4 in 5 \npeople addicted to heroin say their habit began by misusing \nprescription medications. Over half of those people report they got \ntheir prescription painkillers from a friend or a relative for free. \nAnd this includes adolescents.\n  My amendment would help give these people ways to stop their problem \nbefore it starts. More than ever, communities need to supply safe \ndisposal services to their residents to get excess pills out of the \nhands of people who don't need them. My amendment would make sure that \nour communities have access to the resources they need to do so.\n  The American Medical Association recognizes this point in its strong \nsupport of drug take-back programs, and the FDA has published \ninformation regarding proper disposal of unused medications as well.\n  When I was a district attorney, I worked with local and State police \nto combat the flow of drugs coming into our neighborhoods. Yet, as the \npublic supported these efforts to keep dangerous drugs off the streets, \nthey didn't realize that the greatest supply of these dangerous drugs \nwas sitting in their own medicine cabinets.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank Chairman Goodlatte and Chairman Sensenbrenner. I \nalso thank my colleagues--Mr. Rothfus, Mr. Blumenauer, Dr. Roe of \nTennessee, and Mr. Bera--for cosponsoring this amendment and joining me \nin this effort to add a commonsense step toward solving this important \npublic health epidemic.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I appreciate the gentleman's courtesy, and \nI strongly support everything he just said. We are in a situation today \nwhere we have a massive epidemic of opioid abuse. We are prescribing it \nin unimaginable volumes, and many times people are getting supplies \nthat are far more than they need.\n  We are finding that young people, in particular, 62 percent of teens \nwho abuse prescription drugs do so because they are easy to get from a \nparent's medicine cabinet or from a medicine cabinet of a neighbor or a \nfriend or people who break into homes. We need to have a systematic \neffort to be able to safely dispose of drugs.\n  One of the problems in some cases is people are flushing them down \nthe toilet. As a result, we are finding in our water supply traces of \nthese medications. We are slowly medicating the American population. \nThat itself is extraordinarily dangerous, and it is expensive for our \nwater treatment systems.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chair, I yield an additional 15 seconds to the \ngentleman.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Chair, I hope this is a first step for us to have \na systematic effort at the Federal level to be able to support these \nimportant programs to keep it out of the medicine cabinets and out of \nthe sewer systems.\n  I have introduced legislation that would provide a tax credit for \nproviders to be able to provide these services. I hope that we can \ncontinue this conversation going forward.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from California (Mr. Bera).\n  Mr. BERA. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank my colleagues. I would \nalso like to thank my colleague and fellow physician, the gentleman \nfrom Tennessee (Mr. Roe), for partnering with me on the Dispose \nResponsibly of your Pills Act, the DROP Act.\n  As a doctor, I have seen firsthand the devastation that misused \nprescription drugs can have on families. Deb Simpson, from Sacramento \nCounty, shared her family's story with me. Her son became addicted to \nprescription medications he found in the family's medicine cabinet. By \nthe time Deb realized what was happening, he was already addicted. \nThankfully, through help and rehabilitation facilities, her son \nrecovered, but far too many families suffer the tragic loss of a child \nor a loved one. We can easily prevent this. Let's make it easier to \ndispose of medications by supporting this simple amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim the \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. Keating) and the gentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Rothfus) for \noffering this amendment, and I support it.\n  According to the Office of National Drug Control Policy, more \nAmericans are now dying every year from drug overdoses than in car \naccidents, and a majority of those overdoses involve prescription \nmedications. In 2012, healthcare providers wrote 259 million \nprescriptions for opioid pain medications, enough for every American \nadult to have a bottle of pills.\n  In 2010, the House Committee on the Judiciary and Committee on Energy \nand Commerce shepherded through Congress the Secure and Responsible \nDrug Disposal Act, which amended the Controlled Substances Act to allow \npatients to legally return unused or expired prescription drugs to \nlocal pharmacies, police stations, and community drug disposal \nprograms.\n  That same year, the Drug Enforcement Administration began hosting \nNational Prescription Drug Take-Back events. At the previous 10 take-\nback day events, over 5.5 million pounds of unwanted, unneeded, or \nexpired medications were surrendered for safe and proper disposal. On \nApril 27, I was pleased to host, along with Committee on Appropriations \nChairman Rogers, a drug take-back event here on Capitol Hill.\n  At this year's National Take-Back Day, held on April 30, Americans \ndisposed of more unused prescription drugs than during any of the \nprevious 10 events. The DEA and over 4,200 State, local, and tribal law \nenforcement agencies collected 893,498 pounds of unwanted medicines, \nabout 447 tons, at almost 5,400 sites spread through all 50 States, \nsurpassing the previous high of 390 tons in the spring of 2014.\n  This amendment will allow grant funds to be used to sponsor these \nimportant drug take-back events. I urge my colleagues to support the \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Pennsylvania \n(Mr.\n\n[[Page H2312]]\n\nRothfus), a lead sponsor of this amendment.\n  Mr. ROTHFUS. Mr. Chair, I thank the chairman. I also want to thank my \ncolleagues, particularly the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. \nKeating), my friend, for inviting me to work with him on this important \namendment, which adds drug take-back programs to the list of authorized \nuses under the Comprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program created by this \nlegislation.\n  While prescription drugs can be lifesaving when used properly, they \ncan also be harmful and even lethal if they end up in the wrong hands. \nAs recognized by Mr. Keating, unused prescription medications can pose \na real safety concern and public health risk, particularly in homes \nwith children. These unused drugs can be accidentally ingested, stolen, \nor misused, which is why it is absolutely essential that we take \nappropriate steps to provide both a safe and responsible means of \ndisposing of them. This amendment ensures that Federal grant funds can \nbe used for that purpose.\n  I believe this is a positive step and will offer real benefits in \nreducing accidental overdose deaths. For that reason, I urge my \ncolleagues to support this important amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Roe), a sponsor of the amendment.\n  Mr. ROE of Tennessee. I thank the chairman for yielding. I rise in \nsupport of this amendment.\n  Prescription drug abuse is a growing problem throughout the United \nStates, particularly in east Tennessee, where I live. There is no \nquestion that a significant source of the supply for prescription drug \nabuse is unused prescriptions. We need to do everything possible to \nencourage the safe disposal of drugs that may be ripe for abuse.\n  I worked with the gentleman from California (Mr. Bera), my friend, on \na bill to establish a grant program to fund programs to help law \nenforcement agencies, pharmacies, narcotic treatment programs, \nhospitals, clinics, and long-term care facilities to properly dispose \nof outdated or unused prescription medications. I am pleased that the \npassage of this amendment will create a similar funding stream.\n  Currently there are no existing grants available for programs to \nproperly dispose of prescription drugs, and I believe this effort could \nhelp curb the widespread prescription drug abuse we are seeing \nthroughout the country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Lynch\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 4, after line 3, insert the following:\n       ``(9) Developing, implementing, or expanding a program to \n     ensure the security of opioids in medical facilities.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, first, I would like to commend Chairman Bob \nGoodlatte and Mr. Sensenbrenner, as well as Mr. Conyers and Mr. \nJohnson, for their effort in bringing this important bill to the floor.\n  I rise today in support of my amendment to H.R. 5046, the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Reduction Act of 2016. Mr. Chairman, my \namendment, if adopted, will allow grants authorized under the \nunderlying bill to provide for developing, implementing, or expanding \nprograms to ensure security and custody of opioids at medical \nfacilities.\n  The issue of abuse of prescription painkillers is not a new one, but \nthe rise of this epidemic has really been fueled by the increased \nstrength of and proliferation of these addictive drugs. It is well \ndocumented that the road to the use and abuse of an illicit opioid drug \nlike heroin frequently begins with the legitimate use or diverted use \nof prescription opioid painkillers like OxyContin or Vicodin.\n  Through a variety of ways, these powerful drugs end up in the hands \nof individuals struggling with their disease. One of the most frequent \nways that these drugs make it to the street is after they have been \nstolen from a medical facility in which they are stored for legitimate \nuse.\n  In the wake of our nationwide prescription drug abuse epidemic, these \ndrug diversion crimes have increased across the country. I will give \nyou a few examples, but there are many.\n  At a Georgia hospital, according to the Georgia Board of Pharmacy \nconsent order, a theft scheme lasted for more than 4 years and diverted \nmore than 1 million doses of controlled drugs.\n  In my own district at home, two nurses at the Massachusetts General \nHospital diverted nearly 16,000 pills, mostly OxyContin, resulting in \nthe hospital paying a $2.3 million fine.\n  In New York, a doctor stole 200,000 pills of oxycodone with a $5.6 \nmillion street value.\n  In Utah, at the Utah VA, a pharmacist there stole 7,000 units of \nprescription drugs for sale on the street.\n  I am not criticizing these institutions. I am merely underscoring \nthat the addictive nature and the power of these drugs is really \ndriving these crimes. I am just trying to underscore that there is a \nneed to address the drug diversion issue.\n  The Controlled Substances Act requires that registrants notify the \nDrug Enforcement Agency in writing of a theft or significant loss of \nany controlled substance, but we need to try to prevent the diversion \nof these drugs and work together to improve and strengthen the systems \nin place to deter the thefts that put these addicts in this position \nand put the addictive drugs on the street.\n  If adopted, my amendment will help do that. My amendment will give \nStates and local governments the resources to work with their hospitals \nand community health centers, physician clinics, and treatment \nfacilities to identify areas in which they can improve the security and \ncustody of these prescription drugs. By regularly reviewing best \npractices and updating protocols and existing systems, we can keep \nthese drugs secure and save some lives in the process.\n  The Commonwealth of Massachusetts and the cities I represent and \nothers across the country are combating this effort from all sides. My \namendment is another tool in the toolbox. Quite simply, we need to do \neverything we can to keep these drugs off the street.\n  I urge my colleagues to support my amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition to the \namendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Virginia is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  I first want to commend the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch) \nfor his support of this underlying bill and for his sincere desire to \nimprove the bill.\n  While I appreciate that desire to ensure that opioids are secured \nappropriately in medical facilities, that is the responsibility of the \nDrug Enforcement Administration, and there are already rigorous \nstandards in place to ensure this. So I must oppose the amendment as \nbeing duplicative and causing waste of resources and diverting some of \nthe resources provided under this bill from some of the other good \npurposes that are already provided for in the bill. The amendment \ncreates a new grant purpose area for developing, implementing, or \nexpanding a program to ensure the security of opioids in medical \nfacilities.\n  The DEA regulations set forth extensive physical security \nrequirements for the transportation, storage, and dispensing of opioids \nand other narcotic prescription drugs. The DEA regulations also place \ntight restrictions on which individuals can access and handle these \ndrugs.\n\n[[Page H2313]]\n\n  The responsibility for regulating and enforcing the rules governing \nthe distribution and storage of schedule II and schedule III narcotics, \nincluding opioids, lies with the DEA, and it is not a task that can be \nundertaken by a grant recipient through the program created by H.R. \n5046.\n  For these reasons, I must oppose the amendment; although, I would say \nto the gentleman that, if he would like to withdraw the amendment, as \nwe move to conference with the Senate, I would be happy to undertake \nhis concerns and see if there was some other way to work to incorporate \nthem into the bill that we ultimately send to the President's desk.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I have great respect for the gentleman from \nVirginia, and I applaud him on the great work he has done here. \nHowever, I started up an adolescent rehab center because of the huge \nproblem I have got in my district with young people. I understand this \nbill is focused on veterans as well. That is another very vulnerable \npopulation, with our folks coming back after multiple tours, but I \nreally feel strongly about the need for securing these opioids.\n  I have got a lot of hospitals in my district. We are having problems \nwith the clinics and hospitals. This is really a problem that we all \nown and not just the DEA. So I would have to insist on my amendment and \nask Members to support it.\n  Mr. Chairman, may I inquire how much time I have remaining.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Massachusetts has 2 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I yield such time as he may consume to the \ngentleman from Georgia (Mr. Johnson).\n  Mr. JOHNSON of Georgia. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of the Lynch amendment. It expands \nthe list of eligible grant uses for the grant program created by H.R. \n5046 to include programs that ensure the security of opioids in medical \nfacilities.\n  This amendment would add programs that ensure the security of opioids \nin medical facilities to the list of grant uses authorized under H.R. \n5046. Maintaining opioids securely in medical facilities protects the \npublic by helping to ensure that the drugs will not fall into the hands \nof individuals who will use them or sell them improperly or illegally.\n  If State or local governments wish to take steps to better secure \nthese facilities, grant funding under this program should be available \nto them.\n  Therefore, I support the amendment.\n  Mr. LYNCH. In closing, Mr. Chairman, there is a gap out there in \nterms of the security and custody of these opioids within medical \nfacilities. I am trying my best, just as the chairman is trying his \nbest, to address the problem that we have in our districts. It is a \nreal problem.\n  So it is a great bill. There is just this one gap, and I am trying to \nclose that.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's dedication to the issue. However, \naccording to the DEA, the vast majority of diversion does not occur \nbecause employees are stealing drugs from hospitals or distribution \ncenters. The vast majority of diversion occurs through the \noverprescribing of opioid pain medication.\n  Is this amendment intended to prevent pharmacy robberies? Who is the \ngrantee that the gentleman believes will be able to do what this \namendment contemplates?\n  Given the limited resources available, I very strongly believe \ngrantees must use their money for the most appropriate and efficient \npurposes available and not for a purpose that is already covered by the \nstrict regulations administered by a Federal agency.\n  So I oppose the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Lynch).\n  The question was taken; and the Acting Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. LYNCH. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further \nproceedings on the amendment offered by the gentleman from \nMassachusetts will be postponed.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Israel\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 7, strike lines 3 through 7, and insert the following:\n\n     ``SEC. 3024. EQUITABLE DISTRIBUTION OF FUNDS.\n\n       ``In awarding grants under this part, the Attorney General \n     shall ensure equitable distribution of funds based on the \n     following:\n       ``(1) The geographic distribution of grants under this \n     part, taking into consideration the needs of underserved \n     populations, including rural and tribal communities.\n       ``(2) The needs of communities to address the problems \n     related to opioid abuse, taking into consideration the \n     prevalence of opioid abuse and overdose-related death in a \n     community.''.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Israel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I rise today to offer a commonsense, \nbipartisan amendment that I think will have significant impact on the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from West Virginia (Mr. McKinley) and \nthe gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. Mullin) for working with me on this.\n  This amendment basically would direct the Attorney General, when \nawarding grants, to consider the prevalence of opioid abuse and opioid-\nrelated overdoses in a community.\n  The underlying legislation already properly ensures an equitable \ngeographic distribution of funds. This amendment simply makes sure that \nthe areas hardest hit by the epidemic are getting the resources that \nthey need.\n  I happen to represent Suffolk County on Long Island in New York. We \nhave suffered with more opioid and related deaths than any other county \nin my State. Between 2009 and 2013, 334 people lost their lives to \nheroin or opioids. By comparison, Brooklyn, which has 1 million more \nresidents, had only one-half the number of opioid deaths in the same \ntime.\n  Treatment admissions for opioid addiction on Long Island rose from \n12,887 in 2010 to 16,681 in 2014. That is a 29 percent increase. These \nare percentages and statistics, Mr. Chairman, and all of us in this \nbody know how this epidemic is affecting real lives.\n  Just over 2 weeks ago I met with students from Half Hollow Hills High \nSchool West's One World Youth Organization. I met with a young woman \nnamed Alexa Wasser. She shared with me that her brother, Zachary \nWasser, died of an overdose in January at 23 years old.\n  He was friendly. He was outgoing. He loved to spend time with his \nfamily. He was a good kid who got caught up in an epidemic that is \nimpacting way too many Long Island families and way too many American \nfamilies, so much so that they have nicknamed the Long Island \nExpressway the ``Heroin Highway.''\n  Mr. Chairman, for the sake of the Wassers and for the hundreds of \nLong Island families whose lives have changed forever, I urge support \nfor my amendment and I urge passage of the underlying bill. I again \nwant to thank my colleagues on both sides of the aisle for their \ncooperation and support for this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition even \nthough I do not oppose the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from Virginia is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, as we have said repeatedly, the opioid \nepidemic affects every Member's district,\n\n[[Page H2314]]\n\nevery region of our country, and every socioeconomic level.\n  In order to ensure these grants are dispensed broadly, as is needed, \nthe underlying bill includes language requiring the Attorney General to \nalso consider the needs of rural and tribal communities in making \ngrants.\n  This amendment builds upon that requirement by directing the Attorney \nGeneral to also consider the prevalence of opioid abuse and overdose-\nrelated deaths in a community. This is a good amendment which will help \nensure these grant funds reach across the Nation and are directed where \nthey will help the most.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from Oklahoma (Mr. \nMullin), a strong supporter of this amendment and the underlying \npurpose.\n  Mr. MULLIN. Mr. Chairman, I rise today in support of my colleague's \namendment to this important bill.\n  This amendment would make sure that rural and tribal areas receive \nthe funding they need to combat the growing drug use epidemic.\n  My district is very rural. My district also has two of the five \ncounties in the entire State that have the highest rates of \nunintentional painkiller overdoses.\n  In 2014, Oklahoma had the 10th highest drug overdose rate in the \nNation and more people died from unintentional overdoses than in car \ncrashes.\n  Rural areas have some of the highest overdose death rates in the \nentire country, and this is a growing epidemic. We must ensure that \nthese rural areas are getting the tools they need.\n  This is why I am offering this amendment with my colleagues, Mr. \nIsrael and Mr. McKinley, to ensure that rural and tribal areas receive \nthe proper Federal drug abuse prevention efforts they deserve.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I again want to commend the chairman, the \ngentleman from Oklahoma, and the gentleman from West Virginia for their \ncooperation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentleman from New York (Mr. Israel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n         Amendment No. 11 Offered by Ms. Clark of Massachusetts\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 \nprinted in part B of House Report 114-551.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the \ndesk.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Add at the end of the bill the following:\n\n     SEC. 6. GAO STUDY AND REPORT ON DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE \n                   PROGRAMS AND RESEARCH RELATIVE TO SUBSTANCE USE \n                   AND SUBSTANCE USE DISORDERS AMONG ADOLESCENTS \n                   AND YOUNG ADULTS.\n\n       (a) Study.--The Comptroller General of the United States \n     shall conduct a study on how the Department of Justice, \n     through grant programs, is addressing prevention of, \n     treatment for, and recovery from substance use by and \n     substance use disorders among adolescents and young adults. \n     Such study shall include an analysis of each of the \n     following:\n       (1) The research that has been, and is being, conducted or \n     supported pursuant to grant programs operated by the \n     Department of Justice on prevention of, treatment for, and \n     recovery from substance use by and substance use disorders \n     among adolescents and young adults, including an assessment \n     of--\n       (A) such research relative to any unique circumstances \n     (including social and biological circumstances) of \n     adolescents and young adults that may make adolescent-\n     specific and young adult-specific treatment protocols \n     necessary, including any effects that substance use and \n     substance use disorders may have on brain development and the \n     implications for treatment and recovery; and\n       (B) areas of such research in which greater investment or \n     focus is necessary relative to other areas of such research.\n       (2) Department of Justice non-research programs and \n     activities that address prevention of, treatment for, and \n     recovery from substance use by and substance use disorders \n     among adolescents and young adults, including an assessment \n     of the effectiveness of such programs and activities in \n     preventing substance use by and substance use disorders among \n     adolescents and young adults, treating such adolescents and \n     young adults in a way that accounts for any unique \n     circumstances faced by adolescents and young adults, and \n     supports long term recovery among adolescents and young \n     adults.\n       (3) Gaps that have been identified by officials of the \n     Department of Justice or experts in the efforts supported by \n     grant programs operated by the Department of Justice relating \n     to prevention of, treatment for, and recovery from substance \n     use by and substance use disorders among adolescents and \n     young adults, including gaps in research, data collection, \n     and measures to evaluate the effectiveness of such efforts, \n     and the reasons for such gaps.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 2 years after the date of \n     enactment of this Act, the Comptroller General shall submit \n     to the appropriate committees of the Congress a report \n     containing the results of the study conducted under \n     subsection (a), including--\n       (1) a summary of the findings of the study; and\n       (2) recommendations based on the results of the study, \n     including recommendations for such areas of research and \n     legislative and administrative action as the Comptroller \n     General determines appropriate.\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 720, the gentlewoman \nfrom Massachusetts (Ms. Clark) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Massachusetts.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the \ngentleman from Virginia for his work and leadership on the underlying \nbill.\n  We know that addiction does not wait until adulthood. A majority of \nadults in substance use treatment start using before turning 18.\n  My amendment would direct the GAO to study research and programs \ncarried out by the Department of Justice and its grantees and report on \nthose programs' findings and work regarding substance use and substance \nuse disorders among adolescents and young adults.\n  The amendment would require GAO to report on any gaps in the research \naround adolescent and young adult substance use that have been \nidentified by experts or Department of Justice officials.\n  We need to understand what extended opioid use means for young brains \nand how it affects development and growth. We also need to understand \nhow early exposure to opioids might change young people's needs with \nrespect to treatment and support on the road to recovery.\n  I would like to tell you about a constituent of mine named Chip. Chip \nwas an athlete. He excelled at hockey and baseball. Playing sports was \nextremely important to him. But then, in eighth grade, he started \ndrinking. Shortly after, drugs entered the picture, and Chip stopped \ncaring about everything.\n  As a young husband and father by the time he was 22, Chip always felt \nlike something was missing. Anytime there was a problem, Chip reached \nfor drugs as a solution. He received two OUIs in 1 year. He lost his \nlicense. He lost his family. He overdosed on heroin and became \nhomeless.\n  The addiction ruined his life and devastated anyone who cared for \nhim. It was only when serving a jail sentence for a third OUI that Chip \nfinally heard a recovering addict who came to speak to inmates, and for \nsome reason he connected.\n  Chip has been in recovery and has been clean and sober for 7 years. \nHe works today as a recovery coach in my district, walking together \nwith others with substance use disorder on the long road to recovery \nand a future.\n  We owe it to young adults like Chip who were successful, ambitious, \nand energetic before opioids to understand what happened to them and \nhow we can prevent it from happening to other adolescents and young \nadults. We owe it to them to understand how to help them seek and gain \neffective treatment.\n  The more information we can collect about how addiction begins in \nadolescents and how to treat young adults, the clearer we can see where \nthere are gaps in our understanding and the better chance we have of \ncombating this horrific epidemic.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I ask unanimous consent to claim \ntime in opposition, although I am not opposed to the amendment.\n  The Acting CHAIR. Is there objection to the request of the gentleman \nfrom Wisconsin?\n  There was no objection.\n\n[[Page H2315]]\n\n  The Acting CHAIR. The gentleman from Wisconsin is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for offering \nthis amendment.\n  The amendment directs the Government Accountability Office to study \nand report on Justice Department programs and research relative to \nsubstance abuse and substance use disorders among adolescents and young \nadults.\n  I share the gentlewoman's desire for additional information on the \nprograms available to combat the opioid epidemic. This is an \nappropriate piece of the legislative package.\n  Having said that, I am concerned that, as drafted, the amendment \nrequires the GAO to study things DOJ might not be doing and does not \nhave the expertise to do so effectively.\n  Specifically, the amendment directs the GAO to study and report on \nDOJ programs relative to substance abuse and substance use disorders by \nadolescents with no nexus to the criminal justice system.\n  I do not oppose the amendment, but I would like to work with the \ngentlewoman going forward to ensure the provisions of the amendment are \nappropriately tailored to the responsibilities and programs within the \nJustice Department's jurisdiction.\n  I urge my colleagues to support the amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Ms. CLARK of Massachusetts. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful to the \ngentleman from Wisconsin not only for the support of this amendment, \nbut for all the work and leadership he has shown around this issue.\n  We look forward to working with him to make sure this amendment is \ntailored to meet the needs of the underlying bill and to be in line \nwith the Department of Justice's work and research.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SENSENBRENNER. Mr. Chairman, I thank the gentlewoman for her \noffer of working together.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The Acting CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Massachusetts (Ms. Clark).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Chairman, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. \nHolding) having assumed the chair, Mr. Westmoreland, Acting Chair of \nthe Committee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported \nthat that Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. \n5046) to amend the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968 \nto authorize the Attorney General to make grants to assist State and \nlocal governments in addressing the national epidemic of opioid abuse, \nand for other purposes, had come to no resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2315-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2315]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1500\n                COMMUNICATION FROM THE DEMOCRATIC LEADER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following \ncommunication from the Honorable Nancy Pelosi, Democratic Leader:\n\n                                                   April 21, 2016.\n     Hon.

My father has read the 28 pages. Some of my \ncolleagues in the Congress have read the 28 pages; yet, still today, \nthe American people aren't able to read them.\n  As elected officials, we answer to the people. Adlai Stevenson said \nit best: ``As citizens of this democracy, you are the rulers and the \nruled, the lawgivers and the law-abiders, the beginning and the end.''\n  Mr. Speaker, no one has been able to answer the question of why is it \nnecessary to continue to hide the truth from the public, so it is time \nto allow all Americans to read the 28 pages and make up their own \nminds, as is their American right.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2319-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         CMS ON STATE EXCHANGES\n\n  (Mr. ALLEN asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. ALLEN. Mr. Speaker, thanks to a report by the House Energy and \nCommerce Committee, we now know that a top CMS official misled Congress \nduring a hearing that was investigating wasted funds on ObamaCare State \nexchanges. I have the report right here in my hand.\n  When ObamaCare was enacted, the President freely gave taxpayer money \nto States to establish these State exchanges. Since then, exchanges in \nOregon, New Mexico, Hawaii, Nevada, among others, have failed and \nbillions of taxpayer dollars have been squandered. I think I speak for \nthe American taxpayer when I ask: Where is all the leftover money?\n  My legislation, H.R. 4262, addresses this problem by establishing a \nplan to recoup Federal funds and, most importantly, protect American \ntaxpayers from having to pay back the balance.\n  Clearly, State exchanges are a mess if a CMS administrator cannot \nspeak correctly or accurately on them. Faulty State exchanges are not \ngoing away. It is a problem that is only just beginning, and it is \ngoing to get worse.\n  I thank the committee for their investigation, and I urge my \ncolleagues to support my legislation, the Transparency and \nAccountability of Failed Exchanges Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2319-2", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      CONGRATULATING HAROLD HAYES\n\n  (Mr. MICHAEL F.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nrecognize one of my constituents, Harold Hayes, who is retiring after \nmore than 35 years in broadcasting in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania.\n  Harold has a lifelong connection to the city of Pittsburgh. Born in \nMcKeesport, Harold went on to graduate from South Hills High School and \nthen from the University of Pittsburgh.\n  He joined KDKA-TV as a reporter in 1979, and he has been there ever \nsince, providing the people of southwestern Pennsylvania with solid, \nobjective reporting about the news that matters to them.\n  There is no doubt that Harold Hayes has served as Pittsburgh's \nreporter throughout his many years with KDKA. I want to commend Harold \nfor his contributions to our community, congratulate him on his \nretirement, and wish him all the best as he begins the next phase of \nhis life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize one of my constituents, Harold \nHayes, who's retiring after more than thirty-five years in broadcasting \nin Pittsburgh, PA.\n  Harold has a lifelong connection to the City of Pittsburgh. Born in \nMcKeesport, Harold went on to graduate from South Hills High School and \nthen from the University of Pittsburgh in 1975 with a Bachelor's degree \nin Speech and Communications. After graduation, Harold worked as a \nresearch assistant in the ``Reading is Fundamental'' program, sponsored \nby the Urban League of Pittsburgh.\n  In August of 1979, Harold joined KDKA-TV as a reporter, and he's been \nthere ever since, providing the people of southwestern Pennsylvania \nwith solid, objective reporting about the news that matters to them. \nSince joining the station, Harold has covered everything from military \noperations in the Middle East to landmark local court cases. He has \namassed an impressive portfolio of overseas coverage, including \nreporting on Operation Desert Shield in Saudi Arabia in 1990, the \ngovernment of Kuwait's memorial to the local lives lost during \nOperation Desert Storm in 1993, and the funeral of Pope John Paul II in \n2005.\n  Yet his touch has really been felt locally, not only reporting on the \nday-to-day lives of Pittsburghers, but even making sure to follow up on \nstories that made headlines years ago. For example, he covered the 1981 \ncourt desegregation order that resulted in the creation of the Woodland \nHills School District. Twenty years later, he found one of the students \nhe had interviewed back then, and discovered that the former student \nnow had a child who was about to graduate from Woodland Hills as well. \nIt is this type of dedication and compassion that has distinguished \nHarold from most other reporters in Pittsburgh for years.\n  Harold has covered both tragedy and triumph, as well as the personal \nstories of working people, Presidents, and protesters all with equal \ngrace, fairness, compassion, and his special dry sense of humor. Harold \nbrings both humility and perspective to his work every day, and because \nof that, has remained a consummate professional throughout his 37 years \nof work. He represents that high level of personal integrity and the \ndemanding work ethic that characterize the people of Southwestern \nPennsylvania. There is no doubt that Harold Hayes has served as \n``Pittsburgh's Reporter'' throughout his many years with KDKA. We will \nmiss Harold's presence on the air.\n  Harold represents the best that there is in broadcast journalism, and \nhe will be recognized for his contributions by the National Academy of \nTelevision Arts & Sciences in September when he will receive a Lifetime \nAchievement Award at a ceremony in Philadelphia, PA.\n  Harold's commitment to our community extends far beyond his career as \na newsman. He has also become a spokesperson for the Negro Educational \nEmergency Fund (NEED), and he created a scholarship in his mother's \nname for local students. In addition, he helps raise money for the Rev. \nJ. Harold Hayes Scholarship, named for his late father, a former pastor \nof Bethlehem Baptist Church in McKeesport.\n  I want to commend Harold for his contributions to our community, \ncongratulate him on his retirement, and wish him all the best as he \nbegins the next phase of his life.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2319-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2319]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            OPIOID ADDICTION\n\n  (Ms. McSALLY asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. McSALLY. Mr. Speaker, opioid addiction is an epidemic that is \ntearing our communities apart. This devastation is acutely felt by \nfamilies in southern Arizona, many of whom know all too well the pain \nof losing a loved one to an overdose. Nobody, no family, is immune.\n  A recent analysis showed that Pima County, which I represent, has an \noverdose rate twice as high as any other county in Arizona, which had \nthe 10th highest rate in the Arizona.\n  Southern Arizona's close proximity to the border exacerbates this \nproblem, as more and more opioids come flowing into our communities. \nReports show that, between 2010 and 2015, heroin seizures spiked by \nmore than 300 percent. Too many lives have been ruined by the tragic \nconsequences of opioid abuse, which is why we must act.\n  This week the House is voting on 18 bills that take steps such as \nlaunching medication and treatment intervention programs, expanding \nresources to evidence-based incarceration alternatives, and increasing \nthe availability of lifesaving overdose reversal drugs.\n  These are many important first steps to stopping the rise of opioid \naddiction, and I pledge to continue working to address this very grave \nand urgent issue.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2319-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2319-H2320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                          NATIONAL POLICE WEEK\n\n  (Mr. BRENDAN F.

Mr. Speaker, it is a special privilege to be able to \ncome to the floor and acknowledge the giants that live among us.\n  Today I want to honor a giant in my community, the 18th Congressional \nDistrict, which I have the privilege of representing. That giant's name \nis Carl Whitmarsh.\n  If one were to think of those like Franklin Delano Roosevelt, John F. \nKennedy, William Jefferson Clinton, President Obama, and many other \nleaders who invested in America, you would think of Carl Whitmarsh.\n  He invested in the process of democracy. He invested, yes, in the \nDemocratic Party because he was known as a democratic activist, but he \nhad a sincere heart, being one of the members of the Texas Young \nDemocrats.\n  But in the course of being a democratic person and an activist, Carl \nworked with one of the first African Americans to integrate the Young \nDemocrats in the name of Doris Hubbard. They worked together to say \nthat, in this Nation, we are all equal.\n  Yes, he was feisty. He was strong. He made us stand up and \nacknowledge our responsibilities of service. We lost him this past \nweekend.\n  I want to thank Mr. and Mrs. Schlett for the great work that they \nhave done to answer his need in the place he lived. I thank the \nSchletts for all they have done.\n  Let me thank all of his friends for all they have done. Certainly, he \nwas a friend of Hillary Clinton. He was a friend of mine and a friend \nof those who now mourn him.\n  So among those of us who count ourselves as activists, let me simply \nsay that he was a public servant and he believed in helping people.\n  Let me also give my sympathy to the Oak Forest Area Democrats and all \nof his friends and family. Because we know that not only is a voice of \ndemocracy silenced, but we realize that a person who loved all of us \nand loved life and was willing to share--that person is Carl Whitmarsh.\n  May he rest in peace. We have lost you, but not your spirit, your \nmemory, and your legacy.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2320-3", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              PLANNING 2.0\n\n  (Mrs. LUMMIS asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LUMMIS. Mr. Speaker, today in the Natural Resources Committee \nhere in the House we heard testimony about how the Bureau of Land \nManagement's Planning 2.0 rule might affect counties around this \ncountry that are dealing with Federal lands in their districts.\n  FLPMA, which is the Federal Land Policy Management Act, is a law that \nwas designed to give local government a lot of input especially in \ncounties where there is a tremendous amount of Federal land.\n  We heard today from counties that have 90 to 95 percent of their land \nowned by the Federal Government. They need input into what is going on \nin their districts. FLPMA contemplated that.\n  For Planning 2.0, the new proposed rule to change that and perhaps \neliminate some opportunities for local governments to have input into \nFederal land management decisions would be a huge mistake.\n  I ask the Bureau of Land Management to extend the time beyond the 30 \ndays they granted and allow 180 days for the time that local \ngovernments and other stakeholders are allowed to respond to the \nproposed new rule.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2320-4", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2320]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      REACHING OUT TO CONSTITUENTS\n\n  (Mr. MEEKS asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. MEEKS.

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentlewoman from New Jersey (Mrs. Watson Coleman) \nis recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on the subject of my Special Order.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from New Jersey?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN of New Jersey. Mr. Speaker, for what feels like \nthe first time this year, the House got to work on something that would \ngenuinely help millions of Americans: addressing the opioid crisis.\n  My home State of New Jersey is a perfect example of this epidemic in \nboth reach and financial impact. Four of every five new heroin users \nstarted their drug abuse addictions with a prescription opioid. By one \nestimate, New Jersey is now home to more than 128,000 heroin addicts.\n\n                              {time}  1645\n\n  In the past 10 years, heroin has claimed 5,000 lives in my State, and \nwe fall just short of the top 10 in the percent of healthcare costs we \nuse on those suffering with opioid addiction.\n  Opioids, both heroin and prescription painkillers, are driving the \nnational\n\n[[Page H2321]]\n\ncrisis of lethal overdose, with more than 60 percent of these deaths \nattributed to opiate abuse.\n  Many have called this an epidemic, and they are absolutely right. It \ndeserves our attention, and I applaud the bipartisan work we have done \nthis week.\n  But while we have taken a few vital steps, there are two very \nimportant things that I need my colleagues to understand. First, that \nalthough we have newly and rightly chosen to show those dealing with \nopioid addiction compassion and clemency, the only thing new about the \naddiction epidemic is its face.\n  The greatest spikes have been among White, suburban Americans, for \nwhom we are opening doors for treatment, rehabilitation, and \nalternatives to incarceration.\n  Meanwhile, communities of color have watched families arrested, \nconvicted, and imprisoned for decades over nonviolent drug offenses. \nAfrican Americans are three to four times more likely to be arrested \nfor drug crimes, and when these offenders go behind bars instead of to \ntreatment beds, it breaks families and has lasting, devastating impacts \non both families and communities.\n  We have now begun to take an evidence-based approach to drug abuse, \none that recognizes that arrest and long prison terms come at great \ncost and zero benefit. It is something that we should have done a long \ntime ago.\n  But now that we recognize the flawed policies of the past, we need to \nturn a critical eye to the victims of the older paradigm and offer them \nthe doors to rehabilitation that we have created for today's offenders.\n  There is a second vital step here, Mr. Speaker, without which all of \nour bipartisanship today would be meaningless. We have authorized a \nvariety of measures that have the potential to stop the advance of the \nopioid crisis, but without funding and continued review, our work will \nbe worthless.\n  States and local municipalities need new resources to combat this \ncrisis if we are going to make any kind of difference. That is why my \nDemocratic colleagues put forward a proposal that will provide $600 \nmillion in new funds specifically to fight opioids and heroin.\n  My colleagues on the other side of the aisle voted to block that \nproposal, which makes me concerned that they assume that the handful of \nauthorizations we have worked on will be enough.\n  With 78 Americans dying from opioid overdose every day, the American \npeople cannot afford for us to wash our hands of this issue without \nproviding the resources necessary to halt this epidemic for all of \nthose that are affected. We need to keep pushing forward.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to my colleague from Minnesota (Mr. Ellison), \nthe honorable chairman of our Progressive Caucus.\n  Mr. ELLISON. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding, and I \nalso want to lend my voice to hers as I stand here before you to say \nthat I was happy to vote for the legislation addressing opioid \naddiction today; sad that Republicans didn't support Democratic \ninitiatives, but overall happy with the work that has been done on this \nthis week.\n  I know many people fighting opioid addiction. It is debilitating. It \nis heartbreaking in the lives that it has ruined. And I think that \nthough the steps we took today were positive, we could have taken more.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to reflect upon an issue that is related to \nthis, but give a little historic perspective because I think that \nCongress' response to opioid addiction has, I think, in the main, been \ncommendable.\n  Unfortunately, if it were 20 years ago today, in the mid 1990s, \nperhaps the response of Congress then to crack cocaine was very \ndifferent.\n  The response to crack cocaine was massive incarceration. The effect \nof the crack cocaine epidemic was massive blanketing of police in \ncertain neighborhoods, front-end loaders in poor neighborhoods.\n  I hope that what this more humane, more medical-oriented response to \ndrug addiction represents is America learning how to deal with drug \naddiction because I think a more cynical person, not me, might say that \nbecause crack cocaine was associated with people who were African \nAmericans, a more harsh, police-oriented, prison-oriented response was \nwarranted and tolerable; and because opioid is more broad and affects \nthe majority community as well, that a more reasoned response is \nwarranted.\n  Thinking about people like Kemba Smith, who got 24 years in prison \nwhen she was a student at Hampton University. She never touched 1 gram \nof crack cocaine; had a boyfriend who was a drug dealer. He housed some \ndrugs in her house. She got convicted, ended up getting 24 years in \nprison.\n  Thank goodness President Clinton gave her a commutation, but ruined \nher life.\n  We now have about 2.4 million people in prison, many of them for \nnonviolent drug offenses, many who were arrested and given an enormous \namount of time in the crack cocaine wars of the 1990s.\n  I hope that the enlightened approach that we have now, which is not \nmarked with helicopters and front-end loaders and all types of \nweaponry, literally militarizing Black neighborhoods across the United \nStates back in the 1990s--I am glad that that is not the response we \nhave taken this time. I hope it means we have learned something, but I \nhope it also means that we go back and ask ourselves if some of the \nexorbitant sentences that people got, life sentences in some cases, 10 \nyears, 20 years, we revisit these; we look at mandatory minimums for \nsome of these offenders; that we look at how we have exploded massive \nprison rates all around crack, even though, in my opinion, crack and \npowder cocaine are basically the difference between ice and water. They \nare essentially the same chemical.\n  We incarcerate one much more severely than the other. One is used \npredominantly by Whites; the other, more Blacks are found in possession \nof it, and the rates of incarceration are dramatically different.\n  This Congress corrected a grievous injustice where we punished crack \ncocaine 100 times more severely than we did powder. We changed that to \n18 times more. That is improvement; it is not equality.\n  But I hope that today, the way we dealt with opioids, which I \nsupported and I voted for--because I do believe that we do need to have \nmore of a medical approach to drug addiction than the militarized, \npolice-oriented, incarceration-oriented measure that we have used in \nthe past--I hope that this new way of dealing with drug addiction is an \nadvance in our understanding rather than a reflection of who is being \nhurt.\n  I think that if we really want to demonstrate that it is a reflection \nof what we have learned, then we have some unfinished business to \nachieve because there are still a lot of people who are dealing with \nthe vestiges of mass incarceration and the war on crack cocaine.\n  Let me also just say that I remember being a young criminal defense \nlawyer in Minnesota, and I remember being in court when a courageous \nyoung judge named Pam Alexander, an African American female, found that \nthe difference between powder and crack cocaine sentencing was not \nwarranted by the facts or the evidence; in fact, amounted to an equal \nprotection violation under the Minnesota constitution.\n  To the credit of the Minnesota State Supreme Court, they upheld her \nruling, but Pam Alexander paid a heavy toll for her courageous judicial \nwork because she was nominated to be a Federal district judge. That was \nblocked by people who wanted to maintain the status quo, and she never \ngot to be a Federal district court judge.\n  Now, she is still a distinguished journalist, to the pride of us all; \nbut, you know, just showing that some people went to prison for this \nand others had their careers limited because of their willingness to \nspeak up against these equal protection problems.\n  So I just hope that today represents advancing our understanding \nrather than just the different treatment that different people \nhistorically have received in our country.\n  I definitely feel that I was proud to vote for the four measures \ntoday and enjoyed the debate and definitely was--my heart was in sync \nwith all of my colleagues when they were talking about some of the very \nhorrific problems that people suffer from opioid addiction. I am right \nthere with them and my heart is right there with them and my mind is \nright there with them.\n\n[[Page H2322]]\n\n  But I cannot get it out of my head about how differently we dealt \nwith the crack epidemic. According to the Center for Disease Control, \nBlacks and Whites use crack about the same rate. And yet, there were \nwhole jurisdictions in this country where there was literally no White \nperson being charged with crack possession, and there were African \nAmericans getting 5 years for a few grams, 10 years for a few more, and \ntheir lives absolutely devastated because of it.\n  I mentioned 2.4 million Americans behind bars. Much of this is driven \nby the war on drugs. There are 2.7 million children whose parents are \nbehind bars. When your parent goes to prison, it devastates family \nincome.\n  So I am just going to turn it back over; announce that I am proud of \nthe votes that I took in favor of addressing opioid addiction today; \nsay that I hope that it was because we learned something about the war \non drugs; say that we must go, sort of fix some of the overzealousness \nof the war on crack years in the 1990s; and say that I really hope that \nour sympathies don't return only in favor of people who look like us, \nbut to all Americans.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentleman from Minnesota. I \nappreciate the remarks that he has made and the issues that he has \nbrought before this body this evening, particularly his illuminating \nfor us and reminding us of the disparities of the criminal justice \nsystem, of the way we dealt with drug addiction in the past.\n  But we are in an enlightened period now, as evidenced by the work \nthat we did just today; and I hope that we look at the issue of drug \naddiction and those addicted in the same humane manner, even if it is \nnot an addiction to just heroin or an addiction to opiates, but it is \nan addiction to a drug that is harmful to their well-being.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn \nB. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I thank my good \nfriend, Representative Bonnie Watson Coleman, for hosting this Special \nOrder to talk about opioids and drug policies.\n  Our country is currently facing a great crisis. According to the \nCenters for Disease Control, 78 Americans die each day from an opioid \noverdose. We are in the midst of an addiction epidemic, an epidemic \nrobbing mothers and fathers of their children, and children of their \nfuture.\n  I cannot imagine the torture and hardship that not only those with \nthese addictions suffer, but their families and friends as well, seeing \ntheir loved ones in pain, unable to help them. But that does not have \nto be the case.\n  Congress can make a difference. Our actions here can help save lives, \nsave people from suffering and having to bury a loved one. But we \ncannot stop this epidemic with just congressional authorization of new \ngrant programs, studies, reports. We must fund these needed tools so \nthat communities have the resources they so desperately need.\n  Today the House passed, and I was proud to support the Comprehensive \nOpioid Abuse Reduction Act, a bipartisan bill creating the \nComprehensive Opioid Abuse Grant Program. And while I wholeheartedly \nsupport this new program, we have to make sure we provide the funding \nthat is necessary to get the program up and running.\n  This new program and any others we enact will be no help without \nfunding to support it.\n  Since 2000, there has been a 200 percent increase in the rate of \ndeaths attributed to opioids. This problem is only getting worse, and \nhas been for some time.\n\n                              {time}  1700\n\n  Our actions are already too late for the 28,000 lives lost just in \n2014.\n  The leading cause of accidental death in New York State is now an \noverdose. An estimated 886 lives were lost citywide in 2015. That is \n886 preventable deaths a year just in New York City, 886 individuals \nthat could still be here today had we acted sooner.\n  Last month, Mayor de Blasio announced a new $5.5 million plan to \ncombat deaths caused by overdose, building on the ThriveNYC initiative, \na program to support those suffering with mental health problems.\n  Actually, today, the first lady, Chirlane, was here in Washington \nmeeting with the delegation on the Thrive initiative on ways that we \nwere working in the city to combat the opioid epidemic.\n  Earlier this week, Governor Cuomo of New York launched a statewide \ntask force to face the heroin and opioid crisis in the State head-on. \nBut our States can't do it alone, and they shouldn't need to. This \nisn't a problem confined to one district, one State, or one section of \nthe country. It is a nationwide epidemic that cannot be allowed to \ncontinue unabated any longer.\n  We owe it to all those suffering, those addicted and their families, \nto show we recognize this problem and that we are working for them, not \nonly through our efforts, our votes authorizing these new programs \ntoday, studies, and reports, but through actually putting the necessary \nsupport behind these efforts and funding them.\n  We can and we must work to save lives. But all those votes are for \nnaught if we don't actually get these programs off the ground. \nCommunities across the country need our help, and the time to act is \nnow. We have already lost too many to this epidemic. I am proud of the \nvotes on the floor today in support of moving forward to do something \nabout it.\n  I thank the gentlewoman for her leadership and for yielding.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman from New \nYork.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to the gentlewoman from the great State of \nTexas, the Honorable Sheila Jackson Lee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I thank Congresswoman Bonnie Watson \nColeman for leading this Special Order and for bringing us together \naround two very important issues, not only this question of opioids, \nbut, as well, the question of the rights of women.\n  Let me say that this has been a week for news, news coming from the \nmost powerful lawmaking body in the Nation. As I heard a Member say in \nthe course of the debate on the list of opioids legislation, it is not \nthat we needed it, for the record is established through the \nCongressional Record, but that we would want to have those areas that \nare usually filled with media really take hold of what is being done on \nthe floor of the United States House of Representatives and, of course, \nthe complementary legislation of the other body.\n  Over the past 2 days, we passed legislation dealing with pregnant \nwomen, we passed legislation dealing with teenagers who lost their \nlives because of overdose of prescription drugs, and we passed \nlegislation that gave a whole litany under the Judiciary Committee not \nof mandatory minimums and mass incarceration, but how do we bring law \nenforcement and substance abuse counselors together? How do we provide \ntraining for police officers to use naloxone? How do we ensure that \nthere is training or resources for those who are addicted? How do we \nget parental training as it relates to individuals who are addicted and \ntheir children are addicted? How do we monitor the issuance of \nprescription drugs with the respect for the medical profession that we \nall have in doing their job?\n  Because we do realize that this prescription journey started with the \nnew approach to pain management that had been studied on an evidence-\nbased basis that you would heal better if you could allow the pain not \nto be so devastating, then, of course, what happens are many things: \nthe amount of prescription is more than you would need; or your \nchildren get ahold of it, or other people's children; or there is no \nplace to dispose of it.\n  In this discussion of opioids, I want it to be reflected that the \nCongress came together as Republicans and Democrats focusing on how we \nshould address this as a sickness and an addiction and not as \nincarceration and punitive sentencing.\n  We followed the beginning, in 2009, where we removed some of the \ndisparities between crack cocaine and didn't have it in this large, \nunfair basis where, if you had a little bit of crack you were in prison \nfor 400 years, if you had cocaine, you might skip by. We made that \nstep. But now it is 2016, and we made a metamorphic change because we \nmoved from the idea of mass incarceration to the idea of treatment.\n  When I finished the debate on the floor on the most recent Judiciary\n\n[[Page H2323]]\n\nCommittee bill authored by Mr. Sensenbrenner working with Mr. \nGoodlatte, Mr. Conyers, many Members, and me, I indicated that we \nmissed a period of history of the crack cocaine users. Many of them are \nlanguishing in prisons. So I am hopeful about this bipartisan spirit, \nas we look to sentencing reduction through H.R. 3713, for something \nmiraculous, because it includes retroactivity. Many of those crack \ncocaine users are nonviolent. We will have the ability as this \nlegislation works its way through Congress to include them in the \nscheme of treatment and the restoration part of what we are trying to \ndo in the lives of people who are sick and addicted.\n  I had someone come to me who said: Don't forget the meth users. We \nknow that meth was an epidemic--and still is--and how destructive it is \nto one's physical look and body.\n  So I am delighted to join my colleagues here to say that we did have \na newsworthy great week and that we were taking a look at opioids in a \ndifferent manner, that we are taking a look and working with physicians \nand the medical profession to be able to ensure that they do their work \nand that we find a way to provide a monitoring situation so that we can \nstem the tide of this horrific, horrible, and destructive drug \naddiction that destroys the lives of so many young people.\n  I close by saying that some years ago, my late mother was in the \nhospital. We know how we treat our parents--but our mothers. I was \nflying back and forth from this House checking and determining what her \ncondition was. She had so many moments where she was on the brink but \nshe came on back.\n  One of the moments that I came to the hospital, there was erratic \nbehavior. It wasn't my mother. That is the issue that we want. We want \npeople to be explained to as to what is going on. It was a treatment \nthat was dealing with trying to ease her pain.\n  I had to ask them: What is she using?\n  Percocet.\n  The first time that I heard that word was 6 years ago--or even later, \nbeyond 6 years. That was 2010, so it was even earlier than that. I \ndidn't know the ramifications of Percocet. I am a lawyer and not a \ndoctor. But I realize that whatever it was, the cure was worse than the \ndisease, and I asked them to take my mother off the Percocet and for me \nnever to see that again.\n  Now, how many families do that?\n  She did get off of it. Thank God, she healed and walked out of that \nhospital. That wasn't the time that she passed. She lived for another \nday.\n  But we need, in this opioid discussion, as we are moving against mass \nincarceration, to explain to families and physicians to talk about what \nthese painkillers can do. Because, in essence, they are sometimes so \ntoxic that they, in many instances, easily cause addiction, as I have \nheard many parents say about their youngsters who had athletic \ninjuries.\n  So I thank the Congresswoman for yielding to me because I think this \nweek has been a magnificent week when we have opened the door and \nkicked the can not down the road, but we have kicked it to open the \ndoor to say to all of us in America that it is okay. Addiction can be \ncured. But we are going to work alongside of you so that you can openly \nseek that cure to relieve yourself of addiction, and we are not going \nto direct you down the path of incarceration and mandatory minimums. I \nwant that for those who are languishing and who have been sentenced on \ncrack cocaine, and I am looking forward to working so that legislation \ncovers that aspect of those who are still incarcerated.\n  With that, I thank the gentlewoman for yielding to me, and I thank \nthe gentlewoman for her leadership.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlewoman for always \nsharing with us in our Special Order Hour her wisdom, experience, \nunique observations, recommendations, and proposals. I thank the \ngentlewoman very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me add just one more thought to this topic.\n  This week we demonstrated that bipartisanship is still possible on \nissues that matter to the American people. We need to take that same \nspirit and apply it to the countless other issues that have always been \nbipartisan. Restoring the Voting Rights Act, for one; addressing the \nsignificant dangers of a virus, in this instance, of the Zika virus is \nanother illustration; and passing a budget that creates jobs and grows \npaychecks for American workers.\n  As we now shift topics here, Mr. Speaker, there is another issue that \nthis body has been avoiding for decades. A few months ago, I joined my \ncolleagues on the floor of the House to urge the passage of the Equal \nRights Amendment. We are here again, Mr. Speaker, and we will keep \ncoming back until it is done.\n  We have been avoiding ensuring protection for women in the \nConstitution for almost 100 years, and with enduring biases and \ndiscrimination against women, there is no better time than now.\n  The ERA would give Congress the constitutional grounds to pass \nlegislation that gives women victimized by gender-based violence \nrecourse in Federal court and restoring elements of the Violence \nAgainst Women Act that have been deemed invalid by the Supreme Court. \nThe ERA would give women a stronger legal platform from which to \nprotest gender bias discrimination at work, giving cases like Betty \nDukes' 2011 suit against Walmart the standing they would need. When you \nprove statistically lower pay and slower promotion, the biases are \nobvious and shouldn't be allowed to continue just because they haven't \nbeen specifically expressed. The ERA would keep women from being forced \nout of work during pregnancy, a protection that currently does not \nexist.\n  Those are just a few of its benefits.\n  For a long time, the push for the ERA has been viewed from a single \nperspective. But it is time for a coalition of women of every \nethnicity, every religion, every nationality, and every race to stand \nunited in the call for the ERA because it is for all of us. There are \nunique issues that every minority group faces, but they are all \ncompounded when you add the gender to that plate. We can and we must \nwork together to level the gender playing field, and the ERA is the \nbest route to that goal.\n  Mr. Speaker, I now yield to a fierce fighter for women and the ERA, \nthe gentlewoman from New York (Mrs. Carolyn B. Maloney).\n  Mrs. CAROLYN B. MALONEY of New York. Mr. Speaker, I truly want to \nthank Bonnie Watson Coleman for hosting this Special Order to talk \nabout the Equal Rights Amendment. I can't think of anything that is \nmore important than protecting the rights of half the population of \nAmerica.\n  We in Congress and in our country have helped other countries win \ntheir independence and craft their constitutions. One of the things we \nworked to place in that constitution is equality of treatment for all \npeople. We have seen that countries that treat women well have less \nterrorism, less turmoil, and more economic stability, and that adds to \nthe peace of the world. Yet we don't have women in the Constitution of \nthe United States of America.\n\n                              {time}  1715\n\n  I think it is long past due, and it doesn't cost any money. It just \nis an equality statement in a Constitution giving protection to half \nthe population.\n  I have come to this Congress and reintroduced the Equal Rights \nAmendment. We know that it passed in the 1970s. It fell three States \nshort of ratification. You need 38 States, and 35 ratified it. It has \nalready passed in this country before, and there is huge support. \nCurrently, we have over 187 bipartisan cosponsors that have joined \nBonnie and me in this effort.\n  There is an old Chinese saying that women hold up half the sky. But \nwhat most women are concerned about is how they are treated while they \nare on the Earth. We want to be treated fairly on the Earth. The \nexclusion of women--half the population--from the Constitution has dire \nconsequences.\n  Last month we commemorated Equal Pay Day, or more appropriately, \n``Unequal Pay Day,'' when the average woman's salary catches up with an \naverage man's earning from the previous year. To put it simply, women \nhave to work 3\\1/2\\ months more than a male colleague doing the same \njob with the same pay to reach his equal pay.\n  Now, I can say we have made progress. When I first entered the \nworkforce, we were at 59 cents to the\n\n[[Page H2324]]\n\ndollar. We have made progress. We are now at 79 cents to the dollar. \nBut economists say that, if we continue at the same rate, it will be \nthe year 2025 before anything near equality is reached in equality of \npay.\n  Given that fact, the economic state of women in the United States is \nunequal, unfair, and unacceptable if we want to ensure financial \nstability of American families and protect economic growth.\n  It is very interesting. One study was done by Heidi Hartmann, who is \na MacArthur Award-winning economist. She stated that, if you just paid \nwomen equally, you would eliminate half the poverty in the United \nStates.\n  So everybody talks about job programs and everything else. Just pay \nwomen fairly and you would eliminate half the poverty in our country. \nThat is an easy way to address opportunity and fair treatment.\n  This unfairness of 79 cents to the dollar is also much, much more \nunfair when it goes to women of color. The pay gap is even larger. The \npay gap has narrowed slightly over the years, but its impact is perhaps \nmore detrimental today than ever before because women are participating \nin the workforce in record numbers.\n  Increasingly, women are sometimes absolutely necessary for the income \nof the family, and some are single parents, as I am. I am a widow. When \nyou treat a woman fairly, you are treating her husband fairly and her \nchildren fairly. With more women in the workforce because they have to \nwork, bringing home a full, fair paycheck becomes more and more \nimportant.\n  I recently asked the Joint Economic Committee democratic staff to \nstudy the effects of the gender gap, not just the 79 cents to the \ndollar, but what does it mean over a lifetime. This report, which was \nprobably the most comprehensive, in-depth report on the subject to \ndate, looked at the pay gap by age, race, State, and congressional \ndistricts.\n  What it showed is that, over the span of a lifetime, it compounded. \nWomen are 75 percent more likely to live in poverty in their old age \nthan their male counterparts. The unequal pay in the paycheck \ntranslates into lower pensions, lower Social Security, lower savings, \nand just less cash in the pocketbook.\n  They say that, in 1 year over the lifetime of a woman, the average is \nthat you lose over $500,000 in pay. That is just the pay. Then you have \nto compound it into all of the savings aspects that all of us rely on \nin our older age.\n  We found that the gender gap varies widely by race, age, and State. \nWorking mothers--this is so interesting. For a country that says we \nhonor the family, we honor the mothers and the fathers, if you become a \nmother--and many economists have written the same thing--you pay a \npenalty in the form of depressed wages when compared to working fathers \nand women without children.\n  Women that become mothers, the study showed that they are paid less--\nthey call it the ``mommy penalty''--yet, men that become fathers are \npaid more. Men that become fathers are paid not only more than women, \nbut they are paid more than men without children. So it is interesting.\n  And the statistics are that men with children make 15 percent more \nthan men without children and significantly more than women. Over a \ncareer, this disparity widens for women, making them more likely to \nlive in poverty. Older women are the largest segment of poverty in our \ncountry.\n  Women cannot support their families or fully participate in the \neconomy when they are consistently paid less than men doing comparable \nwork. This is bad for everyone. As you go through it, you wonder why \ndoes the gender gap persist and what can we do about it.\n  In the past 30 years, the gender gap has been stuck at 79 cents to \nthe dollar. After controlling for the complex factors that contribute \nto the gender gap, which could be leaving work to take care of \nchildren, taking care of an elderly parent, or other reasons, there is \na 40 percent gap which many economists attribute to discrimination. \nWithout the ERA, there is little to do. There is no recourse to fight \ngender discrimination when it does exist.\n  The late Justice Antonin Scalia agreed and famously said, ``Certainly \nthe Constitution does not require discrimination on the basis of sex. \nThe only issue is whether it prohibits it. It doesn't.''\n  I believe that Justice Scalia, who Ruth Bader Ginsburg called her \nclosest friend on the Court, was doing the women's movement and like-\nminded men who care about women a favor by making this crystal clear.\n  He was a strict constitutionalist. He went by the Constitution. His \nstatement made it very clear: Women are not in the Constitution; \ntherefore, I, as a Justice, and others would not protect them.\n  We need to correct this. It is something that we could join hands and \nmake happen. If we don't explicitly protect women in the Constitution, \nthere can be no expectation for equality in the workforce, government, \nsports, or academia. There is no remedy for discrimination against \nwomen in the court.\n  There have been some celebrated Supreme Court decisions that the \ndissent has said that this will be reversed in later years, and I \nbelieve it will. But they decided against women on the point that women \naren't in the Constitution. Well, let's change that. That is something \nwe can do in this House: pass a bill that puts women in the \nConstitution of our great country.\n  Leaving women out of the Constitution and legally defenseless harms \nall of us in other areas of our lives. The progress women have made can \ntoo easily be rolled back, laws can be repealed, and judicial attitudes \ncan shift. Something as fundamental as equality of opportunity and \nrights should not be at the whim of who is on the Court, who is in the \nlegislature, or any other law that could be put in place to roll rights \nback.\n  I would say that equality for women is a fundamental right that the \nvast majority of this country supports. I polled it once, and 99 \npercent of the people in America said, yes, people should have equal \nrights, and, yes, they should have equality of opportunity.\n  Yet, this fundamental aspect for half of the population of America--\nand it is an important half of the population. Every man had a mother. \nWomen are there working in the home, in the society, and in the \ncommunities.\n  As we help and support and empower women, we empower our country and \nempower our economy. We can't compete and win in this world economy \nwithout using the strength of all of our people. That means not just \ntalented men, but talented women, also.\n  Ninety percent of the country actually thinks the Constitution \nalready fully protects women because it seems so much like a no-\nbrainer. If you asked anyone in this body, they would say ``Of course \nwomen should be treated equally,'' ``Of course I want my daughters and \nmy sons to have equal opportunity.''\n  Properly valuing women is the right thing to do for our daughters, \nsisters, mothers, and grandmothers. It is also the closest thing to a \nsilver bullet to stimulate the economy. If you just paid women equally, \nyou would move so much more money into the economy that would have to \nbe consumed and spent in the economy.\n  I want to really thank the like-minded men and women who support the \nopportunity and the goal for women to be treated fairly. I believe this \nis an issue that we could all agree on. It is a fundamental right. I \nthink that people believe in opportunity. This is one way to make sure \nthat all of our citizens have the same opportunity.\n  I want to thank Bonnie for bringing this issue to the floor. She \nbrings it to the floor once a month. That shows a persistence and a \ncommitment that I want to follow and want to support.\n  I can't think of anything more important that we could spend our time \non as a Nation or as individuals than helping people have the equal \ntreatment and the equal opportunity that they so justly deserve in this \ngreat country.\n  I just want to close by saying I wake up every morning and I say a \nprayer and I kiss the ground and thank God that I was born an American. \nThere is no question in my mind that we are the greatest country on \nEarth. We treat our people the best. It is amazing.\n  We just did a report that came out of the President's Office of \nEconomic Advisers that shows that our economy is leading the world. The \nonly thing that is hurting our economy is the suffering other economies \nthat are pulling us\n\n[[Page H2325]]\n\ndown. We are a great country. But one of the reasons that we are so \ngreat is that we always strive to be better.\n  I can't think of doing anything more important or better than \ntreating all of our citizens equally and allowing them to have the same \nequal opportunity under our great flag and under our great \nConstitution. It is long past due to put women in the Constitution.\n  I hope my colleagues will join me in helping to make this dream of \nequality a reality in the great country of the United States of \nAmerica.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentlewoman \nfrom New York. I welcome our partnership on this endeavor. We committed \nto one another that we are going to continue to raise the issue of the \nERA on a monthly basis so that people will be reawakened to just how \nsignificant and important this is.\n  I was very struck by the information that she shared with us with \nregard to the unequal pay as it relates to women versus men. While we \ncited sort of the general knowledge or norm that is associated with the \nERA and with unequal pay, we recognize that there is an even greater \ndisparity when it comes to African American women and Latin women to \nthe tune of 63 cents on the dollar and 54 cents on the dollar.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), \nwho is also a fierce fighter for equality for all people.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as I listened to Congresswoman Maloney, \nI heard her mention the Constitution and the importance of the Equal \nRights Amendment and I am reminded of the constitutional amendment that \nwas needed in 1920 to allow women the right to vote.\n  If you took a broad assessment of the American people, they might \nallude to women have the right to vote. But what I would offer to say \nto them is that every time we wanted to be sure of a right given to a \nleft-out group, we had to add to the Bill of Rights.\n\n                              {time}  1730\n\n  The Bill of Rights includes the Fifth Amendment, which is the \nprotection of our property and due process. It includes the 13th, 14th, \nand 15th Amendments, which codify, constitutionally, the wrongness of \nslavery and the concept of equal protection under the law. But in all \nof that, it has not protected women in their rightful place in this \nsociety to have a legal basis to object to unequal pay. It did not \nprovide the cover for Lilly Ledbetter, who went to protest the fact \nthat she was paid less and was not given any respect by the employer \nwho felt that there were no laws that protected her.\n  I believe that, in all of my tenure in Congress, I have supported the \nEqual Rights Amendment legislation. So I just answer today, for those \nwho may be querying ``here they come again'' or ``they already have a \nBill of Rights'' or ``they have the amendment allowing them to vote,'' \nyes, we have sectors of rights--the right to vote--and maybe we join in \nand have the right to due process.\n  What the Equal Rights Amendment does is it pierces the veil of \ngovernmental leadership and governance, and it says to the 50 States: \nyou must adhere to the Constitution as it is related to women and that, \nwith every aspect of governmental action that impacts women, without \ndiscrimination against men, you must put them on an equal footing.\n  We have title VII and we have title IX; but, Mr. Speaker, in spite of \nthose statutes, women are still discriminated against because you can't \nsection off their rights and expect all of their rights to be \nprotected. Discrimination under title VII fits one box, and title IX, \nwith athletics, fits another box. Then, for some reason, we have all of \nthese different aspects that seem either not to prevail under lawsuits \nunder title VII or not to prevail under lawsuits under title IX, but \nwomen are still discriminated against.\n  If there were an amendment that would cover all aspects of governance \nthat States had to adhere to, that counties had to adhere to, that \ncities had to adhere to, and that, certainly, the Federal Government \nhad to adhere to, because the Constitution is the Constitution of the \nUnited States for all people, then we would see the lifting of those \nissues that impact women and that are not clarified through the \nstatutory process.\n  I rise today again to support the movement of this bill through the \nJudiciary Committee, to the floor of the House, and, ultimately, \nthrough the Senate. For my colleagues, many of you know that there is a \nconstitutional process that would engage the States. Then, ultimately, \nthat would become an amendment to the United States Constitution. What \nbetter process of engaging the people of the United States in \ndetermining whether they want and recognize the importance of an Equal \nRights Amendment than the process of amending the Constitution of the \nUnited States.\n  I finish by saying we are doing what is right, and I am hoping that \nits conclusion will be in short order on behalf of the women and the \nmen and the families of this great United States of America.\n  Mrs. WATSON COLEMAN. I thank the gentlewoman from Texas for joining \nus in this discussion as well.\n  Mr. Speaker, it has been almost a century; so the time for the ERA is \nright now.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2325-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2325-H2330]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                NATIONAL POLICE WEEK: BLUE LIVES MATTER\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Washington (Mr. Reichert) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, tonight, my colleagues and I come to the \nfloor of the United States House of Representatives to spotlight and \nhighlight a very special week, a week that brings families and police \nofficers together here in Washington, D.C. It is a week that is called \nNational Police Week where these families and police officers from \naround the country come and gather to remember those police officers \nwhose lives were tragically taken in the line of duty during the past \nyear, and this happens every year. In that process, we not only \nremember those lives who were lost in the past year, but we also \nremember those lives who were lost in all of the years prior to that. \nLater on, I will talk about a couple of close friends of mine whose \nlives were taken early in their careers in the King County Sheriff's \nOffice.\n  I should say that, prior to coming to Congress, I spent 33 years in \nthe King County Sheriff's Office in Seattle, starting in a patrol car, \nthen as a detective, then as a SWAT commander, a hostage negotiator, a \nprecinct commander, and, finally, as a sheriff, then coming here to \nCongress.\n  To begin tonight, I honor Chehalis Police Officer Rick Silva and \nWashington State Trooper Brent Hanger, who both tragically died in the \nState of Washington in the line of duty.\n  I begin with Washington State Trooper Brent Hanger.\n  Trooper Hanger died on August 6, 2015, while investigating a \nmarijuana grow in a small town called Yakima, Washington. He was 47 \nyears old. He had a wife, Lisa, and six children: Emily, Erin, Kailey, \nErik, Kyle, and Kevin. Trooper Hanger served with the State Patrol for \n17 years, all of which were spent in the State Patrol's District 7, \nwhich includes Washington State's Snohomish, Skagit, and Whatcom \nCounties. Early in his career, in 2000, Trooper Hanger received the \nAward of Merit from the State Patrol for assisting and saving the life \nof a suicidal person.\n  It is one of the things we forget about with regard to police \nofficers. We are really peace officers, and we are there to protect \npeople and keep the peace. The vast majority of us who go into law \nenforcement enter into law enforcement to protect people and to save \nlives, and that is what Trooper Hanger did in 2000 on just one occasion \nthat he was recognized for.\n  I also recognize Chehalis Police Officer Rick Silva.\n  Rick was 60. He died in Chehalis on June 18, 2015, in Centralia, \nWashington. He had a wife named Cindy and a daughter named Shannon. \nFrom 1986 to 1988, he was a Lewis County corrections officer. From 1988 \nto 2002, he was an officer with the Lewis County Sheriff's Office; and \nhe was employed, when he passed away, with the Chehalis Police \nDepartment. He was a self-taught master fabricator, race car driver, \nautomotive restorer, and carpenter.\n  Since the first known line of duty death in the year 1791, more than \n20,000\n\n[[Page H2326]]\n\nU.S. law enforcement officers have made the ultimate sacrifice. A total \nof 1,439 law enforcement officers died in the line of duty during the \npast 10 years--an average of one death every 61 hours, or 144 per year. \nThere were 123 law enforcement officers who were killed in the line of \nduty in 2015. Since the beginning of 2016, 36 law enforcement officers \nhave died in the line of duty--36 this year. So far, the number of \nfirearm-related fatalities is up 50 percent compared to the same time \nlast year. In 2014 alone, there were 15,725 assaults against law \nenforcement, resulting in 13,824 injuries. Now, we hear sometimes in \nour own communities about those who lost their lives, but we don't \nalways hear about those who were injured in the line of duty.\n  The next speaker I will introduce here in a moment is also a career \nlaw enforcement officer. He was also a sheriff, a sheriff in Florida, \nand I am sure that he and I together could trade police stories all \nnight that would illustrate for you, Mr. Speaker, and for others who \nare listening the danger that one experiences as a law enforcement \nofficer across this country.\n  I yield to the sheriff, the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Nugent).\n  Mr. NUGENT. I thank Sheriff Reichert so very much for yielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are here at a very solemn time in the law enforcement \ncommunity. National Police Week is the week that we honor those who \nhave fallen the year before and in all of the prior years.\n  When Sheriff Reichert was talking about the statistics of assaults on \nlaw enforcement officers and about the number of law enforcement \nofficers who are killed annually, behind each of those stories is a \nreal person--a son or a daughter who is not coming home anymore, or a \nwife or a husband.\n  I have been a police officer. I was a police officer for 38 years, \nand I was ultimately a sheriff in Hernando County, Florida. I have \nburied my share of fellow law enforcement officers in those 38 years--\ntoo many to even talk about without bringing a tear. I can tell you, as \na rookie police officer who was right out of the academy, in the first \nyear I was on the street, one of the guys with whom I went through the \nacademy was shot and killed. That was the first year out of the \nacademy. I was held hostage at one point in time in my career by a guy \nwho was intent on killing his wife.\n  We all have stories like that. Sheriff Reichert is one of those true \nheroes in law enforcement. He is too modest to talk about the times \nthat he has been assaulted, stabbed, or of the folks he has put in \njail--the Green River Murderer. That is just the type of people we are. \nWe are very humble. I was blessed to be in law enforcement for 38 \nyears, and 12 of those years were outside the city of Chicago. I will \ntell you this: the brotherhood in law enforcement is the same wherever \nyou go across this great Nation.\n  We are made up of people, though, and we have flaws like anybody \nelse. Whether you are a physician or a teacher or even a priest, \nsometimes they do wrong things, but 99.99 percent of those in law \nenforcement do it for all of the right reasons. It is not because they \nare going to make great pay, and it is not because: Oh, my gosh, I get \nto work the weekends or work holidays or work midnights or miss \nbirthday parties. They do it because of the love that they have for the \npeople whom they serve in whatever community it may be--as large as New \nYork City and as small as Apopka, Florida. It doesn't matter. The \nfeelings that go into being a law enforcement officer are those of \nservice to his fellow man.\n  I have been blessed. My wife and I have been married for 41 years, \nwith three sons--all of them in the military--but the one middle son, \nwho is a Blackhawk pilot for the Florida Army National Guard, is also a \ndeputy sheriff in Hillsborough County, Florida. I know the feeling that \nhis wife has every time he dons that uniform and goes to work: Is he \ngoing to come home tonight?\n  That is the feeling that all of our wives and mothers and \ngrandmothers felt for their children as they went out the door wearing \nthat uniform of whatever city, county, township they supported or State \npolice agency.\n  We have been blessed in America, and it is because of those people--\nthat thin blue line--who are willing to stand in front of danger to \nprotect the normal, average citizen, somebody they have never met and \nmay never meet again. They run into burning buildings, just like on 9/\n11, to save people. They face down felons to save their fellow man. All \nthey ask for is a little respect, and I don't think that is too much to \nask.\n  This week we passed a piece of legislation, the Fallen Heroes Flag \nAct, that allows us as Members of Congress and in the Senate to provide \na flag. It is a small token of our everlasting appreciation for the \nsacrifices their families have made in the deaths of loved ones who \nserved their country while wearing a law enforcement officer's uniform. \nWe passed that here, and the President is going to sign it. It gives us \nthe ability to provide that flag at no cost to the families. Go figure. \nAt the end of the day, it is really about recognizing in a very small \nand symbolic way that it does matter. Blue lives matter, and all lives \nshould matter.\n  Mr. Speaker, I thank the distinguished sheriff, the gentleman from \nWashington State, Dave Reichert.\n\n                              {time}  1745\n\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, Sheriff Nugent served 35 years. I know he \nlooks a lot younger than I do, but he served a couple of years longer \nthan I did.\n  Sometimes we call people heroes and we don't readily accept those \ntitles because, as the sheriff said, we just want to help. Cops just \nwant to help. They want to help people. They want to serve the \ncommunity and want to keep people safe.\n  I am proud to have another Member here tonight who I am going to \nintroduce who has been a staunch supporter of law enforcement since his \ntime in Congress. We actually came here together in 2005, and he \nhappens to be a judge from Texas.\n  So I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank Sheriff Reichert, \nSheriff Nugent, and all the Members in Congress who have served in law \nenforcement before they came to the House.\n  This is a solemn week when we show our respect and honor to those who \nhave worn the shield or the star. You notice, Mr. Speaker, the shield \nor the star is always over the heart, and it is symbolic of protecting \nus from outlaws, from criminals.\n  Law enforcement stands between us and those who would do us harm. \nThat is why they wear the shield or the star over their heart, because \nthey will give their lives and have for the rest of us, protecting us \nfrom those do-bads out there.\n  I served as a prosecutor in Houston, Texas, for 8 years and then 22 \nyears in the criminal courts trying all kinds of cases. I met a lot of \npolice officers. I still know a lot of them. They are certainly a rare \nbreed that would do what they do.\n  Most Americans couldn't go on patrol one day and do what they do. \nThey are to be admired. We honor those who have died last year, but we \nhonor those who have died in previous years.\n  Some in America don't realize that the Capitol Police protect us \naround the Capitol. In 1998, two Capitol police officers, John Gibson \nand Jacob Chestnut, gave their lives protecting Members of Congress. We \nshould remember them.\n  Last year, 128 peace officers were killed in the United States. \nEleven of those were females. Twelve were killed in Texas, the highest \nof any State. There were also two K-9s who were officers that were \nkilled in Texas.\n  Three of those officers who were killed were from my hometown of \nHouston, Texas: Darren Goforth of the Sheriff's Department, Officer \nTronoski Jones of the Sheriff's Department, and Officer Richard Martin \nof the Houston Police Department.\n  About this time last year, there was a robbery in progress--we call \nthose hijackings in Houston--at a service station on Sunday morning. \nThe Houston Police Department responded.\n  They get to the scene and see a stolen U-Haul van speeding away from \nthe service station. There is a high-speed chase. The U-Haul got a \ndistance on the Houston police officers, jumped out of the U-Haul, \ngrabbed a lady that was getting in her minivan, pushed her out of the \nway, stole the minivan, took off, and are firing shots at the police \nofficers. Meanwhile, most of Houston is asleep and safe.\n  Their chase goes on for a long time. Officer Richard Martin was ahead \nof\n\n[[Page H2327]]\n\nthe chase. He got his patrol car far enough ahead that he jumped out of \nthe car and put spikes in the road to stop this outlaw from getting \naway.\n  The outlaw sees Richard Martin, veers off the road, hits him and \nkills him and keeps driving for 20 miles before the Houston Police \nDepartment stopped him.\n  Richard Martin was 47. He had only been a peace officer for 4 years. \nHe had other careers before that, including serving in the United \nStates Air Force. He has two children. I met Tyler last week. He is 11. \nIt was a rough, rough conversation talking to him about his dad.\n  As Sheriff Nugent said, these are real people and they are good \npeople. They are a rare breed, the American breed, who will wear that \nstar, that badge, over their hearts to protect us.\n  All that separates us from evil and criminals is the thin blue line. \nThat is it. You either have anarchy or you have the rule of law. Those \nwho want to cause anarchy and mischief and crime in our communities are \nstopped by the law. That is why we call them law officers, peace \nofficers.\n  They are protecting us from those that would do us harm, and we \ncertainly should give them and their families the respect and honor \nthat they rightfully deserve because they make a sacrifice every day. \nThey willingly make that sacrifice for us.\n  Most peace officers I ever met have an extra job. They don't make \nenough money being a peace officer; so, to support their families, they \ndo something else. They work long hours all week doing everything they \ncan to make an income to take care of their families, and we should \nrecognize that they are the best that America has.\n  In closing, I would just like to say, Mr. Speaker, peace officers are \nreally the last strand of wire in the fence that protects good from \nevil, that protects the chickens from the coyotes. That is the peace \nofficers. We appreciate what they have done.\n  I want to thank Sheriff Reichert for his service to our country, \nespecially all those cases that you solved years ago. I am sure that \nthe criminals are glad that you are in Congress and not back in \nWashington State chasing them down.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Judge Poe for his service, too, \nand for his staunch support of law enforcement officers across the \ncountry.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would like to introduce Mr. Wilson of South Carolina, \nwho has a real understanding of what it means to serve. His family is a \nfamily of military service. So he understands the service that law \nenforcement officers provide across this country as well.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Dave \nReichert along with Sheriff Richard Nugent and Judge Ted Poe for their \nservice to law enforcement in Congress.\n  Mr. Speaker, this Sunday marks the beginning of National Police Week, \na time each year when we especially honor the service and sacrifice of \nour Nation's police officers. Tragically, the citizens of South \nCarolina's Second Congressional District lost two distinguished and \ncourageous officers this year.\n  Officer Gregory Alia, a 7-year veteran of the City of Forest Acres \nPolice Department, was beloved by his friends, family, and the entire \ncommunity where he was born and raised. Gregory was an Eagle Scout, a \ngraduate of Richland Northeast High School, and a graduate of the \nUniversity of South Carolina.\n  In 2003, I was grateful to accompany him along with my son, Hunter, \nwith Troop 100 of St. Joseph's Catholic Church of Columbia to the \nPhilmont Scout Ranch in Cimarron, New Mexico, for a 100-mile trek. I \nknew he was a great fellow.\n  A hardworking, dedicated, and humble man, he was the embodiment of a \nhero every day of his life. As a new father, he loved his family, \nlooked for the good in everyone, and was a selfless leader, one who \nbrought people together.\n\n  His end of watch was September 30, 2015, when he was shot while \npursuing a suspect.\n  I am grateful his wife, Kassy; parents, Dr. Richard and Alexis; aunt, \nCatherine Alia-Harding; and his infant son, Sal, are here in the \ngallery and community today.\n  Gregory's legacy lives on not only in the outpouring of love and \nappreciation from the community, but also in the actions of his family \nand friends.\n  I would like to especially recognize his wife, Kassy, for her \nselfless service in the days, weeks, and months following the loss of \nGregory.\n  Less than a week--actually, even during the funeral service--after \nher husband was killed, the community was devastated by a 1,000-year \nrain, which caused widespread flooding.\n  Days after Gregory's funeral, Kassy volunteered at the Harvest Hope \nFood Bank. She also started Heroes in Blue, an organization dedicated \nto sharing and caring and providing courageous stories of police \nofficers in South Carolina and across the country. She founded Gregory \nAlia Day on December 14, the date of what would have been their fourth \nanniversary.\n  Hundreds of community members and local businesses honored his memory \nby providing hot meals to 13 police stations in the Midlands of South \nCarolina.\n  Nearly a month after Gregory Alia was provided final honors at St. \nJoseph's Church, our community faced another tragedy when Officer Stacy \nCase lost her life in the line of duty.\n  Stacy, an Iraq war veteran, served the Army for 15 years, earning \nseveral commendations, including the National Defense Service Medal, \nGlobal War on Terrorism Expeditionary Award, the Army Commendation \nMedal, and the Army Achievement Medal.\n  Originally from Michigan, Stacy joined the City of Columbia Police \nDepartment in 2011. She worked one of the most difficult beats of the \ndepartment and regularly sought opportunities for professional \ndevelopment. Stacy was killed in an automobile accident when responding \nto a shots-fired call on November 7, 2015.\n  A highly respected member of the Columbia Police Department, her \nlegacy will continue to live on. Indeed, last month the City of \nColumbia Police Department commissioned a new K-9 officer named Case in \nStacy's memory. It is just one of the many tributes to her honor.\n  As we mark National Police Week, I remember those that we have lost \nand stand in support of the men and women who risk their lives every \nday to protect us.\n  God bless and protect our law enforcement and their devoted families.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Wilson for his support and for \nbeing here tonight to help us highlight law enforcement Police Week and \nremember those who have died in the line of duty and those continuing \nto serve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would now like to introduce Mr. Gowdy from South \nCarolina, who also has a career in law enforcement and has continued \nthat effort here to do the right thing and protect the American people \nhere in Congress.\n  I yield to the gentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Gowdy).\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Reichert for his service to \nthe country and to the great State of Washington. I want to thank Judge \nPoe, Sheriff Nugent, and my friend and colleague from South Carolina, \nJoe Wilson, who is the father of a prosecutor.\n  Mr. Speaker, Allen Jacobs was going to be a father again, but this \ntime was going to be a little bit different. He was already the father \nof two precious little boys, but he was going to be the father of a \nlittle girl. His wife, Meghan, and he were expecting a child this July.\n  Life had prepared Officer Jacobs very well to be a father. He was an \noutstanding student, an athlete in Greenville, South Carolina. He put \nthat athleticism and intelligence to work for our country in the United \nStates Army.\n  He was deployed to Iraq, Mr. Speaker, for 15 months and even \nvolunteered to live in the neighborhoods of Baghdad because he \nunderstood that all people want to live in a peaceful, secure \nenvironment.\n  After Iraq, he was deployed to Haiti because he wanted to help the \nHaitian people in the aftermath of their tragic earthquake.\n  Well, Mr. Speaker, the tug of fatherhood is strong. So Allen decided \nto return to the Upstate of South Carolina,\n\n[[Page H2328]]\n\nbut his desire to protect and serve others and to provide peace and \nsecurity to others never dissipated.\n  So he left the uniform of the United States Army and put on the \nuniform of the Greenville City Police Department. He pursued that \ncalling with the same vigor and the same strength and the same \nprofessionalism that epitomized every other facet of his life, whether \nit was service on the SWAT team or the Cops on the Court, as a patrol \nofficer for schools or a gang resistance team.\n  Mr. Speaker, Allen Jacobs would stop his patrol car from time to time \nto shoot basketball with young men in the inner city of Greenville who \ndid not have the father figure that he was to his boys and that he \nwould be to his daughter.\n\n                              {time}  1800\n\n  Now, Mr. Speaker, I learned all of this from Allen's mother in a \ntelephone call we had 2 days before his funeral. This strong man who \nsurvived Iraq and Haiti and boot camp and police officer training \ncouldn't survive an encounter with a teenage gang member who had just \nbeen released from jail. He never even had a chance to unholster his \nweapon, Mr. Speaker. He was just trying to protect, serve, enforce the \nlaw, and he was ambushed.\n  His funeral gave all of us an opportunity to reflect not only on his \nlife, but on the lives of all the other folks in the upstate of South \nCarolina who died in the line of duty, whether it be Russ Sorrow or \nKevin Carper or Eric Nicholson or Marcus Whitfield or Greg Alia, who \nwas killed in the line of duty, as my friend from Columbia made note \nof. His wife is here and his parents are here and his aunt is here. \nThey have a little boy who is less than 1 year old.\n  I want to say this in conclusion, Mr. Speaker. I want to thank all \nthe women and men in uniform who are willing to do what most of us are \nnot willing to do, and interact with people that most of us are not \nwilling to interact with, and miss things in life that most of us are \nnot willing to miss. But I especially want to send a message, Mr. \nSpeaker, to Allen Jacobs' two sons and his daughter on the way and Greg \nAlia's son. Their fathers lived a life of service and sacrifice and \nsignificance, and they left the greatest legacy that you can ever leave \nchildren, which is a good name to be proud of.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Gowdy.\n  I was going to try to get some courage up to tell one of my stories \nabout my partner who was killed in 1982, but I think I am going to wait \nand gain my composure.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Jolly), who has led one of \nthese Special Orders in the past in honor of police officers and is \nanother staunch supporter of law enforcement across this great Nation.\n  Mr. JOLLY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the sheriff. I want to associate \nmyself--I know we all do--with our colleague Mr. Gowdy's remarks. This \nis personal for so many.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today on behalf of the people of Pinellas County, \nFlorida, the people in the State of Florida, who, if they were here in \nthis Chamber tonight, would also want to associate themselves with the \ngratitude that fills this well, gratitude to law enforcement officers \nwho each day do risk their lives. They risk their own security, they \nrisk the stability of their family, and at times they risk the security \nof their children, knowing the risk that is on the line every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, the risk is very real. It is very audible. We know--it \nhas been talked about tonight--that, on average, we lose a law \nenforcement officer once every 3 days in the line of duty. As Sheriff \nReichert very rightfully pointed out, we also know the prevalence of \nassaults and injuries. By some accounts, more than one assault every \nsingle hour of every single day, 365 days of every single year. The \nrisk is real.\n  We all have an opportunity, a privilege, to hold the public trust. \nWhen we sit in this Chamber, we represent fine men and women who wear \nthe uniform. We represent multiple police departments, sheriff's \ndepartments, other law enforcement agencies. One of the great \ndepartments I have gotten the opportunity to work with since being a \nMember is the Clearwater Police Department--men and women of impeccable \ncharacter, impeccable bravery, but also impeccable sacrifice, a \ndepartment that dons the number 4 on their shirts to remember four law \nenforcement officers from their department who paid the ultimate \nsacrifice: Patrolmen Harry Conyers, Ronald Mahony, John Passer, and \nPeter Price.\n  So what can this body do in addition to paying tribute, on behalf of \nthe people we represent, to those who serve in blue, our men and women \nin law enforcement? We can do what we are doing tonight, but we need to \ndo it every single year. What we need in this town are Members of \nCongress and elected officials who stand with law enforcement.\n  Frankly, Mr. Speaker, I am sick and tired of people in this town who \nrefuse to stand with law enforcement, who take cheap shots questioning \nthe integrity of men and women who put their valor on the line, on \ndisplay every single day. You want to make America safer? You want to \nsolve civil unrest throughout the country? Let's stand with law \nenforcement. Let's say: Just as you have our back, we have yours.\n  The way to solve so many of these issues that we have seen on display \non television in the last 2 years is to dispense with the rhetoric, \ndispense with the vitriol, dispense with the lies and the rumors and \nsay: You know what? As a body, this Congress, this government is going \nto stand with our law enforcement officers each and every day.\n  There are two simple measures that I have introduced, and I am joined \nby colleagues, each who have other measures as well. There are a lot of \ngood measures out there.\n  One we will be highlighting tomorrow in a national press conference \nis called the Thin Blue Line Act. It provides for enhanced penalties \nfor anyone who assaults or takes the life of a police officer. We \ncurrently provide those additional protections for someone who attacks \na child, an elderly person, a disabled person. I think we should take \nthat model code and apply it to law enforcement officers as well and \nvery simply say to somebody: If you take the life of a law enforcement \nofficer, be prepared to lose your own.\n  Another piece of legislation I think we should move on is something \nthat addresses some of the questions about the 1033 program to provide \nsurplus equipment. This President has launched a war on local law \nenforcement by restricting the availability of equipment and technology \nfor local law enforcement agencies. Why don't we trust the leadership \nand the judgment of our local law enforcement leaders, our chiefs, and \nour sheriffs to determine what equipment is necessary for their force?\n  I have legislation that would leave 1033 perfectly in place but \nsimply require the local law enforcement agency to certify that they \nhave personnel trained and capable of operating that equipment. It is \nthe right way to stand with law enforcement and say we are going to \nmake sure you have the tools and technology you need.\n  The risk is very real; the politics, at times, are absolutely \ndisgusting. We may never be able to replace the loss of families whose \nfathers, mothers, brothers, sisters were lost in the line of duty; we \nmay never be able to heal the wounds; but we can honor our law \nenforcement officers every day. It is what this body is attempting to \ndo tonight. It is the commitment of my colleagues I stand here with to \nlet law enforcement officers around the country know that, just as you \nhave got our back, we have got yours.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Jolly for his comments and his \nstrong support of law enforcement over the years. I especially \nappreciate his comments regarding the partnership between police and \ncommunity.\n  The police cannot protect our families and our neighborhoods and our \ncommunities alone. The communities can't do it alone. There has to be a \npartnership there, Mr. Speaker, and that partnership has to be based on \ntrust.\n  So together, as a nation, in our communities across this great \ncountry, we have got to come together, police and communities, for the \ngood of our children and the protection of our neighborhoods and the \nsafety of our country. I think we can accomplish that with dialogue and \nespecially going back to the good old days of community policing and \nactually visiting and talking with members of the community, as\n\n[[Page H2329]]\n\nMr. Gowdy pointed out, a police officer who stopped in his \nneighborhood, got out of his car and played basketball with the young \nmen and women on the street. I can remember those days myself. I got \nhurt in a basketball game with some kids on the street, but that is \nanother story.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield to the gentleman from Kentucky (Mr. Barr).\n  Mr. BARR. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Reichert--Congressman, colleague, \nand sheriff--for this opportunity to support National Police Week and, \nmore importantly, to thank him for his long career in law enforcement \nand his service.\n  Yesterday, Mr. Speaker, I had the opportunity to meet with the \nfamilies of fallen Kentucky State Troopers Eric Chrisman and Blake \nTribby. Tomorrow I will meet with the families of fallen Nicholasville, \nKentucky, Police Officer Burke Rhoads and fallen Richmond Police \nOfficer Daniel Ellis.\n  Each of these men died while doing his job, to defend our communities \nand to keep our families safe. These families have been deprived of a \nloved one, endured tremendous pain, and made enormous sacrifices so \nthat all of us can live with greater peace of mind.\n  At a time when some are using the bad actions of a few to attack the \ndignity of the entire law enforcement profession, let the sacrifices of \nthese men and their families remind us that uniformed officers are \nputting their lives on the line for our benefit every single day. We \nowe an enormous debt of gratitude to all law enforcement officers \nthroughout this country, and especially to those who have made the \nultimate sacrifice.\n  My wife, Carol, and I had the privilege and the honor of attending \nthe memorial service for fallen Richmond, Kentucky, Police Officer \nDaniel Ellis just a few months ago. The memorial service in the Eastern \nKentucky University Alumni Coliseum was packed full of family and \nfriends and colleagues on the Richmond police force. But even more \nimpressive, brothers in blue from all over Kentucky and all over the \ncountry were packed in that coliseum to pay tribute to this hero to our \ncommunity.\n  Richmond Police Chief Larry Brock, who was eulogizing his colleague, \naddressed the crowd, and speaking of Ellis' valor and his kindness, he \nalso expressed the heartbreak felt by all of Ellis' colleagues in blue. \nThis is what he said:\n  `` `As we left the hospital to escort Daniel to Frankfort for the \nrequired medical exam, the skies opened up and it poured rain. It was \nas if the angels themselves were crying at the loss of this special \nyoung man,' said Brock, his voice breaking.''\n  I would like to join all of my colleagues in welcoming the tens of \nthousands of people who have come across the country to our Nation's \nCapital in support of National Police Week. I especially want to thank \nKatie, the widow of Officer Ellis, and Officer Ellis' 3-year-old son, \nLuke. In the words of the Gospel, John 15:13: ``Greater love hath no \nman than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I again thank Congressman Reichert for hosting this \nimportant Special Order to recognize the contributions and the \nsacrifices of police officers from across the country.\n  Mr. REICHERT. Mr. Speaker, I thank Mr. Barr for his comments and his \nsupport.\n  I yield to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Buck).\n  Mr. BUCK. Mr. Speaker, I thank Sheriff Reichert and others who have \nso eloquently spoken and recognize the importance of this week.\n  Police Week gives us the opportunity to honor and thank those law \nenforcement officers who put their lives on the line to protect us. The \nmen and women who work in law enforcement know the definition of \nsacrifice. They know the look on their spouse's face when they leave \nfor the swing shift. They know the loneliness of a patrol car on a \nsnowy night. They know how many times they have looked at that picture \nof their family on the dashboard, and they know what it is like to lose \none of their own.\n  In Colorado, we have already lost three officers this year: Deputy \nSheriff Travis Russell, Corporal Nate Carrigan, and Deputy Sheriff \nDerek Geer. But speaking their names on the House floor won't bring \nthem back for dinner tonight or put them in their patrol car or seat \nthem in the bleachers of their son's baseball game on Saturday.\n  We must honor those who have fallen, but our honor must engender \nresolve; otherwise, we are forgetting too quickly the sacrifices we \nmeant to remember. This is why I have introduced the Blue Lives Matter \nAct. The despicable criminals who would assault or kill an officer \nsimply because of that officer's status as a member of law enforcement \ndeserve an enhanced sentence and a prosecution and investigation from \nevery possible agency that we can bring resources from. This \nlegislation ensures that these criminals see justice.\n  Everywhere I go in Colorado, I run into officers who thank me for \nintroducing this bill, and I appreciate that, but I don't deserve their \nthanks. Protecting police officers isn't something we do because we \nhave some extra time or because we feel especially patriotic. Congress \nhas a duty to protect those who protect us.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  Mr. REICHERT. I thank the gentleman for his support and taking time \nto honor those fallen in the State of Colorado.\n  Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time is remaining?\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Allen). The gentleman has 19 minutes \nremaining.\n  Mr. REICHERT. I yield to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Al Green).\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentlemen and \nsheriff, and I would also like to thank President John F. Kennedy for \nhis proclamation recognizing our peace officers.\n  I want to say that I am grateful that the gentleman has chosen to \ncome to the floor and have this Special Order honoring those who are \nwilling to make the ultimate sacrifice.\n  I have heard persons talk about the virtues of peace officers. I \ndon't have to have it explained to me because I have a personal \nexperience that I can relate to.\n  My uncle was a deputy sheriff. My uncle was a peace officer. He was \nwell respected in his community. I adored him. My uncle and I were \ntogether in his patrol car, and I was asking a lot of questions.\n  His comment to another person with us was: This boy is asking a lot \nof questions. He is going to be a lawyer because he is asking so many \nquestions.\n  I did not know what a lawyer was, but I knew that, if my uncle, who \nwas a deputy sheriff, said I was going to be a lawyer, then a lawyer I \nwould be.\n  From that day forward, I had one mission in life when it came to my \neducation and my career. That was to be a lawyer because my uncle, the \ndeputy sheriff, the peace officer, proclaimed it as such.\n  So I am honored tonight to pay tribute to him. His name was Dallas \nYates. He served in Florida in a small town called Gifford, near Vero \nBeach.\n  He lived into his nineties, became a minister, and passed away just \nrecently. It was not in the line of duty, but it meant something to me \nto know that he lived and made a difference in the lives of others.\n  With reference to the phrase itself, this terminology, ``in the line \nof duty,'' it takes on new meaning if you go to the home-going ceremony \nof a peace officer. It will take on a new meaning.\n  When you see that riderless horse with the boots in the stirrups, it \ntakes on a new meaning. When you see the family grieving, it takes on a \nnew meaning. When you understand this is a person who was willing to \nsacrifice so that others might have life, it takes on a new meaning.\n  So I am honored to be here tonight, and I want people to know that \nthere are many of us who believe that we have to support our law \nenforcement officers and stand with them and recognize that ``in the \nline of duty'' means more than going to work. It sometimes means not \ncoming home.\n  Mr. REICHERT. I thank Mr. Green for his support. I think your uncle \ngave you great advice.\n  Mr. Speaker, as I stood here tonight and listened to all the other \npresenters, I came to the realization that there were a lot of people \nhere that might be a lot more articulate about what it means to be a \npolice officer. Even though I have served for 33 years, I found that a \nlot of words here touched me tonight because it brings back memories of \ngood friends.\n\n[[Page H2330]]\n\n  I want to tell a brief story related to some topics that were \ndiscussed earlier tonight about the opioid epidemic here. Yes, we are \nconcerned about the people who are addicted. We are concerned--and \nrightly so--about the families who are trying to deal with that \naddiction and the danger that it presents to the person addicted, the \ndanger it presents to the family, the tragedy it presents to that \nfamily and the addicted individual and the community in the entirety.\n  But sometimes we forget to include the police officer in that group \nof people that is endangered by this epidemic that has ripped our \nNation. They are the first people there. They are the first ones called \nto a scene where someone might be acting up as a result of being \naddicted to heroin or some other drug.\n  I can remember a night. I just want to share this short story so \nthat, Mr. Speaker, you can understand this is something that happens to \npolice officers across this country every day of the year.\n  I was with a team of officers who were assigned to serve a drug \nsearch warrant on an apartment. We were all assigned a room to go to. I \nkicked in the door and I went to the right to a small bathroom.\n  When I entered that door and went into the bathroom, there was a \nyoung man in the bathroom with a rubber band around his arm and a \nneedle injected in his arm. His eyes were glazed over. He was standing \nby the toilet.\n  He saw me come in with my badge over my heart and my gun in my hand. \nI said: Raise your hands above your head and drop to your knees. He \nraised his hands, but he didn't go to his knees. He stood there and \nstared at me for a short time. Eventually, his right hand moved to the \nright behind a half wall and came out with a gun.\n  At that moment, I had to make a decision. Every police officer across \nthis Nation has to make a split-second decision: Do I shoot? Is my life \nin danger? Am I going home to my family? Am I not going home to my \nfamily? Is this the time? Those things go through your mind in a \nmillisecond. In the snap of a finger, you have to make a decision.\n  Something told me I could talk to this young man. And so I continued \nto talk, and he finally leaned back and dropped the gun in the toilet, \nfell to his knees, and we handcuffed him and took him to jail.\n  I share that story to just emphasize the fact that police officers \nare going through these dangerous situations every day, having to make \nthose decisions. And then, Mr. Speaker, every day after that they \nsecond-guess themselves, if they had decided to pull the trigger, and \nthen the community will continue to second-guess.\n  And, yes, we need to be questioned. And, yes, we need to be held \naccountable. And, yes, we need to be trained. All of those things are \ntrue. But it is so easy to Monday-morning-quarterback.\n  I had a partner that was killed in 1982. We were tracking down a \nmurder suspect. In the process of that, my partner was ambushed and \nshot in the chest and killed. He had five sons. They are all grown men \nnow. They grew up without their father.\n  In 1984, another friend and partner was stabbed and killed with a \nWorld War II sword. His name was Michael Rayburn. My partner's name was \nSam Hicks. But just a few years before that, Mike Rayburn saved my \nlife.\n  I was directing traffic in the middle of the night, at 2 o'clock in \nthe morning, on Pacific Highway just south of Seattle. It was a pretty \nmajor accident. I had my back turned to the ditch behind me. Deputy \nRayburn drove up.\n  Just at the moment he drove up, somebody jumped out of the ditch. He \nhad a knife in his hand and was running across the lanes of traffic to \nbury that knife in my back. Mike Rayburn was there just in the nick of \ntime and tackled that man who was about to stab me. Two years later, \nMike Rayburn was dead. His kids grew up without their father.\n  I am here tonight to honor them. I am here tonight to honor every \npolice officer in this country. I am here tonight, Mr. Speaker, to ask \npeople across the Nation to say thank you to the police officers that \nprotect their community, protect their children, and protect their \nhomes each and every day.\n  I will be there on Sunday at the memorial in front of the Capitol and \nbe with those families. I have held the widows in my arms, as the \nsheriff. I have held the children and cried. I will be doing that again \non Sunday.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2330-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H2330-H2333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                             TAX DAY FLOOD\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, I am honored tonight to stand \nhere in the U.S. House of Representatives to call to the attention of \nmy colleagues, my friends, H.R. 5025, a bill that will bring some \nrelief to much suffering in the Houston area in the State of Texas.\n  But before I get into the bill itself, I think it appropriate to \nthank some people for what they have done to help us get to this point.\n  I thank my colleague who will be speaking in just a moment, the \nHonorable Gene Green, who serves in the 29th District, which is \nadjacent to the district that I serve. I want to thank my friend Gene \nGreen because he is the original cosponsor of this legislation. He was \nthere to help shape it, and it means something to know that you have a \nfriend that you can work with to this extent.\n  I want to thank my friend Congressman John Culberson. He is the first \nto make this legislation bipartisan. This is not a partisan issue. \nFlooding is not a partisan issue. The homes that are damaged, the lives \nthat are lost, none of this is partisan. I am grateful to Congressman \nCulberson for signing onto this bill.\n  I would like to thank the 60-plus cosponsors of this legislation who \nhave said that they want to see what has been authorized materialized, \nsuch that, in Houston, Texas, we cannot only eliminate a lot of \nflooding--and we will. We can't eliminate all of it, but we can \nmitigate that which we cannot eliminate.\n  I thank Chairman McCaul of the Homeland Security Committee. He \npublished the letter for us, the members of the delegation, to sign and \nsend to the President of the United States, asking that Texas have \ncertain areas within the State declared disaster areas because of the \nhorrific flooding that took place on what we call Tax Day.\n  I thank the leadership for allowing us to have this team on the floor \ntonight on both sides. The leadership makes these things possible, and \nI am grateful to all leadership for doing this.\n  Finally, I want to thank President Barack Obama because he did, Mr. \nSpeaker, declare certain areas in Texas disaster areas so that we might \nreceive the help of FEMA and funds to help people recover and to \nrestore their lives and continue with their lives.\n  So tonight I will say more about some of these things mentioned, but \nnow I am asking to ask the gentleman from Texas (Mr. Gene Green), my \ncolleague, who is the lead cosponsor of this, to have his commentary.\n  Because his district has suffered greatly not just this time, but in \nthe past, from these floods. I will not go into it. I will leave all to \nbe said about it to him.\n  But I think it appropriate that I acknowledge his great work in the \nCongress of the United States of America not only on this issue, but on \nmany other issues impacting people within his district and across the \nlength and breadth of this great country.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleague and \nneighbor and friend for setting this Special Order tonight for what we \ncall the tax day floods in Houston and Harris County, Texas.\n  Our district was hit by flooding, but not near as much as in \nCongressman Al Green's, because I was in his district that week, and \nalso in the neighboring districts, Congressman Culberson, Congresswoman \nLee and Congressman McCaul, and Congressman Brady.\n  But I was just looking at a memo. In our district, we have Hunting \nBayou, which is part of the legislation, that was overflowed; and the \npeople who live in that area, along Interstate 10 East, they cleaned \nout their homes, the Sheetrock and everything else, and it is literally \na tragedy.\n\n[[Page H2331]]\n\n  On April 18, the city of Houston and Harris County, Texas, was \nsubjected to paralyzing flooding which claimed the lives of 9 of our \ncitizens and required the rescue of at least 1,200 others.\n  Approximately 2,000 housing units were flooded, and we are currently \nworking to figure out where to house the folks who cannot return to \ntheir homes.\n  This is the second major flooding disaster Houston has experienced in \nthe last 6 months. The city is expecting additional rain, even this \nweekend, tomorrow and Saturday.\n  Residents of our congressional district, as well as other Members' \ndistricts, have been severely affected, and we must do everything we \ncan to stop the needless loss of life.\n  The President has recognized the significance of the catastrophe and \nfulfilled a request for a disaster declaration. Now it is the job of \nCongress to help our constituents. That is why I have worked closely \nwith my neighbor and friend and colleague, Representative Al Green, to \nintroduce the Tax Day Floods Supplemental Funding Act, H.R. 5025.\n  The legislation would provide $311 million to the U.S. Army Corps of \nEngineers for the construction and, in most cases, completion of our \nbayou and flood projects in the Houston and Harris County, Texas, area.\n  Flooding is not new to Houston, but we have learned how to control \nit. Our bayou system has saved countless lives and millions of dollars \nin damage since the creation of them. Unfortunately, due to the \nconsistent budget pressure, the Army Corps of Engineers cannot \nadequately fund these projects.\n  This bill would ensure that our Federal, State, and local authorities \nhave the resources necessary to expedite these flood control projects \nwe know protect people and property.\n  My colleagues and I have requested the Director of FEMA and the \nSecretary of Housing and Urban Development to tour our districts and \nsee the damage firsthand, and I renew that request again today.\n  The support in the community is overwhelming. The Greater Houston \nPartnership, our chamber of commerce, supports this legislation, and \nthey estimate that the total lost is about $1.9 billion.\n  It is also supported by our local--in Harris County we created a \nflood control district that partners with the Corps of Engineers. Our \nHarris County Flood Control District also supports this legislation.\n  Additionally, I want to make sure that the folks on the ground have \nthe information they need to get back in their homes.\n  FEMA has opened disaster centers in our community, but if you are not \nnear one of those centers, you can apply to FEMA by phone. Call 1-800-\n621-3362. That is 1-800-621-FEMA. 1-800-621-3362.\n  FEMA can offer two types of assistance: housing assistance, temporary \nhousing, money to help repair or replace your primary residence.\n  Non-housing needs include medical, dental, funeral costs, clothing, \nhousehold items, tools, home fuel, disaster-related moving and storage, \nreplacement of a disaster-damaged vehicle. After 24 hours, FEMA will \nfollow up with you.\n  It is important in our district to know that, if your Spanish-\nspeaking households have children that are U.S. citizens or legal \nresidents, FEMA can help you if there is a legal resident or a citizen \nliving in that home.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is important that we help victims in our \nneighborhoods so we can get back on top and help them.\n  I urge our body, this House, to pass the emergency funding \nlegislation and do so as quickly as we can.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague and friend. I was impressed that \nday when we were in his district, in Westbury, at the flooding and the \noutpouring of people.\n  I have seen it in my district where people will literally move \neverything from their house; they have to throw it away. It is out on \nthe curb. The city of Houston is cleaning it up as fast as they can, \nbut we need to get these people back into their homes.\n  But this bill that we have will make sure their homes are not flooded \nagain because, that way, we don't need to have these repetitive floods \nlike we have had in the last few years.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleague for this Special Order tonight \nbut, more importantly, I want to thank him for his leadership on this \npiece of legislation. I am proud to be his cosponsor.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. I thank the gentleman very much. I greatly \nappreciate all that he has done to help us, especially coming into my \ndistrict, and being there with the mayor, if you recall, who was there.\n  We had a county commissioner in attendance, County Commissioner Gene \nLocke, Mayor Sylvester Turner, and persons from that neighborhood. This \nwas not your district, but the people were people that the gentleman \ncared about, and they are grateful, as am I, for the gentleman's coming \nin and visiting with us.\n  Mr. GENE GREEN of Texas. If the gentleman will yield to me; we also \nhad the press conference, and everybody was confused. We also have the \ngentleman's city council member, Larry Green. So they had Congressman \nAl Green, Congressman Eugene Green, and City Councilman Larry Green. \nThey can call all of us and we will help them.\n  Mr. AL GREEN of Texas. Absolutely. In Houston, Green is a good name \nif you want to become a member of the political order.\n  Again, I thank my colleague.\n  Let me elaborate for just a moment on the letter from the Greater \nHouston Partnership because a good many people are not aware that this \nis another way for us to say chamber of commerce in Texas. We have gone \nbeyond a simple chamber of commerce. We call ours a partnership because \nit is an effort among the many to make sure that commerce excels, but \nalso to make sure that people have great opportunities.\n  Houston is a city of opportunity, and I want to thank the Greater \nHouston Partnership for the letter that has been sent to us supporting \nH.R. 5025.\n  But now let's be a little bit more specific. I want to thank Mr. \nJamey Rootes. He is the chairperson of the Greater Houston Partnership. \nHe and I have been talking, and he has been working with me and with my \ncolleagues to try to make sure that we have an opportunity to get our \nmessage out to the masses. He has done what he can to help us with this \nmessaging, a message that includes the position of the Greater Houston \nPartnership, I must add.\n\n  Also, Mr. Bob Harvey, who is the president and CEO of the Greater \nHouston Partnership. We made a call to them one morning, asking if they \ncould get a letter to us indicating their support, and that afternoon \nwe had the letter in hand, the letter that I hold in my hand currently. \nAnd that letter is, without question, a solid indication of support for \nthis project.\n  The last paragraph of it reads: ``We want to make sure that we do all \nthat we can to help you and your staff as you consider every potential \nopportunity for Federal support. Please do not hesitate to call.'' And \nthey give names and numbers.\n  They are committed to doing what they can to not only help with this \nlegislation, but to help people in their recoveries, and to prevent \nthis from happening again.\n  The Harris County Flood Control District, Mr. Michael Talbott, sent \nthe letter, the executive director. And in his letter, he speaks of how \nthis can benefit the Houston area to the amount of about $2.4 billion.\n  He goes on to talk about the jobs that can be created--6,220 created \nif we can get this legislation done, if we can get this money into \nHouston.\n  I must add this: this money is money that we will get eventually into \nHouston. This is not money that we won't ever get. These projects have \nbeen authorized. They are already in progress. It is just that we are \ngetting the money in a piecemeal fashion, and we need a wholesale \nrepresentation of this emolument for Houston, such that we can get on \nwith these projects, such that we can prevent future damages, such that \nwe can save lives. What we cannot eliminate, we can mitigate in terms \nof damages.\n  So I am honored that the Corps of Engineers has these projects that \nthey are working on, and I am especially honored that the Harris County \nFlood Control District has let us know that they are absolutely in \nsupport of what we are trying to accomplish with H.R. 5025.\n\n[[Page H2332]]\n\n  Now, having said all of these things and making it clear that this is \nmoney that has to be matched, that this is money that we will \neventually acquire, I think it's appropriate for me to say this:\n  This is about more than money. It is about more than things, \ninanimate objects. This is about more than homes and personal property, \ncars, and all of the things that we call creature comforts. It is about \nmore than these things. It is about people. This legislation really is \nabout human beings. It is about human beings who are in a recovery \nphase right now, many of them recovering from the tax day flood, some \nstill recovering from the Memorial Day flood which took place last \nMemorial Day. Mr. Speaker, it is about these people, but not only these \npeople, it is about people who lost their lives in this flood.\n  My colleague mentioned that there were nine--nine persons, that we \nknow of, lost their lives. And wouldn't it be a shame to remember the \nflood, remember the damages that were imposed upon the homes, and the \ncars, and the furniture, remember the damages, but not remember the \npeople who lost their lives?\n  So tonight I want to take just a moment on behalf of my colleague and \nmany others in this House and just recognize, memorialize the lives \nthat were lost in this horrific flood, a tragedy that, quite frankly, \ncould have been mitigated if we had all of these projects to \ncompletion.\n  Let's just remember these persons and not forget them. So with a \ndegree of solemnity, I would like to just call their names and say a \nlittle bit about each of the nine.\n  The first, German Antonio Franco. He was 66 years of age, Mr. \nSpeaker. He was a retired HEB produce manager. HEB is one of our food \nstores. He also worked as a part-time contract limousine driver. This \nwas a man who had children--three children and four grandchildren. The \ncircumstances of his death are that he died after an encounter with \nhigh water, something we will see consistently as I go through this. \nBut he lost his life in Houston, Texas, in a flood.\n  I would like to mention Ms. Claudia, last name is Melgar. Claudia \nMelgar. She lost her life, 25 years of age. She was a college student. \nShe died in an encounter with high water.\n  Now, there are those who would say that you can avoid an encounter \nwith high water. I believe that in many circumstances you can, but in \nHouston, Texas, we have what are known as flash floods, floods that \noccur in a flash, and there are many times when you can be caught in a \ncircumstance such that you cannot extricate yourself.\n  Because of this, the waters will envelop you and you will find \nyourself in a position such that you cannot even leave the car that you \nare in because of the way the electronics can malfunction. And if you \ndon't have some device, some tool to break windows, to move yourself \nthrough some passageway other than that door, you will find yourself in \nharm's way and you can lose your life.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  This has happened to many people. It happened to Claudia.\n  I would also like to mention Pedro Rascon Morales, 61 years of age. \nHe was a big rig driver, a father, and a grandfather. He died in the \ncab of his 18-wheeler while trapped in a flooded roadway in Houston, \nTexas.\n  All of these persons are in and around the Houston area. They all \nlost their lives in water due to flooding with the tax day floods as we \ncall them. These are lives that we can never forget. I think that we \nshould remember the damages that were caused to property and the \ndestruction, but we shouldn't forget the lives that were lost because \nthere are families that are grieving to this day because they lost \npeople that they loved.\n  These were the daughters and sons of somebody, and we should never \nforget that they lived and that they lost their lives, some, I might \nadd, in a needless circumstance--this is my opinion--because of our not \nfulfilling our obligation to fund what has been authorized.\n  Next, we have Charles Edward Odum, 56 years of age, seventh grade \nsocial studies teacher, married, with two children. Circumstances of \nhis death: died after encountering high water.\n  Then there was Teri White Rodriguez, 41 years of age, a wife and \nmother of three. Circumstances of death: died in her vehicle after an \nencounter with high water, an encounter with high water in Houston, \nTexas.\n  It was an unfortunate circumstance, and we should not forget that \nlives were lost.\n  I know it is going to be easy for many of us to go on with our lives. \nThis will be put behind us. We have a moment when we focus on these \nthings, but life is such that there are so many other things that we \nencounter that our focus is lost or that we focus on something else. \nThat is important, so I don't begrudge anybody who has to focus on \nother things. I just believe that I have a duty, an obligation, and a \nresponsibility to make sure that we don't forget these lives that were \nlost. There will be others, but we don't want to forget these. There \nhave been others, but we won't forget these.\n  We won't forget Sunita Singh, 49, an electrical engineer, a wife and \na mother of two children, drowned in her car after an encounter with \nhigh water.\n  Let's not forget Suresh Kumar Talluri, 49, a husband and father of \ntwo young children ages 6 and 8, drowned in his car after he was \ntrapped by high water.\n  We shouldn't forget and we should commemorate the life of Dharamendra \nUppal. This is an unfortunate circumstance wherein we have the age of \nthe person undisclosed, the circumstances of the death undisclosed in \nthe sense that we don't know personal information about this person who \nlost his life, or her. I am assuming that from the name it was a \nfemale, but this person died and was found deceased in his car, a male, \ndeceased in his car which appears to have been submerged. He was a \nmale. The name is important. The identity is not known completely \nbecause we don't know the age and we don't have personal information.\n  Then there is a woman with an undisclosed name, with no personal \ninformation available to us at this time who drowned after an encounter \nwith high water.\n  All of these unfortunate circumstances involved people. I want to \nmake sure tonight that while we will talk about the billions of dollars \nin damages--and there were billions of dollars in damages, billions of \ndollars. It is estimated that it is as high as $8 billion in damages \nwhen you combine the Memorial Day flood with the tax day flood, as much \nas $8 billion.\n  That $8 billion, by the way, is 25 times the $311 million that we \nmight use to take preventive action.\n  This money will not go to help people get new homes. This money won't \ngo to help people get personal items that have been destroyed. All of \nthis money will go to projects that have been authorized, projects \nthat, if completed, can possibly prevent the loss of future lives and \nprojects that, if they had been completed, may have prevented the loss \nof some of these lives.\n  So I take it as my personal responsibility to call this to the \nattention of this House and to ask my colleagues to please consider \nH.R. 5025. The President has declared the area that I am speaking of as \na disaster area. FEMA is there. This is an opportunity for us to act. \nWe have done it before, and we should do it now.\n  I want to assure my colleagues that, when there is a disaster of this \nmagnitude, you can count on our good offices being with you to help you \nthrough your time of need. We understand that we should be there for \npeople. This is what we have done in the past, whether it was Sandy, \nhurricanes, or whether it was tornadic activities. Whether it is fires \nor hurricanes along the Gulf Coast, we want to be there for our people.\n  This is our country, and a country is more than bricks, buildings, \nskyscrapers, and military. It is people who live ordinary lives, who \nexpect that they would have the opportunity to fulfill their dreams, to \ngo to work and come home safely and not find themselves in harm's way \nby virtue of waters that are not expected, floodwaters that can come in \na flash and take them away.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, I thank my colleagues who have signed on to this \npiece of legislation. I want to again thank the President of the United \nStates, the Honorable Barack Obama,\n\n[[Page H2333]]\n\nfor making his desires known by declaring certain areas in Texas a \ndisaster area. I thank the Governor of the State, by the way, Mr. \nSpeaker, because he acted quickly, swiftly, and promptly to make the \nrequest of the President.\n  I have mentioned Mr. McCaul. I thank the gentleman again for his \nactions in circulating the letter so that all of the members of the \nTexas delegation could be on it requesting that certain areas in Texas \nreceive this attention from the President.\n  Finally, I know that these are difficult times for us across the \nNation and across the world. There are many things that are happening \nthat are challenging for us. But among these things, let us not forget \nthat there were people who lost their lives in Houston, Texas, and let \nus not forget that these floods occur with a degree of regularity such \nthat it is predictable that it will happen again.\n  We can prognosticate now that this will happen again. If it does, I \nwill find myself back here as a reminder that there are things that we \ncould have done, should have done, and hopefully will do to eliminate \nmuch of the flooding and mitigate that which we cannot eliminate. I am \ngrateful.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "12"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2016/05/12/house-section/article/H2333-1", "month": "05", "year": "2016", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H2333]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
