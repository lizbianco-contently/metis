Mr. Speaker, the first value of \nAmerican leadership is the safety and security of our citizens.\n  While it is important to support those fleeing conflicts across the \nglobe, the CIA Director's recent statements on the distinct possibility \nof additional attacks and the national security implications \nsurrounding Syrian refugees at this point are too great to ignore.\n  The FBI has also indicated that it is next to impossible to \nappropriately screen refugees. For this reason, I have called upon the \nPresident to place a hold on admitting refugees into the country.\n  Additionally, I have joined with members of the Pennsylvania \ncongressional delegation in requesting that Governor Tom Wolf also \nplace a moratorium on accepting refugees into the Commonwealth.\n  The House today will consider legislation that suspends refugee \nadmissions until we assure that adequate screening security for threats \nis in place.\n  We must not take any chances that could put our country at risk. This \nis the first in many steps that will provide Americans security, while \nalso supporting our long-term humanitarian tradition in this country.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support the SAFE Act that will be on the \nfloor later this morning.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8365-8", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8365-H8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                    JAPANESE INTERNMENT AND REFUGEES\n\n  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. TAKANO. Mr. Speaker, 70 years ago my parents and grandparents \nwere\n\n[[Page H8366]]\n\nstripped of their possessions and placed in Japanese American \ninternment camps. They were not guilty of espionage. They did not \ncommit treason. They simply looked like our enemy, and that cost my \nfamily their freedom.\n  Yesterday the mayor of Roanoke, Virginia, suggested that this \ncountry's treatment of Japanese Americans during the 1940s is a model \nfor how we should address today's global refugee crisis.\n  It does not take courage to condemn such disgraceful comments, nor \ndoes it take wisdom to say our World War II policies were a product of \nfear and hysteria.\n  What takes wisdom is recognizing that history is now repeating \nitself. What takes courage is sending a message to the world that \nAmerica will protect innocent people regardless of their nationality or \nreligion.\n  That is what my mother and father deserved 70 years ago, and that is \nwhat these refugees deserve today.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8366-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        LOCAL PRIORITIZATION OF LAND AND WATER CONSERVATION FUND\n\n  (Mr. LaMALFA asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LaMALFA. Mr. Speaker, yesterday the Committee on Natural \nResources considered a bill that restores the original intent of the \nLand and Water Conservation Fund: support of State and local projects.\n  The LWCF State program has supported many recreation facilities \nacross the country, including in my district, such as a municipal pool \nin Susanville, boat launches on the Sacramento River, and city parks \nand playgrounds in Chico, California.\n  However, for every worthwhile local investment of $20,000 or $30,000, \nthis administration now disproportionately spends millions on land \nacquisition for the Forest Service, which already can't manage what it \nowns.\n  Sixty-one percent so far of the program during its existence has gone \nfor this sort of land acquisition. That is not local. The result is \ncatastrophic fires across the West each year with nonmanaged forest \nlands.\n  Mr. Speaker, Chairman Bishop's bill will rectify this problem and \nsend more funding to the State and local projects that need it and help \nend the destructive cycle of the Federal Government purchasing and \nowning land it doesn't manage, only to have it burn.\n  I urge all my colleagues to support this measure when it comes up.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8366-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   THE REPUBLICAN SYRIAN REFUGEE BILL\n\n  (Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. LORETTA SANCHEZ of California. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to \nexpress my concern and opposition to the Republican Syrian refugee \nbill.\n  This restrictive and misguided legislation would immediately shut \ndown the current refugee resettlement and cripple our refugee programs \nfor the future.\n  I represent Orange County, California, one of the historically known \nareas of resettling refugees from all around the world. We are ready. \nWe are ready.\n  Once this administration has taken a look at the backgrounds, has \ndone the extensive research that they do with respect to somebody's \nbackground, we are ready to help resettle these refugees.\n  Refusing to resettle any Syrian refugees would inadvertently empower \nDaesh and boost their recruitment abilities among vulnerable \npopulations struggling to survive. We cannot let Daesh push us to \nsuccumb to fear and to prejudice.\n  These Syrian refugees are fleeing the same violence that we have seen \nin Paris and Beirut and Baghdad this last week. Three-quarters of them \nare women and children. A quarter of them are over 60 years of age. \nRefugees are not the enemy.\n  So remember the words on our Statue of Liberty: ``Give me your tired, \nyour poor, your huddled masses yearning to breathe free.''\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8366-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                           QUOTES TO REMEMBER\n\n  (Mr. WILSON of South Carolina asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as the world faces mass \nkillings by ISIS, Daesh, of Russian, Lebanese, and French citizens, as \nDaesh has announced plans to target Washington and Rome and New York, \nwe need to review how we got here and together change course.\n  President George W. Bush on July 12, 2007, declared: ``To begin \nwithdrawing before our commanders tell us we are ready would be \ndangerous for Iraq, for the region, and for the United States. It would \nmean surrendering the future of Iraq to al Qaeda. It would mean that \nwe'd be risking mass killings on a horrific scale. It would mean we \nallow the terrorists to establish a safe haven in Iraq to replace the \none they lost in Afghanistan.''\n  President Barack Obama on December 14, 2011, claimed: ``Everything \nthat American troops have done in Iraq . . . all of it has led to this \nmoment of success. We're leaving behind a sovereign, stable, and self-\nreliant Iraq.''\n  I agree with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani that the \nPresident's failed policies created the development of Daesh, leading \nto the Syrian refugee crisis, resulting in children drowning at sea. \nThe President should change course.\n  In conclusion, God bless our troops, and may the President, by his \nactions, never forget September the 11th in the global war on \nterrorism.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8366-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8366]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                CRS REPORTS SHOULD BE PUBLICLY AVAILABLE\n\n  (Mr. LANCE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANCE. Mr. Speaker, this week Americans for Tax Reform joins the \nchorus of advocacy and good government groups calling for Congressional \nResearch Service reports to be available to the public.\n  In its letter of support, Americans for Tax Reform said that opening \nCRS reports to the public is a commonsense proposal that will increase \ntransparency, give taxpayers greater access to important information, \nand enrich public knowledge.\n  The taxpayer advocacy group pointed out that the rules casting CRS \nreports into secrecy are outdated and unnecessary, and these reports \nbelong in the public domain.\n  U.S. taxpayers support the work of the Congressional Research Service \nto the tune of more than $100 million a year. It is fiscally \nresponsible and good public policy to allow educators, students, \nmembers of the news media, and everyday citizens access to these \ntaxpayer-financed reports.\n  I urge my colleagues to join Congressman Mike Quigley and me in our \nbipartisan support of H. Res. 34, which will open CRS information to \nthe public. These reports are paid for by taxpayer funds.

Mr. Speaker, today I rise to recognize Samaritan's Purse, \nan organization headquartered in Boone, North Carolina, that brings \nspiritual and physical aid to hurting people around the world.\n  This week is the national collection week for the organization's \nOperation Christmas Child ministry, which puts empty shoe boxes to good \nuse by filling them with gifts for needy children.\n  In order to participate, one needs to start with a shoe box, then \ndecide whether to pack a box for a girl or a boy, and pick the age \ncategory: 2 to 4, 5 to 9, or 10 to 14. Finally, one fills the shoe box \nwith gifts, including fun toys, hygiene items, and school supplies.\n  This year I packed a shoe box for a girl between the ages of 5 and 9. \nIt is a simple concept that brings so much joy to the children who \nreceive these special packages. I urge everyone to consider \nparticipating in this worthy program.\n\n[[Page H8367]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8367-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8367-H8378]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n  PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 4038, AMERICAN SECURITY AGAINST \n                      FOREIGN ENEMIES ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, by direction of the Committee on \nRules, I call up House Resolution 531 and ask for its immediate \nconsideration.\n  The Clerk read the resolution, as follows:\n\n                              H. Res. 531\n\n       Resolved, That upon adoption of this resolution it shall be \n     in order to consider in the House the bill (H.R. 4038) to \n     require that supplemental certifications and background \n     investigations be completed prior to the admission of certain \n     aliens as refugees, and for other purposes. All points of \n     order against consideration of the bill are waived. The bill \n     shall be considered as read. All points of order against \n     provisions in the bill are waived. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and on any \n     amendment thereto to final passage without intervening motion \n     except: (1) one hour of debate equally divided and controlled \n     by the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on \n     the Judiciary; and (2) one motion to recommit.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, for the purpose of debate only, \nI yield the customary 30 minutes to the gentleman from Massachusetts \n(Mr. McGovern), pending which I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume. During consideration of this resolution, all time yielded is \nfor the purpose of debate only.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all \nMembers have 5 legislative days to revise and extend their remarks and \ninclude extraneous material on House Resolution 531 currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Georgia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I usually begin my statements \ntalking about the technicalities of the rule, who is managing the \ngeneral debate time, and a recap of the testimony and amendments we \nreceived in the Committee on Rules hearing. These are important items \nto discuss before this body. But today is different. The debates that \nwe will have on this rule and the underlying legislation will be and \nshould be different.\n  I will be honest. This bill has nothing to do today with job \ncreation. It has nothing to do with reducing regulatory burden or \nempowering educators to focus on the needs of students rather than the \nwish list of unions. Those are important issues that we will address in \ncoming weeks. But today is different.\n\n                              {time}  0945\n\n  Today, we face the growing evil in the world and resolve to fight \nagainst it, no matter the price. The power of ISIS to kill and destroy \nhas stunned the world and called us to question who we are as \nindividuals, as people of faith, and as a Nation.\n  It doesn't matter how many press conferences this administration \nholds, they will not distract from their abdication of responsibility \nto the security of the United States and the security of its citizens.\n  The pro-rape, pro-torture, pro-mutilation strategy of Islamic State \ndoes not shrink in the face of meaningless words by our Commander in \nChief. We are here today because this administration has failed. In the \nface of unspeakable violence and terror, the White House blinked. And \nour world is paying the price.\n  My colleagues across the aisle no doubt plan to deliver moral \nlectures, as this administration is so fond of, dismissing those who \nsuggest that the Islamic State will use any means possible to bring \nAmerica to her knees. Before they do, let me remind them the price this \ncountry has paid for freedom.\n  Soil around the world is soaked with the blood of our sons and our \ndaughters who gave it all so that we may be free--as Lincoln said, \n``that last full measure of devotion''--and so those who seek refuge \ncan find safety and security in our country.\n  Despite what the administration wants you to believe, refugees don't \nseek safe haven because of our welfare benefits. It is because we don't \nnegotiate with terrorists. It is because we recognize our first and \ngreatest responsibility is the life and liberty of those who call \nAmerica home.\n  We are a Nation of immigrants. We are a Nation of laws. And we are a \nNation with a fundamental responsibility to preserve the rights of our \ncitizens. And those rights include life.\n  The United States has one of the most generous legal immigration \nprograms in the world, welcoming the hurting and abandoned, the \npersecuted and destitute. And we will continue to. But we will not \nwelcome terrorists. We will not sacrifice moral courage on the altar of \nquotas.\n  This country and the world will be judged by future generations on \nour response as a Nation and as individuals to the Islamic State and \nthose they have raped, tortured, driven from their homes, and murdered. \nAnd I believe we will also be judged on our commitment to the safety of \nthe millions of men, women, and children already living within our \nborders.\n  The underlying legislation, H.R. 4038, isn't about who we welcome \ninto our country. It is about keeping out those who pose a threat to \nour national security.\n  Last night, the Rules Committee received testimony from the Judiciary \nand Homeland Security Committee chairmen and minority representatives, \nas well as receiving amendment testimony from a number of Members on \nboth sides of the aisle, for over 4 hours.\n  Now, more than ever, those who seek shelter in the United States \ndeserve the assurance that our government is doing everything within \nits power to protect them from the very evil they fled.\n  But where is the administration? Perhaps if the Commander in Chief \nwould stop holding press conferences to lecture Republicans and start \nleading the world in the fight against terrorists, we wouldn't have \nthousands upon thousands tortured, displaced, and killed.\n  The White House said ISIS was contained less than 24 hours before 100 \npeople became the latest victims of terrorism on the streets of Paris. \nAnd, oh, by the way, before releasing five from Guantanamo that \nmorning. It seems the President was too busy practicing his Turkish for \nthe G-20 Summit remarks to notice the world is crumbling and the \nIslamic State is growing stronger.\n  In fact, when the President spoke at the G-20 Summit press \nconference, here is what he mentioned before addressing the terrorist \nattacks in Paris: the beauty of Turkey; the hospitality of the Turkish \npeople; his practice of the Turkish language; the need to grow the \nglobal economy; the need to create jobs; rising inequality in the \nworld; cyber theft; and oh, yes, global climate talks.\n  There is no question that we have a political commentator when what \nour Nation and the world needs is a Commander in Chief.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Collins) for yielding me \nthe customary 30 minutes.\n  (Mr. McGOVERN asked and was given permission to revise and extend his \nremarks.)\n  Mr. McGOVERN. First, Mr. Speaker, I don't blame the gentleman of \nGeorgia for not wanting to talk about the rule because, today, we are \nabout to debate the 46th closed rule of this Congress, making this the \nmost closed session of Congress in history. Speaker Ryan promised an \nopen and deliberative process when he took the gavel. He has already \nreneged on that promise.\n  Representatives Bennie Thompson and Zoe Lofgren offered an \nalternative to today's bill that deserves debate on the House floor, \nbut the Republicans on this Rules Committee prohibited debate under \nthis completely closed process.\n  The bill that we are about to debate wasn't even introduced until \n10:14 p.m. Tuesday night. There have been no hearings--none at all--no \nmarkups, and no opportunities for bipartisan input. And, quite frankly, \nthere was not a lot of opportunity for rank-and-file Republicans to \nhave any input on this. Even more stunning, the Judiciary Committee is \nholding a hearing today--right now--on the very subject we are going to \nvote on in an hour.\n\n[[Page H8368]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, we all understand why people are anxious and concerned. \nWe all watched with horror as the brutal attacks in Paris played out on \nour TV screens. And our thoughts and our prayers continue to be with \nthe people of Paris, whose courage inspires all of us.\n  Keeping Americans safe is our top priority. And in the wake of the \nParis attacks, that mission has never been more important. But in the \ndays since those terrible attacks, there has been a deeply troubling \ndebate about whether the United States should accept Syrian refugees. \nIn the past week, we have heard far too many of our leaders stirring up \nfear and far too few talking about the facts.\n  Mr. Speaker, Americans want an honest and serious debate about how we \nkeep our country safe, but this bill, the so-called American Security \nAgainst Foreign Enemies Act, or the American SAFE Act, falls far short.\n  Instead of debating a bill that might actually strengthen and enhance \nour refugee resettlement screening process, we are debating a bill that \nappeals to the worst in us and hurts the very people who are fleeing \nthe violence and chaos ISIS has wrought.\n  The authors of this bill boast that ``this legislation would put in \nplace the most robust national security vetting process in history for \nany refugee population.'' But the simple truth is that the United \nStates already has in place the most rigorous screening process for \nrefugee resettlement in the world.\n  Right now, Mr. Speaker, America's refugee screening process already \ninvolves seven different Federal departments and agencies, including \nthe State Department, the Department of Homeland Security, the National \nCounterterrorism Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, the \nDepartment of Defense, the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, \nand the U.S. Customs and Border Protection.\n\n  Beyond that, every refugee from Syria is also subjected to an \nadditional layer of security and scrutiny. This process is so detailed \nthat it takes, on average, about 2 years for each refugee to be fully \nscreened and allowed to enter the United States, under the sponsorship \nof a local service agency, and be settled here. Two years.\n  Now, I would think that every Member of this House would feel \nreassured knowing that such a process is already in place to protect \nour citizens and our communities. We have already resettled over 1,800 \nSyrian refugees over the past 4 years in 130 communities across \nAmerica. In the past year, Massachusetts has resettled 62 Syrian \nrefugees, including 24 in my hometown of Worcester. Of the 2,174 Syrian \nrefugees that we have resettled in the United States since 9/11, not a \nsingle one has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds. \nNot one.\n  I recognize that there are ways that we can strengthen that process \nfurther. The Congress could consult and work with the administration, \nincluding Homeland Security, the State Department, the national \nintelligence agencies, and the FBI, to identify and discuss areas where \nenhancements can be made. But that is not what the authors of this bill \ndid. And it is clear that it wasn't their intention either.\n  What H.R. 4038 would actually ``achieve'' is the creation of a so-\ncalled process that would shut down all refugee resettlement from Syria \nand Iraq. It is not meant to make things better. It is meant to make it \ncompletely unworkable.\n  Nothing in this bill actually improves the FBI's or any other \nintelligence agency's ability to conduct a more effective screening \nprocess. If you want to do that, give them more money for more \npersonnel and consult with them directly about how to strengthen the \nexisting screening process. This bill hasn't done that.\n  Right now, of the more than 1,800 Syrian refugees resettled in the \nUnited States since 2012, half are children, a quarter are adults over \nthe age of 60, and none have been involved in anything remotely tied to \nterrorism or violent activity.\n  Mr. Speaker, America is at a critical crossroads. It is moments like \nthis that define who we are as a Nation. This bill, along with the \ndeeply troubling rhetoric that surrounds it, would only perpetuate the \npolitics of fear and intolerance. Americans are better than that. And \nnow, more than ever, we must stay true to our values.\n  Our enemies want to divide us. We must remain strong and united in \nthe face of this evil. We must not abandon the clear-eyed compassion \nthat has made America the shining city on the hill for more than two \ncenturies, giving hope to so many generations before us in search of a \nbetter life for themselves and for their children.\n  In July, I traveled to Gaziantep, Turkey, near the Syrian border, \nwith a congressional delegation led by Senator Tim Kaine of Virginia. \nWhile there, we heard directly from government leaders, local NGOs, and \ncharities on the front lines helping the countless Syrian refugees who \nhave lost their homes and many of their friends and family. They are \ndesperate to escape the violence and are part of the world's worst \nrefugee crisis since World War II. We cannot shrink from this moment \nwhen strong American leadership is needed.\n  One of the most important reminders of the legacy we must live up to \nis the Statue of Liberty. For more than 100 years, it has stood as a \npromise for better life for the ``huddled masses yearning to breathe \nfree.'' We cannot turn our backs on the values at the heart of our \nidentity as Americans. To do this would cede a victory to the \nterrorists. Yet the fear, anger, prejudice, and isolationism that are \ndriving the current debate on Syrian refugees remind me of some of the \ndarkest and ugliest chapters of modern American history.\n  Many Americans--some in this Chamber--still remember the moment in \nour Nation's history when we turned away ships filled with Jewish \nrefugees desperate to escape Nazi Germany and imprisoned our fellow \ncitizens of Japanese heritage in internment camps. Do we really want to \nreturn to these kinds of destructive and hateful policies? Is that \nreally who we are today?\n  I am so proud of America's leadership in providing $4.5 billion in \naid to Syrian refugees in the region--more than any other country. I am \nalso proud that the U.S. Office of Refugee Resettlement places a \npriority on accepting widows with children and highly vulnerable \nindividuals, especially the elderly and the infirm.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4038 would shut down our resettlement program \naltogether. That is what it wants to do, and that is what it intends to \ndo.\n  The refugees eligible for resettlement in the United States are not \nthe refugees in Europe. The refugees coming into the United States \nthrough our resettlement program have been living in refugee camps for \nmonths--often years--under unimaginably harsh conditions.\n  A woman and her 3-year-old little girl whose home in Syria was \nreduced to rubble by barrel bombs and whose husband has been killed \nwill be denied the opportunity to go through the rigorous screening \nprocess to find a new home in America.\n  An elderly woman who has lost everything and is barely alive now in a \nrefugee camp will be denied a home in America, even if she has some \ndistant relatives already in the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, where is our humanity? None of the Syrian refugees who \nhave already made it through our screening process and have been \nresettled in the United States fit the description of the terrorists I \nhave heard described over and over again last night in the Rules \nCommittee. Those ugly distortions of the people we are resettling only \nemphasize how out of touch with reality this debate has gotten.\n  Mr. Speaker, if we really want to help make America more safe and \nmore secure in the wake of the Paris attacks, then we should put more \nmoney in the omnibus appropriations bill for the FBI, DHS, and for our \nlocal law enforcement agencies so that they can continue focusing on \ncriminal and homegrown as well as possible foreign individuals and \nnetworks that might engage in violence against our citizens.\n  And, while we are at it, we should also increase the funding for the \nState Department, HHS, the UNHCR, and the NGOs that provide \nhumanitarian aid abroad and resettlement support to refugee families \nhere in America. But let us stop wasting our time with a bill that is \ngoing nowhere and fails to offer the serious approach we need to keep \nAmerica safe and address this crisis.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n\n[[Page H8369]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I was sort of amazed--it took almost probably 7 or 8 minutes--but we \ncame to the real heart of the problem: just throw money at it. If you \ndon't fix a problem, just throw money at it. When you are showing no \nleadership, I guess I would throw a diversionary tactic out there and \ndo that as well.\n  What I am having trouble understanding is also what has been said by \nmany speakers this morning, Mr. Speaker, and that is that true refugees \nare not the problem. They can still apply. Nothing in this bill keeps \nthat rigorous process from them applying and going through that \nprocess. We are simply adding a certification step.\n  Now, undoubtedly, that is a little cumbersome for our Secretary of \nthe Department of Homeland Security because he has this problem: he \nsays it is cumbersome for him to certify each Syrian refugee \npersonally.\n  There are issues here. Is it just hugely cumbersome and not the most \neffective use of the Secretary's time? I am sorry; you are the \nSecretary of Homeland Security in this country. Your job is to keep us \nprotected. However that may play out, get the resources and do what you \nare supposed to be doing.\n  It is not like the example of keeping a young mother with kids from \ngoing through the process. There is nothing in this bill that does \nthat. That is a distraction.\n\n                              {time}  1000\n\n  I will talk about the rule. The rule is straightforward. Vote for the \nrule in just a few minutes. Vote with the side of those protecting \nAmerica. Make sure that we are protected. That is a simple choice this \nmorning.\n  That is what this rule does. It gets us to a bill that allows us to \nput an extra level of security and an extra level of certification so \nthis administration cannot just continue to do what they are doing.\n  I was stunned just a few moments ago when I heard from my friend that \nthis appeals to the worst in the U.S.\n  This appeals to the worst in the U.S.? Protecting America and trying \nto find ways to do that appeals to the worst of us?\n  That, to me, is derogatory to every man and woman who serves in our \nmilitary, who goes and fights for freedom not only here but abroad. You \nare telling me to add a level of protection to those who live within \nour borders is appealing to the base of who we are?\n  That is not true. Deflect how you want to. Talk about this bill. Vote \n``no'' if you want to. Go on the side of saying, you know, we have got \nit pretty good right now. Those that have come haven't done anything.\n  I would rather see a proactive approach. I would rather see something \nthat is very reflective of the world's times. When we do that, then we \nare fulfilling our role. That is the best of America, not the worst.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1\\1/2\\ minutes to the gentleman \nfrom Pennsylvania (Mr. Cartwright).\n  Mr. CARTWRIGHT. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose this rule. This bill, \nH.R. 4038, was rushed to the floor with no hearings, no opportunities \nfor amendments, none of the things that Speaker Ryan promised us about \nan open process, a bottom-up process.\n  Now, I agree that preventing dangerous actors from entering the \nUnited States is paramount, and I also agree that we must be strong in \nour resolve to confront and defeat terrorism wherever it comes from. \nBut I submitted an amendment to this bill which would have excluded \nwomen and children from the extra and potentially onerous process this \nbill would enact for refugee vetting.\n  Refugees from this region already undergo a far more rigorous \nscreening process than anybody else seeking admission to this country. \nThe process takes, on average, between 18 and 24 months--and longer, in \nmany cases--before a refugee sets foot on U.S. soil. Surely this \nprocess is sufficient for women and children, widows and orphans of \nterrorism who are particularly vulnerable during conflicts while \nfleeing, who come from refugee camps.\n  It means that this bill is particularly punitive for them if it means \nthey have additional wait time. Imposing that kind of additional wait \ntime while going through unnecessary bureaucratic steps to vet those \nlow-risk individuals makes no sense.\n  Speaker Ryan, I oppose this rule because you are not living up to \nyour promise. We ought to have debate. We ought to have hearings, and \nyou ought to allow amendments like this one that would make an \nexception for widows and orphans.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I would just say, if the gentleman agrees that we need to enforce and \nhave strong protections to make sure that we are not attacked, then my \nrecommendation would be vote ``yes'' on the rule and vote ``yes'' on \nthe bill. It is a pretty simple choice here. Or you can go back and \nexplain to most of the people in your district who agree that we need \nto protect our country--it is something across our country, from coast \nto coast, that says this is something that is worth doing, and I think \nwe need to look at that.\n  I do want to hit this hard in just a moment. There are times--and \nespecially when you come to a decision like this--when we understand \nhow we got here and that it was put together by six chairmen who, over \nthe weekend and this past week after the tragic result of last Friday \nnight in Paris, have put together this first step in legislation to \ndeal with this, and there will be other steps coming. But to \ncharacterize this as something that basically has not been considered--\nthere are committees, the Judiciary Committee on which I serve, the \nHomeland Security Committee, and others, who have been looking at this \nissue for a long time.\n  This is something that has come together, and it gives us an \nimmediate first step, and it makes a very clear choice.\n  Do you want to add a layer of protection to protect the American \npeople or not? If you don't want to, vote ``no.'' If you don't want to \ndo that, vote ``no.'' Vote ``no'' on the rule. Vote ``no'' on the bill. \nTalk about the process. Whine about whatever you want. But this is a \nclear choice. The bill is protection or not.\n  The other issue that we need to really just assess here is, when we \nlook at what we are doing, the question is about leadership, and the \nquestion is about how are we going to protect those. It doesn't shut it \ndown.\n  Also, it was just mentioned just a little bit ago that there was a \nhearing right now. The implication was that the hearing had something \nto do with this bill. Let's just be very clear. The hearing is about \nthe Syrian refugee issue as a whole, not this bill. We are not taking \naway from that. This is an issue and a hearing that had been planned. \nIt is happening. Those are other discussions that will be coming \nforward.\n  So let's at least make sure that we are giving the right implications \non what is going on on the Hill right now.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from Georgia for \nclarifying that point, which now means that there are zero hearings on \nthis bill and no markup. It doesn't make me feel very good about this \nprocess.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New Jersey (Mr. Pascrell).\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I have lived in Paterson, New Jersey, all \nmy life, which has a large Syrian American population. In fact, when I \ncame back from the service, I joined the American Legion. It was the \nJohn Raad Post, which was a Syrian American military organization. \nThese are hardworking people here.\n  The advantage of what we are doing, and over the past 4 years since \nthe beginning of the Syrian war, the civil war, is that we are \nconnecting refugees with Syrian American families.\n  There are no harder working people in this country than Syrian \nAmericans. Know the history of it. They didn't come here last week.\n  So here is the chart. This is what you need to go through to get a \nrefugee into the United States of America. I hope you looked at the \nchart. I hope you have examined every step, the 14 steps. Let's not get \ninto one side wants to secure America more than the other side.\n  I served in the Armed Forces. I was on the beginning of the Select \nCommittee on Homeland Security. I don't\n\n[[Page H8370]]\n\nlike anybody telling me: You guys tried to do that in 2005, and you \nlost in 2006. Stay away from it.\n  No one party is privy to protecting this country. We all want that. \nBut we are not going to sacrifice what we, as Americans, are. We are \nnot going to do this.\n  When women and children who have nothing on their back--nothing--and \n2 or 3 years, they could finally come to the gate of the greatest \ncountry in the world--yeah, you may smile over there, but I am very \nserious about what I am saying. This is a very serious moment in our \nhistory.\n\n  I want to protect America. I want to be strong. I don't agree with \nall the President's Syrian policies, but I think that we are doing harm \nto ourselves and sending the wrong message.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Jenkins of West Virginia). The time of \nthe gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentleman an additional 1 minute.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman is reminded to address his \nremarks to the Chair.\n  Mr. PASCRELL. Mr. Speaker, I want to salute the Speaker of the House, \nand here is why I want to salute him. He defused the religious \nconnotations when this was first brought up. He did that yesterday, and \nI salute him.\n  Imagine, to have one line for Christian Syrians and another line for \nMuslim Syrians. What are we reduced to here? What message does that \nsend to the rest of the world? You tell me. It is shameful.\n  So I thank him for that.\n  I don't impugn anybody on the other side. I don't question their \nmotives. I don't think that this is a good idea.\n  The commitment we have to public safety can be upheld even as we \nprovide refuge to some of the world's most vulnerable people. When you \nsleep tonight, think about the world's most vulnerable people, and we \ncan still keep America safe.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I appreciate the gentleman's words. I agree with him. No party claims \na right of both as one protects, one doesn't. But I will say this: Both \nof us have the same commitment to raising our hand and saying we do \nprotect. Both parties have that in common.\n  And as someone who has served, myself, and been in a war zone in Iraq \nand understands what this is about, I appreciate the gentleman's \nfeelings. My problem is this: Go to your district. As was said just a \nfew moments ago, they felt better about no hearings. My question is, go \nto your district and ask your district this question, Mr. Speaker: \nWould you rather have a hearing, or would you rather do something to \nprotect them?\n  Would you rather have hearings or go and do something to protect, and \nthen come back, as we have done hearings, and work moving forward?\n  This is a process that should be together. I am really, frankly, \namazed that we are not together on this because, at this point, it does \nnothing--I repeat, does nothing--to shut the process down. It simply \nadds a layer of protection.\n  It doesn't shut it down. It doesn't defame our humanitarian effort \naround world in which we lead the way in both money and resources, and \nit still allows that mother with those kids to apply and go through the \nprocess.\n  We are simply saying, let's pause a moment and make sure that it is \nnot just the mother with the kids, that there is not somebody else \nabusing the system, there is not somebody else hiding through the \nsystem that wants to come into this country and do us harm.\n  Let's frame this in very simple terms. It is a very simple bill. It \nis only four pages. When we understand that, we can continue.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I am stunned to just listen to the gentleman from Georgia basically \ntell us that you can have either a bill or you can have regular order, \nbut you can't have both.\n  This is the greatest deliberative body on the planet. We are supposed \nto discuss issues. We are supposed to debate issues. Committees are \nsupposed to do their work and report that, then, to the Rules Committee \nto come to the floor. But to suggest that you have a choice here, you \ncan't have both, is ridiculous.\n  The Speaker of the House promised regular order. He has reneged on \nthat promise. It is outrageous, especially on a bill like this, that we \ncannot have amendments; that even the committees of jurisdiction can't \neven do their job. It is an outrage. It is shameful. How can you defend \nthat kind of process?\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee).\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I associate myself with the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts because I think it is important for my colleagues to \nunderstand that, when you talk about process, you talk about responding \nin the right way to crisis.\n  Let me be very clear. The inquiry that my friends on the other side \nof the aisle are making is correct, to find out how we can ensure the \nsafety and security of the American people.\n  I sit on the Homeland Security Committee and, like my friend from New \nJersey, from the very beginning, the tragedy of 9/11.\n  I am the ranking member on the Crime, Terrorism, Homeland Security, \nand Investigations Subcommittee. There is no way that I would stand \nhere and jeopardize the security of the American people.\n  Let me also say, I represent the Catholic diocese, Catholic \nCharities, Lutheran Services, Interfaith Ministries in my district, and \nI would ask my colleague on the other side of the aisle to query them \nabout whether or not they support this legislation.\n  There are people who understand the burdensomeness and the wrongness \nof the direction in which we are going.\n  Is it appropriate to inquire and have a report to Congress to ensure \nthat there are strictures in dealing with those coming to this country \nfrom Syria or anywhere else? Yes, it is. But is it ridiculous to ensure \nor to insist that this 5-year-old little girl must be individually \ncertified by the FBI, the DNI, Counterterrorism, and the CIA, and a \nlong litany of others? That is what we are saying.\n  First of all, there were 23,000 who were recommended by the United \nNations, Syrians, to come into the United States. The Department of \nHomeland Security selected only 7,000 to interview. In that 7,000, only \n2,000 have gone through the process through an 18- to 20-month period.\n  We are saying to the American people, if you want to get rid of ISIS, \ntake the fight to ISIS. That is what we are doing with our allies, to \ndestroy and eliminate ISIS. But to be able to say to our allies around \nthe world that we are putting a stop sign on our refugees from Syria \nthat look like mothers and fathers and old people is absolutely absurd.\n  The inquiry is correct; the process is wrong. Let us not distort this \nto the American people and tell them an untruth, that one side of the \naisle is against the security and the other side is not.\n  Take the fight to the caliphate.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I yield the gentlewoman 15 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. This is an improper approach. You cannot certify a \n5-year-old girl from Syria. She will never get in.\n  The process is extensive, it is definite, it is secure, and we are \nsecuring the American people. Let's work together, as my friend on the \nother side of the aisle has said, and do it right.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Also, I just want to say that it shouldn't have been shocking. There \nwas nothing in part of what I said, that you have to have regular order \nor a bill. I am simply saying, here is the process it went through that \nwe have had here.\n  That is a false dichotomy, Mr. Speaker. It is not true. I never said \nyou couldn't have regular order and have a bill. You have both. In this \ncase, you have a bill.\n\n                              {time}  1015\n\n  The bill says in very plain and simple terms--4 pages--here is what \nit does, and that is where we go at it. To continue to say that it does \nother stuff that it doesn't do is simply wrong. We are just simply \nsaying: We are giving another layer of protection. Take that layer of \nprotection. Let's continue to have our hearings, let's continue to\n\n[[Page H8371]]\n\nhave our debate, and we will be bringing others because we are already \ntaking the fight--and that is another issue that we need to have. It is \ntime to call the radical Islamic terrorists what they are, thugs in \nthis world, rapists, torturers, and murderers. They have no regard for \nreligion and no regard for themselves. They are simply plain thugs.\n  If we want to talk about what we are fighting, then let's put it in \nthose terms. Let's put it in those terms. I prefer that we have an \nextra measure of protection keeping those folks out while we take the \nfight to them because I believe, as the Air Force that I serve and the \nmilitary we have, the fight is coming to them, and the thugs will not \nwin. We are just going to put an extra measure of protection here to \nmake sure they don't come in here while maintaining the integrity of \nour program.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, those of us on our side have no problem with taking the \nfight to the thugs. What we have a problem with is taking the fight to \norphans, widows, young children, and senior citizens who are fleeing \nwar and terror. To turn our backs on those individuals, to basically \nshut this process down--and that is what this would do. By the way, the \nauthors of the bill admitted that last night in the Rules Committee. \nThis is not going to stop the refugee resettlement process in its \nplace. But to do that goes against the very best traditions and values \nof this country.\n  We are better than that.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from California \n(Ms. Lee).\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank the gentleman from \nMassachusetts for yielding and for his leadership on these critical \nissues.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise in strong opposition to the rule, H. Res. 531, \nand also to the bill, H.R. 4038, the American Security Against Foreign \nEnemies Act of 2015. Foreign enemies--refugees.\n  We all watched with horror as unconscionable violence unfolded in \nParis over the weekend, but also in Egypt, in Lebanon, and in Nigeria. \nSo let me just first say that my thoughts and prayers go out to all of \nthose who have been affected by all of these tragedies.\n  But it would be a grave mistake to use these attacks as a pretense to \nclose our doors to the families that are fleeing ISIL in their own \ncountries. The overwhelming majority, of course, are women and \nchildren. Just as the unfortunate attacks of 911 required us to step up \nand lead, we are at that moment again where Members of Congress need to \nlead.\n  This counterproductive bill would immediately shut down the \nresettlement of refugees from countries such as Syria and Iraq while \nsignificantly slowing down--yes, shutting down--our resettlement \nprocess in the future.\n  But, of course, as Members of Congress, our first goal is keeping our \ncountry safe. We all are committed to that, and we do that each and \nevery day. But preventing these people suffering the violence of war--\nthe violence of war--sends the wrong signal first to our allies; to our \nown country. And really, this is not consistent with our national \nsecurity goals. Simply put, closing our doors to these refugees would \nreally be a betrayal of our Nation's most fundamental values.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States already has the lengthiest and most \nrobust screening procedures in the world. Any refugees seeking to come \nto the United States go through a screening process that takes 18 to 24 \nmonths before they can even set foot on United States soil.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield the gentlewoman from California an \nadditional 1 minute.\n  Ms. LEE. Mr. Speaker, our screening process has already involved \nmultiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, \nincluding the Department of Homeland Security, the National \nCounterterrorism Center, and the FBI. These agencies subject those \nseeking refuge in the United States to safeguards, such as biometric \nand biographic checks. Syrian refugees are already subject to \nadditional forms of security screening.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is worth noting--it has been said before, and I will \nsay it again--that of the 2,174 Syrian refugees admitted to the United \nStates since September 11, 2001, not a single one has been arrested or \ndeported on terrorism-related grounds. I am proud that Oakland--in my \ncongressional district--has resettled more Syrian refugees than any \nother East Bay area city in California. Rather than working to shut out \nthose seeking refugee in our country, we should instead be working \ntoward ensuring a regionally led, comprehensive, economic, political, \nand diplomatic solution to the conflicts that have led to the worst \nrefugee crisis since World War II.\n  Mr. Speaker, this would stop the flow of refugees and give them a \nchance to live in their own country free of war and violence. I urge my \ncolleagues to reject this rule and this unnecessary bill.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I find it a great privilege to \nstand here and really not believe that a bill that protects the \ninterests of Americans I find never is unnecessary. In fact, I find it \nneeded at this point.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. \nPalazzo).\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my colleague from Georgia \nfor engaging in this debate. I know it sometimes seems to be a lonely \njob, especially when you are right, you are correct, and you are \nputting the best interests of the American people ahead of partisan \npolitics. So I applaud you, and I applaud all my colleagues who are \ngoing to support this underlying rule and move on to support the final \nbill.\n  I heard a comment while I was following the debate, and someone said \nthat Speaker Ryan has reneged on his promises.\n  Mr. Speaker, if anybody has reneged on their promises, I believe it \nis the President of the United States of America. As Commander in \nChief, he has the ultimate responsibility to lead our troops. But also \nhis number one constitutional responsibility is the common defense of \nthis Nation against all enemies, both domestic and foreign. But he has \nmade America weaker. He has made our military weaker. The international \ncommunity, our friends, no longer trust us, and our enemies no longer \nfear us. So if anybody has reneged on their responsibilities, it is the \nPresident of the United States.\n  Just now, Mr. Speaker, we started to basically really try to cut off \nthe flow of money to ISIS and to the Islamic radicals. For over 2 \nyears, we have been telling them to go after the oil revenues. That is \nwhere they are making their money. They are making it because they are \nsmuggling oil out of the country and selling it on the black market, \nand they are making billions of dollars a year. Just now, we decide, \nwell, we are going to go after the oil tankers that carry the oil so \nthey can make the money, so they can buy weapons, and then they can \nbasically export terrorism all around the world.\n\n  Twenty-five years ago, I remember pretty much this month I was \nactivated for the Persian Gulf War. One thing I do remember is we \nbombed the hell out of our enemies before we sent our men and women in \nuniform with boots on the ground in there. And pretty much, as we all \nknow, within a week, the Iraq war was over with.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, it baffles the mind why we are waiting for the last \nmoment to actually cut off the revenues that are funding this global \njihad and this radical Islam. But, like my colleague from Georgia and \nthose who are going to support this rule and support the bill, we \nunderstand our constitutional responsibilities.\n  Our number one responsibility is the common defense of this Nation at \nhome and abroad. That means taking care of people in our congressional \ndistricts, taking care of people in our State, and taking care of the \nAmerican people. So you are either with us or against us on this.\n  I just want to urge my colleagues to support the underlying rule, \nsupport the bill, and let's start taking care of Americans, and the \nrest will take care of itself.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the remaining time.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to urge my colleagues to defeat the previous \nquestion.\n\n[[Page H8372]]\n\nIf we do, I will offer an amendment to the rule that would simply allow \nus to debate and vote on a reasonable alternative in addition to the \nRepublican bill that we are considering today. This record-breaking \nclosed rule shuts down both Republicans and Democrats, makes it \nimpossible for them to be able to participate in the legislative \nprocess, and prevents us from considering reasonable, commonsense \nalternatives. If we are truly interested in actually enhancing the \nsecurity of the United States and protecting the American people, maybe \nwe ought to come together and behave like adults and work together to \ncome up with a solution that actually works.\n  Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent to insert the text of the \namendment in the Record, along with extraneous material, immediately \nprior to the vote on the previous question.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Massachusetts?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a letter that was \nsigned by 81 NGOs that work in the field of humanitarian relief and \nrefugee resettlement in support of the refugee resettlement program and \nthe Syrian refugee resettlement program.\n\n                                                November 17, 2015.\n       Dear Senator/Representative: As refugee and immigration law \n     experts, humanitarian aid organizations, faith, labor and \n     civil and human rights groups, we write to express our \n     support for the U.S. refugee resettlement program. The world \n     is witnessing the largest refugee crisis since World War II. \n     More than 4 million Syrians have fled from their home country \n     fleeing conflict and violence, and 6.5 million are displaced \n     internally.\n       At a time when the world needs humanitarian leadership, \n     some are now calling for the suspension of the U.S. refugee \n     resettlement program or the imposition of restrictions on \n     funding for Syrians and other groups of refugees. We oppose \n     these proposals and believe they would jeopardize the United \n     States' moral leadership in the world.\n       Syrian refugees are fleeing exactly the kind of terror that \n     unfolded on the streets of Paris. They have suffered violence \n     just like this for almost five years. Most have lost loved \n     ones to persecution and violence, in addition to having had \n     their country, their community, and everything they own \n     brutally taken from them.\n       Refugees are the most thoroughly vetted group of people who \n     come to the United States. Security screenings are rigorous \n     and involve the Department of Homeland Security, the FBI, the \n     Department of Defense and multiple intelligence agencies. \n     Department of Homeland Security officials interview each \n     refugee to determine whether they meet the refugee definition \n     and whether they are admissible to the United States. \n     Refugees undergo a series of biometric and investigatory \n     background checks, including collection and analysis of \n     personal data, fingerprints, photographs, and other \n     background information, all of which is checked against \n     government databases. The entire process typically takes more \n     than two years and often much more before the refugee would \n     arrive in the U.S. In addition the Administration is already \n     taking steps, with its existing authority, to increase the \n     capacity of its security and screening procedures for \n     refugees. There is no need for Congress to impose additional \n     restrictions or security measures.\n       The United States decides which refugees to resettle. \n     Because so few refugees in the world are resettled, the U.S. \n     often chooses the most vulnerable, including refugees who \n     cannot remain safely where they are and families with \n     children who cannot receive the medical care they need to \n     survive.\n       To turn our back on refugees would be to betray our \n     nation's core values. It would send a demoralizing and \n     dangerous message to the world that the United States makes \n     judgments about people based on the country they come from \n     and their religion. This feeds into extremist propaganda and \n     makes us all less safe. We call upon Congress to demonstrate \n     leadership by speaking out against the scapegoating of any \n     group during this time of crisis and to ensure that our \n     nation's humanitarian efforts are robust.\n       The United States is a welcoming country with a diverse \n     society and our resettlement program must continue to reflect \n     this.\n       We can welcome refugees while ensuring our own security. \n     Refugees have enriched communities across our country and \n     have been part of the American fabric for generations. \n     Historically our nation has responded to every major war or \n     conflict and has resettled refugees from Africa, South East \n     Asia, Eastern Europe as well as the Middle-East. Closing the \n     door to refugees would be disastrous for not only the \n     refugees themselves, but their family members in the United \n     States who are waiting for them to arrive, and our reputation \n     in the world.\n           Sincerely,\n       The Advocates for Human Rights, Alliance for Citizenship, \n     American Civil Liberties Union, American Immigration Lawyers \n     Association, American Jewish Committee (AJC), American \n     Refugee Committee, America's Voice Education Fund, Anti-\n     Defamation League, Asian American Legal Defense and Education \n     Fund (AALDEF), Asian Americans Advancing Justice--AAJC, Asian \n     Pacific Institute on Gender-Based Violence, Association of \n     Jewish Family and Children's Agencies.\n       CARE USA, Center for Applied Linguistics, Center for Gender \n     & Refugee Studies, Center for New Community, Center for \n     Victims of Torture, Centro de los Derechos de Inmigrante, \n     Inc., Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) Refugee & \n     Immigration Ministries, Church World Service, Columban Center \n     for Advocacy and Outreach, Concern Worldwide (US) Inc., \n     Conference of Major Superiors of Men, Council on American-\n     Islamic Relations.\n       The Episcopal Church, Ethiopian Community Development \n     Council, Inc., Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, \n     Farmworker Justice, Franciscan Action Network, Friends \n     Committee on National Legislation, Habonim Dror North \n     America, HIAS, Human Rights First, InterAction, International \n     Catholic Migration Commission, International Refugee \n     Assistance Project, International Rescue Committee.\n       Jesuit Conference of Canada and the United States, National \n     Advocacy Office, Jesuit Refugee Service/USA, Jewish Council \n     for Public Affairs, Jewish Labor Committee, Kids in Need of \n     Defense (KIND), Leadership Conference of Women Religious, \n     Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, Mercy-USA for Aid \n     and Development, Mi Familia Vota, Muslim Public Affairs \n     Council, NAFSA: Association of International Educators, \n     National Council of Asian Pacific Americans (NCAPA).\n       National Council of Jewish Women, National Immigrant \n     Justice Center (NIJC), National Immigration Forum, National \n     Immigration Project of the National Lawyers Guild, NETWORK, A \n     National Catholic Social Justice Lobby, OCA--Asian Pacific \n     American Advocates, OneAmerica, ORAM--Organization for \n     Refuge, Asylum & Migration, Oxfam America, Peace Action West, \n     Presbyterian Church USA, Refugees International.\n       Save the Children, South Asian Americans Leading Together \n     (SAALT), Southeast Asia Resource Action Center (SEARAC), \n     STAND: The Student-Led Movement to End Mass Atrocities, \n     SustainUS: U.S. Youth for Justice, Syrian American Medical \n     Society (SAMS), Syria Relief Development, Tahirih Justice \n     Center, T'ruah: The Rabbinic Call for Human Rights.\n       Union for Reform Judaism, Unitarian Universalist \n     Association, United to End Genocide, United Farm Workers, \n     United States Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, United \n     States Conference of Catholic Bishops, UURISE--Unitarian \n     Universalist Refugee and Immigrant Services and Education, \n     Inc., Win Without War, Women's Refugee Commission, Workmen's \n     Circle, World Relief.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. I also include in the Record a statement by the \nCatholic Bishops that say that the U.S. should welcome Syrian refugees \ninto the United States.\n\n [From the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Nov. 17, 2015]\n\nBishops' Migration Chair: U.S. Should Welcome Syrian Refugees, Work for \n                                 Peace\n\n       Baltimore.--Bishop Eusebio Elizondo, Chairman of the United \n     States Conference of Catholic Bishops' (USCCB) Committee on \n     Migration, issued a statement on Syrian refugees during the \n     Bishops' annual General Assembly in Baltimore Nov. 17.\n       Full text of the statement follows:\n\n\n         Statement on Syrian Refugees and the Attacks in Paris\n\n       On behalf of the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops' \n     Committee on Migration, I offer my deepest condolences to the \n     families of the victims of the November 13 attacks in Paris, \n     France and to the French people. I add my voice to all those \n     condemning these attacks and my support to all who are \n     working to ensure such attacks do not occur again--both in \n     France and around the world.\n       I am disturbed, however, by calls from both federal and \n     state officials for an end to the resettlement of Syrian \n     refugees in the United States. These refugees are fleeing \n     terror themselves--violence like we have witnessed in Paris. \n     They are extremely vulnerable families, women, and children \n     who are fleeing for their lives. We cannot and should not \n     blame them for the actions of a terrorist organization.\n       Moreover, refugees to this country must pass security \n     checks and multiple interviews before entering the United \n     States--more than any arrival to the United States. It can \n     take up to two years for a refugee to pass through the whole \n     vetting process. We can look at strengthening the already \n     stringent screening program, but we should continue to \n     welcome those in desperate need.\n       Instead of using this tragedy to scapegoat all refugees, I \n     call upon our public officials to work together to end the \n     Syrian conflict peacefully so the close to 4 million Syrian \n     refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes. \n     Until that goal is achieved, we must work with the world \n     community to provide safe haven to vulnerable and deserving \n     refugees who are simply attempting to survive. As a great \n     nation, the United States must show leadership during this \n     crisis and bring nations together to protect those in danger \n     and bring an end to the conflicts in the Middle East.\n\n\n[[Page H8373]]\n\n\n  \n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I include en bloc in the Record a whole \nbunch of other materials.\n\n    [From Religious Action Center of Reform Judaism, Nov. 17, 2015]\n\n    Reform Movement Rejects Calls for New Limits on Syrian Refugees\n\n       Washington, D.C.--In response to calls for new limits on \n     Syrian refugees in the wake of the recent attacks in Paris, \n     Rabbi Jonah Dov Pesner, Director of the Religious Action \n     Center of Reform Judaism, issued the following statement:\n\n       The recent attacks in Paris have horrified and pained us \n     deeply, as they have all people of goodwill around the world. \n     Our hearts ache for all those directly impacted by these acts \n     of terror. We pray for healing of those who were injured and \n     comfort for the families of all who were lost.\n       These attacks echo the kind of terrible violence that the \n     Syrian people have lived with for the past several years, \n     buffeted between the brutality of President Assad and the \n     barbarism of ISIS. As such, now is the time to ensure the \n     U.S. refugee system remains open to those fleeing Syria and \n     who wish to contribute to and strengthen our nation. Calls to \n     impose new limits on Syrian refugees, to impose a religious \n     test on refugees, or to close our doors altogether ignore the \n     reality that the lengthy and rigorous vetting of refugee \n     applications helps ensure our national security while \n     upholding our historic role as a place of refuge.\n       We cannot allow the violence wrought by ISIS and its allies \n     to overshadow our values as Americans and as Reform Jews. As \n     Jewish tradition teaches, ``and each shall sit under their \n     vine and fig tree, and none shall make them afraid'' (Micah \n     4:4). We can ensure our security and fulfill our highest \n     aspirations as a nation rooted in compassion and commitment \n     to religious liberty. We call on members of Congress to \n     oppose any effort to limit the acceptance of Syrian refugees, \n     just as we urge public officials and figures across the U.S. \n     to reject divisive and inflammatory statements that do not \n     reflect our history as a nation founded by descendants of \n     those who fled persecution in search of freedom.\n       In these trying times, we cannot lose sight of our values \n     and what we stand for. To repair the brokenness in our world, \n     we must stand united with those who reject violence and \n     divisiveness and instead support those who uphold healing, \n     safety and security for all.\n                                  ____\n\n\nRanking Members Schiff, Thompson and Lofgren Joint Statement on Syrian \n                  Refugee Bill on House Floor Tomorrow\n\n         [For Immediate Release--Wednesday, November 18, 2015]\n\n       Washington, DC.--Today, Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA), Ranking \n     Member of the House Permanent Select Committee on \n     Intelligence, Rep. Bennie G. Thompson (D-MS), Ranking Member \n     of the Committee on Homeland Security, and Rep. Zoe Lofgren \n     (D-CA), Ranking Member of the Judiciary Committee's \n     Subcommittee on Immigration and Border Security, released the \n     following statement:\n       ``For many Americans, the horrendous loss of life and \n     scenes of chaos of the Paris terrorist attacks harkened back \n     to our own experience in the wake of September 11th. Our top \n     priority is and will always remain the safety of the American \n     people. And it is in these times that the core values of our \n     nation are tested. Welcoming refugees who are fleeing \n     persecution and war is the humane--and American--thing to do. \n     However, some in Congress intend to use this tragedy to shut \n     down the U.S. refugee program, turning our backs on victims \n     fleeing the horrors of ISIS and the Assad regime.\n       ``We must constantly re-evaluate and refine our refugee \n     screening to find ways to strengthen the existing system and \n     ensure that we are maintaining the most rigorous vetting \n     system in the world. Refugees, and refugees from this region \n     specifically, already undergo a far more rigorous screening \n     process than anyone else seeking admission to this country, \n     including background checks, national security vetting, \n     biometric identifiers, and interviews. The process takes on \n     average between 18 to 24 months, and longer in many cases, \n     before a refugee steps foot on U.S. soil. The House \n     Republican legislation would immediately shut down all \n     refugee resettlement from Syria and Iraq--possibly for many \n     years--and severely handicap future refugee resettlement \n     around the world.\n       ``Our commitment to refugees and the security of the \n     American people are not mutually exclusive. We believe that \n     turning our backs on those escaping persecution, many of them \n     religious minorities and victims of terrorism, runs counter \n     to the proud and generous heritage of the United States--a \n     country of immigrants--that has always helped those in need \n     in the most trying times.''\n                                  ____\n\n\n                   Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                  H.R. 4038--American SAFE Act of 2015\n\n               (Rep. McCaul, R-TX, and Rep. Hudson, R-NC)\n\n       The Administration's highest priority is to ensure the \n     safety and security of the American people. That is why \n     refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, \n     considered for admission to the United States undergo the \n     most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone \n     admitted into the United States. This legislation would \n     introduce unnecessary and impractical requirements that would \n     unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most \n     vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of \n     terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle \n     East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis. The \n     Administration therefore strongly opposes H.R. 4038.\n       The current screening process involves multiple Federal \n     intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, \n     including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland \n     Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring \n     that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country. \n     These safeguards include biometric (fingerprint) and \n     biographic checks, medical screenings, and a lengthy \n     interview by specially trained DHS officers who scrutinize \n     the applicant's explanation of individual circumstances to \n     assess whether the applicant meets statutory requirements to \n     qualify as a refugee and that he or she does not present \n     security concerns to the United States. Mindful of the \n     particular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees--\n     who have had their lives uprooted by conflict and continue to \n     live amid conditions so harsh that many set out on dangerous, \n     often deadly, journeys seeking new places of refuge--go \n     through additional forms of security screening, including a \n     thorough pre-interview analysis of each individual's refugee \n     application. Additionally, DHS interviewers receive \n     extensive, Syria-specific training before meeting with \n     refugee applicants. Of the 2,174 Syrian refugees admitted to \n     the United States since September 11, 2001, not a single one \n     has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds.\n       The certification requirement at the core of H.R. 4038 is \n     untenable and would provide no meaningful additional security \n     for the American people, instead serving only to create \n     significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a \n     vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national \n     security objectives. No refugee is approved for travel to the \n     United States under the current system until the full array \n     of required security vetting measures have been completed. \n     Thus, the substantive result sought through this draft \n     legislation is already embedded into the program. The \n     Administration recognizes the importance of a strong, \n     evolving security screening in our refugee admissions program \n     and devotes considerable resources to continually improving \n     the Nation's robust security screening protocols. The \n     measures called for in this bill would divert resources from \n     these efforts.\n       Given the lives at stake and the critical importance to our \n     partners in the Middle East and Europe of American leadership \n     in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, if the President \n     were presented with H.R. 4038, he would veto the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n\n           [From U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants]\n\n    Security Screening of Refugees Admitted to the United States: A \n                       Detailed, Rigorous Process\n\n       Resettlement is considered a durable solution for refugees \n     who cannot return to their countries of origin or integrate \n     into the current country that is hosting them. Resettlement \n     to a country like the U.S. presents a life-saving alternative \n     for a very small number of refugees around the world (less \n     than one half of one percent). Refugees seeking resettlement \n     in the United States must pass through a number of steps \n     aimed at ensuring that they will not pose a security risk to \n     the United States.\n\n\n                                 STEP 1\n\n       Refugee Status: In most cases the UN High Commissioner for \n     Refugees (UNHCR) determines that the individual qualifies as \n     a refugee under international law. A refugee is someone who \n     has fled from his or her home country and cannot return \n     because he or she has a well-founded fear of persecution \n     based on religion, race, nationality, political opinion or \n     membership in a particular social group.\n\n\n                                 STEP 2\n\n       Referral to the United States: A refugee that meets one of \n     the criteria for resettlement in the United States is \n     referred to the U.S. government by UNHCR, a U.S. Embassy, or \n     a trained Non-Governmental Organization.\n\n\n                                 STEP 3\n\n       Resettlement Support Center: A Resettlement Support Center \n     (RSC), contracted by the U.S. Department of State, compiles \n     the refugee's personal data and background information for \n     the security clearance process and to present to the U.S. \n     Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for an in-person \n     interview.\n\n\n                                 STEP 4\n\n       Security Clearance Process: With information collected by \n     the RSC, a number of security checks are conducted. The State \n     Department runs the names of all refugees referred to the \n     United States for resettlement through a standard CLASS \n     (Consular Lookout and Support System) name check. In \n     addition, enhanced interagency security checks were phased in \n     beginning in 2008 and applied to all refugee applicants by \n     2010.\n\n\n                                 STEP 5\n\n       Security Clearance Process: Certain refugees undergo an \n     additional security review called a Security Advisory Opinion \n     (SAO).\n\n[[Page H8374]]\n\n     These cases require a positive SAO clearance from a number of \n     U.S. law enforcement and intelligence agencies in order to \n     continue the resettlement process. When required, this step \n     runs concurrently with Step 4.\n\n\n                                 STEP 6\n\n       Security Clearance Process: Refugees who meet the minimum \n     age requirement have their fingerprints and photograph taken \n     by a trained U.S. government employee, usually on the same \n     day as their DHS interview. The fingerprints are then checked \n     against various U.S. government databases and information on \n     any matches is reviewed by DHS.\n\n\n                                 STEP 7\n\n       In-person Interview: All refugee applicants are interviewed \n     by an officer from DHS's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration \n     Services (USCIS). A trained officer will travel to the \n     country of asylum* to conduct a detailed, face-to-face \n     interview with each refugee applicant being considered for \n     resettlement. Based on the information in the refugee's case \n     file and on the interview, the DHS officer will determine if \n     the individual qualifies as a refugee and is admissible under \n     U.S. law.\n\n\n                                 STEP 8\n\n       DHS Approval: If the USCIS officer finds that the \n     individual qualifies as a refugee and meets other U.S. \n     admission criteria, the officer will conditionally approve \n     the refugee's application for resettlement and submit it to \n     the U.S. Department of State for final processing. \n     Conditional approvals become final once the results of all \n     security checks (Steps 4, 5, and 6) have been received and \n     cleared.\n\n\n                                 STEP 9\n\n       Medical Screening: All refugee applicants approved for \n     resettlement in the U.S. are required to undergo medical \n     screening conducted by the International Organization for \n     Migration or a physician designated by the U.S. Embassy.\n\n\n                                STEP 10\n\n       Matching Refugees with a Sponsor Agency: Every refugee is \n     assigned to a Voluntary Agency in the U.S., such as the U.S. \n     Committee for Refugees and Immigrants (USCRI). USCRI will \n     place refugees with a local partner agency or office that \n     will assist refugees upon their arrival in the U.S.\n\n\n                                STEP 11\n\n       Cultural Orientation: In addition, refugees approved for \n     resettlement are offered cultural orientation while waiting \n     for final processing, to prepare them for their journey to \n     and initial resettlement in the United States.\n\n\n                                STEP 12\n\n       Security Clearance Process: Prior to departure to the U.S., \n     a second interagency check is conducted for most refugees to \n     check for any new information. Refugees must clear this check \n     in order to depart to the U.S.\n\n\n                                STEP 13\n\n       Admission to the United States: Upon arrival at one of five \n     U.S. airports designated as ports of entry for refugee \n     admissions, a Customs and Border Protection (CBP) officer \n     will review the refugee documentation and conduct additional \n     security checks to ensure that the arriving refugee is the \n     same person who was screened and approved for admission to \n     the United States.\n       *Note that under limited circumstances, refugee applicants \n     may be interviewed in their home country rather than in a \n     country of asylum.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                  [From Human Rights First, Nov. 2015]\n\n          Refugee Resettlement--Security Screening Information\n\n       Refugees to the United States are more stringently screened \n     and vetted than any other group allowed to enter the country.\n       The U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees first registers \n     refugees, interviews them, takes biometric data and \n     background information. These refugees overwhelmingly women \n     and children have been Ewing in Jordan, Turkey or other \n     frontline refugee-hosting countries for years, struggling to \n     survive. UNHCR has data from its regular interactions with \n     these refugees over the years. Resettlement helps support the \n     stability of nations that are key U.S. allies, as they are \n     straining under the pressure of hosting so many refugees. \n     Only those who pass the U.N. assessment are referred to the \n     United States for resettlement. At least 18,000 have already \n     been through the U.S. process and are awaiting U.S. \n     government consideration and review.\n       The U.S. government then conducts its own extremely \n     rigorous screening process, including health checks, repeated \n     biometric checks, several layers of biographical and \n     background screening, and in-person interviews by specially-\n     trained officers. Multiple agencies are involved, including \n     the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, the State Department, \n     the Department of Homeland Security, the National \n     Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Defense and U.S. \n     intelligence agencies. DNS has added an additional country-\n     specific layer of review for Syrian refugee applications, \n     which includes extra screening for national security risks.\n       Secretary Jeh Johnson outlined this process in \n     Congressional testimony in October 2015: ``With regard to the \n     current refugee crisis, the U.S. is committed to providing \n     refuge to some of the world's most vulnerable people, while \n     carefully screening refugees for security concerns before \n     admitting them to the United States. The reality is that, \n     with improvements to the process we have made over time, \n     refugees are subject to the highest level of security checks. \n     DHS works in concert with the Department of State, the \n     Department of Defense, the National Counterterrorism Center, \n     and the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center for the screening \n     and vetting of refugees. The U.S. Government conducts both \n     biographic and biometric checks on refugee applications, \n     including security vetting that takes place at multiple \n     junctures in the application process, and even just before \n     arrival to account for changes in intelligence. All refugees \n     admitted to the United States, including those from Syria, \n     will be subject to this stringent security screening. Acting \n     on my direction, USCIS has developed additional protocols to \n     aid in the identification of security concerns with regard to \n     the Syrian population, and the entire Department, along with \n     the interagency, is committed to continual improvement of \n     overall security vetting, as new techniques or sources of \n     information are identified.''\n       More specifically, the U.S. refugee vetting process for \n     Syrian refugees includes the following elements as outlined \n     by Department of Homeland Security officials.\n       Department of Homeland Security Interviews: Refugees are \n     interviewed by DHS-USCIS officers to determine whether or not \n     they can be approved for resettlement to the United States. \n     These interviews are conducted while refugees are still \n     abroad.\n       Consular Lookout and Watch List Check: Biographic checks \n     are conducted against the State Department's Consular Lookout \n     and Support System (CLASS)--which includes watch list \n     information.\n       Security Advisory Opinions from Intelligence and Other \n     Agencies: DHS seeks Security Advisory Opinions (SAOs) from \n     law enforcement and intelligence communities for cases that \n     meet certain criteria.\n       National Counterterrorism Center Checks with Intelligence \n     Agency Support: Interagency checks, known as ``IAC's,'' are \n     conducted with the National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) \n     for all refugee applicants within a designated age range, \n     regardless of nationality. In addition, expanded intelligence \n     community support was added to the IAC process in July 2010, \n     and recurrent vetting was added in 2015 so that any \n     intervening derogatory information that is identified after \n     the initial check has cleared but before the applicant has \n     traveled to the United States will be provided to DHS.\n       DHS and FBI BlometrIc Checks: Fingerprints are screened \n     against the vast biometric holdings of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation's Next Generation Identification system, and \n     are screened and enrolled in DHS's Automated Biometric \n     Identification System (IDENT). Through IDENT, the applicant's \n     fingerprints are screened not only against watch fist \n     information, but also for previous immigration encounters in \n     the United States and overseas--including cases in which the \n     applicant previously applied for a visa at a U.S. embassy.\n       Department of Defense Biometric Screening: Biometric \n     screening is also conducted through the Department of Defense \n     (DOD) Automated Biometric Identification System (ABIS). ABIS \n     contains a variety of records, including fingerprint records \n     captured in Iraq. ABIS screening has been expanded to refugee \n     applicants of all nationalities who fall within the \n     prescribed age ranges.\n       Enhanced Review for Syrian Cases: In addition to the many \n     biometric and biographic checks conducted, DHS-USCIS has \n     instituted additional review of Syrian refugee applications. \n     Before being scheduled for interview by a DHS-USCIS officer \n     (while the refugee is still abroad), Syrian cases are \n     reviewed at DHS-USCIS headquarters. All cases that meet \n     certain criteria are referred to the DHS-USCIS Fraud \n     Detection and National Security Directorate (FDNS) for \n     additional review and research. FDNS conducts open-source and \n     classified research on referred cases and synthesizes an \n     assessment for use by the interviewing officer. This \n     information provides case-specific context relating to \n     country conditions and regional activity, and is used by the \n     interviewing officer to inform lines of inquiry related to \n     the applicant's eligibility and credibility. DHS-USCIS \n     reports that FDNS engages with law enforcement and \n     intelligence community members for assistance with identity \n     verification and acquisition of additional information.\n       Additional Screening Checks on Entry: When they travel to \n     the United States, refugees are subject to screening \n     conducted by DHSU.S. Customs and Border Protection's National \n     Targeting Center-Passenger and the Transportation Security \n     Administration's Secure Flight program prior to their \n     admission to the United States, as is the case with all \n     individuals traveling to the United States regardless of \n     immigration program.\n\n\n                          Additional Resources\n\n       The Wall Street Journal in a video outlines the steps a \n     refugee must go through to reach the United States.\n       The New Yorlc Times in an interactive map shows where \n     Syrian refugees currently reside.\n       David Miliband: ``There are many ways to come to the United \n     States. Comparatively the refugee resettlement program is the \n     most difficult short of swimming the Atlantic.''\n       Fran Townsend: ``There are no easy answers in Syria, but \n     it's time to stop acting as if the problems there are too \n     hard or too complicated. While we cannot right the wrong of \n     the current poky failure, it is still possible to act now to \n     both alleviate the consequent suffering and mitigate the \n     potential future.''\n\n[[Page H8375]]\n\n       Governor Nikki Haley: ``These are people who have protected \n     our troops, these are people who have been persecuted for \n     being Christian . . . these are people who we took in because \n     they were unsafe where they were.''\n       Finally, states cannot unilaterally block resettlement. \n     Governors do not have the legal authority to determine who \n     lives in their states. When refugees are legally admitted to \n     the United States they have the right to move freely \n     throughout the country.\n\n  Mr. McGOVERN. Mr. Speaker, I do want to say one thing. It strikes me, \nas we are having this debate here, that I can't help but take note of \ntheir response in France toward the Syrian refugees. Yesterday, French \nPresident Francois Hollande promised to honor his commitment to take in \ntens of thousands of refugees, welcoming 30,000 refugees over the next \n2 years. That is 6,000 more than he committed to in September. He also \nannounced $53.3 million to develop housing for refugees. We have all \ninvoked the terrible tragedy that happened in France. Let's follow \nFrance's example and be a secure shelter for those most in need.\n  As I listen to the debate here, one of the troubling things to me is \nthat there doesn't ever seem to be a tragedy that my friends on the \nother side of the aisle don't want to exploit for political gain, and I \nthink today is no exception. A horrendous terrorist attack happened in \nParis, an attack that has shocked the entire world. This is being used \nas an excuse to pass what I consider an ugly bill because this would \nshut down a refugee resettlement for Syrians and Iraqis.\n  This bill is aimed at fueling fear rather than protecting the \nAmerican people. We have an exhaustive screening process for refugees \nalready in place. It takes years for a refugee from Syria to be able to \nbe admitted to the United States--years. Can we improve the system? \nAbsolutely. But the opportunity to do that requires us to consult with \none another and to put the results ahead of political gain. But that is \nnot what happened. We had a bill before the Rules Committee that never \nwent through committee, that never was marked up, the content of which \nwas not shared with the Democrats, and a lot of Republicans were locked \nout of the process. Here we are with a political document more than \nsomething that is going to do anything to help these people fleeing \nviolence or help enhance our security. Now, that might be a nice sound \nbite in your next campaign, but it is an awful thing to do to a group \nof people fleeing war and terror.\n  Who are these people? They are, as the President stated, widows and \norphans mostly. They are old people trying to be reunited with distant \nfamily members in the United States. They are people who are fleeing \nfor their lives and who are fleeing the worst terror imaginable. That \nused to mean something in this Chamber. We used to care about these \nthings in a bipartisan way. Apparently, no more.\n  This Congress is losing its humanity. Here is the deal: we are \nbehaving in a way that I think reinforces what the terrorists are \ntrying to communicate to the rest of the world, which is that somehow \nwe don't care about people from certain parts of the world or we don't \ncare about people who happen to be Muslim. We have had a lot of people \non the other side of the aisle who have talked about we ought to have a \nreligious test here and very little condemnation in response to that \nfrom my friends on the other side of the aisle.\n  Mr. Speaker, last night in the Rules Committee, my Republican friends \nsaid that all we are doing is responding to public opinion. Our job is \nto be more than just a political weathervane. We have an obligation to \nmake sure that we state the facts--the real facts. We have an \nobligation to tell the truth. We have an obligation to help put issues \nin perspective. And, in short, we have an obligation to lead on issues \nlike this and not be so jittery to pursue policies that we all know are \nwrong.\n  So we are here with a bill that my friends say is so important that \nthere could be no hearings and no markup on, a bill that is so \nimportant that there could be no consultation on, a bill that is so \nimportant that nobody can offer an amendment on, and we have a bill \nthat is coming before us in an absolutely closed process.\n  Let me just close by expressing my deep frustration with this place \nand how it is being run. For some time now, I have watched as my \nRepublican friends have regularly turned their backs on the most \nvulnerable populations. There is no more vulnerable population--no more \nvulnerable group of people on this planet--than refugees fleeing god-\nawful war and terror. Yet, today, they are being thrown under the bus \nfor political gain. They are being demonized. They are being \ncharacterized as terrorists. Young children, 3-year-old girls, widowed \nmothers, and grandmothers are being demonized as terrorists.\n\n                              {time}  1030\n\n  And for what? The American people, I think, expect more from us. What \nwe are doing here today is not about protecting the American people. It \nis not about helping people fleeing war and violence. This is \npolitical. That makes what is happening here today not only \ndisappointing but, I would say, disgusting.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  I share many times the frustration my friend from Massachusetts has \nabout this place. When I look at what is going on today, my \nfrustration, frankly, on the floor here has probably grown, considering \nthat we talk about everything else except what the bill actually does. \nWe throw up every picture of everything.\n  I am not sure at what point today--and I can go back through my \nremarks. I am not sure where I ever disparaged a refugee, ever said \nthat the inhumanity and suffering that is going on because of a bunch \nof thugs called the Islamic State, that these folks do not need to have \na place to go or humanitarian help, which America has led on from the \nbeginning. It is easy to say that.\n  As the gentleman is fond of saying, Mr. Speaker, it makes political \npoints. Well, the same is true for him and true for our folks across \nthe aisle. It makes political points for them. The problem is it is not \nin the bill. The problem is it is adding an extra layer.\n  There has been discussion here today about the political whims. Look, \nI believe that what is happening right now is a test of two things: \nthermometers and thermostats.\n  This administration is a pretty good thermometer. They will look out \nand tell you what they believe the temperature is, and they react to \nthe world opinion.\n  I believe today the Republican majority is acting as a thermostat and \nmoving the temperature and moving the awareness. Because I do not \nbelieve that an event could be ignored if it is not being used. It is \nsaying there is a warning sign. It is like a warning sign on your \nvehicle. You can ignore it, and when it breaks down, you wonder what \nhappened; or you can say, here is a warning sign, here is what is going \non in the world.\n  All we are asking for is certification from our highest officials in \nsecurity to say these folks have another level of check so that we can \nensure our homeland is protected.\n  One attack on American soil is too many. The Islamic State has been \nclear in their desire to bring America to her knees. The underlying \nlegislation won't change that. But as the chairman of the Judiciary \nCommittee stated last night, it will put this administration on notice \nthat Congress will not be silent.\n  We will take up the national security mantle that this White House \nhas so carelessly disregarded. In the weeks ahead, you can expect this \nbody to bring forward additional legislation reforming both our refugee \nand visa waiver programs.\n  There is no loophole or vulnerability that ISIS won't seek to use to \nkill and destroy, and there is no loophole or vulnerability the House \nRepublicans aren't committed and determined to fix, and I desperately \nask my friends across the aisle to join us.\n  Our Nation is a beacon of freedom and hope, and no force of evil will \never change that. No terrorist will ever cause Republicans in this body \nto shy away from our duty to our citizens or our duty to the world, and \nfor that I believe both sides need to come together.\n  The President stated ISIS is the JV. I believe the families and loved \nones of the recent attacks on an airplane in Paris would not say that, \nin fact, would say otherwise.\n\n[[Page H8376]]\n\n  The administration's refusal to look the Islamic State in the eye and \ndeclare with a resounding voice that they will be defeated is \ndevastating, but it isn't the end. Where this White House has failed, \nCongress will succeed. We will work tirelessly to restore the faith and \ntrust of the American people. We will replace political posturing with \npolicy priorities dealing with our national security, as opposed to \nthose of a more liberal strategy that we have heard today.\n  Look, I know my friends across the aisle share the same heart. We \ngrieve the lives lost. We grieve for those who are caught up in war and \ncaught up in the devastating attacks by a group of people who, \nfrankly--ISIS--have no soul. They are blank. Because if you are \nagreeable to do the atrocities that they are doing, you just have no \npart in a civilized world. You have no part in being acknowledged \nexcept for the animals that you are.\n  I recognize they are in an impossible position of choosing either the \nsafety of their constituents or the political strategy of the \nPresident--I understand that--across the aisle.\n  My hope is that today--today--will be different, that we don't take \nthe easy ``no'' vote, that we will have the moral courage to make the \ndecision that says ``no'' to terrorism and ``yes'' to the American \npeople, a vote that will ensure that our country remains a safe haven \nfor those the rest of the world has abandoned.\n  Again, let me repeat this again, because it has been said. I guess if \nwe say it enough, we believe it to be true.\n  This does not stop the program. It simply says that, until we can \ncertify, we are going to make sure that there is an extra level of \nprotection for the people. It does not shut the program down.\n  A vote in support of this rule and for H.R. 4038 is what we need. And \nafter we bow our heads in thanks next week, filled with gratitude for \nthose who have gone before, we will return with renewed commitment to \nfurther reforms.\n  Evil will not win. ISIS will not win. With the steadfast spirit and \ncourage of conviction of those who came before, those who gave their \nlives, we will not let the torch of freedom go out on our watch, and we \nwill continue to fight for those in our country, for their safety, our \nsons and daughters, as we continue this fight.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nthe rule governing debate on this bill and the underlying bill H.R. \n4038, the ``American Security Against Enemies Act of 2015'' (America \nSAFE Act).\n  This bill represents a rush to judgement.\n  It has been rushed to the floor without the regular order \ndeliberative process promised by the House Leadership.\n  H.R. 4038 was introduced on Tuesday, November 17, 2015, in violation \nof House Rules, without consideration or review by the House oversight \ncommittees.\n  Today, November 19, 2015 it is on the floor for debate and votes.\n  This bill does not further the national security interest of our \ncountry--in fact it harms those interests.\n  The United States does have an urgent need to deal with the \nhumanitarian crisis that is unfolding in the wake of ISIS/ISIL \naggression in Syria and Iraq.\n  There are 60 million displaced persons because of the war.\n  The Syrian/Iraqi conflict has claimed over 240,000 lives.\n  Mr. Speaker, this bill is written as if no process exists for vetting \nIraqi or Syrian refugees.\n  In fact a very rigorous process is in place that has been honed over \nthe past several years by intelligence and law enforcement agencies.\n  They have established and perfected an intense form of screening for \nSyrians called the ``Syrian Enhanced Review.''\n  The American SAFE Act requires a FBI background check for every \nrefugee from Iraq and Syria who applies for asylum in the United \nStates, when a much better process is in place that requires the \nintelligence agencies and the Department of Defense to vet applicants.\n  This bill provides that no refugee from Iraq or Syria can be granted \nasylum in the United States unless the Director of the FBI, the \nSecretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence each make an independent determination and concur \nunanimously that the applicant for asylum poses no threat to the \nnational security of the United States.\n  The FBI is a domestic law enforcement agency--they have an \ninternational presence, but their focus is domestic.\n  The agencies with an international focus such as the State \nDepartment, DoD, and intelligence agencies under the leadership of DHS \nare the experts.\n  The House process for the consideration and deliberation of \nlegislation is intended to prevent bad bills from coming to the floor \nfor a vote.\n  This bill was drafted in haste--in application it would require a 5 \nyear old child who is Syrian to have to get the FBI, DHS, DoD, and DNI \nto agree that she poses no threat to the United States or its people.\n  This bill is doing damage to our nation's foreign policy interest by \nsending a signal to our allies, who are doing much more than the United \nStates is doing to relieve the suffering of Syrian refugees, while also \nfacing the threat of terrorism every day.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me commend Homeland Security Committee Chairman \nMcCaul, the lead sponsor of the bill before us, with whom I have worked \nclosely and reached agreement on many matters critical to the security \nof our homeland.\n  Homeland Security Committee Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson \nand Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration Ranking Member \nLofgren are dedicated public servants whose actions are always \nmotivated by their commitment to keep our nation safe and secure.\n  This bill is purported by supporters as not stopping the refugee \nprocess for Iraq and Syria.\n  The bill in its language does stop the process--some like to call it \na pause, but is a dead stop in the processing of applications from \nIraqi and Syrian refugees.\n  They have not read the bill or they do not understand the \nconsequences of the language that requires certification by the FBI, \nDHS, DoD, and DNI that a refugee poses no threat'' in the legislation \nif they believe that this bill would not end the refugee process for \nIraqi and Syrian applicants.\n  The bill calls for 100% certification by the FBI, DHS, DoD, and DNI \nthat no refugee is a threat.\n  No professional security or law enforcement professional will give \nanyone a 100% guarantee about anything.\n  They will not provide a 100% guarantee because they believe that \nsomething or someone is a threat--they will not provide a guarantee \nbecause it is grossly unprofessional to do so and we should never ask \nthem to do this.\n  On its face H.R. 4038 would end any hope of asylum in the United \nStates for any refugee from Iraq or Syria.\n  The U.S. screening process in place is focused upon applications from \nwomen with children, orphans, the seriously ill and the elderly.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4038 is not necessary at this time because our \nnation already has in place the world's most rigorous screening process \nfor refugees seeking asylum.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are other alternatives to the draconian approach \nof H.R. 4038, takes such as the bill introduced by Ranking Members \nThompson and Lofgren.\n  The President is another solution for those who seek reassurance that \nevery precaution is being taken--he is in a position to certify to the \nCongress and the American people that the process is prudent and \ncareful in its actions regarding refugees seeking entrance into the \nUnited States.\n  It is helpful to recount briefly the critical elements of that \nscreening process.\n  Every applicant for asylum must:\n  1. register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n  2. provide background information, including what caused him or her \nto flee their home country (a ready means of comparing information \nprovided by more than one million refugees to further verify the \nvalidity of the information provided);\n  3. meet one of five legal qualifications: threat of violence based on \nrace, religion or faith or national origin; political beliefs; or \nmembership in a targeted social group.\n  4. undergo a rigorous background check during which investigators \nfact-check the refugee's biography to ensure consistency with published \nor documented reports of events such as bombings or other violence;\n  5. be subjected to biometric tests conducted by the Department of \nDefense, in conjunction with other federal agencies (the U.S. military \nhas an extensive biometric data base on Iraqis from its time in Iraq); \nand\n  6. sit for intensive in-person interviews, which may take months or \nyears before they are conducted.\n  If, during the screening process, a person from Syria gives responses \nthat raise red flags he or she is selected for more intense examination \nby U.S. intelligence agencies.\n  The process for those refugees from the conflict area who have \nentered the United States began with the High Commissioner for Refugees \nwho referred 22,000 applicants to the United States for consideration.\n  The United States through its process only allowed 7,000 for further \nconsideration for admittance and in its final decision permitted\n\n[[Page H8377]]\n\n2,000 individuals to be cleared for entrance into the country.\n  The demographic breakdown of those Syrians who have been approved for \nrefugee status to come to the United States is as follows: children, \n50%; persons over the age of 60, 25%; combat age males, 2%.\n  H.R. 4038 has come to the floor too fast for such a serious decision \nand without considering the arduous process that is in place to screen \nall refugees, not just those from Iraq and Syria.\n  The last thing a terrorist would want is to be a refugee--living in \nthe harsh environment of a refugee camp for two years.\n  Refugees are the victims of terrorists--ISIS/ISIL does not love \nthem--they want to murder every last one of them, because they will not \nbow to them.\n  This rule for this bill troubles me because it has been constructed \non tools that allow Congress to act during times of crisis or \nemergencies.\n  Mr. Speaker a 2-year process does not pose any emergency by any \ndefinition that can be devised.\n  I cannot support this bill, but I an committed to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground.\n  The material previously referred to by Mr. McGovern is as follows:\n\n  An Amendment to H. Res. 531 Offered by Mr. McGovern of Massachusetts\n\n       At the end of the resolution, add the following new \n     sections:\n       Sec 2. Immediately upon adoption of this resolution the \n     Speaker shall, pursuant to clause 2(b) of rule XVIII, declare \n     the House resolved into the Committee of the Whole House on \n     the state of the Union for consideration of the bill (H.R. \n     4079) to require that supplemental certifications and \n     identity verifications be completed prior to the admission of \n     refugees. The first reading of the bill shall be dispensed \n     with. All points of order against consideration of the bill \n     are waived. General debate shall be confined to the bill and \n     shall not exceed one hour equally divided and controlled by \n     the chair and ranking minority member of the Committee on the \n     Judiciary. After general debate the bill shall be considered \n     for amendment under the five-minute rule. All points of order \n     against provisions in the bill are waived. At the conclusion \n     of consideration of the bill for amendment the Committee \n     shall rise and report the bill to the House with such \n     amendments as may have been adopted. The previous question \n     shall be considered as ordered on the bill and amendments \n     thereto to final passage without intervening motion except \n     one motion to recommit with or without instructions. If the \n     Committee of the Whole rises and reports that it has come to \n     no resolution on the bill, then on the next legislative day \n     the House shall, immediately after the third daily order of \n     business under clause 1 of rule XIV, resolve into the \n     Committee of the Whole for further consideration of the bill.\n       Sec. 3. Clause 1(c) of rule XIX shall not apply to the \n     consideration of H.R. 4079.\n                                  ____\n\n\n        The Vote on the Previous Question: What It Really Means\n\n       This vote, the vote on whether to order the previous \n     question on a special rule, is not merely a procedural vote. \n     A vote against ordering the previous question is a vote \n     against the Republican majority agenda and a vote to allow \n     the Democratic minority to offer an alternative plan. It is a \n     vote about what the House should be debating.\n       Mr. Clarence Cannon's Precedents of the House of \n     Representatives (VI, 308-311), describes the vote on the \n     previous question on the rule as ``a motion to direct or \n     control the consideration of the subject before the House \n     being made by the Member in charge.'' To defeat the previous \n     question is to give the opposition a chance to decide the \n     subject before the House. Cannon cites the Speaker's ruling \n     of January 13, 1920, to the effect that ``the refusal of the \n     House to sustain the demand for the previous question passes \n     the control of the resolution to the opposition'' in order to \n     offer an amendment. On March 15, 1909, a member of the \n     majority party offered a rule resolution. The House defeated \n     the previous question and a member of the opposition rose to \n     a parliamentary inquiry, asking who was entitled to \n     recognition. Speaker Joseph G. Cannon (R-Illinois) said: \n     ``The previous question having been refused, the gentleman \n     from New York, Mr. Fitzgerald, who had asked the gentleman to \n     yield to him for an amendment, is entitled to the first \n     recognition.''\n       The Republican majority may say ``the vote on the previous \n     question is simply a vote on whether to proceed to an \n     immediate vote on adopting the resolution . . . [and] has no \n     substantive legislative or policy implications whatsoever.'' \n     But that is not what they have always said. Listen to the \n     Republican Leadership Manual on the Legislative Process in \n     the United States House of Representatives, (6th edition, \n     page 135). Here's how the Republicans describe the previous \n     question vote in their own manual: ``Although it is generally \n     not possible to amend the rule because the majority Member \n     controlling the time will not yield for the purpose of \n     offering an amendment, the same result may be achieved by \n     voting down the previous question on the rule. . . . When the \n     motion for the previous question is defeated, control of the \n     time passes to the Member who led the opposition to ordering \n     the previous question. That Member, because he then controls \n     the time, may offer an amendment to the rule, or yield for \n     the purpose of amendment.''\n       In Deschler's Procedure in the U.S. House of \n     Representatives, the subchapter titled ``Amending Special \n     Rules'' states: ``a refusal to order the previous question on \n     such a rule [a special rule reported from the Committee on \n     Rules] opens the resolution to amendment and further \n     debate.'' (Chapter 21, section 21.2) Section 21.3 continues: \n     ``Upon rejection of the motion for the previous question on a \n     resolution reported from the Committee on Rules, control \n     shifts to the Member leading the opposition to the previous \n     question, who may offer a proper amendment or motion and who \n     controls the time for debate thereon.''\n       Clearly, the vote on the previous question on a rule does \n     have substantive policy implications. It is one of the only \n     available tools for those who oppose the Republican \n     majority's agenda and allows those with alternative views the \n     opportunity to offer an alternative plan.\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my \ntime, and I move the previous question on the resolution.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on ordering the previous \nquestion.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. McGOVERN.

Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n\n[[Page H8379]]\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Ms. MATSUI. I am opposed to it in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Ms. Matsui moves to recommit the bill H.R. 3189 to the \n     Committee on Financial Services with instructions to report \n     the same back to the House forthwith with the following \n     amendment:\n       Page 43, line 25, strike the quotation marks and final \n     period and insert after such line the following:\n       ``(H) Treatment of certain companies.--The Board shall seek \n     to ensure that any company convicted of any felony or \n     misdemeanor or that has been made subject to any judicial or \n     administrative decree or order arising out of misconduct that \n     harms the financial health of seniors is prohibited from \n     receiving a loan or other financial assistance under this \n     paragraph, if the Board determines such prohibition is in the \n     nation's economic interest.''.\n\n  Ms. MATSUI (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent \nto dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from California?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n                              {time}  1115\n\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill \nwhich would not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill would immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of the motion to recommit to \nH.R. 3189, which will ensure that seniors will be protected from losing \ntheir hard-earned benefits to deceitful financial companies found to \nengage in harmful activity. Financial companies that put earnings ahead \nof the needs of our seniors should not be allowed to participate in any \nemergency lending program or facility established by the Federal \nReserve.\n  While Republicans try to put their special interest friends first, \nthe Democratic motion to recommit would ensure that financial companies \nfound to engage in activity that harms seniors' financial health and \nstability are prevented from participating in any emergency lending \nprogram or facility established by the Federal Reserve.\n  Our motion to recommit would stop rewarding unsavory financial \ninstitutions that abuse the trust and harm the financial health of \nAmerica's seniors.\n  America's seniors, who have spent their lives working to provide for \ntheir families, deserve to retire with dignity and live without fear of \nbeing stripped of financial security due to the actions of predatory \nfinancial institutions. Yet, House Republicans are willing to grant \nthese shady financial companies access to emergency resources \nestablished by the Federal Reserve.\n  We need to adopt this motion to recommit to send a strong signal to \npredatory financial entities across this country that putting profits \nahead of people will not be rewarded by the U.S. Government.\n  I am co-chair of the Democratic Congressional Task Force on Seniors, \nand I am committed to protecting the well-being of older Americans and \nensuring that those who work hard and play by the rules receive a \ndignified and secure retirement.\n  In addition to protecting hard-earned benefits like Social Security \nand Medicare, we also need to ensure that vulnerable seniors are not \nthe subject of predatory lending that further puts them at risk for \neconomic security.\n  According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, older \nAmericans are particularly vulnerable to bad actors who seek to defraud \nthem, take advantage of their hard-earned retirement savings, or push \nthem into taking on financial products or services--like a reverse \nmortgage--that they may not want or need.\n  Roughly 1 million older Americans lose an estimated $2.6 billion \nannually as a result of financial abuse according to a MetLife study \nentitled, ``Broken Trust: Elders, Family and Finances.'' This is \nunacceptable.\n  As older Americans age, we have an obligation to ensure that they are \nnot an easy target for financial companies peddling predatory financial \nproducts and services.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge all my colleagues to vote in favor of this motion \nto recommit. By voting for this motion to recommit, Members can make \nclear whose side they are on, whether it be in favor of protecting our \nvulnerable seniors or in favor of protecting dishonest financial \ncompanies that seek to do them harm.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I claim the time in opposition to the \nmotion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Texas is recognized for 5 \nminutes.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I find the motion to recommit to be most \nironic. For the Members who were here for the debate on the underlying \nFORM Act yesterday, all we heard from the other side of the aisle is \nyou cannot direct the Federal Reserve to do anything; you are imposing \nupon their independence. And yet we have a motion to recommit that does \nexactly what they argued against yesterday. That is irony number one, \nMr. Speaker.\n  The second irony about the motion to recommit is nothing has hurt \nseniors more than having 7 years straight of zero percent interest \nrates. It is seniors who know that when you are young you work for your \nmoney, and when you are old you expect your money to work for you. \nTheir money is not working for them because we have had 7 years of \nartificially low interest rates. Real interest rates of zero.\n  If we want to help our seniors, what we need is a monetary policy \nthat is more predictable, that is more rules based, which is exactly \nwhat the FORM Act does. The American people want a healthier economy. \nThey want a government that is transparent and accountable to them, and \nthat includes the Federal Reserve. They cannot continue to cloak their \nprudential regulatory policies behind their monetary policies. We don't \nneed our central bankers to become our central planners, but we need a \nmonetary policy that works for seniors.\n  For a healthier economy, for a government that is transparent and \naccountable to ``we, the people,'' we need to vote down the motion to \nrecommit. Vote for the FORM Act.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Ms. MATSUI. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Pursuant to House Resolution \n531, the bill is considered read.\n  The text of the bill is as follows:\n\n                               H.R. 4038\n\n       Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of \n     the United States of America in Congress assembled,\n\n     SECTION 1. SHORT TITLE.\n\n       This Act may be cited as the ``American Security Against \n     Foreign Enemies Act of 2015'' or as the ``American SAFE Act \n     of 2015''.\n\n     SEC. 2. REVIEW OF REFUGEES TO IDENTIFY SECURITY THREATS TO \n                   THE UNITED STATES.\n\n       (a) Background Investigation.--In addition to the screening \n     conducted by the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director \n     of the Federal Bureau of Investigation shall take all actions \n     necessary to ensure that each covered alien receives a \n     thorough background investigation prior to admission as a \n     refugee. A covered alien may not be admitted as a refugee \n     until the Director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation \n     certifies to the Secretary of Homeland Security and the \n     Director of National Intelligence that each covered alien has \n     received a background investigation that is sufficient to \n     determine whether the covered alien is a threat to the \n     security of the United States.\n       (b) Certification by Unanimous Concurrence.--A covered \n     alien may only be admitted to the United States after the \n     Secretary of Homeland Security, with the unanimous \n     concurrence of the Director of the Federal Bureau of \n     Investigation and the Director of National Intelligence, \n     certifies to the appropriate Congressional Committees that \n     the covered alien is not a threat to the security of the \n     United States.\n       (c) Inspector General Review of Certifications.--The \n     Inspector General of the Department of Homeland Security \n     shall conduct a risk-based review of all certifications made \n     under subsection (b) each year and shall provide an annual \n     report detailing the findings to the appropriate \n     Congressional Committees.\n       (d) Monthly Report.--The Secretary of Homeland Security \n     shall submit to the appropriate Congressional Committees a \n     monthly report on the total number of applications for \n     admission with regard to which a certification under \n     subsection (b) was made and the number of covered aliens with \n     regard to whom such a certification was not made for the \n     month preceding the date of the report. The report shall \n     include, for each covered alien with regard to whom a \n     certification was not made, the concurrence or nonconcurrence \n     of each person whose concurrence was required by subsection \n     (b).\n       (e) Definitions.--In this Act:\n       (1) Covered alien.--The term ``covered alien'' means any \n     alien applying for admission to the United States as a \n     refugee who--\n       (A) is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria;\n       (B) has no nationality and whose last habitual residence \n     was in Iraq or Syria; or\n       (C) has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or \n     after March 1, 2011.\n       (2) Appropriate congressional committee.--The term \n     ``appropriate Congressional Committees'' means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate;\n       (B) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (D) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate;\n       (E) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;\n       (F) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (G) the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (H) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     House of Representatives;\n       (I) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (J) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (K) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (L) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The bill shall be debatable for 1 hour, \nequally divided and controlled by the chair and ranking minority member \nof the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  The gentleman from Virginia (Mr. Goodlatte) and the gentleman from \nMichigan (Mr. Conyers) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Virginia.\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members \nmay have 5 legislative days within which to revise and extend their \nremarks and include extraneous materials on H.R. 4038, currently under \nconsideration.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I support H.R. 4038, the American Security Against \nForeign Enemies Act of 2015.\n  Just one example of a terrorist taking advantage of the United \nStates' generous immigration policy in order to perpetrate attacks on \nAmericans is too many. Unfortunately, there are too many examples to \ncount. Most notable, of course, are the attacks on September 11, 2001, \nperpetrated by 19 foreign nationals who were admitted to the U.S. \nthrough our legal immigration system.\n  The U.S. Government has the ultimate responsibility to protect its \ncitizens. As such, if U.S. immigration policy allows foreign nationals \nwho want to do us harm access to U.S. soil, then the immigration policy \nmust be reviewed and amended.\n  We are faced with such a situation right now. There is a very real \npossibility that a terrorist, particularly one from, or claiming to be \nfrom, Syria or Iraq, will attempt to gain access to the United States \nas a refugee. In fact, ISIS is making no secret of their plans to have \ntheir members infiltrate groups of Syrian refugees. We should take ISIS \nat its word.\n  Of course, our hope is that such an individual would be screened out \nthrough the refugee vetting process. Unfortunately, we have heard time \nand time again from top counterterrorism and intelligence officials \nthat the current vetting process cannot prevent such an individual from \nreceiving refugee status.\n  In fact, just late last month, FBI Director James Comey told the \nJudiciary Committee that with a conflict zone like Syria, where there \nis ``dramatically'' less information available to use during the \nvetting process, he could not ``offer anybody an absolute assurance \nthat there is no risk associated with'' admitting Syrian nationals as \nrefugees.\n  He told another House committee that ``we can only query against that \nwhich we have collected. And so if someone has never made a ripple in \nthe pond in Syria in a way that would get their identity or their \ninterest reflected in our database, we can query our database until the \ncows come home but . . . nothing will show up because we have no record \non that person.''\n  The administration's foreign policy inaction in Syria, and failure to \ntake seriously the ISIS threat, are responsible for the flood of \nSyrians currently leaving their country. Of course, we all remember \nwhen the President told us that ISIS was the JV team. That JV team just \nmurdered 120 innocent people in Paris, including at least one American. \nAnd the Paris JV team included at least one terrorist who was \nregistered as a refugee from Syria.\n  H.R. 4038 requires certification by the FBI Director that the \nsecurity vetting process is sufficient to prevent an individual who is \na security threat from being admitted as a refugee. The bill also \nrequires that the DHS Secretary, FBI Director, and Director of National \nIntelligence certify to Congress that each refugee is not a security \nthreat prior to his or her admission to the United States.\n  In addition, H.R. 4038 requires the DHS Inspector General to review \nsuch certifications annually and report its findings to Congress. The \ncertification procedures apply to aliens who are nationals of Iraq or \nSyria, those who have no nationality and whose last habitual residence \nwas in Iraq or Syria, or who have been present in those countries at \nany time on or after March 1, 2011.\n\n[[Page H8382]]\n\n  H.R. 4038 puts the administration on notice that their lax attitude \ntoward this issue will no longer be tolerated. And it puts the \nadministration on notice that Congress is not yet finished reforming \nrefugee policy.\n  In fact, our committee has been hard at work long before the Paris \nattacks working on legislation to make necessary security-related and \nother changes to the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program. We look forward \nto moving that legislation through the House.\n  H.R. 4038 is not meant to be the sole solution to the security \nproblems we face in vetting Syrian and other refugees, but it is an \nimportant first step. I look forward to Congress taking additional \naction to ensure America's safety.\n  I thank the gentleman from Texas and the gentleman from North \nCarolina for the work they have done on this bill. I urge my colleagues \nto support it.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker and Members, the so-called American SAFE Act purports to \nmake us safer. But as the administration has so correctly observed, \nthis measure would provide no meaningful additional security for the \nAmerican people. Worse yet, it would effectively deny refugee status \nfor Syrians and Iraqis who are themselves victims of terrorism in their \nown homelands.\n\n                              {time}  1145\n\n  H.R. 4038 is a terribly flawed and inhumane bill for many reasons. To \nbegin with, while ensuring the safety of all Americans should be our \ntop priority, H.R. 4038 does nothing to achieve this goal.\n  This measure sets unreasonable clearance standards that the \nDepartment of Homeland Security simply cannot meet. Refugees seeking to \ncome to our shores are already subject to the highest level of vetting, \nmore than any other traveler or immigrant to the United States.\n  This extensive screening process is performed by the Department of \nHomeland Security, the State Department, in conjunction with the \nCentral Intelligence Agency, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and \nother law enforcement and intelligence agencies. The process utilizes \nmethodical and exhaustive background checks that often take up to 24 \nmonths, on average, to complete, and even longer, in some cases.\n  We must keep in mind that our Nation was founded by immigrants and \nhas historically welcomed refugees when there is suffering around the \nglobe. Whether it is an earthquake in Haiti, a tsunami in Asia, or 4 \nyears of civil war in Syria, with no end in sight, the world looks \nalways to the United States. We provide protections for refugees and \nasylum seekers, especially women and children.\n  Nevertheless, in the wake of the September 11 attacks on our shores \nand the tragic November 13 terrorist attacks in Paris, we must be \nvigilant, particularly in the midst of a global refugee crisis.\n  H.R. 4038, however, is an extreme over-reaction to these latest \nsecurity concerns. Rather than shutting our doors to these desperate \nmen and women and children who are risking their lives to escape death \nand torture in their own homelands, we should work to utilize our \nimmense resources and good intentions of our citizens to welcome them.\n  Finally, Congress needs to do its part by properly funding refugee \nresettlement as well as funding our Federal agencies so they have the \nnecessary personnel and programs to complete security checks that we \nalready have in place. Instead of slamming our doors to the world's \nmost vulnerable, we should be considering legislation to strengthen and \nexpand refugee programs.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today is not a serious effort to \nlegislate, and it will not make us safer. It is a knee-jerk reaction, \nas evidenced by the fact that this measure was introduced just 2 days \nago, and has not been the subject of a single hearing or any meaningful \nreview by our committee.\n  Rather than betraying our values, we must continue to focus on the \nmost effective tools to keep us safe, while also providing refuge for \nthe world's most vulnerable.\n  Accordingly, I urge all of my colleagues to oppose H.R. 4038.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nTexas (Mr. McCaul), the chairman of the Homeland Security Committee, \nand the chief sponsor of this bill.\n  Mr. McCAUL. Mr. Speaker, I want to first thank the gentleman from \nVirginia, the chairman of the Judiciary Committee, for his work on this \nlegislation.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support the American Safe Act.\n  Let me be clear. We are a nation at war. The world was reminded last \nweek that Islamic terrorists are seeking to harm our people, destroy \nour way of life, and undermine the foundational principles of the free \nworld.\n  Sadly, with the news that at least one of these terrorists may have \ninfiltrated Europe posing as a Syrian refugee, the Paris attacks appear \nto confirm our worst fears, that, of the thousands of foreign fighters \nwho have gone to Syria and Iraq to join ISIS, some would be deployed to \nbring terror back to the West.\n  The world is now looking at America for leadership and for a clear-\neyed understanding of the threat.\n  ISIS is not ``contained,'' as the President says. ISIS is expanding \nglobally and is plotting aggressively. The group is now responsible for \nmore than 60 terrorist plots against Western targets, including 18 in \nthe United States.\n  Here in the homeland, we have arrested more than one ISIS supporter a \nweek in the past year, and the FBI says it has nearly 1,000 ISIS-\nrelated investigations in all 50 States.\n  Today, we must take decisive action to show the American people that \nwe are doing all that we can to protect our country. We must listen to \nthe words of our enemies.\n  ISIS has vowed, in their words, to exploit the refugee process, to \nsneak operatives, to infiltrate the West, and they appear to have \nalready done that, to attack our allies.\n  For nearly a year, intelligence and law enforcement agencies have \nwarned Congress, both publicly and privately, that they are alarmed by \nintelligence collection gaps and our ability to weed out terrorists \nfrom the refugee process.\n  FBI Director Comey testified before my committee and stated: ``We can \nquery our databases until the cows come home, but nothing will show up \nbecause we have no record of them.''\n  Homeland Security Secretary Johnson said: ``We know that \norganizations like ISIS might like to exploit this program.''\n  This is an administration official's words, not mine.\n  This legislation would add two important layers to our defenses, \ncreating the most robust national security screening process in \nAmerican history for any refugee population.\n  The American SAFE Act also strikes an important balance between \nsecurity and our humanitarian responsibilities. It sets up roadblocks \nto keep terrorists from entering the United States, while also allowing \nlegitimate refugees who are not a threat to be resettled appropriately.\n  Let us not forget, this legislation is the first in a series of steps \nwe must take to defend the homeland, but ultimately, to win this war, \nwe must take the fight to the enemy.\n  Last week, the streets of Paris could just have easily been the \nstreets of New York or Chicago or Houston or Los Angeles.\n  But as I have said before, our long-term message to these terrorists \nmust be clear. You may have fired the first shot in the struggle but, \nrest assured, America will fire the last.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), one who has worked harder on this issue than \nanyone I know.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, all of us watched with horror the events in \nParis. November 13 was France's September 11.\n  And all of us have paused to consider what further should be done to \nmake sure that America is safe because our first obligation, as Members \nof Congress, is to make sure that America is safe.\n  So, as we watch the refugees from the Middle East pouring into \nEurope, concern has been expressed--and I think correctly--who are \nthese people\n\n[[Page H8383]]\n\nhidden among the many helpless victims? Are there those who would pose \na threat?\n\n  It is worth noting that our process for refugees is completely \ndifferent. No one gets into the United States unless they have been \ncompletely vetted. This process starts with the U.N. referring only \nthose people who are vulnerable, who have been tortured, who have been \nvictimized, who are helpless women and children, for screening by us.\n  We have a process that includes soliciting information from the DEA, \nfrom the intelligence agencies, from the FBI, and the like. All of \nthose agencies have a veto. If there is a problem, they veto the \nadmission. The process takes 2 years or more, and a very small number \nof people actually are admitted.\n  Of the 2,000 or so Syrian refugees who have been admitted to the \nUnited States, the overwhelming majority are children and widows who \nhave been victims of torture, who have seen their husbands beheaded.\n  The bill before us, as has been described by the Speaker and the \nauthor, would stop the refugee program. They call it a pause. They \nwould stop it because it completely restructures the very elaborate \nsystem that we have.\n  By putting the FBI as the lead agency, they would have to hire \nagents, send them over. It would be a pause. That is what they have \ndescribed. We think it would take a couple of years to start up.\n  Now, why is that a bad idea?\n  ISIS is our enemy, and we need to fight them, and we need to defeat \nthem. But we are fighting on two levels; one, military, but also, this \nis a fight of values.\n  America stands for freedom. We are the beacon of light, of democracy, \nof freedom in the world. And part of that value of America is allowing \npeople who are escaping monsters like ISIS to be able to become \nAmericans like us.\n  We need to screen and make sure that we are completely safe. But if \nwe stop that program, we give ISIS a win.\n  Please defeat this bill.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nNorth Carolina (Mr. Hudson), the chief cosponsor of the legislation.\n  Mr. HUDSON. Mr. Speaker, America is a compassionate country. We are a \ngood country. We have a long history of accepting refugees, people \nfleeing oppression and violence.\n  But we also have an obligation to the American people. As we welcome \npeople into this country who are seeking asylum, we owe it to the \nAmerican people to know who these people are. And when you have got a \nterrorist group like ISIS, who has said that they will exploit this \nrefugee crisis to infiltrate America--this is an organization that has \nsaid their goal is to come to America and kill Americans--I take them \nat their word.\n  The number one responsibility of this body is to protect the American \npeople. It is not me saying that we have challenges with the current \nvetting process; it is experts from President Obama's administration.\n  I draw your attention to the first quote here from Jeh Johnson: ``It \nis true that we are not going to know a whole lot about the Syrians \nthat come forth in this process.'' That is definitely a challenge. That \nis the Secretary of Homeland Security.\n  I draw your attention to the next quote from Director James Comey of \nthe FBI: ``We can only query against that which we have collected, and \nso if someone has not made a ripple in the pond in Syria in a way that \nwould get their identity or their interest reflected in our databases, \nwe can query our data until the cows come home, but nothing will show \nup because we have no record of that person.''\n  This is not me saying that. This is not Republicans saying that. \nThese are officials in President Obama's administration saying that the \ncurrent process is broken, that we are bringing in these refugees that \nwe cannot properly vet.\n  So our legislation simply says: Let's stop this flow unless and until \nthe law enforcement experts that President Obama has appointed, the FBI \nDirector, the Secretary of Homeland Security, can vouch for the fact \nthat we have a process in place that they are comfortable with.\n  How radical is that?\n  This is common sense, and that is why our polls show that as many as \n75 percent of the American people support this measure.\n\n                              {time}  1200\n\n  Mr. Speaker, I know the President has issued a veto threat, but I \nhope that today in this House we can come together, Republicans and \nDemocrats, and respond to the will of the American people and do our \nprimary job to keep them safe so we can have a bipartisan vote that \ndoesn't say no refugees, it doesn't say stop Syrian refugees, and it \ndoesn't say don't ever let them in again. It says pause the program \nunless and until the law enforcement experts are comfortable that we \nhave got a process.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to \nsupport this legislation.\n  Mr. GOODLATTE. Mr. Speaker, I yield the remainder of my time to the \ngentleman from South Carolina (Mr. Gowdy), the chairman of the \nImmigration and Border Security Subcommittee, and ask unanimous consent \nthat he be able to control that time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Virginia?\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Nadler), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Mr. NADLER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to this irresponsible \nbill that would effectively block the settlement of Syrian refugees in \nthe United States for years.\n  The shocking and tragic events in Paris have touched people all over \nthe world and strengthened our resolve to defeat the terrorists who are \nresponsible for these heinous acts, for bombing a Russian airliner, and \nfor carrying out deadly bombings in Beirut. But defeating terrorism \nshould not mean slamming the door in the faces of those who are fleeing \nthe terrorists. That is why I am appalled by the actions of this House \nand by some of the words of my colleagues today.\n  Mr. Speaker, the United States has always been and should always be a \nplace of refuge. Remember, the Syrian refugees are running away from \nISIS. They are running away from war, from terror. The are its victims. \nTo stop thousands of desperate people who are fleeing unspeakable \nviolence is unconscionable. We might as well take down the Statute of \nLiberty.\n  Countries with much smaller populations like Lebanon and Turkey have \nagreed to take 1 million refugees or more. Even France just announced \nthey are increasing the number of Syrian refugees they are accepting. \nWe in the United States are talking about a mere 10,000. These refugees \nare subject to an extensive vetting process which can take up to 24 \nmonths.\n  But the real danger America faces is that ISIS, through its \npropaganda, can radicalize people already here and inspire them to \nattack the United States from within. In Paris we saw that several of \nthe attackers were European nationals who could enter the United States \nwithout being vetted, so it is ridiculous to assert that by denying \naccess to refugees, we would be making America safer.\n  We face a choice that will echo through history. In 1924, a racist, \nxenophobic, and anti-Semitic Congress passed legislation slamming the \ndoor shut on Jewish, Italian, Greek, and Eastern European immigrants. \nThe Almanac of American Politics said that, if it weren't for the 1924 \nImmigration Act, perhaps 2 million of the 6 million Jews who were \nmurdered in the Holocaust would have been living safely in the United \nStates instead.\n  Back then we shut our doors to people in desperate need. We must not \ndo so again. We must not let ourselves be guided by irrational fear. We \nhave a moral obligation and, for those who care, a religious obligation \nto extend a hand to those in need.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to oppose this bill.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. McCarthy), the majority leader.\n  Mr. McCARTHY. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I \nthank those who have worked on the bill, Congressman Richard Hudson, \nChairman Mike McCaul, a number of other committee chairmen, Chairman \nGoodlatte, and others.\n\n[[Page H8384]]\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this is not an issue that comes before us just because \nof action that happened recently--a horrific action. Mr. Speaker, our \nduty is to protect the American people. Without security, we cannot \nhave freedom. Without security, we cannot help others abroad.\n  The American people are generous, and we want to help those in the \nworld suffering from terrorism and civil war. The fact that America \ngives far more in foreign aid than any other country in the world is a \ntestament to our generosity. In 2014, we gave over $6.5 billion in \nhumanitarian foreign aid alone. That doesn't even count the millions of \ndollars that privately have been offered by American people.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, being generous does not mean we have to have a weak \nscreening process for refugees, especially for those coming from Iraq \nand Syria where we know people are there who seek to do us harm and are \nlooking to exploit a weak process. It is wrong to condemn a strong \nscreening process using the language of charity and morality.\n  When we allow refugees into this country, we must be guided by one \nsingle principle: If you are a terrorist or you are a threat to our \ncountry, you are not getting in, period. The bill before us increases \nthe standards to keep those who want to do us harm out.\n  But America is not saying ``no'' to refugees. America always stands \nas a beacon of hope for everyone fleeing oppression and terror. Nothing \nwill stop us from protecting the innocent while continuing our fight \nagainst evil. Instead, this bill puts a pause on our refugee program \nuntil we are certain that nobody being allowed in poses a threat to the \nAmerican people.\n  To those who do not even want to consider increasing accountability \nin our refugee process--and to the President, who announced that he \nwants to veto this bill--let me tell you this: It is against the values \nof our Nation and the values of a free society to give terrorists the \nopening they are looking for to come into our country and harm the \nAmerican people, and we have an obligation to stop that from happening. \nIn the debate we are having on the refugee crisis, we should not lose \nsight of the root of the problem. The real problem is ISIL and our lack \nof strategy to destroy them.\n  It astounds me that the President refuses to face reality and admit \nthat his strategy is failing. ISIL controls territory the size of \nMaryland. Attacks in Paris, Beirut, and Egypt show that ISIL is not \ncontained to Iraq and Syria. Every day ISIL continues to exist is \nanother day they can train, recruit, and radicalize more people to \ncontinue their war on the civilized world and threaten the safety of \nthe American people.\n  Mr. Speaker, this danger is real, and nothing can replace a winning \nstrategy. Here in the House, we will not accept half measures. We are \ncommitted to keeping America safe. That is why I ask all in the House \nto support this bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentlewoman from \nTexas (Ms. Jackson Lee), a distinguished member of the House Judiciary \nCommittee.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I have been on the Homeland Security \nCommittee since the heinous and vile acts of 9/11. I have often said \nthat I was at Ground Zero, and I had the misery of seeing the recovery \nthat was still occurring at that time. I take no backseat to the \nconcern and love for this Nation, as I know that neither do my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle.\n  But, Mr. Speaker, this legislation is divided in a simple premise: no \nto refugees, stop the refugee program, turn your back on children, \nwomen, and old people broken and bent. This side is saying that \nAmerica's values can parallel the love, respect, and commitment to the \nnational security of this Nation.\n  ISIL is determined to divide this bipolar world; divide it between \nMuslims who share the distorted and profane interpretation and those \nwho live every day under the sun who love freedom. We do not define the \nfaith by those who kill us and maim us. As President Franklin Delano \nRoosevelt said: ``The only thing we have to fear is fear itself''--\nnameless, unreasoning, and unjustified terror which paralyzes needed \nefforts to convert, retreat, and advance.\n  This is the extensive, extensive review that only a small number of \nSyrians go through that are able to get in this country from refugee \ncamps. That is the only place they come from. This is the extensive \none.\n  I say to the President, certify it now.\n  But what this legislation does is requires that the 5-year-old Syrian \ngirl that has lived most of her life in a Jordanian camp must be \ncertified by four or five individuals who are already in the process of \nthe certification.\n  There are 60 million individuals who are displaced across the globe \nnow. Twenty percent of them are Syrians fleeing the conflict that has \ntaken 240,000 lives. Right now the FBI has 50 terrorist cells being \ninvestigated. They cannot count them as Syrian refugees.\n  This is the wrong direction. Let us follow our values, Mr. Speaker. \nVote that bill down and bring refugees who are already certified. This \nbill is unnecessary. It stops the refugee program. Where is our mercy?\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from \nKentucky (Mr. Rogers), the chairman of the Appropriations Committee.\n  Mr. ROGERS of Kentucky. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for \nyielding.\n  Mr. Speaker, I rise today first to reaffirm our solidarity with the \npeople of France, our brethren in Beirut, and the families of the \nvictims of Metrojet Flight 9268 who perished over the skies of the \nSinai. The senseless and unspeakable violence, the blind fanaticism, \nthe utter and irrational hatred for human life by ISIS, together they \npresent a threat not just to national and global security, but also to \nthe fundamental values that constitute the very fiber of civilization.\n  Mr. Speaker, ISIS must be stopped. The violence must end. And the \nUnited States must do more--more to stamp out this evil, more to \neradicate the threats posed here and abroad, and more to ensure that \nAmericans can tuck in their children at night with a feeling of \nsecurity that they will be waking up tomorrow morning for school free \nfrom fear. That is why we must support the SAFE Act. It is thoughtful, \nand it will further one of our principal national security priorities--\nkeeping Americans safe--as we work to eliminate the threat posed by \nISIS.\n  The instability in Syria and the surrounding region has continued \nunabated for more than 4 years, and we have witnessed an indescribable \nhumanitarian crisis because of the brutality of the Assad regime and \nradical Islamic groups such as ISIS.\n  In the wake of the Paris tragedy, we must step back and review the \nprocedures in place for admitting refugees resulting from this conflict \ncoming into our country. We can and must implement a system that \nassists the victims of the tragedy but that also prioritizes American \nsecurity first.\n  H.R. 4038 will ensure that no refugee from Iraq or Syria steps foot \non U.S. soil without the Secretary of the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the FBI Director, and the highest intelligence officer \ncertifying that each refugee is not a security threat to the U.S. The \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the FBI, and the Director of National \nIntelligence must unanimously certify that a person seeking refuge in \nthis country does not represent a security threat. This is an \nunprecedented vetting process to ensure dangerous people do not slip \nthrough the cracks.\n  I urge your support, all in this Chamber, so we can provide our \nmilitary and intelligence personnel with the best possible chance for \nsuccess as they work to keep us safe.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge support for the bill.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 5 minutes to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Thompson), ranking member on the Homeland Security \nCommittee.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the generosity \nfrom my colleague from Michigan on the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we live in uncertain and dangerous times with ever-\nevolving terrorist threats. The brutality that ISIL has inflicted on \ninnocent people is both chilling and demands action.\n  As Members of Congress, we have a responsibility to do all we can to \nprotect our citizens. In the wake of the\n\n[[Page H8385]]\n\nParis attacks, questions have been raised about the screening system \nthat the U.S. utilizes and whether it can be exploited by terrorists.\n\n                              {time}  1215\n\n  In light of those questions, Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record a \nletter from the Department of Homeland Security former Secretary Janet \nNapolitano and former Secretary Michael Chertoff supporting the current \nsystem of vetting refugees.\n\n                                                November 19, 2015.\n     Hon. Barack Obama,\n     President of the United States,\n     The White House, Washington, DC.\n       Dear Mr. President: Following the creation of the \n     Department of Homeland Security, substantial progress has \n     been made in protecting our nation's homeland. The ongoing \n     efforts by our national security experts have provided tools \n     and resources to make a coordinated attack like the one in \n     Paris last week much more difficult to achieve here at home. \n     As a nation, we have strengthened security at our air, land, \n     and sea ports; we have strengthened the ability to monitor \n     the travel of bad actors and detect fraud in our visa \n     process; we have strengthened partnerships with state and \n     local law enforcement across the nation to ensure that they \n     are prepared; and we have engaged with minority and ethnic \n     communities to prevent homegrown radicalization.\n       As former Secretaries of the U.S. Department of Homeland \n     Security, it is our view that the American people are safer \n     due to these efforts, but the Paris attacks remind us that we \n     must remain ever-vigilant in this effort and that the highest \n     priority of our government is to keep American's safe. It is \n     our view that we can achieve this mission in a manner that is \n     consistent with American values of openness and \n     inclusiveness. With respect to refugees seeking to resettle \n     here, it is our view that we can admit the most vulnerable of \n     these refugees into this country safely as long as we do not \n     compromise the already established protections. The process \n     for any refugee seeking entry to the United States requires \n     the highest level of scrutiny from a law enforcement and \n     national security perspective. The process takes place while \n     the refugees are still overseas, and it is lengthy and \n     deliberate--taking an average of 18-24 months with no waiver \n     of any steps. First, we consider only the most vulnerable--\n     particularly survivors of violence and torture, those with \n     severe medical conditions, and women and children--for \n     potential admittance to the U.S. Once a candidate is selected \n     they are subjected to biographic and biometric security \n     reviews based on the latest intelligence from the Department \n     of Homeland Security (DHS), the National Counterterrorism \n     Center, the FBI's Terrorist Screening Center, the Department \n     of State, and the Department of Defense. If they pass these \n     national security checks, they will then be personally \n     interviewed by specially trained DHS personnel to ensure they \n     are qualified for admittance. They are then subjected to \n     recurrent vetting up to the final point of departure and a \n     final interview at the border before being admitted into the \n     U.S.\n       The process that is currently in place is thorough and \n     robust and, so long as it is fully implemented and not \n     diluted, it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable \n     refugees while protecting the American people. Fortunately, \n     these goals are not mutually exclusive.\n           Sincerely,\n     Janet Napolitano,\n       Former Secretary (2009-2013), Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n     Michael Chertoff,\n       Former Secretary (2005-2009), Department of Homeland \n     Security.\n\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, in recent days, however, we \nhave seen a number of Governors, including the Governor of my home \nState, choose fear over facts. If they had done their research, they \nwould have learned that our program is an extensive 13-step process.\n  It starts with a referral from the United Nations of a prescreened \nperson within its refugee camps, requires the Department of Homeland \nSecurity to do in-person interviews, and subjects each applicant to \nrecurring vetting against the Department of Homeland Security, the \nState Department, FBI, Department of Defense, and intelligence \ncommunity terrorist and criminal databases. No excuses, Mr. Speaker. If \nany one of those reviews pops up with a problem, that person can't be \nconsidered for the refugee program--no excuses.\n  Unlike in Europe, where migrants crossed into countries that had \nlittle opportunity to vet them, no alien is allowed onto U.S. soil \nuntil all the checks are completed to DHS' satisfaction. As has already \nbeen said by my colleague, Zoe Lofgren, it takes about 18 to 24 months \nto process an applicant for refugee status.\n  Now, that processing is thorough, Mr. Speaker, and it is complete. \nBut there has been a reference to a stolen passport in the Paris \nsituation. That person, if they had applied for the refugee program, \nwould have had to go through the same process of vetting that would \nhave required at least 18 to 24 months. So the thought that that person \ncould just get on a plane and get here to this country is actually not \naccurate, and that is my effort to perfect the record.\n  Our system of vetting is a multi-layered, multi-agency approach where \nthe FBI has veto authority on any applicant seeking refugee status. \nWhile no system is risk free, the protections in place in the American \nsystem are rigorous, robust, and extensive.\n  In fact, Mr. Speaker, yesterday a witness that the majority invited \nto appear before our committee, Matthew Olsen, the former Director of \nthe National Counterterrorism Center, told our committee that no \nrefugee program in the world is as extensive as what we do in the \nUnited States.\n  Yet, here we are today considering H.R. 4038, a bill that would upend \nthe current system, which was developed by security personnel with one \nthought in mind: to protect the homeland. And these security personnel \nhave done a wonderful job.\n  To the knowledge of all of us, none of the refugees that we are \ntalking about from Syria or Iraq who came through this system have done \nanything but been model citizens since they have been here. Just for \nthe record, there were 23,000 people that applied for refugee status \nfrom these two countries. Of those 23,000, about 7,000 were actually \ninterviewed. Of those 7,000, only 2,000 were admitted.\n  So, Mr. Speaker, our system is robust. It works and it speaks to our \nvalues as Americans. I am proud to say that people who are abused, \npeople who are oppressed, can still look to this country, follow the \nrules. If those rules are properly applied, they can look to America as \nsomewhere they can call home, because most of those individuals \napplying for refugee status can't go home.\n  Once again, I call on Members to embrace facts over fear, Mr. \nSpeaker, and vote against H.R. 4038.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe).\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman from South \nCarolina for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, ISIS is at war with the United States. The question is: \nIs America at war with ISIS? I am not so sure, since we don't have a \nstrategy to defeat ISIS, other than if we are attacked, shelter in \nplace, hunker down, get more security guards around the Capitol, use \nthe tunnels rather than walk outside. That is what we were told after \nthe Paris attacks, Mr. Speaker.\n  This legislation is really simple. It has at its core the idea to \nprotect American citizens. It has nothing to do with refugees as far as \nwhether we accept refugees. Our country accepts refugees. We always \nhave. That is clear. It is not the issue of refugees. It is the issue \nof letting ISIS terrorists get into the country to kill us, Mr. \nSpeaker.\n  Our own security that the gentleman from Mississippi kept talking \nabout tells us we cannot vet Syrian refugees. The FBI Director says \nthat. We can't do it. We are not capable of doing it. One of the \nreasons is many of these folks have no identity. So we can't do a \nbackground check on somebody who has no identity.\n  This legislation says let's take some safeguards. Before we bring in \nthese specific refugees, let's make sure that the people in charge of \nsecurity certify that this person is not a threat. They can't do it \nright now. Even the FBI Director says they can't certify. We owe that \nto the American public. This legislation does that.\n  The gentleman from Mississippi is correct that 31 Governors of the \nStates say: Wait a minute. Not so fast. Find out who these people are.\n  I think the Governors of the States get it right. They ought to have \nthe ability, I think, to decide whether people should come to their \nState or not only after a security check.\n  So this legislation is a step to protect America, one of the things \nwe are supposed to do. The legislation is coming up quickly. Why? \nBecause it is an\n\n[[Page H8386]]\n\nimmediate threat. We have got refugees being bombed over in Syria. If \nwe are going to take them in, let's at least have a plan to protect not \nonly us, but those refugees.\n  That plan is in this legislation. It seems to me it would be \nirresponsible not to pass the legislation to require a certification of \neverybody that comes into America so that America could be safe because \nthat is our responsibility, Mr. Speaker.\n  And that is just the way it is.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Washington (Mr. McDermott).\n  (Mr. McDERMOTT asked and was given permission to revise and extend \nhis remarks.)\n  Mr. McDERMOTT. Mr. Speaker, this bill is nothing but a PR piece that \ncould have been written by Joseph Goebbels, who said, If you can make \npeople afraid, you can make them do anything. What you are seeing here \nis the Republican's attempt to panic the American people that there is \nnot a system in place.\n  Let me tell you about this system that is there. Mr. Thompson from \nMississippi said what is really there. I helped a woman who for 2 years \nwas a translator for American troops in Iraq. She was so good she saved \nlots of people's lives. She was so good that the enemy put a mark on \nher and said they were going to kill her. So she had to go into hiding.\n  It took her from January 2007 until September 2007 to get the papers \nand the witnesses and all the information necessary to get her into the \nUnited States. Somebody who had put her life on the line for us, our \nsoldiers, it took 9 months to get her in. Then her mother and her \nbrothers and sisters, who were 16 and 12 and 9, it took them 2 years to \nget into this country.\n  We have a robust system that is working. This bill is PR bologna. We \nought to vote ``no.'' It sends the wrong message. It says only White \nChristians can come into this country.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 3 minutes to the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Hensarling), the chairman of the Financial Services Committee.\n  Mr. HENSARLING. Mr. Speaker, I thank the gentleman for yielding and \nfor all of his work to make our Nation more secure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I do rise in support today of the safety and security of \nthe American people. As Members of Congress, we have no more sacred \nresponsibility. Thus, I rise in support of the American SAFE Act.\n  Now, I join all Americans and all the people of the world in standing \nwith the people of Paris. We are so sobered as to what happened to \ntheir homeland, but we are also sobered by the challenge and the grave \nresponsibility to thwart the same evil from coming to our homeland.\n  The Director of the FBI testified before Congress just last month \nthat a number of people who were of serious concern were able to slip \nthrough screenings of Iraqi refugees. That is what the Director of the \nFBI said. This disturbing information, Mr. Speaker, obviously raises \nvery serious red flags about lapses in the security within our current \nrefugee vetting system.\n  Again, it is why I support and I encourage all Members to support the \nAmerican SAFE Act of 2015. It would effectively hit the pause button on \nthe refugee program, not the stop, but the pause button.\n  It is simple legislation. It simply requires more rigid standards so \nthat the FBI, the Department of Homeland Security, and the Director of \nNational Intelligence would positively certify that each refugee from \nIraq and Syria does not pose a security threat to us, to our homeland, \nto our families. Otherwise, they will not be permitted to set down on \nAmerican soil. It is simple. It is common sense. It is needed.\n  Mr. Speaker, our hearts also go out to the millions of refugees \nforced to flee their homes and save their lives. There is no other \ncountry in the world--no other country in the world--that has been more \ngenerous with their time and treasure to refugees than the United \nStates of America.\n  But today is not the day to share our territory, not until and unless \nthese people can be properly vetted to ensure they don't threaten our \nfamilies.\n  Mr. Speaker, hopefully, the world has awakened that there is a very \nreal threat that ISIS poses. It is not the JV team. They are not \ncontained. What happened in Paris was not merely a setback.\n  I urge my colleagues to take the responsibility to secure our \nhomeland seriously. This will be the first of what I know will be many \nsteps that this Chamber will take to address the growing threats that \nare posed to our families and our country.\n  I thank the sponsor of the legislation for bringing it to the floor. \nI urge all my colleagues to adopt it.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Pelosi), our leader.\n\n                              {time}  1230\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. I thank the gentleman for yielding and for his great \nservice to our country in promoting our values and strengthening our \nNation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I come to the floor in a very prayerful way today \nbecause we were all horrified at what happened in Paris, at what \nhappened in Beirut, at what happened to the Russian airliner, to name a \nfew recent incidences.\n  We recognize that that is horrible and that we have to protect the \nAmerican people from it. To do so, we must be strong, but our strength \nmust also spring from our prayerfulness for those who lost their lives \nor for those whose security was threatened physically, emotionally, and \nin every other way.\n  In our country, we have a relationship with France. They were our \nearliest friends. That is why in this Chamber of the House of \nRepresentatives, any visitor can see there are only two paintings. One \nis of our great patriarch, George Washington, our hero, our Founding \nFather.\n  The other painting in this Chamber is of the Marquis de Lafayette. It \nis in recognition of the friendship that the French Government extended \nto the Colonies in our war for independence.\n  Just imagine George Washington and Lafayette, a long, long \nfriendship. So, while we are concerned about violence wherever it \nexists in the world, when Paris was hit in such a vicious way, in some \nways, it hit home for us, not that the other lives were not equally as \nimportant.\n  As we come to the floor to talk about what we do next, we take an \noath of office--every one of us--to protect and to support the American \npeople and the Constitution of the United States. Keeping the American \npeople safe is our first responsibility. It is the oath we take. If the \nAmerican people aren't safe, what else really matters?\n  We understand the concern, the fear, in the country when an act of \nterrorism strikes. In fact, that is the goal of terrorists: to instill \nfear, to instill terror. We cannot let them succeed; so, we have to \ntake the measures necessary to protect the American people and to be \nvery strong in how we do it.\n  That is why I have a problem with the bill that is on the floor \ntoday. It is because I think we have a much stronger, better option to \nprotect the American people, and that is in the form of the Thompson-\nLofgren legislation.\n  Unlike in the Republican bill, the Democratic alternative applies \ntough scrutiny to all potential refugees, not just to Syrians and \nIraqis, as the Republican bill is limited to.\n  The Thompson-Lofgren Secure Refugee Process Act would require the \nSecretary of Homeland Security to verify the identities of all refugee \napplicants. Any application that contains insufficient, conflicting, or \nunreliable information would be denied from day one.\n  The bill also requires that at least five Federal agencies--the \nDepartment of Homeland Security, the Attorney General, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, the Secretary of State, the Secretary of \nDefense, the Director of National Intelligence--check all refugee \napplications against their records. Any application that indicates a \nnational security or a criminal threat would be denied--all. Not Iraq-\nSyria--all.\n  Two former Secretaries of Homeland Security--Secretary Janet \nNapolitano and Secretary Michael Chertoff--have written about the \nprocess that is in existence now and which the Thompson-Lofgren \nlegislation respects. The process that is currently in place is \nthorough and robust, and so long as it is fully implemented and not \ndiluted, it will allow us to safely admit the most vulnerable refugees \nwhile protecting the American people. Fortunately,\n\n[[Page H8387]]\n\nthey say, these goals are not mutually exclusive.\n  There are other things that we could be doing in a bipartisan way, \nand I would have hoped that that would have been a place we could have \ngone with this. One of them relates to closing loopholes in the Visa \nWaiver Program.\n  Today our colleagues on the Senate side are putting forth their \nprinciples, which state: ``If an ISIS recruit attempts to travel to the \nUnited States on a fraudulent paper passport issued by a country that \nparticipates in the Visa Waiver Program, that individual would avoid \nbiometric screening and an in-person interview.''\n  How could we allow this loophole to exist if we are truly addressing \nthis challenge in a comprehensive way?\n  If the Republicans want to make the Nation safer in the face of \nterror, there is another clear area in which we should act, and that is \nwe should be voting on Republican Congressman Peter King's bill in \norder to close the appalling loophole.\n  It is outrageous that a person who is on the terrorism watch list--\nlisten to this. If someone is on the terrorist watch list, he could \nwalk into a gun store and buy a gun. His bill is called the Denying \nFirearms and Explosives to Dangerous Terrorists Act.\n  The visa waiver.\n  Close the terrorist gun loophole.\n  According to the GAO, over the last 11 years, more than 2,000 \nsuspects on the FBI's terrorist watch list bought weapons in the United \nStates. Did you know that?\n  Ninety-one percent of all suspected terrorists who tried to buy guns \nin the United States walked away with the weapons they wanted over the \ntime period with just 190 rejected despite their having ominous \nhistories. Listen, 5 to 1, 10 to 1, they were able to get these guns.\n  Why can't we talk about guns when we talk about danger to the \nAmerican people?\n  It is outrageous that we would be slamming the door to mothers and \nchildren while we still allow people on the terrorist watch list to \nwalk in the door of a gun store and buy a gun.\n  With regard to those mothers and children, I join with labor, civil, \nhuman rights, and faith groups from the U.S. Conference of Catholic \nBishops, from the Episcopalians, the Lutherans, the Methodists, the \nPresbyterians, the evangelicals, and Jewish groups. I join them in \nsaying that the Republican bill before the House today fails to meet \nour values and fails to strengthen the security of the American people.\n  Families in Syria and Iraq are desperately trying to escape ISIS' \ngruesome campaign of torture, rape, violence, and terror of the Assad \nregime. The Republican bill before the House today severely handicaps \nthe refugee settlement in the future in our country. It slams that door \nagain on desperate mothers and children who are fleeing ISIS' \nunspeakable violence.\n  As Leith Anderson, President of the National Association of \nEvangelicals, said: ``Of course we want to keep terrorists out of our \ncountry, but let's not punish the victims of ISIS for the sins of \nISIS.''\n  Did you know this? Here are the facts.\n  Since 2001--just in the last few years--only about 2,200 Syrians have \nbeen admitted to the United States. Half are children, and 25 percent \nare seniors. All faced an 18- to 24-month-long screening process.\n  As the Refugee Council and its coalition of more than 80 faith, \nhumanitarian, and human rights groups point out in their letter to \nCongress: ``Because so few refugees in the world are resettled, the \nUnited States often chooses the most vulnerable, including refugees who \ncannot remain safely where they are and families with children who \ncannot receive the medical care they need to survive.''\n  Mr. Speaker, I include for the Record the Refugee Council's letter \nwith all of the cosigners.\n\n                                          Refugee Council USA,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Refugee Council USA \n     (RCUSA), a coalition of 20 non-governmental organizations \n     committed to refugee protection and welcome, I write to you \n     today to urge you to protect Syrian and Iraqi refugees and \n     the integrity of the United States refugee resettlement \n     program by voting NO on H.R. 4038--The American Security \n     Against Foreign Enemies Act 2015.\n       Since 1975, the United States has resettled more than 3 \n     million refugees from around the world, including 169,000 \n     from Bosnia and more than 100,000 from Iraq. Three quarters \n     of a million of those refugees entered the U.S. since 2001. \n     During that time, there have been no recorded terrorist acts \n     in the United States by a refugee. That should come as little \n     surprise. Refugees are, by definition, people fleeing from \n     persecution--not persecutors themselves.\n       H.R. 4038 creates a bureaucratic review process that could \n     take years to implement and would effectively shut down \n     refugee resettlement. The bill requires the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to ``certify'' whether an individual \n     refugee is a threat or not after ``concurrence'' with the \n     Directors of the FBI and DNI. The bill does not provide \n     guidance on what the process for certification will be. This \n     process will have to be created and agreed upon by three \n     heads of agencies. Establishing such a process could take \n     years, and in the meantime, refugees who could be resettled \n     would languish in camps and dangerous situations, Syrian \n     Americans would not be able to reunite with their family \n     members, and there would be very real ramifications for \n     international refugee protection and U.S. foreign policy \n     interests in the region.\n       The process, once established, would add months or years to \n     the security screening process, which is already the \n     lengthiest and most robust in the world, routinely taking \n     between 18 and 36 months. Obtaining the concurrence of three \n     heads of federal agencies for EACH REFUGEE would take years \n     and effectively put an end to the refugee resettlement \n     program. For reasons of security and safety, security and \n     medical clearances are only valid for limited periods of \n     time. During the certification process, these clearances will \n     expire. This will mean that refugees will be caught in an un-\n     ending loop of security clearances that will never end.\n       The bill requires reporting to thirteen congressional \n     committees on each refugee that is considered for \n     resettlement. This is unreasonably burdensome and will \n     further delay the admission of refugees, cause security \n     clearances to expire, and effectively end the program.\n       Refugees are already the most vetted non-citizens in our \n     country. All refugees undergo thorough and rigorous security \n     screenings prior to arriving in the United States, including \n     but not limited to multiple biographic and identity \n     investigations; FBI biometric checks of applicants' \n     fingerprints and photographs; in-depth, in-person interviews \n     by well-trained Department of Homeland Security officers; \n     medical screenings; investigations by the National \n     Counterterrorism Center; and other checks by U.S. domestic \n     and international intelligence agencies. Supervisory review \n     of all decisions; random case assignment; inter-agency \n     national security teams; trained document experts; forensic \n     testing of documents; and interpreter monitoring are in place \n     to maintain the security of the refugee resettlement program. \n     Due to technological advances, Syrian refugees are also \n     undergoing iris scans to confirm their identity through the \n     process.\n       The bill is a waste of resources. Funds used to establish \n     and run this certification process would be better used in \n     conducting actual security reviews of refugees and others who \n     are vetted by these agencies.\n       The bill is a pretext and requires differential treatment \n     of refugees from Syria and Iraq without providing a \n     justification for the additional verification. It is a \n     disguised attempt to stop refugees from two countries long \n     beset by internal conflict, including refugees who have been \n     in neither Syria nor Iraq for four years. Differential \n     treatment, with no clear justification, amounts to \n     discrimination on the basis of nationality without rational \n     basis.\n       No terrorist attacks in the US have been committed by \n     refugees. The few non-citizens who have caused harm have come \n     to the US as tourists or through other means. This bill will \n     tell the world that the US has no interest in being part of \n     the global solution to protect the victims of the violence in \n     Syria and Iraq. It will keep US citizen family members of \n     these refugees from reuniting with their loved ones who are \n     in danger. This bill does nothing to keep the country safe, \n     is a waste of tax dollars, and is an attack on refugees and \n     immigrants--both those who are seeking safety and those who \n     are already here.\n       For these reasons we ask that you vote ``no'' on H.R. 4038. \n     We also want to draw your attention to the attached letter \n     signed yesterday by 81 national organizations in support of \n     Syrian refugees.\n       We appreciate your support in protecting the refugees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Melanie Nezer,\n                                       Chair, Refugee Council USA.\n\n  Ms. PELOSI. As it is the proud American tradition, we can both ensure \nthe security of our country and welcome desperate women, children, and \nseniors who are facing ISIS' brutality. As my colleague who spoke \nbefore me just said, our hearts go out to the refugees, but our hand of \nfriendship does not. And it could.\n  We could do this in a bipartisan way. If we betray our values as a \ncountry and slam the door in the faces of those innocent victims of \nterror, we do not strengthen our security. We weaken ourselves in the \nfight against ISIS' savage ideology.\n\n[[Page H8388]]\n\n  As the Refugee Council USA and its coalition wrote to Congress--and \nthis is very important--``it would send a demoralizing and dangerous \nmessage to the world that the United States makes judgments about \npeople based on the country they come from and their religion. This \nfeeds into extremist propaganda and makes us all less safe.''\n  I talked about the French to begin with. It was interesting to me to \nhear President Hollande as he spoke to thousands of people in the wake \nof the tragedy. What he said in some of his remarks at various venues \nwas that France would be welcoming 30,000 refugees from Syria in the \nperiod ahead. With all that they have suffered, with the immediacy of \nthe tragedy, with the emotion of the moment, they are still doing the \nright thing.\n  The Republican bill before us does not make us safer, and it does not \nreflect our values. It does not have my support.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nNebraska (Mr. Ashford).\n  Mr. ASHFORD. Mr. Speaker, in my view, H.R. 4038 is, in fact, a \ncommonsense approach to addressing the legitimate security concerns \nthat my constituents and the American people have expressed to me and \nare expressing today.\n  In the wake of the horrific attacks in Paris--in my view, it is a \ngame-changer--we must and are obligated to reassess our existing \nprocedures--and that is all this bill does--for admitting and \nmonitoring refugees from countries associated with ISIS. I cannot sit \nback and ignore the concerns of my constituents and the American \npublic.\n  This legislation does not shut down the refugee asylum process. If it \ndid, I wouldn't support it. We are simply asking the administration to \nreassure us that those coming to the United States do not pose a threat \nto the American people. We should not accept anything less from our \nFederal Government.\n  I am very proud of our American legacy of being a welcoming nation, \nand I have devoted much of my professional life to that concept and \nidea. This legislation, in my view, does not diminish that legacy. \nRather, this legislation will protect that legacy into the future and \nwill reassure Americans that we are working to protect them.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Meeks).\n  Mr. MEEKS. Mr. Speaker, I think it is without question that we have \nthe strongest, the most stringent, and the toughest refugee system in \nthe entire world. I don't think anybody can dispute that. Yet, we are \nstill humanitarians with regard to what our system is.\n  This bill is called the American SAFE Act, but where our greatest \ndanger lies is when rhetoric is given for ISIS to utilize in order to \nrecruit American citizens--those of us who are here to radicalize \nthem--and then they can go to a gun shop and buy an assault weapon.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  If we truly want to make sure that America is safe, we should make \nsure that no homegrown or radicalized person here has access to an \nassault weapon. We should have a bill.\n  We want every American to be safe, as I hear my colleagues talking. I \nam with you. How do we make them safe? Make sure that nobody, refugee \nor otherwise, has the ability to come to our Nation and put their hands \non an assault weapon that can harm our people. That is what will keep \nAmerica safe. Working together with the most stringent refugee system \nis what we need to do.\n  This is just something to try to keep people from coming in who are \nrunning away from rape, from violence, from persecution. Young children \nand women who are widows overwhelmingly are the individuals of the \n2,000 that have been led in here.\n  Let's keep America safe. Let's keep assault weapons out of our land.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Rohrabacher).\n  Mr. ROHRABACHER. Mr. Speaker, I rise in support of H.R. 4038. This \nlegislation will give us a pause to ensure that a benevolent safe haven \nin America is not used by terrorists to murder a large number of \nAmericans. After the slaughter in Paris, it behooves us to take a close \nlook to see to it that Americans will not be put in jeopardy by an \nirresponsible refugee policy or by flaws in our own system that already \nexist.\n  We can be proud that our country has a tradition of assisting \nsuffering refugees, but we will not be consistent with that by putting \nAmericans in jeopardy.\n  What could we do that might make the system better, improve the \nsystem, protect more Americans? If we pause for a moment, we might come \nup with some ideas. For example, let me be the first on the floor of \nthe House to advocate that all people coming here, especially from the \nMiddle East, be given polygraph tests. Let's give them a lie detector \ntest to find out who they are. This shouldn't be an option for our \nembassies. It should be a requirement for our embassies to give such \npolygraph tests.\n  Finally, we have heard several references to the Jews being sent back \nin 1938 to Nazi Germany. Well, the Jews had been targeted for genocide. \nIt was wrong, it was horrible, and it was immoral for us to send them \nback and not recognize they had been targeted for genocide.\n  Well, today the Christians in the Middle East are targeted for \ngenocide. I hear over here: Oh, no, you are not going to let anybody in \nbut Christians. No. Christians should get the priority the same way \nthose Jews should have been given the priority in 1938 because, today, \nChristians are targeted for genocide in the Middle East. So we do not \nwant to make the same mistake that sent the Jews back in 1938 to \nHitler's death camps. Let's not make the same mistake and send \nChristians back because we won't give them priority because it might \nmake some people upset with us.\n  I call for, number one, my colleagues to join us and save the \nChristians from genocide; and number two, let's make our system better \nso Americans are not put in jeopardy by the benevolence of our own \npeople.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, we want to vote for a bill to reflect the \nangst of our constituents. If you read this bill, you can't vote for \nit. It forces our three security leaders--the Director of the FBI, the \nDirector of National Intelligence, and the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity--to personally review, vote on, and certify each and every \nindividual refugee file.\n  We admitted 187 Syrian refugees last month. If our security leaders \njust spend 2 hours on each file, it will consume all of their working \nhours. ISIS cannot simultaneously and permanently incapacitate our \nsecurity leaders. This bill does.\n  Now, some will say that our security leaders just won't look at any \nof the files, that this is an underhanded way for Congress to halt all \nrefugees without taking responsibility, but our security leaders are \nhuman. They are going to look at the picture of Aylan Kurdi--that 3-\nyear-old boy on the Turkish beach--and our security leaders will know \nthat if they just invest a couple of hours in personally reviewing a \nfile, they can save a human life. If they just spend another 2 hours, \nthey can save another human life. Our security leaders will be full-\ntime refugee evaluators.\n  This bill is not a pause bill. This is a permanent bill which \npermanently incapacitates our security agencies. Read the bill. Vote \n``no.''\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from \nMississippi (Mr. Palazzo).\n  Mr. PALAZZO. Mr. Speaker, I want to thank my friend from South \nCarolina for the time.\n  Mr. Speaker, we are under attack. Across the globe and here at home, \nwe are being targeted. We are at war. The enemy has brought war to us. \nAnd make no mistake about it, this enemy is radical Muslim extremism.\n  Last week in Paris, we saw a brutal reminder of just how dedicated \nour enemy is in fighting this war against us. We must fight back, and \nwe must do more. The United States of America must do more.\n  The President of the United States, on the very day ISIS attacked \nParis, argued that ISIS had been contained. He was wrong. Last year, \nthe President called ISIS the JV team. He was wrong. The President has \nbeen wrong on ISIS\n\n[[Page H8389]]\n\nfrom the very beginning, and he is wrong now. Where is the strategy? \nWhere is the willpower? Where is the leadership?\n  Two years ago, Secretary of State John Kerry testified in front of \nthe House Armed Services Committee about the need to arm Syrian rebels. \nI questioned this decision because we had no way of vetting these \nrebels. I told Secretary Kerry at the time: ``America is just not \nbuying what you are selling.'' Two years later, the administration has \nshut down the arming of Syrian rebels because it was completely \nineffective.\n  Now, the administration wants to bring in 10,000 Syrian refugees to \nthe United States, refugees who even the Director of the FBI says \ncannot be fully vetted. We cannot allow this to happen\n  Mr. Speaker, today we are going to pass a strong piece of legislation \nto protect the American people. The SAFE Act will ensure the highest \nlevel of scrutiny is placed on every single Syrian refugee and \neffectively stop this program until we can ensure Americans are \nprotected. I believe we should do more, but this is a powerful first \nstep to stopping dangerous terrorists from reaching our soil.\n  The President, our Commander in Chief, the one person charged with \nprotecting the U.S. homeland above all others has threatened to veto \nthis bill. I dare him. I dare the President to veto this bill because \nhe is angrier at Republicans than he is terrorists. I dare him to veto \nthis bill because he thinks his strategy is working, despite the \ndevastation in Paris. I dare the President of the United States to tell \nthe citizens of the United States that he is more concerned with Syrian \nrefugees than the safety of the American people. I dare him.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Ted Lieu).\n  Mr. TED LIEU of California. Mr. Speaker, I am Congressman Ted Lieu. I \nam a veteran, and I oppose the Republican legislation that would upend \nAmerica's refugee program for Syrians and Iraqis. It is the wrong \nsolution for the wrong problem.\n  There has not been a single act of terrorism on American soil \ncommitted by a refugee. In Paris, those horrific attacks were committed \nby French and Belgian citizens. Under the Republican rationale, we \nought to be banning travel for French and Belgians to America. If that \nsounds ridiculous, then so is scapegoating Syrian orphans, widows, and \nsenior citizens fleeing persecution.\n  America is a country born of persecution, forged in liberty's name \nwith equality for all. We are that shining city upon the hill. We are \nbetter than this.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from the \ngreat State of South Carolina (Mr. Duncan).\n  Mr. DUNCAN of South Carolina. Mr. Speaker, as a Christian, I have \ncompassion and sympathy for the refugees in Syria. In fact, I visited \nwith many of them in a refugee camp in Jordan, a camp that held about \n120,000 Syrian refugees.\n  We are criticized for not having compassion on this issue. Let me \ntell you, compassion cuts two ways. We should also be cognizant of the \ncompassion we should show our fellow citizens here in America. That \ncompassion is exemplified by using the good sense that God gave us in \naddressing this national security concern that our Nation faces.\n  Our compassion should be, too, to make sure to the best of our \nabilities--and I think that is what this legislation does--is it says \nwe are going to use the best of our abilities that no harm comes to our \nfellow countrymen. We should do everything we can to make sure that \nelements of evil are not introduced, due to our compassionate hearts, \ninto the neighborhoods, the towns, the cities, and the States that we \nrepresent in this great Nation.\n  We lock our doors, not because we hate the people on the outside. We \nlock our doors because we love the people on the inside. This \nlegislation is a great first step to hit pause. Let's get this right \nfor the people we serve in the great Nation that we swear to uphold and \ndefend.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Oregon (Mr. Blumenauer).\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, my Republican friends, unlike the French \nwho had the vision and courage not to scapegoat desperate Syrian \nrefugees fleeing the barbarians that attacked them in Paris, this is a \nfoolish attempt to thwart ISIS terrorists who won't wait 2 years to be \nvetted.\n  They would do what the 9/11 hijackers did using the existing visa \nsystem. Are we going to pause and certify visas for students, tourists, \nor workers? Why not?\n  One really objectionable portion of this bill for me is I have worked \nfor 10 years to try and help the Iraqis who worked with us in Iraq \nduring that war to be able to escape the tender mercies of al Qaeda and \nothers with long memories who are killing and torturing them. This bill \npulls the plug on that and condemns them to be left to the terrorists. \nI think that is reprehensible. These are people who depended upon us, \nwho relied upon us. We have been working in a bipartisan way for 10 \nyears to help them escape to safety, and this bill would slam that door \nshut. You ought to be ashamed.\n  Mr. GOWDY. I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Brendan F. Boyle).\n  Mr. BRENDAN F. BOYLE of Pennsylvania. Mr. Speaker, this bill is a \ngreat way for Congress to appear as if it is acting and achieving \nsomething without actually doing anything.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am proud to be a member of the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee. We have had numerous hearings from the beginning of the \nyear, including yesterday, on this issue specifically.\n  One of the great challenges Western countries face is the problem of \nhomegrown terrorism. We saw that last week in Paris when the \noverwhelming majority of those who perpetrated these acts were French \nnationals and Belgian nationals.\n  So the big issue we face is: What do we do with those who hold \nEuropean passports and who can come here easily by getting a plane \nticket? What do we do with the problem of homegrown terrorism here in \nthe U.S. among American citizens? Those are the key challenges we face \nin how we balance our civil liberties, our need for tourism, our need \nfor economic bilateral relations, with our need for security. This bill \nsadly today does absolutely nothing about that.\n  So we are going to pass this bill. We are going to pat ourselves on \nthe back. We are going to go home and say we did something when \nactually we have done nothing to solve the problem and protect the \nsecurity of the American people.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the distinguished \ngentleman from California (Mr. Becerra).\n  Mr. BECERRA. Mr. Speaker, the safety of our fellow Americans, and \nAmerica itself, is and must be our number one priority, our number one \nresponsibility here in this Chamber. The people of America have a right \nto expect--indeed, demand--exactly that.\n  Our national security screening and background system for refugees is \nthe toughest in the world. That is why so few refugees from Syria have \never been able to receive their clearance to be accepted into this \ncountry.\n  But then Paris, November 13, happened. Terror reigns and fear \nspreads, including here. We are reminded of 9/11. If I believed that \nthis rushed legislation made our toughest of refugee screening systems \nwork better, I would vote for it. If this rushed legislation only adds \nanother layer of bureaucracy that makes our screening process look \ntougher and then results in denying women and children who are fleeing \nthe very terrorists we seek to keep out a chance to seek that refuge \nhere in this country, then I cannot support that.\n  Our tradition and our values open our door, as in the past, to those \nwho fled Europe to start this country in the first place. It is up to \nus to do this courageously and do it right, not with rushed \nlegislation.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge a ``no'' vote.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nTennessee (Mr. Cohen), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n\n[[Page H8390]]\n\n  \n\n  Mr. COHEN. Mr. Speaker, this bill is here without having gone through \ncommittee. It is not our normal process. It is considered an emergency. \nIt is not an emergency. Refugees will not get in this country for 1\\1/\n2\\ to 2 years from the time they apply.\n  We could come back and look at the Democratic bill, of which I am a \ncosponsor, that incorporates Mr. King's amendment to prevent terrorists \nor people on the terrorist list from getting guns, and get a Democratic \nand Republican bill that we might find we could agree on.\n  Instead, we are doing this for politics, and we are doing it by \ncontinuing to use the pinata of President Barack Hussein Obama. This is \nan attack on the President, who has a responsibility to defend us, and \nhis team is doing it. This doesn't add anything to it. It doesn't make \nus safer. It is simply a political way to attack the President, and it \nis wrong.\n  Mr. Speaker, that is why I will be voting ``no.''\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, may I inquire how much time remains for both \nsides.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Duncan of Tennessee). The gentleman from \nSouth Carolina has 2 minutes remaining. The gentleman from Michigan has \n4 minutes remaining.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I continue to reserve the balance of my time \nuntil such time as my friend from Michigan has closed.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record from today's New \nYork Times Editorial Board, noted today, ``Refugees From War Aren't the \nEnemy.'' It includes, ``this measure represents election-year pandering \nto the xenophobia that rears up when threats from abroad arise. People \nwho know these issues--law enforcement and intelligence professionals, \nimmigration officials and humanitarian groups--say that this \nwrongheaded proposal simply would not protect Americans from `foreign \nenemies.' ''\n\n                [From the New York Times, Nov. 18, 2015]\n\n                   Refugees From War Aren't the Enemy\n\n                        (By The Editorial Board)\n\n       The House is expected to vote Thursday on H.R. 4038, the \n     American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act of 2015, \n     which Republican sponsors say ``would put in place the most \n     robust national-security vetting process in history'' for \n     refugees, one that would ``do everything possible to prevent \n     terrorists from reaching our shores.''\n       Conceived partly in response to the Paris attacks, the bill \n     seeks to ``pause'' admission of Syrian and Iraqi refugees. \n     Though there are real fears of terrorism, this measure \n     represents election-year pandering to the xenophobia that \n     rears up when threats from abroad arise. People who know \n     these issues--law enforcement and intelligence professionals, \n     immigration officials and humanitarian groups--say that this \n     wrongheaded proposal simply would not protect Americans from \n     ``foreign enemies.''\n       One of the bill's chief sponsors, Representative Michael \n     McCaul of Texas, chairman of the House committee overseeing \n     the Department of Homeland Security, surely knows how federal \n     protocols for admitting refugees work. Yet the bill \n     disregards the complicated current process, which already \n     requires that applicants' histories, family origins, and law \n     enforcement and past travel and immigration records be vetted \n     by national security, intelligence, law enforcement and \n     consular officials. This process can take 18 months to two \n     years for each person.\n       Among other hurdles, the measure would require that the \n     secretary of homeland security, the director of the F.B.I. \n     and the director of national intelligence personally certify \n     that every refugee from Syria and Iraq seeking resettlement \n     here is not a threat. That's a lot of women, children, and \n     old people.\n       Moreover, this bill ignores most of what the United States \n     has learned, since 9/11 and before, of how potential \n     terrorists actually reach these shores: such individuals more \n     often already live here, or they come via illegal means. \n     Unlike the refugees in Europe, those seeking resettlement in \n     the United States must apply from abroad. They don't arrive \n     until formally admitted, and about half of those seeking \n     refugee status are approved.\n       So far, half of the Syrian refugees accepted into the \n     United States, officials say, have been children, and another \n     quarter are over 60 years old. Roughly half are female, and \n     many of those applying from abroad are multigenerational \n     families, often with the primary breadwinner missing. About 2 \n     percent are single males of combat age.\n       Given these facts, it is fair to say that the people who \n     will be denied resettlement by this bill would be the victims \n     of war, people who have been tortured and threatened by the \n     same jihadists the United States now battles. They are \n     families, they are old people and they are children, who \n     might be given a chance for an education and a future.\n       This is a frightening time for Europe, and for the United \n     States. Should this bill reach his desk, President Obama is \n     more than likely to veto it because it has little to do with \n     fighting global terror. It is sad that this proposal has been \n     described as a first chance for the new speaker of the House, \n     Paul Ryan, to cooperate with the Senate. This bill doesn't \n     reflect who Americans are, and congressional leaders should \n     have the good sense to realize that.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nCalifornia (Ms. Lofgren), a member of the Committee on the Judiciary.\n  Ms. LOFGREN. Mr. Speaker, I have listened to all of this debate with \nkeen interest, and it is with a sense of great sadness that we were \nunable to come up with a bipartisan bill today.\n  I would like to note, however, that a bill was introduced by myself \nand the gentleman from Mississippi (Mr. Thompson) that actually is much \ntougher than the bill before us. It would relate to all refugees in \nterms of their identity and their excludability--including Nigerians \nbecause we are worried about Boko Haram and Somalians because we may be \nworried about al Shabaab--and that is a tougher approach. I recommend \nit.\n  But we also took good ideas from Mr. McCaul's bill. It is a good idea \nto do some sampling on the IG. It is a good idea to have some reporting \nto the committees. Unfortunately, our bill was not made in order; but \nit is a stronger bill that incorporates the good ideas from the \nRepublican bill and a smarter approach to deal with the threat.\n  Mr. GOWDY. I continue to reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I include in the Record letters of \nopposition to H.R. 4038.\n\n             White House Statement of Administration Policy\n\n\n                  h.r. 4038--american safe act of 2015\n\n               (Rep. McCaul, R-TX, and Rep. Hudson, R-NC)\n\n       The Administration's highest priority is to ensure the \n     safety and security of the American people. That is why \n     refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians and Iraqis, \n     considered for admission to the United States undergo the \n     most rigorous and thorough security screening of anyone \n     admitted into the United States. This legislation would \n     introduce unnecessary and impractical requirements that would \n     unacceptably hamper our efforts to assist some of the most \n     vulnerable people in the world, many of whom are victims of \n     terrorism, and would undermine our partners in the Middle \n     East and Europe in addressing the Syrian refugee crisis. The \n     Administration therefore strongly opposes H.R. 4038.\n       The current screening process involves multiple Federal \n     intelligence, security, and law enforcement agencies, \n     including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal \n     Bureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland \n     Security (DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring \n     that those admitted do not pose a threat to our country. \n     These safeguards include biometric (fingerprint) and \n     biographic checks, medical screenings, and a lengthy \n     interview by specially trained DHS officers who scrutinize \n     the applicant's explanation of individual circumstances to \n     assess whether the applicant meets statutory requirements to \n     qualify as a refugee and that he or she does not present \n     security concerns to the United States. Mindful of the \n     particular conditions of the Syria crisis, Syrian refugees--\n     who have had their lives uprooted by conflict and continue to \n     live amid conditions so harsh that many set out on dangerous, \n     often deadly, journeys seeking new places of refuge--go \n     through additional forms of security screening, including a \n     thorough pre-interview analysis of each individual's refugee \n     application. Additionally, DHS interviewers receive \n     extensive, Syria-specific training before meeting with \n     refugee applicants. Of the 2,174 Syrian refugees admitted to \n     the United States since September 11, 2001, not a single one \n     has been arrested or deported on terrorism-related grounds.\n       The certification requirement at the core of H.R. 4038 is \n     untenable and would provide no meaningful additional security \n     for the American people, instead serving only to create \n     significant delays and obstacles in the fulfillment of a \n     vital program that satisfies both humanitarian and national \n     security objectives. No refugee is approved for travel to the \n     United States under the current system until the full array \n     of required security vetting measures have been completed. \n     Thus, the substantive result sought through this draft \n     legislation is already embedded into the program. The \n     Administration recognizes the importance of a strong, \n     evolving security screening in our refugee admissions program \n     and devotes considerable resources to continually improving \n     the Nation's robust security screening protocols. The \n     measures called for in this bill would divert resources from \n     these efforts.\n       Given the lives at stake and the critical importance to our \n     partners in the Middle East and Europe of American leadership \n     in\n\n[[Page H8391]]\n\n     addressing the Syrian refugee crisis, if the President were \n     presented with H.R. 4038, he would veto the bill.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: The National Immigration Law \n     Center (NILC) urges you to vote no on H.R. 4308. Our nation's \n     refugee laws and programs already include intense security \n     screening and no legislation is required. Our nation would be \n     turning its back on its most fundamental values if we were to \n     adopt measures that hinder or unnecessarily restrict refugee \n     admissions to the U.S.\n       Congress does not need to impose new mandates, like H.R. \n     4038, that would effectively freeze refugee resettlement \n     programs for Syrian, Iraqi or any other refugees. Screening \n     and security measures for refugee admissions are the most \n     robust and thorough in the nation. The agencies directly \n     involved in security screening for refugees are continually \n     reassessing and updating their procedures to keep in line \n     with technology and intelligence resources. The White House \n     has also stated its opposition to H.R. 4038.\n       Proposals like H.R. 4038--along with others that \n     unnecessarily mandate additional burdens on our refugee \n     resettlement programs--are attempts to demonize refugees who \n     are fleeing some of the most dangerous and devastating \n     conditions in the world and to discredit our nation's long-\n     standing and successful refugee resettlement programs that \n     have welcomed and reunited refugee families from around the \n     world.\n       We urge you to vote NO on H.R. 4038 which would halt and \n     likely delay for months, years or more the Syrian and Iraqi \n     refugee programs.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                                            Avideh Moussavian,\n\n                                 Economic Justice Policy Attorney,\n     National Immigration Law Center.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                                          Refugee Council USA,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of Refugee Council USA \n     (RCUSA), a coalition of 20 non-governmental organizations \n     committed to refugee protection and welcome, I write to you \n     today to urge you to protect Syrian and Iraqi refugees and \n     the integrity of the United States refugee resettlement \n     program by voting NO on H.R. 4038--The American Security \n     Against Foreign Enemies Act 2015.\n       Since 1975, the United States has resettled more than 3 \n     million refugees from around the world, including 169,000 \n     from Bosnia and more than 100,000 from Iraq. Three quarters \n     of a million of those refugees entered the U.S. since 2001. \n     During that time, there have been no recorded terrorist acts \n     in the United States by a refugee. That should come as little \n     surprise. Refugees are, by definition, people fleeing from \n     persecution--not persecutors themselves.\n       H.R. 4038 creates a bureaucratic review process that could \n     take years to implement and would effectively shut down \n     refugee resettlement. The bill requires the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to ``certify'' whether an individual \n     refugee is a threat or not after ``concurrence'' with the \n     Directors of the FBI and DNI. The bill does not provide \n     guidance on what the process for certification will be. This \n     process will have to be created and agreed upon by three \n     heads of agencies. Establishing such a process could take \n     years, and in the meantime, refugees who could be resettled \n     would languish in camps and dangerous situations, Syrian \n     Americans would not be able to reunite with their family \n     members, and there would be very real ramifications for \n     international refugee protection and U.S. foreign policy \n     interests in the region.\n       The process, once established, would add months or years to \n     the security screening process, which is already the \n     lengthiest and most robust in the world, routinely taking \n     between 18 and 36 months. Obtaining the concurrence of three \n     heads of federal agencies for each refugee would take years \n     and effectively put an end to the refugee resettlement \n     program. For reasons of security and safety, security and \n     medical clearances are only valid for limited periods of \n     time. During the certification process, these clearances will \n     expire. This will mean that refugees will be caught in an un-\n     ending loop of security clearances that will never end.\n       The bill requires reporting to thirteen congressional \n     committees on each refugee that is considered for \n     resettlement. This is unreasonably burdensome and will \n     further delay the admission of refugees, cause security \n     clearances to expire, and effectively end the program.\n       Refugees are already the most vetted non-citizens in our \n     country. All refugees undergo thorough and rigorous security \n     screenings prior to arriving in the United States, including \n     but not limited to multiple biographic and identity \n     investigations; FBI biometric checks of applicants' \n     fingerprints and photographs; in-depth, in-person interviews \n     by well-trained Department of Homeland Security officers; \n     medical screenings; investigations by the National \n     Counterterrorism Center; and other checks by U.S. domestic \n     and international intelligence agencies. Supervisory review \n     of all decisions; random case assignment; inter-agency \n     national security teams; trained document experts; forensic \n     testing of documents; and interpreter monitoring are in place \n     to maintain the security of the refugee resettlement program. \n     Due to technological advances, Syrian refugees are also \n     undergoing iris scans to confirm their identity through the \n     process.\n       The bill is a waste of resources. Funds used to establish \n     and run this certification process would be better used in \n     conducting actual security reviews of refugees and others who \n     are vetted by these agencies.\n       The bill is a pretext and requires differential treatment \n     of refugees from Syria and Iraq without providing a \n     justification for the additional verification. It is a \n     disguised attempt to stop refugees from two countries long \n     beset by internal conflict, including refugees who have been \n     in neither Syria nor Iraq for four years. Differential \n     treatment, with no clear justification, amounts to \n     discrimination on the basis of nationality without rational \n     basis.\n       No terrorist attacks in the US have been committed by \n     refugees. The few non-citizens who have caused harm have come \n     to the US as tourists or through other means. This bill will \n     tell the world that the US has no interest in being part of \n     the global solution to protect the victims of the violence in \n     Syria and Iraq. It will keep US citizen family members of \n     these refugees from reuniting with their loved ones who are \n     in danger. This bill does nothing to keep the country safe, \n     is a waste of tax dollars, and is an attack on refugees and \n     immigrants--both those who are seeking safety and those who \n     are already here.\n       For these reasons we ask that you vote ``no'' on H.R. 4038. \n     We also want to draw your attention to the attached letter \n     signed yesterday by 81 national organizations in support of \n     Syrian refugees.\n       We appreciate your support in protecting the refugees.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                    Melanie Nezer,\n     Chair, Refugee Council USA.\n                                  ____\n\n                                      The Leadership Conference on\n\n\n                                       Civil and Human Rights,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2015.\n     Oppose H.R. 4038's Refugee Policy ``Reforms''.\n\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of The Leadership Conference \n     on Civil and Human Rights, we write to express our strong \n     opposition to H.R. 4038, the ``American Security Against \n     Foreign Enemies Act of 2015.'' This bill would effectively \n     end the admission of refugees from Syria and Iraq, while \n     doing virtually nothing to improve ``American security \n     against foreign enemies,'' as the name suggests. It is an \n     illogical, poorly considered proposal that is simultaneously \n     far too broad and far too narrow.\n       Under our current system, refugees resettled in the United \n     States undergo more security vetting than immigrants or \n     visitors who come here through any other channel, and more \n     than refugees who are resettled in any other country in the \n     world. Yet under H.R. 4038, and after we have already \n     resettled 3 million refugees from around the world since 1975 \n     (including 100,000 from Iraq), Congress has just this week \n     concluded that our security screening procedures are \n     insufficient. In their place, H.R. 4038 would institute new \n     screening procedures for Syrian and Iraqi refugees--\n     procedures which are poorly defined, but which would take \n     years to fully implement.\n       The practical impact of H.R. 4038's onerous new \n     requirements would be to prevent any refugees from either of \n     these two countries from being admitted for the foreseeable \n     future. Meanwhile, only five days after the terrorist attacks \n     in Paris, French President Francois Hollande has stated that \n     France will honor its commitment to admit 30,000 refugees \n     from war-torn Syria--three times more than President Obama \n     had proposed to admit.\n       At the same time that H.R. 4038 would cause us to cede our \n     decades-long moral high ground in protecting refugees, we \n     struggle to comprehend precisely how it would make America \n     safer. If the assumption behind H.R. 4038 is that Iraqi and \n     Syrian citizens somehow pose a greater threat than citizens \n     of other countries, this bill does not affect the admissions \n     of immigrants or nonimmigrant visitors via other legal \n     channels. If the assumption behind the bill is that refugees \n     somehow pose a greater threat than other types of immigrants, \n     this bill only affects refugee admissions from two countries.\n       We are certainly not suggesting that H.R. 4038 be expanded \n     in any way. But the narrow scope of the bill does make us \n     wonder exactly what the sponsors are hoping to accomplish \n     through its enactment. We should note that few of the \n     terrorists who attacked Paris last week, and none of the \n     hijackers who attacked our country on September 11, 2001, \n     would have been prevented from entering the United States \n     under the provisions of this bill.\n       Again, we urge you to oppose this bill. If you have any \n     questions, please contact either of us, or Senior Counsel Rob \n     Randhava.\n           Sincerely,\n     Wade Henderson,\n       President & CEO.\n     Nancy Zirkin,\n       Executive Vice President.\n                                  ____\n\n\n                    [From MoveOn.org, Nov. 18, 2015]\n\n      MoveOn Responds to Obama's Veto Threat of House Refugee Bill\n\n                           (By Brian Stewart)\n\n       Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org Civic \n     Action, had the following statement in response to news that \n     President Obama would veto a House bill that\n\n[[Page H8392]]\n\n     would make it more difficult for vetted refugees to be \n     admitted to the United States:\n       ``We stand strongly with President Obama on this one. \n     MoveOn members will fight vigorously to uphold the principles \n     of welcome and compassion that are engraved on the Statue of \n     Liberty, and against the xenophobic, hateful, and \n     counterproductive rhetoric and proposals we've heard this \n     week from some--primarily Republican--politicians.\n       ``We will work to help defend the United States' essential \n     program for resettling refugees, many of whom are fleeing \n     from threats of terrorism to save their lives and protect \n     their children.

Refugees--who are \n     fleeing from the violence of terrorism--should not be \n     scapegoated for these extreme acts of violence. As \n     Christians, we must speak clearly and loudly: we are called \n     to welcome the stranger, protect the vulnerable, and love \n     fearlessly. We are called to respond with love even amidst \n     our fear.\n       The world is still facing the largest refugee crisis in \n     recorded history. We must continue to have compassion for the \n     vulnerable individuals fleeing conflict in Syria. Refugees \n     already go through security screenings that can take up to \n     1,000 days; unnecessary additions to the process would be \n     neither compassionate nor caring.\n       The Christian Reformed Church has a long history of \n     welcoming the vulnerable and helping to resettle refugees in \n     safe communities. The CRCNA pledges to fully participate in \n     resettling Syrians of all religions during this current \n     crisis as it has done with refugees from Iraq, Afghanistan, \n     Cambodia, Cuba, Vietnam, and elsewhere.\n           Sincerely,\n                                             Dr. Steve Timmermans,\n     Executive Director, CRCNA.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                               American Civil Liberties Union,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 18, 2015.\n     Re Oppose H.R. 4038, the ``American Security Against Foreign \n         Enemies Act of 2015.''\n\n       Dear Representative: The American Civil Liberties Union \n     strongly urges you to oppose H.R. 4038, the ``American \n     Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of 2015,'' or ``American \n     SAFE Act of 2015'' (H.R. 4038). A vote on the bill is \n     scheduled to take place on Thursday, November 19, 2015. The \n     ACLU urges you to vote NO on H.R. 4038. The ACLU will score \n     this vote.\n       I. H.R. 4038 creates bureaucratic obstacles to end U.S. \n     acceptance of refugees from Syria and Iraq without any \n     demonstrated public-safety benefit.\n       H.R. 4038 creates a bureaucratic-review process that likely \n     would effectively shut down resettlement of refugees from \n     Syria and Iraq. The bill mandates new certifications and \n     undefined background investigations for all refugees who are \n     nationals or residents of Iraq or Syria, and many who are \n     not. Under H.R. 4038, all refugees deemed to originate from \n     Iraq or Syria--including anyone who has been in either \n     country at any time in the last four and a half years--may \n     only be admitted to the U.S. after the Director of the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secretary of Homeland \n     Security, and the Director of National Intelligence \n     unanimously concur that the refugee has cleared an additional \n     background investigation on top of what the Attorney General \n     this week testified is ``significant and robust'' security \n     screening. There has been no need expressed by federal \n     intelligence or law-enforcement agencies for such an \n     unprecedented clearance process, which could take years to \n     operationalize and does not add any public-safety benefit for \n     the U.S. population. In short, H.R. 4038 would bring the U.S. \n     resettlement process of Syrian and Iraqi refugees to a \n     grinding halt.\n       II. H.R. 4038 would result in unjustified discrimination \n     against refugees from Syria and Iraq based on their \n     nationality, national origin, and religion.\n       It is wrong and un-American to condemn groups without \n     reason solely based on their nationality, national origin, \n     religion, or other protected grounds. The proposed \n     certification and background investigation requirements in \n     H.R. 4038 would only apply to refugees deemed to be from Iraq \n     or Syria, and not other countries. The bill sponsors have \n     provided no sufficient reason for additional certification \n     and investigation requirements to justify the differential \n     treatment of refugees from Syria and Iraq, or even defined \n     how that differential treatment would improve current \n     practice. H.R. 4038, therefore, amounts to impermissible \n     discrimination on the basis of nationality and national \n     origin without a rational basis.\n       The extra certification and investigation requirements in \n     H.R. 4038 would disproportionately harm Muslim refugees \n     seeking protection in the U.S. According to the Refugee \n     Processing Center, 96 percent of Syrian refugees admitted to \n     the U.S. since the Syrian civil war began in 2011 are Muslim, \n     while over 60 percent of Iraqi refugees admitted since the \n     Iraq war began in 2003 are Muslim. Muslim refugees would \n     disproportionately suffer the consequences of this \n     discriminatory bill, as they would be denied entry to the \n     U.S. and forced to languish in refugee camps for years on \n     end.\n       III. H.R. 4038 is an attack on vulnerable refugees from \n     Syria and Iraq, both those seeking protection and those \n     already residing in the U.S.\n       Not only is H.R. 4038 an attack against refugees from Syria \n     and Iraq, but it would also harm those refugees' family \n     members who are already in the U.S. and eagerly awaiting to \n     be reunified with their loved ones. This bill would subject \n     those families to an interminable wait and would prolong \n     unnecessary suffering for both the refugees seeking \n     protection and those family members waiting in the U.S. \n     Moreover, the bill's very name, the ``American Security \n     Against Foreign Enemies Act,'' would worsen stigmatization of \n     Syrian and Iraqi refugees--and, more broadly, scapegoat all \n     refugees--fanning the flames of discriminatory exclusion here \n     and abroad.\n       IV. Conclusion\n       The ACLU urges the House to vote NO on H.R. 4038. For more \n     information, please contact ACLU Legislative Counsel Joanne \n     Lin.\n           Sincerely,\n     Karin Johanson,\n       Director, Washington Legislative Office.\n     Joanne Lin,\n       Legislative Counsel.\n     Chris Rickerd,\n       Policy Counsel.\n                                  ____\n\n\n\n                            Asian Americans Advancing Justice,\n\n                                                November 18, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: Asian Americans Advancing Justice \n     (Advancing Justice) is a national partnership of five \n     nonprofit, non-partisan organizations that work to advance \n     the human and civil rights of Asian Americans and Pacific \n     Islanders through advocacy, public policy, public education, \n     and litigation. We are based in Washington D.C., Atlanta, \n     Chicago, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. We write to urge you \n     to vote NO on H.R. 4038, The American Security Against \n     Foreign Enemies Act of 2015 (American SAFE Act of 2015).\n       We are all shocked and saddened by the recent attacks in \n     Paris and elsewhere but now is not the time to close our \n     hearts and our state to people fleeing violence and terror. \n     We must be careful not to act impulsively in response to \n     recent violence and we must be vigilant against enacting \n     policies targeting people based on their national origin or \n     religion. Due to the legacy of the internment of Japanese \n     Americans in WWII and the treatment of Arab, Middle Eastern \n     and South Asian after 9/11, the Asian American community is \n     all too familiar with hasty actions based on discrimination \n     and fear.\n       Protecting national security and public safety is important \n     to all of us, but we should not let fear and prejudice guide \n     our decisions about whom to welcome to America. The refugee \n     resettlement program is already the most difficult way to \n     enter the United States, routinely taking individuals several \n     years to be processed. All refugees undergo thorough and \n     rigorous security screenings prior to arriving in the United \n     States, including but not limited to multiple biographic and \n     identity investigations; FBI biometric checks; in-depth, in-\n     person interviews by Department of Homeland Security \n     officers; medical screenings; investigations by the National \n     Counterterrorism Center, and other checks by U.S. domestic \n     and international intelligence agencies. In addition, other \n     measures such as mandatory supervisory review of all \n     decisions, random case assignment, and forensic document \n     testing are in place to maintain the security of the refugee \n     resettlement program.\n       H.R. 4038 creates a bureaucratic review process that could \n     take years to implement and would effectively shut down \n     refugee resettlement. The bill requires the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security to ``certify'' whether an individual \n     refugee is a threat or not after ``concurrence'' with the \n     Directors of the FBI and National Intelligence. The bill does \n     not provide guidance on what the process for certification \n     will be. This process will have to be created and agreed upon \n     by three heads of agencies. Establishing such a process could \n     take years, and in the meantime, refugees who could be \n     resettled would languish in camps and dangerous situations, \n     Syrian Americans would not be able to reunite with their \n     family members, and there would be very real ramifications \n     for international refugee protection and U.S. foreign policy \n     interests in the region.\n       The process, once established, would add months or years to \n     the security screening process, which is already the \n     lengthiest and most robust in the world, routinely taking \n     between 18 and 36 months. Obtaining the concurrence of three \n     heads of federal agencies for each refugee would take years \n     and effectively put an end to the refugee resettlement \n     program. For reasons of security and safety, security and \n     medical clearances are only valid for limited periods of \n     time.\n\n[[Page H8393]]\n\n     During the certification process, these clearances will \n     expire. This will mean that refugees will be caught in an un-\n     ending loop of security clearances that will never end.\n       The bill also requires reporting to more than a dozen \n     congressional committees on each refugee that is considered \n     for resettlement. This is unreasonably burdensome and a waste \n     of resources. Funds used to establish and run this \n     certification process would be better used in conducting \n     actual security reviews of refugees and others who are vetted \n     by these agencies.\n       This bill is merely a pretext for discriminatory treatment \n     of refugees from Syria and Iraq without providing a \n     justification for the additional verification. America should \n     remain a place of safety for people seeking refuge and peace \n     from around the globe. We strongly urge you to vote no on H.R \n     4038 and reject similar proposals that would limit or impose \n     unnecessary processes that effectively prevent future \n     refugees from coming to the United States.\n       If you have questions about our recommendation, please \n     contact Erin Oshiro at Asian Americans Advancing Justice-\n     AAJC. Thank you.\n           Sincerely,\n     Stewart Kwoh,\n       President & Executive Director, Advancing Justice, Los \n     Angeles.\n     Christopher Punongbayan,\n       Executive Director, Advancing Justice, Asian Law Caucus.\n     Mee Moua,\n       President & Executive Director, Advancing Justice, AAJC.\n     Tuyet Le,\n       Executive Director, Advancing Justice, Chicago.\n     Helen Kim Ho,\n       Executive Director, Advancing Justice, Atlanta.\n\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from \nFlorida (Ms. Frankel).\n  Ms. FRANKEL of Florida. Mr. Speaker, our folks back home are \nunderstandably frightened, and there is no question that ISIL must be \ndestroyed and that the safety of Americans must be our first priority. \nBut denying refuge to women and children who are fleeing rape and \ntorture and who go through a 2-year vigorous entry process will not \nmake us a safer country.\n  At a time when we are trying to forge a coalition of international \nnations, it is self-defeating to send a message of isolation. Our \nantiterrorism resources must be focused on terrorists, not on innocent \nhuman beings seeking shelter from the most unspeakable horrors.\n  Mr. CONYERS. I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, Members of the committee and of the House, instead of \nslamming our doors to the world's most vulnerable, we should be \nconsidering legislation to strengthen and expand refugee programs.\n  Unfortunately, the bill before us today is not a serious effort to \nlegislate, and it will not make us safer. It is a knee-jerk reaction, \nas evidenced by the fact that this measure was introduced just 2 days \nago and has not been the subject of a single hearing or any meaningful \nreview by our committee.\n  Rather than betraying our values, we must continue to focus on the \nmost effective tools to keep us safe, while providing refuge for the \nworld's most vulnerable. Accordingly, I plead with, I urge my \ncolleagues to please oppose H.R. 4038.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  Mr. Speaker, it seems commonsensical that when it comes to national \nsecurity and public safety, we should listen to and rely upon the women \nand men who are actually experts and have dedicated their lives to \npublic safety and national security.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is a fact: We don't have sufficient information to \nappropriately investigate and vet failed nation-states.\n  This is a fact: ISIS has sworn to bring its war against innocents \nhere.\n  This is a fact: Administration officials noted ISIS may well use the \nrefugee program to infiltrate our country.\n  This is also a fact, Mr. Speaker: The margin for error is zero. It is \nzero. The presumption should always be in favor of national security \nand public safety because that is the preeminent role of government, \nand it is our constitutional duty, Mr. Speaker.\n  So unless and until those we place in charge of our national security \nand public safety can provide the necessary assurances, we should seek \nto aid those who need aid where they are.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, the President says that we are scared of \nwidows and orphans. That is what passes for debate in this day and age. \nWith all due respect to the President, what we are really afraid of, \nMr. Speaker, is a foreign policy that produces so many widows and \norphans.\n  He is the Commander in Chief, Mr. Speaker. His job is to make our \nhomes safer. He could also make the homeland of the refugees safer. He \ncould restore order to the region, and he can defeat that JV team that \nhe once thought he had contained. That would be the very best thing we \ncould do for those who aspire to a better, safer life.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CONYERS. Mr. Speaker, I submit the following letters from the \nU.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops and First Focus Campaign for \nChildren.\n\n         United States Conference of Catholic Bishops, Committee \n           on Migration,\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2015.\n       Dear Representative: On behalf of the U.S. Conference of \n     Catholic Bishops (USCCB), I write to oppose passage of H.R. \n     4038, the American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act of \n     2015.\n       As you know, the legislation would suspend the resettlement \n     of refugees from Syrian and Iraq until a procedure could be \n     established whereby the Secretary of the Department of \n     Homeland Security (DHS) would certify--with concurrence of \n     the FBI director and the Director of National Intelligence--\n     that each refugee is not a terrorist threat. It also would \n     require that the current or a future Administration report to \n     thirteen congressional committees on each refugee that is \n     considered for resettlement. These requirements would keep \n     many deserving refugees in danger for an extended period of \n     time, at risk of their lives, but would not necessarily make \n     the process a more effective one.\n       The U.S. Catholic bishops acknowledge and support the right \n     of our government to defend our nation and to ensure that the \n     American people are safe. However, we believe that this \n     legislation is designed to severely limit, if not end, the \n     resettlement of Syrians or Iraqis to the United States, \n     including vulnerable women and children, the elderly, and \n     religious minorities fleeing violence and death, including \n     Christians. It also would impact Iraqis who may have been \n     forced to flee to Syria during the Iraqi war, even those who \n     may have supported our troops.\n       The current security process for Syrian refugees can take \n     up to 24 months or longer, as refugees go through several \n     interviews and 5 security clearance reviews. Refugees go \n     through more security checks than any arrival to our nation. \n     Since 2001, the United States has resettled 784,000 refugees \n     under this process and there has not been a single terrorist \n     act committed by a refugee admitted into the country.\n       The U.S. refugee program is an example of a successful \n     private-public partnership which has enjoyed bipartisan \n     support for decades. Presidents from both political parties \n     have supported, and, at times, expanded the program to \n     respond to humanitarian crises originating from global \n     conflicts, including President Gerald R. Ford after the \n     Vietnam War, President Bill Clinton after the Bosnian \n     conflict, and President George W. Bush after the Iraqi War. \n     H.R. 4038 represents a threat to this tradition and to our \n     moral leadership in the world.\n       Instead of imposing additional bureaucratic processes upon \n     the current stringent security system through the adoption of \n     H.R. 4038, we encourage you to work with the Administration \n     to strengthen it, without suspending the program. I also ask \n     that you work with your colleagues and the Administration to \n     end the Syrian conflict peacefully so the 4 million Syrian \n     refugees can return to their country and rebuild their homes.\n       Until that goal is achieved we must work with the world \n     community to provide safe haven to vulnerable refugees who \n     are simply attempting to survive. H.R. 4038 abdicates our \n     moral responsibility in this area and must be defeated.\n       Thank you for your consideration of our views.\n           Sincerely,\n\n                               Most Reverend Eusebio Elizondo,\n\n                                  Auxiliary Bishop of Seattle, WA,\n     Chairman.\n                                  ____\n\n                                                       First Focus\n\n\n                                        Campaign for Children,\n\n                                Washington, DC, November 19, 2015.\n       Dear Member: On behalf of First Focus Campaign for \n     Children, a national bipartisan advocacy organization \n     dedicated to making children and families a priority in \n     federal policy and budget decisions, I write to you today to \n     strongly urge that you oppose the American SAFE Act (H.R. \n     4038). This bill would immediately prevent all refugees from \n     Syria and Iraq from entering the United States and makes the \n     process for their entry considerably more difficult.\n       The American SAFE Act creates a much more stringent, \n     discriminatory process for\n\n[[Page H8394]]\n\n     refugees from Syria and Iraq to gain entry into the United \n     States. These populations would be singled out and could not \n     be admitted until the Director of the FBI, the Secretary of \n     DHS and the Director of the National Intelligence have \n     received a background investigation that is deemed sufficient \n     to determine whether the refugee is a threat. This process is \n     fraught with complications as thousands of refugee children \n     and their families will remain in limbo indefinitely and \n     agencies would have to use significant resources to \n     coordinate investigations and create new criteria for who can \n     be admitted. The United States already has much tougher \n     protections than European nations, evident in the fact that \n     all refugees are screened for 18-24 months before stepping \n     foot in the U.S. and face the highest level security \n     screening of any traveler or immigrant.\n       Those fleeing from violence in Syria are amongst the most \n     vulnerable in the world. Over 50% of those who have entered \n     the United States are children and a quarter are over the age \n     of 60. By adding an unnecessary layer of bureaucracy to the \n     screening process, the United States would be jeopardizing \n     the lives of thousands of innocent children who have \n     committed no crime other than to be born in a country rife \n     with instability and susceptible to unspeakable acts of \n     terrorism. These children have already experienced a great \n     deal of trauma and creating barriers for safety will only \n     make their situations more desperate.\n       America has a proud history of providing refuge for those \n     in need, and this bill runs contrary to our most fundamental \n     values of compassion and fairness. Thus, we strongly urge you \n     to oppose HR 4038 as it further undermines the safety of \n     millions of children who are seeking protection from the very \n     terrorism we are seeking to defeat.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                     Bruce Lesley,\n     President.\n                                  ____\n\n       Dear Members of Congress: The National Immigration Law \n     Center (NILC) urges you to vote no on HR 4038. Our nation's \n     refugee laws and programs already include intense security \n     screening and no legislation is required. Our nation would be \n     turning its back on its most fundamental values if we were to \n     adopt measures that hinder or unnecessarily restrict refugee \n     admissions to the U.S.\n       Congress does not need to impose new mandates, like HR \n     4038, that would effectively freeze refugee resettlement \n     programs for Syrian, Iraqi or any other refugees. Screening \n     and security measures for refugee admissions are the most \n     robust and thorough in the nation. The agencies directly \n     involved in security screening for refugees are continually \n     reassessing and updating their procedures to keep in line \n     with technology and intelligence resources. The White House \n     has also stated its opposition to HR 4038.\n       Proposals like HR 4038--along with others that \n     unnecessarily mandate additional burdens on our refugee \n     resettlement programs--are attempts to demonize refugees who \n     are fleeing some of the most dangerous and devastating \n     conditions in the world and to discredit our nation's long-\n     standing and successful refugee resettlement programs that \n     have welcomed and reunited refugee families from around the \n     world.\n       We urge you to vote NO on HR 4038 which would halt and \n     likely delay for months, years or more the Syrian and Iraqi \n     refugee programs.\n           Sincerely,\n                                                Avideh Moussavian.\n\n  Ms. EDDIE BERNICE JOHNSON of Texas. Mr. Speaker, I would like to \nexpress my opposition to H.R. 4038, the American Security Against \nForeign Enemies Act. As a result of horrific terrorist attacks in \nParis, France and Beirut, Lebanon last week, many elected officials in \nthe United States are demanding that we stop admitting refugees fleeing \nSyria or place strict restrictions upon their entrance. This rhetoric \nis disheartening and disappointing. We are facing a global refugee \ncrisis that requires a global response.\n  With 60 million people displaced, the United States must do its part \nto help protect and resettle vulnerable families and children who are \nfleeing violence and persecution. While we must continue to ensure that \nscreening procedures are able to properly vet those seeking political \nasylum in this country, I refuse to turn my back on innocent people who \nare fleeing the atrocities in their homeland.\n  H.R. 4038 places unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles in front of \nSyrian and Iraqi refugees without any demonstrated public safety \nbenefit and would result in completely unjustified discrimination based \non nationality, origin, and religion. This is not only wrong, it is not \nAmerican. H.R. 4038 also wrongly attacks vulnerable refugees who are \nfleeing the same dangerous attacks that we fear so much here on \nAmerican soil.\n  While I do believe that we must remain vigilant in our safety \nprecautions, we cannot close our doors and our minds to the children \nand families seeking protection, shelter, and safety. In Dallas, we \nhave always shown our compassion to those who seek safety. I refuse to \nslam the door on a small fraction of the world's Syrian refugees. In \nfact, 184 Syrian refugees have already been placed in Texas with more \nthan 1,500 across the nation and we will certainly welcome more.\n  We cannot turn our backs on those who fall victim to war, aggression, \nand tenor. Instead, we must show compassion by promoting peace and \ndiplomacy. I urge my colleagues to vote against this divisive and \ndiscriminatory legislation.\n  Ms. McCOLLUM. Mr. Speaker, I rise in opposition to HR. 4038.\n  In the aftermath of last week's barbaric ISIL terrorist attack in \nParis the Republican leadership of the U.S. House has decided that the \nbest way to protect the security of the American people is to attack \nSyrian and Iraqi refugees. These are the innocent and vulnerable \nchildren, parents, and elders who are seeking protection from murderous \narmies, terrorist groups, and death squads.\n  The perpetrators of the Paris attack were ISIL radicals with European \ncitizenship, not refugees. As many as 3,000 European extremists have \ntraveled to Syria to join the ranks of ISIL. In fact, the ISIL \nmastermind behind the Paris attack who was killed by French \nauthorities, Abdelhamid Abaaoud, was a Belgian citizen, not a refugee \nfrom Syria or Iraq. Meanwhile, the U.S. visa waiver program allows \nunrestricted access to the U.S. from the European Union which is an \nopen door for European extremists not on a watch list to enter our \ncountry. In my view, this is where the real reform and intelligence \nsharing must be strengthened.\n  The American Security Against Foreign Enemies Act (HR. 4038) is a \nRepublican ploy that is cruel, callous, and a blatant display of \nxenophobia used to energize a political base that is motivated by a \nhatred of immigrants. This legislation is not designed to protect our \nnational security interests, but rather will be used as a political \nweapon to attack Democrats who still believe our nation should be a \nsafe haven for vulnerable people seeking freedom from persecution and \nthe threat of death.\n  I support resettling refugees in the U.S. and I have always welcomed \nthem to Minnesota. The most modem identification technology and \nintelligence background checks need to be utilized in the resettlement \nsecurity process. That means this Republican Congress must act \nresponsibly and provide the necessary funding for such a comprehensive \nscreening protocol. I support appropriating full funding for these \nstrict protocols.\n  ISIL is a global scourge that must be eradicated. Keeping America \nsafe and eliminating ISIL will require intelligence, military, and \ncounter-terrorism coordination between the U.S. and all allies. \nUnfortunately, H.R. 4038 is a transparent effort to scapegoat Syrian \nand Iraqi refugees who have suffered immeasurably, but clearly not \nenough for some of my colleagues. I reject this Republican bill as \nanother example of driving a political agenda based on willful \nignorance in the face of a serious terrorist threat.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues to join me in opposing H.R. 4038.\n  Ms. BONAMICI. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in opposition to H.R. 4038, \nthe American Security Against Foreign Enemies (SAFE) Act of 2015, \nlegislation that was introduced just 48 hours ago with no consideration \nby any Committees of jurisdiction. In the wake of horrific terrorist \nattacks across the globe, I understand and appreciate the concerns and \nfear in our communities. We must recommit to keeping our country safe \nand secure, but keeping our country safe and accepting refugees fleeing \nwar and terrorism are not mutually exclusive and never have been \nthroughout the history of our great nation.\n  The American SAFE Act would effectively bar refugees, many of whom \nare women and children, from escaping violence and finding a safe haven \nin our country. The United States already has an extremely rigorous \nscreening process for refugees that includes 18 to 24 months of \ndetailed background checks, screening, and interviews administered by \nthe Departments of State, Homeland Security, and Defense.\n  The President has committed to allowing an additional 10,000 refugees \ninto our country, and more than half of those are children. Our history \nreflects a nation that thrives on diversity and is strengthened by the \ncontributions of immigrants, and in darker times, our history also \nprovides examples of where we have failed in the past, most notably \nduring the early years of World War II. The men, women, and especially \nchildren who are seeking a better life and refuge from bullets and \nbombs are counting on us. As an American and a mother, I urge my \ncolleagues not to respond to fear and political rhetoric by supporting \nthis bill and instead commit to a thoughtful debate that will \nstrengthen our national security policy without closing our border to \nthe world's most vulnerable.\n  Mr. DANNY K. DAVIS of Illinois. Mr. Speaker, I rise before you with \nthe words that are inscribed on our Statue of Liberty that reflects our \nhistory of a nation of what America is, should be, and to become to \nmany people regardless of nationality, ethnicity, and creed (religious \nbelief). We are a nation of Native\n\n[[Page H8395]]\n\nAmericans, descendants of slaves, and immigrants. Historically, these \nwords have not always reflected the true meaning of freedom through \ntime and periods of conflict.\n  The American Safe Act is a bill that attempts to infuse fear on \nAmericans about terrorism and would lead to slowing down the process of \nresettlement in the Syria and Iraq region for the most vulnerable \nrefugees possibly for years to come.\n  History is a tool that we should always learn from and always seek to \nbuild on the existence of our past to make America better and not a \nspectator on the wrong side of history.\n  Remember what was said about the Japanese Americans during World War \nII, when they were placed in internment camps. Fear was the reason and \nrationale as to why specific citizens were looked on as enemy aliens \nthat needed to be put away to protect our national security and make \nAmerica safe from danger of foreign influences.\n  Remember what happen to immigration quotas and restrictions of Jewish \nrefugees fleeing from a holocaust in Europe. Where American polls were \nsuggesting to not allow German and other political refugees from \nentering America due to fear and concern of possible entry of German \nagents among refugees.\n  What about the Haitians and Africans who are turned back or returned \nto their country of origin while seeking refuge in America?\n  Mr. Speaker, Deja vu all over again, yes we should be cautious and \nyet wise in our decisions that are temper with compassion and not fear \nto reject a people in their greatest hour of need.\n  I submit the following Statue of Liberty Poem:\n\n\n                 new colossus (statue of liberty poem)\n\n     Not like the brazen giant of Greek fame,\n     With conquering limbs astride from land to land;\n     Here at our sea-washed, sunset gates shall stand\n     A mighty woman with a torch, whose flame\n     Is the imprisoned lightning, and her name Mother of Exiles.\n\n     From her beacon-hand\n     Glows world-wide welcome; her mild eyes command\n     The air-bridged harbor that twin cities frame.\n\n     ``Keep, ancient lands, your storied pomp!'' cries she With \n           silent lips.\n\n     ``Give me your tired, your poor,\n     Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,\n     The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.\n\n     Send these, the homeless, tempest-tossed to me,\n     I lift my lamp beside the golden door!''\n\n  Mr. LEVIN. Mr. Speaker, the entire goal of terrorists--in their \ncowardly acts of violence against innocent and unsuspecting civilians--\nis to cause death, chaos, bring intense fear and intimidate the global \ncommunity. We were victims of the most horrendous terrorist attacks on \n9-11 and we all joined in feelings of renewed honor as we watched the \nterrorist attacks in Paris.\n  We need to ensure that our response is both strong in purpose and \neffective. We did that after 9-11. We put in place the most stringent \nrefugee resettlement program in the history of our country.\n  These are the facts:\n  Refugees are referred to the U.S. program after being screened by the \nUnited Nations High Commissioner for Refugees who first determines if \nresettlement in a third country is the right solution.\n  The current U.S. screening process takes between 18-24 months. It \ninvolves multiple Federal intelligence, security, and law enforcement \nagencies, including the National Counterterrorism Center, the Federal \nBureau of Investigation, and the Departments of Homeland Security \n(DHS), State, and Defense, all aimed at ensuring that those admitted do \nnot pose a threat to our country. These safeguards include biometric \n(fingerprint) to confirm identity, multiple layers of biographical and \nbackground checks, and medical screenings.\n  Specifically, each applicant's biographical information is checked \nagainst the Department of State's Consular Lookout and Support System--\nwhich includes terrorist watchlist information during prescreening. \nThen, Security Advisory Opinions from the law enforcement and \nintelligence communities for each applicant is secured.\n  All of this information helps to inform the lengthy in-person \ninterviews. DHS officers scrutinize the applicant's explanation of \nindividual circumstances to assess whether the applicant meets \nstatutory requirements to qualify as a refugee and that he or she does \nnot present security concerns to the United States. If as a result of \nthe security process, U.S. security agencies cannot verify details of a \npotential refugee's story, they are denied. These checks happen before \nan application is approved and long before a refugee would be able to \nenter the United States.\n  And these are the facts on the refugees:\n  Refugees by definition are the most vulnerable people in our global \nsociety. They are fleeing war, violence and persecution. In Syria \nrefugees are either fleeing the violence brought on by the civil war \nand the violence of President Assad's army or the terror of ISIS \noperating from there.\n  The emphasis for the U.S. program is to admit the most vulnerable--\nparticularly women and children, survivors of violence and torture, and \nthose with severe medical conditions. Since 2011, 2,034 Syrian refugees \nhave been admitted to the United States. A quarter of these refugees \nare adults over 60. Half are children. Young, single males unattached \nto families constitute only 2% of the Syrian refugee admissions to \ndate. DHS interviewers receive extensive, Syria-specific training \nbefore meeting with refugee applicants.\n  Each Member of Congress takes very seriously our number-one \nresponsibility to protect the homeland. At times of crisis it is \ncrucial that we act in a bi-partisan fashion. Regrettably that was not \nthe process followed by the Republican Majority. They crafted the \nlegislation before us today on their own and with no hearings, no \nexpert testimony, no Committee markup, and no opportunity to offer \namendment\n  As a result, the legislation before us sets a partisan course, and is \nbeing used mainly as a vehicle to criticize the President's foreign \npolicy. The current screening system has been working. This bill does \nnot improve it and could scramble up what is working. The legislation \nwould require the FBI to have their own additional and undefined \nseparate screening systems even though they currently fully participate \nin the stringent process led by the Department of Homeland Security. We \ncreated DHS after 9-11 to ensure the most effective system that brought \nall of the resources of the federal government together to combat \nterrorism. It does not seem wise to unwind that without thorough review \nand consideration.\n  The threat of terrorism brings to all of us and to communities across \nour country a sense of insecurity. It is our responsibility in Congress \nto channel those feelings into effective solutions. The legislation \nbefore us fails to do so. This bill would disrupt a screening process \nthat is working and, in so doing, would yield the moral high ground \nthat our country must hold at all costs if we are to defeat ISIS. We \ncan and must both fight terrorism and help the victims who seek to \nescape it.\n  Mr. HONDA. Mr. Speaker, I rise today in strong opposition to the \nAmerican SAFE Act of 2015 (H.R. 4038). This ill-advised, short-sighted, \nclosed-minded bill would immediately block all refugees from Syria and \nIraq from resettling in the U.S. and make the process for entry \nsignificantly more challenging for those seeking refuge here.\n  Today, we are seeing the greatest number of refugees and displaced \npersons since World War II. That fact alone is startling and \ndisheartening.\n  People do not uproot their lives and flee their homeland unless it is \nfor the most dire reasons. Who would choose to expose their children to \nmonths of traveling on foot, with only the shirt on their back? The \nfamilies fleeing from the violence in Syria are the most vulnerable in \nthe world. The majority of the refugees are children and women who are \nfleeing from their terror, sexual violence, and destruction.\n  History will remember this moment: when our nation decides whether we \nwill turn the most vulnerable away from our shores, or if we will stand \nwith humanity, be inclusive, and protect those who need our help the \nmost.\n  Mr. Speaker, I firmly oppose the American SAFE Act of 2015; it will \nonly compromise our moral standing in the world, as well as our \nnational security and safety.\n  Our Constitution is never tested during times of tranquility; it is \nduring times of tension, turmoil, tragedy, trauma, and terrorism that \nit is sorely tested. We must not allow our anger and outrage toward \nISIL terrorists and their cowardly attacks on civilians to turn us away \nfrom compassion and generosity. We must not shut our doors--not to the \nSyrian refugees, or to anyone. We need to find ways to help them find \nsafe haven from the perpetrators of these acts of violence.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to speak in opposition to \nH.R. 4038, the ``American Security Against Enemies Act of 2015'' \n(America SAFE Act).\n  This is the latest attempt to attack the President.\n  It is cheap and unworthy of this august body to engage in politics \nwhen our aim should be lofty and thoughtful policy.\n  President Obama has accomplished tremendous successes in restoring \nour nation's leadership and integrity around the world following the \ndisasters of the previous administration.\n  He inherited 2 wars including the Iraq war, an unprovoked and \nunjustified invasion, which today is a strong contributing force to the \nsituation that exists in Iraq and Syria.\n  The President has led where others have only talked--he has used soft \npower in an impressive and masterful way that thwarted Russia in its \nambitions, and to bring Iran to the\n\n[[Page H8396]]\n\nnegotiation table resulting in the curbing of that nation's nuclear \nweapon ambition.\n  Now the President's work to make sure that United States remains a \nleader in the global community by meeting the obligation to receive \nrefugees from Syria and Iraq.\n  This bill is doing damage to our national interest.\n  The American SAFE Act requires a FBI background check for every \nrefugee from Iraq and Syria who apply for asylum in the United States.\n  In addition, H.R. 4038 provides that no refugee from Iraq or Syria \ncan be granted asylum in the United States unless the Director of the \nFBI, the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, and the \nDirector of National Intelligence each make an independent \ndetermination and concur unanimously that the applicant for asylum \nposes no threat to the national security of the United States.\n  I understand that the proponents of H.R. 4038 are responding to the \nlegitimate apprehensions of many Americans shocked by the horror and \ncarnage of the terrorist attacks that occurred last Friday, November \n13, 2015, in Paris.\n  Mr. Speaker, this nation stands in unyielding solidarity with the \npeople of France, which like the United States, is one of the most \nwelcoming and freedom loving nations in the world.\n  Right now, our prayers are with the victims of the terrorist attacks \nand their families.\n  Every American can empathize with the people of France because we \nremember the terrible and heart-breaking events of September 11, 2001, \nthe first and worst attack by an enemy on American soil since Pearl \nHarbor and which took the lives of more than 3,000 innocent persons.\n  On that day Americans of all races, religions, and creeds, in every \nregion of the country were united in their shock and sadness and anger.\n  But we were united in our resolve to help each other, to defend our \nhomeland, and bring to justice those responsible, and only those \nresponsible, for their crime against humanity.\n  In the 14 years since that heart-wrenching day, our nation has \nlearned much from our initial responses to the attacks of September 11; \nwe have a much better idea today of what types of actions work, which \ndo not, which go too far.\n  And the best way to honor those who lost or gave their lives on \nSeptember 11, and to the victims of terrorism in France and other peace \nloving societies, is to apply the knowledge and wisdom we have gained \nfrom experience to meet the challenges and threats the civilized world \nfaces today from radical jihadists.\n  Last September, the Homeland Security Committee, which I have served \non since its inception, held a hearing at Ground Zero during the week \nmarking the 14th Anniversary of the September 11.\n  Homeland Security Committee Chairman McCaul, Ranking Member Thompson \nand Judiciary Committee Subcommittee on Immigration Ranking Member \nLofgren are dedicated public servants whose actions are always \nmotivated by their commitment to keep our nation safe and secure.\n  It is safe to say that this motivation is shared by every Member of \nthis House.\n  But that we all agree on the end to be achieved does not mean that we \nalways agree on the means that should be employed.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is one of those occasions because while I yield to \nno one in my commitment to protecting the homeland and keeping the \nAmerican people safe, I cannot agree that H.R. 4038 achieves that goal \nor is in the best interests of the United States.\n  On March 4, 1933, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt assured the \nnation in his Inaugural Address that ``the only thing we have to fear \nis fear itself--nameless, unreasoning, unjustified terror which \nparalyzes needed efforts to convert retreat into advance.''\n  I would not oppose this bill if I believed that it was needed.\n  This is not to say that the actions H.R. 4038 requires should never \nbe taken; only that they are not needed at this time and employing them \nwould not be an exercise of American leadership but of fear and \nretreat.\n  Our nation is better than that.\n  But it is good that we are debating H.R. 4038 because it provides us \nanother opportunity to remember who we are, what we believe, and what \nmakes our nation exceptional.\n  ISIS/ISIL aspires to bring about a bi-polar world, one divided \nbetween those Muslims who share their distorted and profaned \ninterpretation of one of the world's great religions on the one hand, \nand everyone else on the other.\n  We in the United States seek a peaceful world in which every person \non earth is free to worship in peace, live in freedom, and enjoy the \nblessings of liberty.\n  In other words, like the French, we believe in ``liberte, egalite, \nfraternite'' (liberty, equality, and fraternity).\n  ISIS/ISIL would have none of this--the world they want is one where \nmurder can be justified because you do not believe as they would have \nyou believe or live as they would have you live.\n  Women and children, religious minorities--including other Muslim \nbeliefs that differ from their views, have suffered under ISIS/ISIL's \nreign of terror.\n  The reign of terror unleashed by ISIS/ISIL is the source of refugees \nwho are fleeing from something so all-consuming and destructive that \nthey leave with nothing but their children in their arms and the \nclothes on their bodies.\n  Before September 11, few Americans could imagine that kind of terror.\n  Our allies in Europe understand that kind of terror--from the stories \nof those who sought refuge from the Nazis prior to and during World War \nII and after the war when escaping the totalitarian states of the \nSoviet-dominated Warsaw Pact.\n  Fear of the stranger has always existed, but civilization and \ninstitutions ease that fear by providing law and order to people to \nassure protection from want; violence; and war by expending resources \nto address conditions that would result in those societal destabilizing \ninfluences.\n  Each nation decides where it stands on principle, law, and \nconscience.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4038 is not necessary at this time because our \nnation already has in place the world's most rigorous screening process \nfor refugees seeking asylum.\n  Mr. Speaker, there are other alternatives to the draconian approach \nof H.R. 4038, takes such as the bill introduced by Ranking Members \nThompson and Lofgren.\n  The President is another solution for those who seek reassurance that \nevery precaution is being taken--he is in a position to certify to the \nCongress and the American people that the process is prudent and \ncareful in its actions regarding refugees seeking entrance into the \nUnited States.\n  It is helpful to recount briefly the critical elements of that \nscreening process.\n  Every applicant for asylum must:\n  1. register with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees;\n  2. provide background information, including what caused him or her \nto flee their home country (a ready means of comparing information \nprovided by more than one million refugees to further verify the \nvalidity of the information provided);\n  3. meet one of five legal qualifications: threat of violence based on \nrace, religion or faith or national origin; political beliefs; or \nmembership in a targeted social group.\n  4. undergo a rigorous background check during which investigators \nfact-check the refugee's biography to ensure consistency with published \nor documented reports of events such as bombings or other violence;\n  5. be subjected to biometric tests conducted by the Department of \nDefense, in conjunction with other federal agencies (the U.S. military \nhas an extensive biometric data base on Iraqis from its time in Iraq); \nand\n  6. sit for intensive in-person interviews, which may take months or \nyears before they are conducted.\n  Mr. Speaker, over the past several years intelligence and law \nenforcement agencies have established and perfected an intense form of \nscreening for Syrians called the ``Syrian Enhanced Review.''\n  If, during the screening process, a person from Syria gives response \nthat raise red flags he or she is selected for more intense examination \nby U.S. intelligence agencies.\n  The demographic breakdown of those Syrians who have been approved for \nrefugee status to come to the United States is as follows: children, \n50%; persons over the age of 60, 25%; combat age males, 2%.\n  Mr. Speaker, we must be careful not to engage in ethnic or religious \nprofiling.\n  Unless someone has been profiled it may be difficult to understand \nwhat collective guilt looks, or worse, feels like when it is heaped \nupon members of a group--no matter their age or their condition.\n  Here in America we have learned through bitter experience that it is \nmorally and politically wrong to regard an entire group of people as \nunworthy of compassion, regard, concern, or consideration because of \ntheir race or religion or ethnicity.\n  As I stated at the outset, I do not question the motives of those who \nprevailed upon the\n\n[[Page H8397]]\n\nHouse leadership to rush this bill to the floor for a vote today.\n  H.R. 4038 was introduced on Tuesday, November 17, and is on the floor \nfor a vote less than 48 hours later, Thursday, November 19.\n  This is fast--too fast for such a serious decision and without \nconsidering the arduous process that is in place to screen all refugees \nnot just those from Iraq and Syria.\n  Mr. Speaker, H.R. 4038 only addresses the refugee process for those \nwho are Iraqi and Syrian.\n  In its own way, it acknowledges that the process in place to vet \nrefugees is difficult so much so that no terrorist would choose it as a \nmeans to enter the United States.\n  Unlike Europe where people from the Syrian and Iraqi conflict could \nwalk by land to Europe by the tens of thousands, the United States is \nnot accessible by foot.\n  We will not take any refugees who are now in Europe.\n  Our nation welcomes millions of tourist, business travelers, and \nstudents from around the world at our airports and seaports each day.\n  The United States Refugee Asylum process is not comfortable and it \ntakes at a minimum 2 years.\n  The persons who apply must remain where they have registered until \nthe process is completed, which involves a series of in person \ninterviews, physical health status checks, collection of biometrics and \nother data as well as investigations by law enforcement and \nintelligence agencies.\n  The last thing a terrorist would want is to be a refugee--living in \nthe harsh environment of a refugee camp for two years.\n  Refugees are the victims of terrorists--ISIS/ISIL does not love \nthem--they want to murder every last one of them, because they will not \nbow to them.\n  We should be stirred by the defiance and courage that refugees \nexemplify--braving the unknown because they yearn to breathe free.\n  In truth ISIS/ISIL has killed more Muslims than any other group of \npersons because they practice their faith as they see fit and refuse to \nworship falsely.\n  This bill troubles me because it asks the impossible of professional \nlaw enforcement, national security, and intelligence agency personnel--\nby requiring a l00% guarantee that each person poses no threat.\n  No professional security or law enforcement professional will give \nanyone a 100% guarantee about anything.\n  They will not provide a l00% guarantee because they believe that \nsomething or someone is a threat--they will not provide a guarantee \nbecause it is grossly unprofessional to do so and we should never ask \nthem to do this.\n  On its face H.R. 4038 would end any hope of asylum in the United \nStates for any refugee from Iraq or Syria.\n  If this is what the leadership wants then they should say it plainly \nand have a debate about profiling as a national policy.\n  I cannot support this bill, but I am committed to working with my \ncolleagues on both sides of the aisle to find common ground.\n\n\n    THE SCREENING PROCESS FOR ENTRY TO THE UNITED STATES FOR SYRIAN \n                                REFUGEES\n\n       Applicants register with the U.N. High Commissioner for \n     Refugees, or UNHCR, which collects identifying documents; \n     biodata, such as name, date of birth, and place of birth; and \n     biometrics, most commonly an iris scan.\n       UNHCR interviews applicants to confirm refugee status and \n     the need for resettlement. Biodata, biometrics, and \n     identifying documents are checked again.\n       Applicants fulfill criteria to be considered a refugee \n     under U.S. law and processing priority qualifications.\n       Applicants meet UNHCR resettlement requirements and are \n     referred to the United States for resettlement.\n       Applicants are received and interviewed by a Resettlement \n     Support Center, or RSC, operated by the U.S. Department of \n     State's Bureau of Population, Refugees, and Migration. The \n     RSC compiles information for the security clearance process \n     conducted by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security, or \n     DHS.\n       Biographic and biometric checks: Refugee applicants are \n     vetted against law enforcement, intelligence community, and \n     other relevant databases to help confirm the applicants' \n     identity and check for any criminal or other derogatory \n     information.\n       First biographic check: Applicants are checked against the \n     U.S. State Department's Consular Lookout and Support System, \n     initiated at the time of prescreening by the RSC. Enhanced \n     interagency security checks also take place at this time.\n       Second biographic check: If applicants meet certain \n     criteria, the RSC requests Security Advisory Opinions from \n     the law enforcement and intelligence communities.\n       Third biographic check: If applicants are within a \n     designated age range, the National Counterterrorism Center \n     conducts an interagency check, or IAC. Initially, the IAC was \n     required only for Iraqi applicants but is now required for \n     all qualified refugee applicants.\n       First biometric check: Applicants' fingerprints and \n     photographs are taken by a trained U.S. government employee. \n     Fingerprints are screened against the FBI's Next Generation \n     Identification system.\n       Second biometric check: Applicants' fingerprints are \n     screened against the DHS Automated Biometric Identification \n     System, which contains watch-list information and previous \n     immigration encounters in the United States and overseas.\n       Third biometric check: If applicants are within a \n     designated age range, fingerprints are screened against the \n     U.S. Department of Defense Automated Biometric Identification \n     System, which includes fingerprint records captured in Iraq.\n       Syrian refugee applications are reviewed at U.S. \n     Citizenship and Immigration Services, or USCIS, headquarters \n     by a Refugee Affairs Division officer.\n       Applicants that meet certain criteria are referred to the \n     USCIS Fraud Detection and National Security Directorate for \n     additional review and research that is used by the \n     interviewing officer to inform lines of inquiry related to \n     applicants' eligibility and credibility.\n       USCIS interviews applicants in person while abroad to \n     determine whether or not they can be approved for \n     resettlement to the United States.\n       USCIS approves applicants for resettlement in the United \n     States.\n       Applicants undergo health screening to ensure that those \n     with a contagious disease do not enter the United States.\n       Applicants complete cultural orientation classes.\n       Applicants are matched with a U.S.-based resettlement \n     agency, a process called sponsorship assurance.\n       Applicants under a second interagency security check to \n     make sure no new information disqualifies them for admittance \n     to the United States.\n       Prior to entry to the United States, applicants are subject \n     to screening from the U.S. Customs and Border Protection \n     National Targeting Center Passenger and the Transportation \n     Security Administration's Secure Flight program.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding).

SUPPLEMENTAL LIMITATIONS ON ADMISSION OF REFUGEES.\n\n       (a) Identity Verification Required.--No refugee applicant \n     of special interest shall be admitted as a refugee, until the \n     refugee applicant of special interest has satisfactorily \n     established his or her identity pursuant to procedures \n     established by the Secretary of Homeland Security, which \n     shall address any insufficient, conflicting, or unreliable \n     information, including biographic and biometric data that has \n     not been resolved at the time of admission.\n       (b) Comprehensive Review of Refugees To Identify Security \n     Threats to the United States.--No refugee applicant of \n     special interest shall be admitted as a refugee, if, by the \n     time of admission, the identity of the refugee applicant of \n     special interest's identity has not been checked against all \n     relevant records or databases maintained by the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security, the Attorney General (including the \n     Federal Bureau of Investigation), the Secretary of State, the \n     Secretary of Defense, the Director of National Intelligence, \n     and other Federal records or databases that the Secretary of \n     Homeland Security considers necessary, to determine any \n     national security, criminal, or other grounds on which the \n     refugee applicant of special interest may be inadmissible to \n     the United States.\n       (c) Certification Required.--A refugee applicant of special \n     interest may only be admitted to the United States as a \n     refugee after the Secretary of Homeland Security certifies \n     that all provisions of this Act have been complied with and \n     that the refugee applicant of special interest has not been \n     firmly resettled in a safe third country as described in \n     section 208(b)(2)(A)(vi) of the Immigration and Nationality \n     Act.\n       (d) Monthly Report to Congress.--The Secretary of Homeland \n     Security shall submit to the appropriate Congressional \n     Committees a monthly report on, for the month preceding the \n     date of the report, the total\n\n[[Page H8398]]\n\n     number of refugee applicants of special interest and the \n     number of refugee applicants of special interest whose \n     applications were denied.\n       (e) Inspector General Review.--The Inspector General of the \n     Department of Homeland Security shall conduct an annual risk-\n     based review of a statistically valid sampling of \n     certifications and provide an annual report detailing its \n     findings to the appropriate Congressional Committees.\n       (f) Definition.--In this Act:\n       (1) The term ``appropriate Congressional Committees'' \n     means--\n       (A) the Committee on Armed Services of the Senate;\n       (B) the Select Committee on Intelligence of the Senate;\n       (C) the Committee on the Judiciary of the Senate;\n       (D) the Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental \n     Affairs of the Senate;\n       (E) the Committee on Foreign Relations of the Senate;\n       (F) the Committee on Appropriations of the Senate;\n       (G) the Committee on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (H) the Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence of the \n     House of Representatives;\n       (I) the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (J) the Committee on Homeland Security of the House of \n     Representatives;\n       (K) the Committee on Appropriations of the House of \n     Representatives; and\n       (L) the Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives.\n       (2) The term ``refugee applicant of special interest'' \n     means any alien applying for admission to the United States \n     as a refugee who--\n       (A) is a national or resident of Iraq or Syria;\n       (B) has no nationality and whose last habitual residence \n     was in Iraq or Syria; or\n       (C) has been present in Iraq or Syria at any time on or \n     after March 1, 2011.\n\n  Mr. GOWDY (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I reserve a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. A point of order is reserved.\n  The Clerk will continue to read.\n  The Clerk continued to read.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask \nunanimous consent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentleman from Mississippi?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to the rule, the gentleman from \nMississippi is recognized for 5 minutes in support of his motion.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment \nto the bill, which will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. \nIf adopted, the bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as \namended.\n  Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit will do several things:\n  The first thing it will do is require the Secretary of Homeland \nSecurity to verify the identity of refugee applicants. Any application \nthat contains insufficient, conflicting, or unreliable information \nwould be denied.\n  The second point of my motion to recommit is that this motion will \nrequire at least five Federal agencies--the Department of Homeland \nSecurity, the Attorney General and the Federal Bureau of Investigation, \nthe Secretary of State, the Secretary of Defense, the Director of \nNational Intelligence--all together to check refugee applicants against \ntheir records. Any application that indicates a national security or \ncriminal threat would be denied.\n  In addition, Mr. Speaker, my motion would also require that the \nSecretary of Homeland Security would certify that all relevant Federal \nimmigration laws have been complied with and that the applicant has not \nbeen resettled in a safe third-party country, and has the Department of \nHomeland Security inspector general's review as a sample of the \ncertifications.\n  Fourthly, Mr. Speaker, my motion to recommit would require the \nDepartment of Homeland Security inspector general to submit monthly \nreports to Congress on refugee applications from Syria and Iraq. The \nSecure Refugee Process Act of 2015 is a pro-security, pro-compassion \nbill that would ensure the U.S. continues to maintain the most \nextensive interagency security screening process in the world to vet \nall people who seek safe harbor in our great Nation.\n  Mr. Speaker, the people we are talking about in this particular \nmotion really don't have a country. Many of them have been tortured. \nThe women have been raped. The children, for lack of a better term, are \ndestitute.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  We are a Nation of values. My bill speaks to those values.\n  It does not pause the process. It does not create a moratorium on the \nprocess. It adds an additional layer of security without stopping the \nrefugee program.\n  It is not an immigration bill. It is a refugee program. As I said \nearlier, we had 23,000 individuals apply for status under this \nparticular program who were Iraqi or Syrian citizens. Of that number, \n7,000 received interviews. Of that number, around 2,000 were approved. \nSo it takes time. My motion to recommit is a prudent approach to \nrecognizing the values of this country.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, I withdraw my reservation of a point of \norder.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The reservation of a point of order is \nwithdrawn.\n  Mr. GOWDY. I rise in opposition to the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from South Carolina is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. GOWDY. Mr. Speaker, national security and public safety are the \npreeminent functions of government. National security and public safety \nare not simply factors to be considered in the administration of some \nbroader policy objective. National security and public safety are the \nultimate policy objectives. And the safety and security of our fellow \ncitizens should be the driving force behind every decision that we \nmake.\n  This country, Mr. Speaker, has a long, proud, rich history of \nwelcoming those fleeing persecution and liberating those suffering \nunder oppression. We are the most welcoming, generous country in the \nworld, having taken in over 3 million refugees since 1975.\n  We are generous and compassionate, Mr. Speaker, because we are free. \nAnd we are free because we are a country rooted in the law and public \nsafety and standards of decency protected by a fundamental commitment \nto national security.\n  The world we currently find ourselves in, Mr. Speaker, is imperfect--\nand becoming more imperfect. So, rather than address the underlying \npathology that results in displaced people, this administration is \nfocused on the symptoms.\n  There are refugees from the Middle East and northern Africa because \nthose regions are on fire and riddled with chaos. Our bright lines and \npolicies of containment, smart power, or whatever we call it today, \nhave failed.\n  Mr. Speaker, terrorists took the lives of over 100 innocent people in \nFrance and injured many more because they could. They killed a hundred \nonly because they could not kill a thousand. Their objective is evil \nfor the sake of evil, murder for the sake of murder; wanton and willful \nviolence and premeditated depravity calculated to take innocent lives.\n  The terrorists have been very open about their present and future \nobjectives. We should, therefore, be equally clear about our \nobjectives.\n  Administration officials responsible for national security and public \nsafety, Mr. Speaker, have repeatedly warned us they cannot vet failed \nnation-states. They cannot do background investigations where there is \nno database.\n  ISIS will use any means available to harm us. What this \nadministration needs to tell the American people, Mr. Speaker, is how \nmuch risk is acceptable. Given the consequences of reconciling the risk \nwrongly, how much risk is this administration willing to take?\n  When it comes to public safety, we have to be successful all of the \ntime. And those who seek to do us harm have to be successful just once. \nSo how much risk are you willing to take with your own safety? How much \nrisk are you willing to take with the safety of those you swore an oath \nto represent? Have you done everything in your power to mitigate that \nrisk? Have you done everything in your power to explore alternatives \nother than resettlement here?\n  Mr. Speaker, every decision we make as elected officials should be \nwith the safety and security of our fellow citizens as the preeminent \nobjective. Unless and until those in charge of security and public \nsafety can provide assurances, the aid we render to those in\n\n[[Page H8399]]\n\nneed should be rendered where they are.\n  In conclusion, Mr. Speaker, let me say this. The President is the \nCommander in Chief. He should help us make this, our home, safer. He \nshould help us make the homeland of the refugees safer. He should \nrestore order to the region. That would be the very best and most \nhumane thing we could all do: provide a better, safer life for those \nwho aspire for one where they are.\n  Mr. Speaker, I oppose the motion to recommit and support the \nunderlying bill.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Mississippi. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas \nand nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 and clause 9 of rule \nXX, this 15-minute vote on the motion to recommit will be followed by \n5-minute votes on passage of the bill, if ordered, and agreeing to the \nSpeaker's approval of the Journal, if ordered.\n  The vote was taken by electronic device, and there were--yeas 180, \nnays 244, not voting 9, as follows:\n\n                             [Roll No. 642]\n\n                               YEAS--180\n\n     Adams\n     Aguilar\n     Bass\n     Beatty\n     Becerra\n     Bera\n     Beyer\n     Bishop (GA)\n     Blumenauer\n     Bonamici\n     Boyle, Brendan F.\n     Brady (PA)\n     Brown (FL)\n     Brownley (CA)\n     Bustos\n     Butterfield\n     Capps\n     Capuano\n     Cardenas\n     Carney\n     Carson (IN)\n     Cartwright\n     Castor (FL)\n     Castro (TX)\n     Chu, Judy\n     Cicilline\n     Clark (MA)\n     Clarke (NY)\n     Clay\n     Cleaver\n     Clyburn\n     Cohen\n     Connolly\n     Conyers\n     Cooper\n     Costa\n     Courtney\n     Crowley\n     Cuellar\n     Cummings\n     Davis (CA)\n     Davis, Danny\n     DeGette\n     Delaney\n     DeLauro\n     DelBene\n     DeSaulnier\n     Deutch\n     Dingell\n     Doggett\n     Doyle, Michael F.\n     Duckworth\n     Edwards\n     Engel\n     Eshoo\n     Esty\n     Farr\n     Fattah\n     Foster\n     Frankel (FL)\n     Fudge\n     Gabbard\n     Gallego\n     Garamendi\n     Graham\n     Grayson\n     Green, Al\n     Green, Gene\n     Grijalva\n     Gutierrez\n     Hahn\n     Hastings\n     Heck (WA)\n     Higgins\n     Himes\n     Honda\n     Hoyer\n     Huffman\n     Israel\n     Jackson Lee\n     Jeffries\n     Johnson (GA)\n     Johnson, E.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor the fifth \nannual National Rural Health Day. The third Thursday in November is set \naside each year by the National Organization of State Offices of Rural \nHealth to recognize the unique healthcare needs of and challenges \nfacing rural Americans and their communities.\n  These challenges include fewer healthcare providers and longer travel \ndistances. The hospitals serving rural communities continue to be \nburdened by arbitrary regulations such as physician supervision \nregulations as well as the 96-hour certification rules which we \ncertainly need to address.\n  Mr. Speaker, this year, rural consumers in 12 States also face the \nchallenge of finding a new insurance plan because the so-called \nConsumer Oriented and Operated Plan, or CO-OP, created by ObamaCare, \nfrom which they purchase coverage, has failed. This includes 120,000 \nNebraskans and Iowans who bought coverage through CoOportunity Health.\n  Mr. Speaker, consumers and taxpayers deserve to know what went wrong \nwith the CO-OPs and whether the $2.4 billion in Federal loans to this \nfailing program will be repaid. I will continue to fight for these \nanswers.\n\n[[Page H8401]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1400\n                      REMEMBERING DR.

Mr. Speaker, today, I rise to remember Dr. Kevin Murphy, \nwho passed away at his home in Port St. Joe, Florida, on Thursday, \nNovember 5, at the age of 71.\n  Throughout his decades in medicine, Dr. Murphy built up an incredibly \nlong list of accomplishments, from starting a heart surgery program in \nIndiana, to visiting impoverished and isolated villages across the \nworld to provide care.\n  In 2002, Dr. Murphy moved to north Florida, where he became medical \ndirector for the Gulf County Health Center. He worked there for more \nthan a decade and became well known as a passionate health provider and \nadvocate for equal access to quality care.\n  As the proud great-granddaughter of one of north Florida's first \ncountry doctors, I have a special place in my heart for physicians like \nDr. Murphy. The amazing care he provided for his community ensures he \nwill always be loved and remembered in north Florida.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   HONORING DR.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to honor one of Arkansas' finest \nsons, Dr. Milton Pitts Crenchaw, who passed away on November 17, 2015, \nat the age of 96.\n  Born in Little Rock, Arkansas, Dr. Crenchaw became known as the \n``father of Black aviation in Arkansas.'' Dr. Crenchaw was one of the \noriginal supervising squadron commanders providing training and \ninstruction under the Civilian Pilot Training Program for the Tuskegee \nAirmen during World War II.\n  Dr. Crenchaw served his country for more than 40 years of Federal \nservice with the U.S. Army Air Corps and the U.S. Air Force. Later in \nlife, Dr. Crenchaw's advocacy on the part of veterans and his fellow \nTuskegee Airmen was relentless. In 2007, Dr. Crenchaw, along with the \nother members of the Tuskegee Airmen, were awarded the Congressional \nGold Medal.\n  His courageous service and sacrifice to his country is an example all \nAmericans and Arkansans can admire and will remember Dr. Crenchaw \nforever.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-3", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   INSTITUTE FOR ECONOMICS AND PEACE\n\n  (Mr. RICHMOND asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. RICHMOND. Mr. Speaker, I rise today to, of course, extend my \nheartfelt condolences to the victims of terrorism in Paris. But what I \nalso want to do, because I take my membership in this august body \nseriously, is to make sure that we are not fostering the perception \nthat Black lives don't matter.\n  If we look at the Global Terrorism Index, published by the Institute \nfor Economics and Peace, we would see that Boko Haram has killed 6,644 \npeople last year; 77 percent of them who were private citizens. On the \nother hand, ISIL has killed 6,073; 44 percent of them were private \ncitizens.\n  I just want to take a moment and highlight over the last 2 months the \nterrorism that has been going on in Nigeria, Cameroon, and Chad. Just \nthis Wednesday, 15 people were killed at a mobile phone market with a \nbombing; 34 people were killed with a bombing at a fruit and vegetable \nmarket; 4 people were bombed at a mosque; and 3 people were bombed at a \nmosque on November 9. And in October, more of the same. October 23, 11 \npeople were bombed at a mosque; and October 14, 42 people killed at a \nmosque.\n  Mr. Speaker, I say this to just highlight the fact that terrorism is \nplaguing communities all across this world. We should make sure that \nwe, as the United States Congress, highlight all of those communities \nand express our condolences and seek to create peace all around this \ncountry.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-4", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n       THE SECURITY OF OUR NATION MUST BE THE NUMBER ONE PRIORITY\n\n  (Mr. MARCHANT asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mr. MARCHANT. Mr. Speaker, the recent terrorist attack in Paris is a \nterrible tragedy. Our prayers go out to the victims and their families.\n  These heinous crimes and attacks are a reminder of the great threats \nthat are facing the United States and our allies. We must stand strong \nwith our international partners to eradicate this evil.\n  Here at home, we must ramp up measures to keep the American people \nsafe. That means halting the admittance of Syrian and Iraqi refugees \nuntil we are sure the vetting is airtight. And, right now, it is not.\n  The President's own security advisers have reinforced this fact. Yet \nhe is moving full steam ahead with his plan to admit 10,000 refugees \nover the next year. This is irresponsible.\n  Our Nation has the greatest and most generous refugee policy in the \nworld, but we cannot allow terrorists to exploit our compassion. The \nsafety of the American people must be our number one priority.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-5", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              TERRORISM IS PLAGUING US ALL OVER THE WORLD\n\n  (Mr. PAYNE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. PAYNE. Mr. Speaker, I would like to associate myself with the \nremarks made by the gentleman from Louisiana. Terrorism is plaguing us, \nnot only in Europe--we are concerned about, naturally, our country, the \nUnited States of America, keeping it safe--but it is happening all over \nthe world, in Europe, and in Africa. That is the reason the notion of \nBlack lives matter has been raised.\n  The African people are suffering from Boko Haram, which has aligned \nitself with ISIL as well. If we are going to fight terrorism in one \nplace, we need to make sure we fight it everywhere.\n  And let me just say, Mr. Speaker, that I am very concerned about the \nvote that was just taken today in terms of Syrian refugees. We were \nasked to have a pause. Well, if you don't feel that 18 to 24 months is \na pause in getting into this country, passing a 13- to 14-mark \nchecklist, by the time a 5-year-old gets into this country, he is 7.\n  I think that the bill that was just voted on was flawed and miscued. \nWe have a system in place that gives enough time and ample time to make \nsure that these people seeking asylum have the right to come here, as \nwe have done throughout the history of this Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-6", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8401]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          SHIFT FOCUS OFF THE HOUSE AND BACK TO THE PRESIDENT\n\n  (Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS asked and was given permission to address the \nHouse for 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Mrs. McMORRIS RODGERS. Mr. Speaker, I rise today because I am deeply \nconcerned about the future of American leadership abroad.\n  For nearly 5 years, this administration has defended a containment \nstrategy, even as ISIS rapidly escalates.\n  As Paris tragically demonstrates, containment as a strategy is as \nineffective as it is morally bankrupt. It allowed for the development \nof the world's largest humanitarian disaster since 2002, while placing \nus and our allies at grave risk.\n  This refugee crisis is a direct response to Assad's mass atrocities \nagainst Syrians, civilians, and the associated expansion of ISIS.\n  I call on the President to choose and execute a broader strategy that \ndestroys ISIS, stops Assad's reign of terror, and allows refugees to \nreturn home and rebuild their lives.\n  It is time for real commitment and real courage. The American people \nand the world are waiting.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8401-7", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8401-H8402]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n           WE ALL HAVE A RESPONSIBILITY FOR NATIONAL SECURITY\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute and to revise and extend her remarks.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, this is a long list of the vetting \nprocess\n\n[[Page H8402]]\n\nthat desperate refugees who happen to come from camps in Jordan and \nLebanon--and who happen to be Syrian--go through. It is more than 21. \nIn fact, the last one says: Prior to entry to the United States, \napplicants are subject to screening again from the U.S. Customs and \nBorder Patrol. Applicants undergo, in No. 20, a second interagency \nsecurity check.

I hope the Senate will engage in vigorous \ndebate, that the President will announce to the world that we are \nfighting ISIS. We are joining allies and taking it to the fight, but we \nmust do other things besides denying and stopping innocent refugees \nfrom coming in, a small, small number: Secure our airports; ensure that \nthe back side of the airport is secure; make sure that no foreign \nfighter is able to come into the United States, and I have introduced \nlegislation for this. We are not for not protecting. We are for \nprotecting, but we must do it in a way that America has been able to \nstand up and be respectful or recognizing, of course, all of those who \ncome and struggle.\n  Mr. Speaker, Happy Thanksgiving.

But Stalin failed in his ultimate goal. An \nindependent Ukraine today stands in resistance to aggregation from \nMoscow.\n  I would also like to recognize in our gallery, a Ukrainian-American \ninnovator, Igor Pasternak. His company, Aeros, is the first American \nfirm to provide the Ukrainian Government with the military equipment \nnecessary to defend its sovereignty.\n  Mr. Speaker, I urge my colleagues and the administration to redouble \ntheir efforts to help Ukraine protect its sovereignty by providing \nUkraine with the necessary assistance to protect her freedom.\n  The United States stands with the people and government of Ukraine as \nthey resist aggression once again now in the 21st century.\n  If you free Ukraine and it maintains its territorial integrity, it is \nin America's interest. It is, therefore, imperative that Ukraine has a \nstrong and secure border.\n  That is why I am pleased to be joined by our guests here today and \nlook forward to working with the Ukrainian Government to preserve \nUkrainian freedom and am proud that it is a company from Los Angeles \nthat is the first and, unfortunately, as of yet, the only company to \nprovide the Ukrainian Government with the military equipment it needs.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Westerman).

Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Louisiana (Mr. Graves) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n\n\n                        Louisiana National Guard\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, 3 years ago, the Louisiana Air \nNational Guard began to turn around. After coming in 38th in the Nation \nat the end of September 2012 with a 98.4 percent strength, in 2013, the \nLouisiana Air National Guard moved up to 20th, and, last year, it \nranked 15th.\n  The Louisiana Army National Guard's fiscal year 2015 end strength \ngoal of 9,554 soldiers was surpassed with a total of 9,650 soldiers, or \n101.2 percent. The Air National Guard surpassed its 2015 end strength \ngoal of 1,390 airmen with 1,496 airmen, or 107 percent of its goal.\n  Strong numbers directly relate to our ability to respond to our State \nand Nation. Great leadership under Major General Glenn Curtis has put a \npriority on personal readiness. Mr. Speaker, I will tell you that I \nhave worked very closely with General Curtis over the years, and he is \nan incredible man who has garnered incredible respect from the men and \nwomen of the Louisiana National Guard.\n  Here are a few other statistics for your information:\n  The National Guard end strength at 9,652 is 101 percent, or fourth, \nin the Nation. The Air National Guard end strength is 1,496, which is \n108 percent, or fifth, in the Nation. The Army National Guard retention \nrate is 80 percent, which constitutes first in the Nation. The Air \nNational Guard retention rate is 82 percent, which puts them in the top \n10. The medical readiness rate is 89 percent. The 256th IBCT ranked \nnumber 1 of 28 IBCTs. The Army Community of Excellence program placed\n\n[[Page H8403]]\n\nin the top 4 of 38, and it received a site visit to determine the top \nthree spots.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to commend the men and women of the Louisiana \nNational Guard for their perseverance, for their strength, and for \ntheir contribution to the State of Louisiana and to the United States \nof America.\n\n\n                                 Syria\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, the United States military \nbegan active engagement in Syria back in September of 2014 when the \nUnited States-led coalition began its ongoing airstrike campaign, along \nwith Bahrain, Jordan, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE. During this \nperiod, the Pentagon also administered a $500 million program to train \nand equip moderate Syrian opposition forces to target ISIS. This effort \nfailed to train many soldiers or to yield the desired results; so the \nadministration scrapped the effort.\n  The wide range of state and nonstate actors in Syria has created one \nof the most geopolitically complex conflicts in recent memory. This \nhighlights the urgency and the necessity for a clear strategy in Syria: \nWhat is the United States' end game? A definition of what success means \nin Syria. A strong commitment to eliminating any and all threats that \nISIS poses to the United States, its allies, or a shift away from the \nconflict.\n  I believe this administration has been incredibly vague about all of \nthose, and I have repeatedly reached out to the White House on this \ntopic, and I will continue to call on the President to articulate a \nclear path forward in Syria.\n  Before the United States risks any American lives and resources, the \nadministration, the State Department, and the Department of Defense \nshould provide clarity on U.S. objectives and on how the ongoing use of \nmilitary force fits into a comprehensive strategy for success in the \nregion. Success needs to be defined, but I would suggest defining \nsuccess as the neutralization of all direct threats ISIS poses to \nAmerica and our national security.\n\n  We need to clarify the U.S. strategy in Syria now, and I hope to work \nwith the administration and with other Members of Congress toward \ngetting us on the right path. Well before this Syrian refugee issue \nbecame a hot-button issue, I joined together with Members on the other \nside of the aisle in bipartisan efforts to reach out to the Department \nof Defense, to reach out to the administration in order to express \nthese very concerns.\n  Mr. Speaker, let's be clear. It is our failed policy in Syria that \nhas created this predicament of refugees. If we had a clear strategy--a \ndefinitive strategy--if we had clear objectives, if we were aggressive \nin achieving those objectives, of eliminating and of neutralizing ISIS, \nof creating a new government structure there to fill the void created \nby our removing and helping to remove with the international community \nthe Assad regime, we wouldn't have refugees. We would have stability in \nSyria. We would have a place for people to live, and there would not be \nthis refugee situation where tens of thousands of folks are being \ndisplaced into the United States and other areas, where we have this \nthreat to our national security and the inability to vet these refugees \nbefore they come into the United States.\n  Mr. Speaker, as reports have indicated in recent days--and I want to \nbe clear that this isn't from any classified setting. This is a place \nwhere you, apparently, get real information--the Drudge Report. There \nare reports right now of folks with fake Syrian passports who are being \nquestioned in Honduras and in Costa Rica. There are reports of Afghan \nand Iraqi refugees from years ago in Kentucky and in other areas who \nhave been involved in efforts to attack the United States. I will say \nthat again. There are refugees from other countries--from Middle \nEastern nations of Iraq and elsewhere--who were previously brought to \nthe United States and who had, apparently, not gone through a \nsufficient vetting process who were caught trying to attack the United \nStates, according to reports that are out there now. There are reports \nof folks from the Middle East who are trying to illegally cross over \nand come into Arizona and Texas.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is clearly a systemic failure--the inability to \nplace refugees, to secure our borders, to secure our Nation. This isn't \na partisan issue. We should not be sacrificing the security of \nAmericans. There are ways in which we can be good community citizens, \ngood world leaders, and allow for refugees to come here or, better yet, \nto stabilize, to help work with the international community to \nstabilize their own countries.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to continue to work with other Members of \nCongress, including with our Louisiana delegation. Just this week, \nSenator Vitter introduced legislation to address the refugee problem to \nensure that we are not threatening Americans' security, to ensure that \nwe are not sacrificing the safety and security of Americans in exchange \nfor those from Syria. Together, with Congressman Boustany, Congressman \nAbraham, and Congressman Fleming, we introduced companion legislation \nin the House of Representatives to ensure that that happens.\n  I want to be clear again, Mr. Speaker. This is not some jumping to \nthe hot issue of the day. Before this issue became a crisis and was in \nthe news, we joined together with Congressman Babin and others to \nensure America's safety, to ensure that we were properly vetting these \nrefugees before they came to the United States, and to understand the \nimplications to taxpayers--the cost of having these folks here in the \nUnited States.\n  Mr. Speaker, I am very proud of the strong bipartisan vote that just \noccurred here in this body, but we need to continue to work together in \na bipartisan fashion. This is not a partisan issue. Terrorism affects \nevery American, and we need to continue to be very aggressive and not \nallow this to degrade into partisanship. This is about the safety and \nsecurity of the United States.\n\n\n                    Land and Water Conservation Fund\n\n  Mr. GRAVES of Louisiana. Mr. Speaker, the Land and Water Conservation \nFund was first authorized in 1965. There was some type of compromise \nthat was reached at that time whereby this proliferation of offshore \nenergy production would occur. At the same time, there was a concern \nthat those activities could threaten the environment; so there was a \nnegotiation reached whereby the first $900 million of offshore energy \nrevenues from oil and gas production would be committed to the Land and \nWater Conservation Fund.\n  The idea was that half of those dollars would be used to go toward \nthe acquisition of Federal lands for the purpose of creating or growing \nnational parks or wildlife refuges, BLM land, and national forests. \nHalf of the funds would be authorized to go to stateside grant programs \nfor similar types of activities in order to increase recreational \nopportunities, State wildlife refuges, and State parks for citizens in \nthe United States. That stateside program is a match of 50-50. The \nStates have to put up half of the money.\n  Mr. Speaker, I would call the Land and Water Conservation Fund and \nits objectives a laudable goal to preserve these recreational and \nconservation activities for Americans. Certainly, as this Nation's \npopulation grows, we are going to continue to develop areas. So, for \nthese areas that are especially sensitive, productive, and beautiful, \nlet's ensure that we create those opportunities and retain those \nopportunities for recreation for Americans for generations to come.\n  The Land and Water Conservation Fund expired for the first time in \nits history. This program is no longer an authorized program, and there \nhave been folks on both sides of the aisle who have been working to \nhelp to reauthorize the program.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  I will say it again, Mr. Speaker. I think it is a laudable goal. \nHowever, 50 years have passed. I think, with 50 years of history of \nthis program, it is appropriate to go back and revisit the lessons \nlearned.\n  I am from Louisiana. I want to be clear. This offshore energy \nactivity that has funded the billions of dollars over the last 50 years \nin the Land and Water Conservation Fund activities and other things, \nlike the Historic Preservation Fund, is from oil and gas and offshore \nenergy activities occurring offshore our coast at home in Louisiana.\n  Various discussion drafts have been proposed to take these funds and \ncut\n\n[[Page H8404]]\n\nthem up and allocate them to different programs across the country, to \nslice up the pie. I think that is great for all these people to go out \nthere and express their dream or vision for how all these things \nhappen.\n  However, I would like to bring you back to reality. I view this as \nbeing our money, and I will tell you why. Right now, when you produce \nenergy on Federal lands in the United States, 50 percent of the money \ngenerated from those activities go to the States that host the \nproduction.\n  So let me be clear on this. The States of Wyoming and New Mexico \ntogether receive over a billion dollars a year with no strings attached \nwhatsoever. An additional 40 percent of the money from those same \nactivities go into the reclamation fund to fund water projects in those \nsame western States.\n  So, in effect, 90 percent of the funds from energy production on \nFederal lands goes back to the States that largely host that energy \nproduction on Federal lands. Yet, when we go in the offshore, folks \ntake the money and decide they are going to divvy it up to all these \nother States, but not the State where the energy is produced.\n  Now here is a reason why I am so frustrated by all of these efforts \nto reauthorize and continue spending this money all over the country in \nother programs. Mr. Speaker, we have produced nearly $200 billion in \nrevenues for the U.S. Treasury. We have received not the 90 percent \nthat other States have received nor 50 percent. We have received less \nthan a fraction of 1 percent back.\n  The State of Louisiana passed a constitutional amendment that would \ndedicate any funds received to go toward actually restoring the \nenvironment for things like coastal restoration. The State of Louisiana \nhas lost over 1,900 square miles of our coastal wetlands.\n  Why is it that we are reauthorizing the Land and Water Conservation \nFund and funding environmental and conservation efforts in other \nStates, particularly in western States?\n  I will acknowledge again it is a laudable goal. But why are we doing \nthat before we are addressing environmental issues right there where \nthese activities are occurring and, in many cases, are occurring as a \nresult of historic, several-decades-ago activities that occurred in the \ncoastal area related to this OCS production?\n  It seems to me, Mr. Speaker, as we move forward on this, that that \nneeds to be a critical component. That needs to be the priority, is \naddressing environmental issues, addressing conservation, right here \nwhere this money is derived from because the activities simply aren't \nsustainable if we don't address this.\n  I fully support the reauthorization of the Land and Water \nConservation Fund. I think it needs to be done in a principled manner \nthat recognizes the lessons learned over the last 50 years and, most \nimportantly, recognizes the fact that this area that has generated \nnearly $200 billion for the United States Treasury has severe \nenvironmental consequences or severe environmental problems right there \nas a result of the Federal Government's actions.\n  Mr. Speaker, the Deepwater Horizon disaster was truly one of the \nNation's worst environmental disasters in our history. That disaster \nresulted in millions of barrels of oil covering nearly 600 miles of the \nState of Louisiana's coast.\n  The U.S. Department of the Interior appropriately took a look at well \ncontrol and blowout preventer regulations and guidelines to ensure that \na disaster like the Deepwater Horizon disaster and the awful tragedy to \nthe 11 lives that occurred would never occur again. I think it is \nappropriate to take a look at that.\n  The U.S. Department of the Interior actually took 4\\1/2\\ years behind \nclosed doors to develop a well control and blowout preventer regulation \nthat was put forth in recent months. It took 4\\1/2\\ years to write this \nregulation behind closed doors without involvement and without \nengagement of this multibillion-dollar industry.\n  Now, the regulation was paired with a 30-day comment period. I am \ngoing to say that again. They took 4\\1/2\\ years to draft a regulation \nand they gave 30 days for folks to actually comment on it.\n  Of course, being very concerned about that and the implications \nwhether the rule was actually going to improve safety or be a detriment \nto safety, we asked that more time be given to comment to allow us to \nfully understand it, to allow the industry to fully understand it, and \nto allow the environmental community to fully understand it.\n  The administration came back and gave a 60-day comment period, which \nis absolutely absurd with the complexity. Keep in mind, Mr. Speaker, it \ntook them 4\\1/2\\ years to draft it.\n  Now, to give you an idea of the disconnect here, the U.S. Department \nof the Interior says that compliance with the rule is going to cost \n$800 million. A separate analysis that was done independently says that \nthe cost of compliance is going to be in excess of $30 billion, Mr. \nSpeaker. The disconnect there is crystal clear just in the cost \nestimate.\n  It is going to have a detrimental effect on the United States' \nnational energy security. What this is going to result in is it is \ngoing to result in us becoming more independent on energy sources from \naround the world.\n  Why are we not being energy self-sufficient and utilizing our \nresources here, promoting jobs here?\n\n  There is a study that I read that says, for every dollar in U.S.-\nproduced energy, it has a $3 implication on our economy. For every \ndollar spent at the pump on foreign energy, it has a 40-cent \nimplication on our Nation's economy. I think the answer there is \ncrystal clear. We should become energy self-sufficient. We should be \nutilizing our own energy resources.\n  Mr. Speaker, analyses have determined that 20 percent of the oil and \ngas wells produced in the offshore over the last 5 years would not be \nproduceable under this rule, not even produceable. Let me give you an \nidea what that means. That causes an estimated $12 billion economic \nloss to the United States, to the U.S. Treasury, just over the next 10 \nyears.\n  Now, you would think that the U.S. Department of the Interior would \nwant to get this rule right, and you would think that they would be \nengaging folks. Yet, we have had phone call after phone call from \npeople saying they are refusing to engage, they are refusing to take \nmeetings, and they are refusing to discuss.\n  Mr. Speaker, I have actually experienced it myself, asking the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior for a meeting with the Gulf Coast \ndelegation, with House Members and Senators, to sit down and discuss \nthis to ensure that the Department of the Interior gets it right. And I \nwant to be clear on what ``right'' means, which is to make things \nsafer, not to propose regulations that are actually going to result in \nthe potential for disaster.\n  I am not an expert in offshore production, but I can read the \nregulations and determine the disconnect and the lack of technical \nunderstanding of the folks who drafted this rule. Yet, the U.S. \nDepartment of the Interior also told us that they would not meet with \nus, shutting the door.\n  Mr. Speaker, this is the United States of America. That is not how \nthis country works. People at agencies have to understand that they \nshouldn't be sitting in some ivory tower drafting regulations that are \ngoing to export jobs, that are going to increase the trade deficit, and \nthat are going to make us reliant or dependent upon nations like \nVenezuela for energy, nations that don't share America's values. What \nin the world are we doing? Who is running this place?\n  This is the United States of America. We have had people who have put \ntheir lives on the line to protect our freedoms and to protect our \ngreatness. I don't think this is what they were protecting or that this \nis what they were fighting for.\n  Mr. Speaker, I want to urge, as we move forward on legislation at the \nend of this year, that we take appropriate action to ensure that \nAmerica's energy security is protected, to make sure that America's \nindependence is protected, to make sure that we don't take actions that \npenalize or increase our trade deficit, and that we promote American \njobs, America's economy, and America's workforce.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back.\n\n[[Page H8405]]\n\n  \n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8405-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8405]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n\n                 TERRORIST ATTACKS AND SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mrs. Comstock). Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. \nCosta) is recognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority \nleader.\n  Mr. COSTA. Madam Speaker, I rise today to express my deepest \ncondolences to all the individuals who have been affected in recent \nmonths by terrorist attacks throughout the world and, also, to focus on \nthe need for America to step up and to in a more comprehensive way lead \na global effort again these terrorists.\n  My thoughts and prayers--and our thoughts and prayers as a Nation--\ncontinue to be with the people of France, Algiers, Lebanon, and Russia, \nthe victims and their families, who are suffering during this time.\n  With worldwide attention and support for defeating terrorism, America \nhas a new opportunity to draw a line in the sand and lead a global \ncoalition. The United States, our allies, and those who oppose \nterrorist groups must come together on a comprehensive plan for \neliminating terrorist organizations, like ISIL, al Qaeda, and all those \nwho support terrorist activities, whether it be on the Internet or in \nall sorts of ways that we are discovering today.\n  America must provide the leadership and use all of the resources at \nour disposal to eliminate these terrorist organizations and their \nsupporters. I understand that the world is facing a humanitarian crisis \nand it is a serious problem.\n  I think we here in the Congress all understand that our first \nresponsibility is to protect and defend the American people from all \nenemies, foreign and domestic. We take an oath when we are sworn in \nevery 2 years for that purpose.\n  The Syrian refugees are seeking safety, and the United States has a \nthorough vetting process for those refugees and others. We can always \nimprove our efforts to protect the American public while at the same \ntime providing the very humanitarian aid that is necessary.\n  Recent terrorist attacks have led Congress to assess the current \nprocess the United States uses to grant entry to refugees who are \nseeking safety from their country. These are women and children. These \nare innocent people who have been terribly impacted by the civil war in \nSyria. There are camps in Jordan with over a million and a half people, \nand Turkey has a similar number. Of course, we see the accounts of \nthese refugees fleeing to Europe.\n  What do we do? We have to respond. The legislation that passed today \nand the legislation that the Senate has introduced today is an effort \nto improve the current system. Clearly, these legislative efforts are a \nwork in progress and they will change.\n  To succeed, we must work closely with the President always to focus \non ways that we can improve to protect American citizens because we \nknow this, that terrorists never ever sleep. I believe the \nadministration is doing everything it can to make absolutely certain \nthat our efforts to provide that humanitarian support does not threaten \nAmerican lives.\n  In addition to ensuring that a strict and thorough vetting process is \nin place, we need to pursue comprehensive efforts that include working \nwith our allies to end this civil war in Syria, which, as we know, is \nthe primary source of this refugee crisis.\n  Let's be clear. It is easy to Monday-morning-quarterback this, but \nthere are multiple causes to the conflicts in Syria and, in essence, \nmore than one war that is taking place.\n  There is the civil war that is caused by Assad, but there is a proxy \nwar between Russia and Iran against the Sunni nations. Then, of course, \nthere is a conflict going on between Turkey and the Kurds.\n  Then, of course, there are our collective efforts for the majority of \nthe countries to go after ISIL and their horrific crimes. We have \nconflicting alliances within the multiple conflicts that are taking \nplace within Syria today.\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Therefore, it is not easy as we try to sort this out in a way to put \nthis comprehensive strategy together. If a global coalition is put in \nplace, we can, I believe, combat this terrorism activity and bring \nthose terrorists responsible for these horrific crimes, crimes against \nhumanity, to justice. And we must.\n  Let's face it. They have declared war on Western civilization and our \nvery way of life. I know that the President is working very hard to put \nthis comprehensive effort together.\n  Ladies and gentlemen, Madam Speaker, this is not nor should it be a \npartisan issue. Every Member of Congress and the President go to bed at \nnight, and we wake up in the morning with the safety of the American \npeople being always our first priority.\n  Let me repeat that. This is not a partisan issue. We all fear for a \nworst case scenario. Therefore, we must be working together in a \nbipartisan effort on any concepts of legislation that we consider with \nthe administration, with the President to continually improve our \nability to protect our American citizens.\n  Now, it is important that we understand that this will be costly, and \nsacrifices will inevitably be made. Today, American men and women are \nin harm's way in the Middle East, serving in our military, doing their \nvery best on multiple fronts. It is not just the sacrifices they are \nmaking, but it is the sacrifices their families are making as well.\n  It is essential that we come together to develop and implement a \nlong-term comprehensive plan. At the end of the day, it is the only way \nwe will protect our freedoms and our way of life. This is what is at \nstake, and this is why, as we go home for the Thanksgiving recess, with \nour families and friends, we contemplate how we might do a better job \nworking with the administration.\n  As we look at this Thanksgiving week coming up, truly we have a lot \nto be thankful for in this Nation. We must remember as Americans, the \ncommon values that we share, the bonds that we hold most dear are far, \nfar stronger than whatever differences we may have.\n  Madam Speaker, I wish my colleagues here in the Congress, as we go \nback to our homes throughout America, a very blessed Thanksgiving with \ntheir families and friends. May God bless the United States of America, \nand may He grant us the guidance to work together in a more united way \nto solve these difficult challenges we have in front of us today, \nbecause we know, working together, all is possible.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8405-2", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H8405-H8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                            SYRIAN REFUGEES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nGohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Madam Speaker, these are the times that try men's souls.\n  After so many Americans have given the last full measure of devotion \nfor their country, for our freedom, for the freedom of so many others, \nwe are at a time in our history when we have enemies reporting that \nthey are entering the United States. That is confirmed by the Director \nof the FBI and others in this administration. As is now reported, there \nare active ISIS elements in every State in the Union.\n  Some say, well, those who want to suspend bringing in Syrian \nrefugees, wouldn't that be like telling the Jews during World War II \nthey couldn't come to America? Actually, it would be more like saying \nwe are going to suspend bringing Germans--we are going to keep bringing \nin German Jews because clearly they are being persecuted. We are going \nto try to save them from the Holocaust, but we are going to suspend \nbringing in those who appear to have similar backgrounds to the Nazis \nbecause we are not sure who is Nazi and who isn't.\n  Can you imagine dealing with what France has dealt with after we \nwelcomed with open arms Nazis before and during World War II, if that \nhad been the policy of the Roosevelt administration? Thank God it \nwasn't. But, unfortunately, Jews were turned away before and during \nWorld War II.\n  The President wants to continue bringing in refugees, continue the \nmass migration of illegal aliens into the United States. We have this \nreport from yesterday by Brandon Darby and Ildefonso Ortiz. They report \non eight\n\n[[Page H8406]]\n\nSyrians being caught at the Texas border in Laredo yesterday.\n  The story says:\n  ``Two Federal agents operating under the umbrella of U.S. Customs and \nBorder Protection are claiming that eight Syrian illegal aliens \nattempted to enter Texas from Mexico in the Laredo Sector. The Federal \nagents spoke with Breitbart Texas on the condition of anonymity, \nhowever, a local president of the National Border Patrol Council \nconfirmed that Laredo Border Patrol agents have been officially \ncontacting the organization with concerns over reports from other \nFederal agents about Syrians illegally entering the country in the \nLaredo Sector. The reports have caused a stir among the sector's \nBorder Patrol agents.\n\n  ``The sources claimed that eight Syrians were apprehended on Monday, \nNovember 16, 2015. According to the sources, the Syrians were in two \nseparate `family units' and were apprehended at the Juarez Lincoln \nBridge in Laredo, Texas, also known officially as Port of Entry 1.''\n  The President has also stated in recent days--it's been played over \nand over as the President condemns Republicans and conservatives and \nliberals and moderate Americans across the specter of politics, \nAmericans who are concerned about one thing: the safety of their \nhomeland.\n  The President comes out and condemns, and he said: ``When I hear \npolitical leaders suggesting that there would be a religious test for \nwhich a person who's fleeing from a war-torn country is admitted . . . \nthat's shameful. . . . That's not American. That's not who we are. We \ndon't have religious tests to our compassion.''\n  It doesn't violate the rules of the House to point out when an \nelected official is ignorant. It is a violation to insinuate some ill \nmotive. I am insinuating no ill motive. I am stating that the President \nis completely ignorant of what our laws are because the law is very \nclear, if you look at 8 U.S.C. 1158--and I need to tip the hat to \nAndrew McCarthy. I have got his article in front of me from yesterday, \nfrom nationalreview.com.\n  He points out that under Federal law the executive branch is \nexpressly required to take religion into account in determining who is \ngranted asylum. Under the provision governing asylum--and again, that \nis 8 U.S.C. section 1158--``an alien applying for admission''--and this \nis the law--``must establish that . . . religion . . . was or will be \nat least one central reason for persecuting that applicant.''\n  Now, there are other potential reasons that can be given for \nestablishing the persecution, but religion is a very important one, and \nwe have always looked at that issue as being important. If you are \nbeing persecuted for your religious beliefs in the world, that is \nalways historically American to look at that fact and determine, yes, \nthere is a religious test, and these people are being persecuted \nbecause of their religious beliefs, and only if we look at their \nreligion and whether or not that religion is being persecuted can we \ndetermine whether they are entitled to asylum.\n  So to answer the question that is raised by the ignorant statement by \nour President, the truth is, yes, it is American. It is the law. We \nneed to know what religion you are to determine whether or not you are \nbeing persecuted for your religion.\n  In another place, and this is over from 8 U.S.C., this is in section \n1101, and this is the section regarding refugee status, but to qualify, \nthe applicant must be a refugee as defined by Federal law, and then \nthat definition is what is at section 1101(a)(42)(A).\n  ``The term `refugee' means (A) any person who is outside any country \nof such person's nationality . . . and who is unable or unwilling to \nreturn to . . . that country because of persecution or a well-founded \nfear of persecution on account of . . . religion.''\n  Religion is important to take into account in determining whether \nsomeone is truly a refugee. It is American. It is not shameful. It is \nwhat we have done historically, and that is why I would have a Baloch \nminority in my office today talking to me about persecution against the \nBaloch people in Iran, because, as he says, Americans have \ntraditionally been compassionate when people are being persecuted \nunfairly. And we have. And to take such persecution into account, we \nlook at whether religion is a factor in their persecution. That is \nAmerican. It is recognized even in Iran as being American and being \nunshameful--not only not shameful, but being to the glory and credit of \nthe United States of America that we do care.\n  Mr. McCarthy's article goes on. He says:\n  ``In the case of this war, the Islamic State is undeniably \npersecuting Christians. It is doing so, moreover, as a matter of \ndoctrine. Even those Christians the Islamic State does not kill, it \notherwise persecutes as called for by its construction of sharia \n(observe, for example, the ongoing rape jihad and sexual slavery).''\n  From my discussions when I have been in Nigeria with the poor \nAfricans whose children have been kidnapped, they explained it was only \nthe daughters that were being kidnapped and that the school was \nattacked.\n  I asked: Was it attacked because it was a girls school and they don't \nwant girls having education?\n  They said they don't want girls having education, but that is not the \nreason they attacked it. They attacked it because it was a Christian \nschool.\n  So these radical Islamists associated with the Islamic State, they \nattack schools, particularly Christian schools; and after they attack a \nChristian school, the Nigerians explained they bring the children out, \nand if they are boys, they just go ahead and kill them immediately \nbecause they are Christian boys, and they don't want that to spread.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  If, however, they are girls, the Nigerian Africans who were victims \nof Boko Haram explained, they don't kill them. No. But you couldn't \nreally say they weren't persecuted because they are kidnapped and they \nare kept strapped to beds and they are repeatedly raped until such time \nas they are sold into sexual slavery.\n  And this administration, according to some in Nigeria, has said: We \nmay help you, but you have got to adopt a same-sex marriage provision, \nor we are not going to be such help to you.\n  And as one Nigerian bishop said, to his deep credit: Our religious \nconvictions are not for sale--not to President Obama, not to anybody.\n  God bless them.\n  The same effort was made to push Kenya into adopting same-sex \nmarriage laws against their religious beliefs in that country. I was so \nproud of the Kenyan President. And I have heard other African leaders \nsay they were so proud. They were also proud in Africa of the Kenyan \nPresident not being intimidated by President Obama's demand that they \nchange their marriage laws to go against the teachings of the man whose \nprofile is right up here above the main door to our Gallery--a man \nnamed Moses--who said he was speaking for God. And according to God's \nlaw, a man shall leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home \nand the two will become one flesh. That was to be marriage.\n  When Jesus was asked about marriage and divorce, he quoted Moses \nperfectly--the man we have depicted up here in our House Chamber. He \nquoted Moses perfectly: A man shall leave his father and mother and a \nwoman leave her home and the two will become one flesh. And then he \nadded to Moses' perfect quote: And what God has joined together, nobody \nput asunder.\n  Anyway, our President was in African in the past trying to push them \ninto changing their laws, but unfortunately for people in areas where \nradical Islamist's have reigned, if you are a Christian, you are being \npersecuted for your religious beliefs. And if you are a Christian boy \nin a school that Boko Haram attacks, they will most likely just shoot \nyou, kill you; and if you are a girl, they take you into sex slavery, \nin all likelihood.\n  McCarthy goes on: ``To the contrary, the Islamic State seeks to rule \nMuslims, not kill or persecute them.''\n  I think that is a very important point Mr. McCarthy makes. The \nradical Islamists are not seeking to kill or persecute Muslims like \nthey are Christians. They are seeking to rule them.\n  Mr. McCarthy goes on:\n  ``Obama prefers not to dwell on the distinction between the jihadist \ntreatment of Muslims, on the one hand, and\n\n[[Page H8407]]\n\nof Christians, Jews, and other religious, on the other hand, because \nhe--like much of Washington--inhabits a world in which jihadists are \nnot Islamic and, therefore, have no common ground with other Muslims . \n. . notwithstanding that jihadists emerge whenever and wherever a \npopulation of sharia-adherent Muslims reaches critical mass. While \nthere is no question that ISIS will kill and persecute Muslims whom it \nregards as apostates for refusing to adhere to its construction of \nIslam, it is abject idiocy to suggest that Muslims are facing the same \nubiquity and intensity of persecution as Christians.\n  ``And it is down right dishonest to claim that taking such religious \ndistinctions into account is `not American,' let alone `shameful.' How \ncan something American law requires be `not American'? And how can a \nnational expression of compassion expressly aimed at alleviating \npersecution be `shameful'?''\n  That is Andrew McCarthy yesterday, the NationalReview.com.\n  ``The State Department Turns Its Back on Syrian Christians and Other \nNon-Muslim Refugees'' is an article by Nina Shea, November 2. She says: \n``Over the past 5 years of Syria's civil war, the United States has \nadmitted a grand total of 53 Syrian Christian refugees, a lone Yazidi, \nand fewer than 10 Druze, Baha'is, and Zoroastrians combined. That so \nfew of the Syrian refugees coming here are non-Muslim minorities is due \nto American reliance on a United Nations refugee-resettlement program \nthat disproportionately excludes them. Past absolute totals of Syrian \nrefugees to the United States under this program were small, but as the \nObama administration now ramps up refugee quotas by tens of thousands, \nit would be unconscionable to continue with a process that has \nconsistently forsaken some of the most defenseless and egregiously \npersecuted of those fleeing Syria.\n  ``The gross underrepresentation of the non-Muslim communities in the \nnumbers of Syrian refugees into the U.S. is reflected year after year \nin the State Department's public records. They show, for example, that \nwhile Syria's largest non-Muslim group--Christians of the various \nCatholic, Orthodox, and Protestant traditions--constituted 10 percent \nof Syria's population before the war, they are only 2.6 percent of the \n2,003 Syrian refugees that the United States has accepted since then.\n  ``Syria's Christian population, which before the war numbered 2 \nmillion, has since 2011 been decimated by what Pope Francis described \nas religious `genocide.' ''\n  I want to insert at this point, Madam Speaker, that I have been \nadvised that this administration is now saying that the persecution of \nChristians is not being deemed a genocide. Perhaps it is because this \nadministration feels like if you are taking the young girls and putting \nthem into sex slavery and you are not outright killing them--you are \njust raping them and putting them into sex slavery--then maybe that is \nnot a genocide. You are letting the girls live.\n  So maybe they are so callous that they would consider it is not \ngenocide if you just rape and put these young girls who are Christians \nor from Christian families into sexual slavery.\n  This article from Nina Sea says:\n  ``Clearly, far more than a dozen members of Syria's religious \nminorities should qualify as refugees under the legal definition of a \nrefugee as someone with a `well-founded fear of persecution based on \nreligion.'. . . Instead minorities have difficulty getting to step one \nin the U.N. process. The religious terror that drove them from Syria \nblocks their registering. The Office of the United Nations High \nCommissioner for Refugees is largely limited to collecting refugee \napplications and making resettlement referrals from its own camps and \ncenters--the burden of feeding creates strong incentives for this \npractice.\n\n  ``In an email to me, Knox Thames, the State Department's new Special \nAdviser for Religious Minorities wrote that `many minorities have not \nentered the U.N. system because they are urban refugees.' That is, \nbecause they live far from the remote U.N. camps and aid centers, they \nlack the information and access to register. And, as is widely known, \nmany non-Muslim refugees try hard to avoid these camps.''\n  The reason Christians try to avoid these U.N. camps is that they are \nMuslim.\n  In fact, in this article, it is pointed out:\n  ``According to British media, a terrorist detector asserted that \nmilitants enter U.N. camps to assassinate and kidnap Christians. An \nAmerican Christian aid group reported that the U.N. camps are \n`dangerous' places where ISIS, militias, and gangs traffic in women and \nthreaten men who refuse to swear allegiance to the caliphate.\n  ``Such intimidation is also reportedly evident in migrant camps in \nEurope, leading the German police union to recommend separate shelters \nfor Christians and Muslim migrant groups.''\n  The article goes on to point out:\n  ``According to a recent UNHCR posting, 19,000 Syrians picked straight \nfrom `refugee camps in Turkey, Lebanon, and Jordan,' have received U.N. \napproval and are awaiting resettlement in the United States. In \nOctober, President Obama ordered their expedited admission. Without \nfurther action, however, only token numbers of non-Muslim minorities \nwill be among those rescued. George Carey, former Archbishop of \nCanterbury, called it right about the Christian refugees, and his words \nequally apply to Syria's other non-Muslim communities: They are being \n`left at the bottom of the heap.' ''\n  There is an article from Todd Starnes, November 18--yesterday--\nentitled ``Obama is Importing Muslims, Deporting Christians.''\n  Well, if this is true, so much for his test--that we don't care about \nreligious tests.\n  But this article says:\n  ``When individuals say we should have a religious test and that only \nChristians--proven Christians should be admitted--that is offensive and \ncontrary to American values, the President said--just one day after he \ncalled such behavior un-American.''\n  But as Todd Starnes says:\n  ``What is offensive and contrary to American values is refusing to \nproperly investigate those wanting to come to our Nation--especially \nthose coming from regions that are hotbeds of Islamic extremism.\n  ``Those of us who fear that Islamic radicals might be lurking among \nthe refugees have been called every name in the book: bigots, \nIslamophobes, and un-American . . . But the President says such \nprudence only further enflames the Islamic jihadists.''\n  The President warns that it is counterproductive and needs to stop.\n  The truth is, I will insert parenthetically, what has been a huge \nrecruiting tool for ISIL, ISIS, and the Islamic State, has been \nAmerican weakness and unwillingness to confront radical Islam head up \nand call it what it is.\n  We found back when we were engaged in Iraq that one of the big \nrecruitments that was used by radical Islamists is they would go back \nto 1979 and the fact that Jimmy Carter did not after they attacked our \nEmbassy and took over 50--51 people or so--as hostages. We did \nbasically nothing to them.\n  And they point out that we pulled out of Beirut after our Marines \nwere killed there. And they go out and point out the 1993 attack on the \nWorld Trade Center under Bill Clinton. We really did nothing after that \nin response. And after the USS Cole was hit, we basically did nothing \neffective.\n  And they go on to point out each time that America has been hit and \nwe did nothing effective to counter the attack upon us, that is the \nbiggest recruiting element that ISIS or any radical Islamist group has \nhad, when they can show that they have attacked and we have been weak.\n  And nothing has been shown to be less effective in responding to \nattacks against us, against Americans, against Christians, against \nminority groups, against moderate Muslims, then what has happened \nduring this administration. Call George W. Bush what you will, but the \nfact is the world knew that while he was President, if you messed with \nAmerica, he would strike back.\n\n                              {time}  1515\n\n  That is what led Qadhafi to abandon his nuclear efforts. It led him \nto open up his doors. You tell me what weapons I can keep. He was \nafraid we were going to invade them next.\n  According to this article, it says, ``But the cold, hard reality is \nthat Protestants, Catholics and Jews aren't\n\n[[Page H8408]]\n\nthe ones beheading people. The Lutherans and Nazarenes aren't gunning \ndown young folks in concert venues.''\n  Nevertheless, the President remains steadfast. The Muslims will come.\n  ``We don't have religious tests to our compassions,'' he told \njournalists from high atop his soapbox.\n  But that is not entirely accurate. Last year the Obama administration \nled a fierce legal battle to have a German Christian family thrown out \nof the United States.\n  The Romeikes fled their homeland in search of a nation where they \ncould homeschool their children. A judge initially granted them asylum, \nbelieving they were escaping from religious persecution. However, the \nObama administration waged a fierce campaign against the Romeike \nfamily, demanding they be returned to Germany.\n  The family lost court battle after court battle, but, at the eleventh \nhour, the White House relented and begrudgingly let them stay.\n  But just a few months ago a Federal Immigration judge ordered a dozen \nIraqi Christians deported from a facility in San Diego. An Immigration \nCustoms Enforcement spokesperson declined to tell the San Diego Union \nTribune why the Iraqi Christians were being sent back to their native \nland.\n  So the next time President Obama wants to lecture the Nation about \nreligion, maybe he could explain why his administration is importing \nMuslims and deporting Christians.\n  I realize that I just have a few minutes left, Madam Speaker. Our \nhearts, our prayers and thoughts have been with the people of France \nand Lebanon and Russia, victims of radical Islamist attacks and \nanywhere they have been occurring, Brussels, as well.\n  There is great irony. On Wednesday of last week, the European Union \nannounced what it had been building to for some time. In essence, it \nannounced it was declaring economic war on Israel.\n  Anti-Semitism has grown all over the European Union to levels I never \nwould have dreamed, as a little boy, would ever come back to Germany, \nwhere we read and studied about the Holocaust and the persecution of \nJews not just in Germany, but around Europe, and there were other \ncountries that actually assisted the Germans.\n  There were people like George Soros, who was Jewish, that helped \nfinger other Jews. I never thought we would get to the level of anti-\nSemitism where Europe, as a whole, as a group, would basically declare \neconomic war against Israel. Incredible how anti-Semitism has grown \nthere.\n  And then, within 48 hours of them declaring war, siding with the \nPalestinian Muslims, siding with those--they are attacking the \nChristians and Jews in Israel and siding with the wrong people.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "19"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/11/19/house-section/article/H8408-1", "month": "11", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H8408]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         ENROLLED BILLS SIGNED\n\n  Karen L.
