Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize a man who has \nliterally walked the walk in support of our Nation's wounded warriors.\n  Mr. Speaker, 65-year-old Richard Albero, a former Naval officer and \nmath teacher from Dunedin, Florida, recently completed an 86-day, \n1,150-mile walk from home plate at Steinbrenner Field in Tampa during a \nspring training game to home plate at Yankee Stadium in New York City. \nHe did so to honor his fallen nephew. Richard's nephew, Gary, worked at \nthe World Trade Center and lost his life in the 9/11 attacks.\n  In addition to honoring his nephew, Richard also chose to do \nsomething very special. He walked to raise money for the Wounded \nWarrior Project. His goal was to raise $25,000.\n  During Richard's trek up the East Coast, which began on March 2, he \nwent through six pairs of shoes. He suffered blisters on his feet and \ntraveled over countless hills and endured the many elements, yet \nRichard never gave up.\n  Very recently, just a few weeks ago, he completed his walk, arriving \nat Yankee Stadium to a cheering crowd. Along the way, Richard blew past \nhis goal for raising money and raised $55,000 for the Wounded Warrior \nProject.\n  Mr. Speaker, Richard's nephew would be most proud and the Members of \nthis body should be most proud as well as we reflect on and remember \nthose who lost their lives and those who pay tribute to them today, \nthose like Richard Albero.\n  May God bless Mr. Albero. May God bless our men and women in uniform \nwho protect us each and every day. And may God bless these United \nStates.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4385-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4385-H4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                         TRANSPORTATION FUNDING\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Chair recognizes the gentleman from \nOregon (Mr. Blumenauer) for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. BLUMENAUER. Mr. Speaker, there is a tremendous crisis facing \nAmerica, but it is not one you hear much about on Capitol Hill. It is \nkilling hundreds of people a year, injuring thousands more. It is \ncrippling America's global standing, as we have fallen in the world \nranking from number 1 down to 27 and falling further. It is having a \nprofound effect on our global economic competitiveness, while costing \nAmerican families hundreds of dollars a year in extra expenses.\n  Of course, it is complicating the lives of American business and \nfamilies by losing millions of hours that otherwise could be put to \nproductive work, at exercise, or with their families, and on the job.\n  If it were any other subject, there would be cries of outrage and \nalarm and calls for action. You would see a flurry of action here on \nCapitol Hill.\n  Sadly, this decline, this cost, this damage is the result of our very \nreal infrastructure crisis, a crisis to which Congress has been \nindifferent at best and negligent at worse.\n  Despite countless examples of the crying need for infrastructure \ninvestment, Congress has been paralyzed, trying to pay for 2015 costs \nof infrastructure with 1993 dollars. Congress has not taken any \nsystematic action since 1993, and the time has long since passed for \naction.\n  Thirty-three short-term extensions of transportation finance is not a \nsubstitute for action. No nation became great building its \ninfrastructure 9 months at a time.\n  To be fair, there are people on Capitol Hill who do care about this \nand have proposed action:\n  My friend and colleague Peter DeFazio, the ranking member on the \nTransportation and Infrastructure Committee, has proposed a barrel tax \non petroleum. He has proposed a financial fee on transactions, both of \nwhich would go a long way toward solving this problem.\n  My Ways and Means colleagues Jim Renacci and Bill Pascrell have \nproposed a mechanism that would be a failsafe, that if Congress didn't \nact to fund infrastructure, the gas tax would be indexed and increased.\n  Our Maryland colleague John Delaney has identified vast sums of\n\n[[Page H4386]]\n\ncorporate money parked overseas that could be made available for \ninfrastructure investment in the United States if it were returned for \nthat purpose.\n  And I have proposed, along with two dozen of my colleagues, that we \nsimply bite the bullet and do what Ronald Reagan did in 1992--raise the \ngas tax for the 1st time in 22 years.\n  When I introduced this proposal in this Congress, it was supported by \nthe widest array of groups on any major contested issue on Capitol \nHill. It was supported by the top echelons of business, of organized \nlabor, of the building trades, construction companies, local \ngovernment, transit, bicycles, truckers, AAA, all in alignment that \nCongress should step up and remedy this situation.\n  There are solutions. There are people who think about it. We need to \nhave the same level of courage and urgency that has been shown by \npeople at the State and local level where they don't have the luxury of \nliving in a Capitol Hill bubble. They have to deal with the \nconsequences, and they have stepped up, 19 States since 2012--in fact, \n6 States already this year. Idaho, Utah, Iowa, South Dakota, Nebraska, \nand Georgia, deep red States, have all raised the gas tax in 2015.\n  I am pleased that tomorrow the Ways and Means Committee will have its \nfirst hearing on transportation finance in the 56 months since my \nRepublican colleagues took over. It is no substitute for Congress \nrolling up its sleeves and acting, but it is an important start. And I \nhope it will signify a full-court press in that committee to finally \nget down to cases and solve this problem.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4386-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                       MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT\n\n  A message in writing from the President of the United States was \ncommunicated to the House by Ms. Wanda Neiman, one of his secretaries.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4386-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Mr. Speaker, last week, the House approved part of a \nlegislative package on trade promotion authority, or TPA.\n  There have been many mischaracterizations of what TPA is. Every day I \nhear from constituents who want me to hold President Obama accountable. \nWell, TPA does just that by providing accountability to the President's \ntrade negotiation efforts through enhanced congressional oversight and \nadditional transparency. The allegations that TPA is something for \nPresident Obama is false.\n  It is important to recognize that more than 95 percent of the world's \ncustomers live beyond U.S. borders, and 1.2 million jobs in North \nCarolina rely on trade with them. Trade-related employment in North \nCarolina grew 3.8 times faster than total State employment from 2004 to \n2013.\n  While I heard many different perspectives on TPA from my \nconstituents, the argument from North Carolina families, farmers, and \nemployers that negotiating these trade agreements is in the economic \nbest interest of our State was a deciding factor for my vote in favor \nof TPA.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4386-9", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4386]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 REBUILDING OUR NATION'S INFRASTRUCTURE\n\n  (Mr. KILDEE asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. KILDEE. Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for Congress to come \ntogether and pass a bold, bipartisan plan to rebuild our Nation's \ninfrastructure.\n  Right now, China is spending 10 times as a percentage of GDP what we \nare on infrastructure. They are making huge investments in roads, \nbridges, ports, and rail. Meanwhile, Congress has simply not acted to \nput us on a competitive path in this global economy.\n  Now, a lot of debate has occurred here in the last weeks and days \nabout our position in global trade, and we should have a trade deal \nthat protects American jobs.\n  Meanwhile, what are we doing about China outspending us on \ninfrastructure, which makes us less competitive? How are we supposed to \ncompete with them when we haven't done anything to deal with our \ncrumbling roads and bridges that are essential to making our \nmanufacturers competitive in delivering their products to market?\n  It is time for bold action, big action on infrastructure, like the \ndevelopment of a national infrastructure bank that would leverage \npublic capital with private capital to rebuild our crumbling roads and \nbridges.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is long past time for action. There is bipartisan \nsupport for this. We need to bring a big infrastructure bill to the \nfloor of the House.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4386-10", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4386-H4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n        MAJORITY OF PENNSYLVANIANS SUPPORT HYDRAULIC FRACTURING\n\n  (Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania asked and was given permission to \naddress the House for 1 minute.)\n  Mr. THOMPSON of Pennsylvania.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of H.R. 160, the \nProtect Medical Innovation Act, that will be considered on the floor \nthis week.\n  One of the most fundamental flaws of what is known as the Affordable \nCare Act is trying to offset the trillion-dollar price tag by imposing \nan arbitrary 2.3 percent tax on lifesaving medical devices, such as \npacemakers and heart valves. It actually discourages the type of \ninnovation that will improve our healthcare system for people needing \nthese devices.\n  Hindered with these new high costs, our small businesses are finding \nit increasingly difficult to innovate, curtailing medical advancements \nand often delaying the availability of new treatments and cures for \npatients. I personally visited a number of these companies and \nunderstand how important their work is to improving our healthcare \nsystem.\n  Taxing innovation is not a 21st century healthcare solution. This \ndevastating tax is reported to have already caused a net loss of over \n33,000 jobs.\n  American families and small businesses deserve better, and the House \nis committed to advancing commonsense ideas to ease the burdens of the \nPresident's healthcare law. H.R. 160 is one of those solutions.\n  I ask my colleagues to join me in support of repealing this job- and \ninnovation-killing tax that only limits options for those who really \nneed these lifesaving devices.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4387-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM\n\n  (Ms. JACKSON LEE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. Mr. Speaker, as we rally around the obvious in the \nneed for criminal justice reform and, in essence, the rehabilitation of \nour criminal justice laws as we deal with the interaction of law \nenforcement and civilians, having a pathway for respect for both, one \nof the most forgotten aspects is dealing with the treatment of \njuveniles in the criminal justice system.\n  I intend, over the next couple of weeks, to introduce a series of \nlegislative initiatives that address that form of the criminal justice \nsystem, which we find, as parents and family members, touches all \njuveniles.\n  One of the things that the bill recognizes is that a young person's \nbrain is still developing into his or her early twenties, and that \nthose who commit crimes before this point should be treated differently \nby the criminal justice system.\n  The purpose of this effort is to improve the treatment of young \noffenders within the Federal criminal justice system and to put them on \na path toward successful reentry by providing options for the \nsentencing judges: a safety valve for young offenders which would, in \nessence, break through the mandatory minimum; an early release for \nyoung offenders; and, particularly, alternatives such as massive use of \nhome arrest.\n  Our children are our future.

This tax is \nset to cost New Hampshire's largest city, Manchester, over $5 million.\n  Americans simply can't afford another costly tax, and that is why I \nintroduced H.R. 879, a bill to repeal the so-called Cadillac tax. As we \nprepare to vote on a series of healthcare bills this week, I urge my \ncolleagues to join me in cosponsoring this commonsense bill.\n  H.R. 879 is a win for employers. It is also a win for municipalities. \nAnd, most importantly, it is a win for all those hard-working Americans \nwho expected the President to keep his promise that, if you like your \nhealthcare plan, you can keep it.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4387-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4387]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                   EXPORT-IMPORT BANK REAUTHORIZATION\n\n  (Mrs. TORRES asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute.)\n  Mrs. TORRES. Mr. Speaker, in just 6 legislative days, the charter of \nthe Export-Import Bank will expire.\n  The Ex-Im Bank has proven an important tool in expanding U.S. exports \nand creating American jobs. It has done that with bipartisan support at \nzero cost to the taxpayers.\n  I would like to mention two companies in particular that have \nreceived support from the Ex-Im Bank: Able Industrial Products in \nOntario and Desiccare in Pomona. These aren't giant, faceless \ncorporations. They are very small businesses that provide jobs for the \nInland Empire residents.\n  The world economy is getting more competitive, and the Ex-Im Bank is \nhelping to level the playing field for American companies. If my \ncolleagues truly want to protect U.S. jobs and U.S. workers, we can't \nafford to let the Ex-Im Bank expire. It is time to allow a vote.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4387-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4387-H4388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1215\n                      TRIBUTE TO DORELLA ANDERSON\n\n  (Mr. TAKANO asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n\n[[Page H4388]]\n\n  Mr. TAKANO.

Mr. Speaker, last week the International Air Transport \nAssociation recommended a new guideline that would reduce the size of \ncarry-on luggage. The new carry-on size limit is 21 percent smaller \nthan the size currently permitted by most major domestic airlines.\n  Eight major international carriers have already adopted the new size \nlimits, and the trade association is suggesting more airlines will be \nadopting it soon. If implemented by our domestic carriers, this will \nforce consumers to spend more on checked baggage fees and/or purchase \nnew luggage to meet this new guideline.\n  Enough is enough. Airline passengers are tired of getting squeezed by \nairlines, both physically and fiscally. The seats are smaller, the \nlegroom is less, the prices are more, and the profits are more.\n  That is why I introduced the Carry-on Freedom Act. The bill would \nprohibit airlines who charge for checked baggage from reducing the size \nof carry-on baggage from the current size standards and would protect \nconsumers from even more cost to travel. I urge my colleagues to stand \nup for consumers and pass the Carry-on Freedom Act.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4388-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4388]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 PROSTATE CANCER IS A NATIONAL EPIDEMIC\n\n  (Mr. BUTTERFIELD asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mr. BUTTERFIELD. Mr. Speaker, prostate cancer is a national epidemic, \nthe most common cancer in men. One in seven men will be diagnosed, with \nmore than 220,000 new cases each year, and 28,000 men will die from \nprostate cancer this year. Prostate cancer, Mr. Speaker, \ndisproportionately impacts African American men, who have the highest \nprostate cancer rates of any racial or ethnic group. Black men are \ntwice as likely to be diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 2\\1/2\\ \ntimes as likely to die from that disease.\n  Last week, I introduced the National Prostate Cancer Plan Act along \nwith Congressmen Mike McCaul, Elijah Cummings, and Walter Jones. The \nbill would establish the National Prostate Cancer Council and direct \nthem to develop and implement a national strategic plan to accelerate \nthe innovation of diagnostic tools to improve early detection and \nreduce unnecessary treatment.\n  Prostate cancer can strike anyone. Many of us have either been \npersonally affected by this disease or have lost a loved one.

I join \nover 1 million Americans who voted in an online poll conducted by Women \non 20s, a nonprofit grassroots organization, to put a woman on the $20 \nbill.\n  To celebrate the amazing achievements of women throughout our \nhistory, I introduced the legislation to Put a Woman on the Twenty Act, \nH.R. 2147, which would empower the Secretary of Treasury to put a woman \non the face of a $20 bill as soon as possible.\n  Since the first general circulation of paper currency in this \ncountry, no woman has ever held the honor of being featured on paper \nmoney, and I would say to Secretary Lew that you need look no further \nthan the people's choice winner, Harriet Tubman, for inspiration. In \nher words, ``Every great dream begins with a dreamer.'' In her dreams, \nshe always had a vision.

Under his watch, Palm Beach \nState College has become the eighth-largest producer of associate \ndegree graduates in America. From expanding STEM education programs \ncoveted by local employers to creating an honors college for high-\nachieving students, Palm Beach State College flourished under Dr. \nGallon's leadership.\n  Just last year, the United States Department of Education reported \nthat Palm Beach State College offers the sixth-lowest tuition rates \nnationwide. Dr. Dennis Gallon's commitment to high-quality, affordable \nhigher education is truly admirable, and his tenure as president of \nPalm Beach State College deserves our praise and gratitude.\n  Congresswoman Frankel, and I am sure Congressman Hastings, and I \nproudly thank him for his remarkable service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4388-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4388-H4389]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                      RENEW THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK\n\n  (Mrs. CAROLYN B.

That is the approximate number of Ex-Im credit \nagencies that are competing with us around the world that are waiting \nfor our Bank to expire so they can grab that American export business.\n  3,340. That is the number of small businesses that are supported \nright now by the Ex-Im Bank, helping them to export their goods and \nprovide jobs.\n  164,000. That is the number of American jobs that are provided right \nnow this year by the Ex-Im Bank that we would lose immediately.\n\n[[Page H4389]]\n\n  1.3 million. That is the number of private sector jobs that have been \ncreated by the Bank since 2009, with no additional cost to the American \ntaxpayer. In fact, it makes money to help us pay down our debt.\n  And, finally, zero. That is what we gain by killing our Bank. Zero. \nWe don't get the revenue. We don't get the jobs.

This past weekend, the city of Lynn lost a dedicated \npublic servant, a tireless local volunteer, and an inspiring advocate \nfor the people of our community. Domenic D'Ambrosio, known by many as \nDom, was loved by many for his uncanny ability to connect with people. \nWhether they were old friends or someone he was meeting for the first \ntime, Dom's compassion for others was contagious, encouraging all of us \nto be better members of our community.\n  At a time when public opinion of Congress is at an all-time low, \nDom's belief in this institution and the power of the democratic \nprocess could not have been stronger. I thank him for bringing a \nreinvigorating energy to our Nation's political dialogue and for \nreminding us why we are so fortunate to have a free and democratic \ngovernment, and why we should all take part in making it better.\n  My thoughts and prayers are with his wife, Kelly, his family, and \nfriends. The Sixth District of Massachusetts lost a true champion, but \nI know that his legacy will live on through our shared commitment to \npublic service.

Mr. Speaker, I rise today to recognize the \nmonth of June as Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month. Approximately \n340,000 Texans and 5.4 million Americans currently have Alzheimer's \ndisease. One in nine Americans over 65 is projected to develop \nAlzheimer's, and it is the sixth-leading cause of death in the United \nStates.\n  The rapidly growing number of older Americans will lead to a \ncorresponding rapid growth in the prevalence of Alzheimer's disease. \nThe devastating emotional and financial impact of this debilitating \ndisease is known by too many. My mother-in-law battled this disease, so \nI know firsthand how difficult it can be for patients and their loved \nones.\n  I strongly support efforts to advocate and raise awareness and robust \nfunding for research to find treatments and cure for this disease. \nCongress has a real opportunity to dramatically impact the lives of \nmillions of Americans by funding research and outreach programs for \nAlzheimer's.\n  I urge my colleagues to join me in recognizing the month of June as \nAlzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month.

Mr. Speaker, I am pleased to bring forward \ntoday this rule on behalf of the Rules Committee. This rule provides \nfor a robust amendment debate on a wide variety of issues related to \nthe authorization of funds for 16 intelligence agencies.\n  This rule provides for the consideration of H.R. 2596, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. The Rules \nCommittee met on this measure yesterday evening and heard testimony \nfrom both the chairman of the committee and the ranking member, in \naddition to receiving amendment testimony from multiple Members.\n  This rule brought forward by the committee is a structured rule. \nThere were 29 amendments in total submitted to the Rules Committee. Of \nthose 29, I am pleased that the full House will debate and vote on 16 \nof those amendments, over half that were submitted.\n  The majority of the amendments made in order are bipartisan, a fact \ndemonstrating the unity of this body in advancing funds that will go \ndirectly to fighting against terrorism proliferation and weapons of \nmass destruction.\n  ``To provide for the common defense'' is a common phrase to us all, \nand one that clearly sets forth the more basic responsibility of our \ngovernment, a responsibility that the members of the Rules Committee, \nthe Intelligence Committee, and, yes, I believe the entire House do not \ntake lightly.\n  This rule provides for 1 hour of general debate equally divided and \ncontrolled by the chair and the ranking member of the Permanent Select \nCommittee on Intelligence.\n  As most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified \nprograms, all Members were given the opportunity to review the \nclassified annexes to the underlying legislation prior to Rules \nCommittee consideration.\n  Members should also be aware that section 2 of the rule provides that \nthe motion to reconsider the vote on Trade Adjustment Assistance, or \ntitle II of the Senate amendment to H.R. 1314, may continue to be \npostponed through Thursday, July 30, 2015.\n  This postponement was necessary to allow House and Senate leadership, \nin addition to the President, sufficient time to consider legislative \noptions related to this action on trade promotion authority and Trade \nAdjustment Assistance.\n  I am proud of the work undertaken by the Intelligence Committee to \nadvance this vitally important legislation whose consideration is \nprovided for by this rule.\n  There are a few key provisions that I want to ensure Members are \naware of because I believe they speak to the overwhelming awareness the \nIntelligence Committee possesses of the responsibility of Congress to \nprotect this Nation from terrorism, and also of our unwavering fidelity \nto the United States Constitution.\n  First, section 302 of the underlying legislation provides that the \nauthorization of appropriations by this act shall not be deemed to \nconstitute authority for the conduct of any intelligence activity that \nis not otherwise authorized by the Constitution or the laws of the \nUnited States.\n  Sections 303 and 304 require specific elements of the executive \nbranch to provide Congress with timely notifying requirements on key \nintelligence activities. Congressional notification requirements \ngenerally remain a vitally important mechanism to ensure that Congress \nis able to conduct robust oversight.\n  Notification requirements specific to the intelligence community are \neven more essential, given the classified and delicate nature of the \nsituations our intelligence agencies face every day.\n  The classification of documents and the decisionmaking factors that \ngo into such classification have historically been an area of great \ninterest and, at times, concerns by Members of this body and the \ncitizens that we represent.\n  In response to the valid concerns and interest by Members and the \npublic at large, in the Intelligence Committee's report on H.R. 2596, \nthey specifically state that the committee ``seeks to improve its \nvisibility into the classification process and better understand how \nthe intelligence community determines the classification level of \nespecially sensitive reporting and analysis.''\n  In the underlying legislation, the committee carries out this goal by \ndirecting the Director of National Intelligence to provide, within 60 \ndays of the enactment, a report to the congressional intelligence \ncommittees outlining each instance in the past 5 years that the Office \nof Director of National Intelligence or any other entity within the \nexecutive branch directed an element of the intelligence community to \nbegin disseminating existing uncompartmented intelligence reporting or \nanalysis through a compartment or subcompartment.\n  This requirement is just one of several additional reporting \nrequirements in the legislation to serve to enhance Congress' role in \nand understanding of the classification process, again, emphasizing \nCongress' oversight role. The committee has done a good job in \nclarifying that.\n  The underlying legislation also directs the Central Intelligence \nAgency to provide the congressional intelligence committees with all \nintelligence reports based on the documents collected in the May 1, \n2011, raid that killed Osama bin Laden.\n  We live in a dangerous world and face constant and evolving threats \nfrom terrorist groups like al Qaeda, Boko Haram, al Shabaab, and ISIS. \nThese groups successfully use the Internet to anonymously build their \nresources, both human and financial.\n  The United States Government must maintain and enhance their ability \nto counter extremists online. By understanding how and where terrorist \ngroups operate, we can more effectively fight for freedom at home and \nabroad. I am pleased to see strong provisions in the legislation that \nwill further this goal.\n  These provisions that I have just spoken of are just a few examples \nof the thoughtful and difficult work the Intelligence Committee \nundertook to bring forward this legislation that authorizes critical \nnational security functions while staying within the funding \nconstraints of the Budget Control Act, or BCA.\n  I want to thank the Intelligence Committee and their staff for their \nhard work on the authorization measure.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I may consume, \nand I thank the gentleman, my friend from Georgia, for yielding the \ncustomary 30 minutes for debate.\n\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule provides for consideration of H.R. 2596, the \nIntelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, as well as \nprovides that the\n\n[[Page H4391]]\n\nmotion to reconsider the vote on passage of the Trade Adjustment \nAssistance measure may continue to be postponed until the end of the \nlegislative day on July 30.\n  First, I commend the efforts of Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member \nSchiff for their effort in crafting a bill with largely bipartisan \nsupport that provides our Nation's intelligence community with the \nresources they need to keep us safe. Our national security relies on \nthe continued strength of our intelligence community.\n  As we face ongoing security challenges both at home and abroad from \nthreats such as ISIL, lone wolf attacks, the emergence of cybercrime, \nas well as the specter of unknown challenges that may be awaiting us, a \nstrong intelligence apparatus is of the utmost importance.\n  This legislation will do much to meet those challenges. Specifically, \nthis bill supports investments in cutting-edge technology like spy \nsatellites, enhances our Nation's human intelligence capabilities, \nprovides resources to safeguard valuable signals intelligence \ncollection, and partners with our foreign allies to maximize the reach \nof our intelligence efforts.\n  This investment in our country's intelligence infrastructure comes at \na critically important time. As you know, the Office of Personnel \nManagement recently suffered a disastrous breach. Hackers were able to \ntarget OPM and gain access to personnel data, including employees' \nnames, addresses, Social Security numbers, and numerous other personal \ndetails.\n  Perhaps most disturbing, OPM houses the applications and files \nsubmitted by those applying for security clearances, with data going \nback until 1985. These files were compromised as well, leading some \nexperts to argue that the compromise of these files could have \ntremendous negative effects for our human intelligence gathering \ncapabilities.\n  These cyber attacks represent a critical threat to our national \nsecurity. We all love the convenience that technology provides us, but \nwe must also be prepared to invest in technologies that will protect us \nfrom those who wish to sabotage our security in the virtual world. It \nis time for the OPM to implement and abide by best practices so that we \nnever face a data breach like the one we saw last week.\n  To the extent that Congress will play a role in securing our virtual \ninfrastructure, we should work as quickly as possible to ensure that \nour employees and our most sensitive material are not needlessly \nexposed to those who wish to do us harm.\n  Mr. Speaker, while I support the strong national security protections \nthis authorization provides, I am extremely disappointed yet again in \nhow my Republican colleagues have skirted the fiscal cuts imposed by \nsequestration in order to fund the things that they care about, while \nignoring the effects such fool-headed cuts have on the vital domestic \nprograms that they don't seem to care about. We have people hurting all \nover this Nation because of this irresponsible and senseless policy of \nsequestration.\n  Republicans claim to be using this policy as an important tool to \nrein in out-of-control government spending; yet, when sequestration \naffects programs and areas of the budget they care about, they \nmagically get around this dilemma by using accounting gimmicks.\n  That is just what they have done here in this measure. The majority \nhas yet again used the overseas contingency operations account to evade \nsequestration spending caps.\n  Wouldn't it be nice if Republicans wanted to evade spending caps for \nthe Department of Education so that we can get around sequestration and \nproperly educate our children? Or if they could use accounting tricks \nto get around sequestration to fully fund and repair our crumbling \ninfrastructure? Or if they were also inclined to use their budgetary \nmagic to get around sequestration caps to properly fund critically \nimportant agencies like the Environmental Protection Agency so that our \nchildren and grandchildren can continue to have access to clean water \nand clean air?\n  Alas, all we get from the majority is more of the same budgetary \ndouble standard, using tricks to get around spending caps on things you \nlike to spend money on and then cry, ``sequester, sequester,'' on \nthings you don't like to spend money on.\n\n                              {time}  1245\n\n  Let's stop pretending. That isn't a plan to rein in government \nspending. That is just spending taxpayer money on things you deem \nworthy of unfettered spending and ignoring programs, for political \nreasons, that you don't even like, even though such programs remain \nvital to our country's success.\n  Mr. Speaker, many on my side of the aisle have taken issue with the \ndetention facility in Guantanamo Bay since day one; I certainly have. \nOnce again, the Republicans look to continue the operation of this \nprison, when we should be working to bring about its orderly closure.\n  We are better than this prison. As a country dedicated to the rule of \nlaw, as a country that inspires people the world over to work for and \neven die for the establishment of democratic rule, we are better than \nthis prison. This prison is an exercise in Kafkaesque justice, which \nhas long worked to undermine our standing with our allies and helped \nterrorist organizations recruit more and more fighters.\n  Look, I don't think that anyone is arguing that, if we close the \nprison, then the myriad terrorist groups who use it as a recruiting \ntool will no longer have people joining their ranks, but it would be \none less arrow in their quiver.\n  For that reason, we need to work together to close the prison as \nquickly as possible. In doing so, we will not jeopardize the safety of \nour country, but will act more fully to reflect our commitment to \ndemocracy and the rule of law.\n  We know and I know, having been in the judiciary, that our justice \nsystem is more than capable of handling the prosecution of terrorists, \nno matter where they are, including those held in Guantanamo Bay.\n  We have successfully tried Richard Reid, Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, \nFaisal Shahzad, and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev--the Boston bomber--and we have \neither sentenced them to death or life imprisonment in our most secure \nprisons.\n  At last night's Rules Committee meeting, my friends on the other side \nof the aisle decided to make a last-minute change to today's rule--or, \nI might add, to further pollute today's rule. That last-minute change \nallows for the postponement of the motion to reconsider TAA.\n  Over the course of my tenure in Congress, I voted to support \nthousands of pieces of legislation. In the 20-plus years that I have \nserved in this body, I can think of only three votes which I deeply \nregret making, and one of those was in support of NAFTA.\n  In the years since, I have seen after NAFTA a decrease in American \njobs, a rollback of critical environmental protections here and in \nMexico, where I was promised that the environmental circumstances in \nthe maquiladoras would be cleaned up and they were not and a stagnation \nof wages that has prevented the financial upward mobility of working \nclass and middle class Americans and has ground poor Americans into \npoverty beyond belief.\n  If we are going to create trade policy that is worthy of future \ngenerations, then we must ensure that that policy strengthens, not \nweakens, labor rights. It must strengthen, not weaken, environmental \nprotections. It must ensure other countries' responsibility to adhere \nto basic human rights. It must expand and strengthen our middle class, \nnot squeeze hard-working Americans in favor of corporate interests.\n  The legislation included in this rule today is part of a trade \npackage that does nothing to bolster these important priorities.\n  Finally, as I have stated time and again, I take issue with the \nmanner in which these important measures are being considered. \nLegislation as important as the ones at hand deserve an open and \ntransparent process where Members of both parties and both Houses of \nCongress may debate and offer amendments as they please.\n  This process, envisioned and designed by our Founding Fathers to \nserve as a safeguard to democracy, continues to be eroded by the \nmajority's insistence on grouping multiple, unrelated bills together \nunder one rule and limiting the number of amendments that can be made \nin order, as well as the time available for debate.\n\n[[Page H4392]]\n\n  There were amendments offered last night. For example, Congresswoman \nSpeier offered whistleblower protection, not made in order. My \ncolleague Representative Schweikert from Arizona and I offered a very \nsensible measure under the intelligence provision to allow for us, as a \nsense of Congress only, to say that we will participate with Tunisia's \nintelligence operation in a more pronounced manner--totally innocuous, \nbut at the very same time, helping a country that may very well make \nthe bridge to democracy and certainly has been an ally in \nintelligence--and a needed one, in light of the number of people that \ncome up from north Africa through Tunisia and wind up fighting in the \nMiddle East.\n  If we are truly to operate as the deliberative body the U.S. House of \nRepresentatives was created to function as, we must do more to ensure \nthat our Nation's most critical pieces of legislation are afforded the \ntime and consideration they rightly deserve.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida. One of the \nthings that I, coming on to the Rules Committee, have found is really \nthe vigorous debates that we do have--and the gentleman from Florida, \nwe have had many of those, and that is a good place for it.\n  It is a good place for it also here on the floor to discuss what \nreally, as was focused on very clearly, is a rule for a bill, and then \nthere is a procedural issue that we are extending the TAA \nreconsideration until July 30. I am understanding what he is saying, \nbut I do want to make Members clear that is what is happening.\n  We are working on the majority side for a process that is open. \nSixteen amendments are going to be made in order, and they are going to \nbe debated right here on the floor of this House and voted. I think \nthat is what the Republican majority is focused on.\n  One of the things that came up--and I want it to be clear, Mr. \nSpeaker, is the gentleman brings up a point. It is about priorities. It \nis about priorities. When we are dealing with authorizations and \nspending bills, is what we are dealing with in the majority here, we \nhave made it very clear, I believe, from the Republican majority \nstandpoint, although I personally and others may have discussions on \nhow we use overseas contingency funds, and those have been debated on \nthis floor and should be continued to be debated on this floor.\n  However, one of the things that we are doing, and I believe, from our \nperspective, is we are putting priorities first--priorities for \nnational defense; securing our national interest; and in light of this \nbill, making sure that our country is safe, abroad and here, from \nattacks from people who don't like us.\n  I don't buy the argument--and the debate on Guantanamo is a different \nissue--but the argument that if we closed it up, it takes away one \nrecruiting piece. I am sorry. Boko Haram, al Qaeda, these others do not \nhate us only because of a prison; they just hate us because we are \nfree. They hate us because we have a society that is open.\n  I understand the debate that we want to have, but let's make it \ncrystal clear. There was no Guantanamo when they rammed planes into our \nWorld Trade Center. There was no Guantanamo at that time. They just \ndon't like us. Let's make that very clear.\n  Funding is appropriate. We will debate those entirely upon this House \nand continue to. The Republicans will still look out for jobs and those \nworking in the middle class, and those that are trying to find their \nfamilies' priorities in their own economic sphere and looking at it in \na country that is in debt and trying to make sure we make good fiscal \ndecisions.\n  Our priorities are that we help businesses start, we encourage the \ncreation of jobs, not a government strangulation of jobs, and that is \nwhat resources do.\n  With this bill, it is very focused, though. This is about our \nintelligence community. This is a rule that supports an authorization \ncoming from a very difficult community that does a very difficult job. \nWe are supporting a rule that funds those agencies so that it keeps us \nsafe and does the things that keeps America free. That is the continued \nargument that we will continue to have.\n  I appreciate, Mr. Speaker, the other debates that we want to have \nhere, but let's be focused. This rule is about that. It is also about a \npolicy decision or a procedural decision in this rule.\n  Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am very pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Connecticut (Ms. \nDeLauro).\n  Ms. DeLAURO. Mr. Speaker, the vote on Trade Adjustment Assistance \nfailed in the House of Representatives last Friday by a 3-1 margin; yet \nthis rule today would extend the revote on Trade Adjustment Assistance \nthrough the end of July. This is one more attempt to play games with \nthe future of hard-working families.\n  American workers demand and they deserve respect. They deserve a \nliving wage and the right not to have their jobs shipped overseas. That \nis what we are united in fighting for.\n  A vote for this rule is a vote for fast track. A vote for fast track \nis a vote against jobs and against wages.\n  United States trade policy has been failing American workers, failing \nAmerican consumers and families for 20 years.\n  The U.S.-Korea Free Trade Agreement has already cost up to 75,000 \njobs, and it was just passed 3 years ago. Up to 5 million jobs have \nbeen destroyed by currency manipulation; and a number of the \nsignatories to this trade agreement, their policy is to manipulate \ntheir currency to have their goods sold at a lower price than American \ngoods, putting American workers out of jobs and lowering their wages.\n  Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Laureate in Economics, has written: \n``Inequality is not inevitable. It is a choice that we make with the \nrules that we create to structure our economy.''\n  Trade policy is one of those choices. If we approve fast track, we \nthrow away our ability, our constitutional authority to represent the \npeople who sent us here in good faith. We throw away that ability to be \nable to fix the flaws in the trade agreement, like the Trans-Pacific \nPartnership, to the detriment of millions of American families.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on this rule.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am very pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the distinguished gentleman from Texas (Mr. Doggett).\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Friday, this House sent a strong message to the Fast-\nTrackers: Not so fast.\n  Forty-eight hours ago, Republican leaders were telling the world \nthat, at this moment, we would be voting to approve Fast Track; but \nnow, the Fast-Trackers have become backtrackers, pushing back the vote.\n  The only reason that they seek this postponement in this rule of up \nto 6 weeks is that they do not have the votes to approve Fast Track \ntoday, and the only way they can get those votes today is to use this \nstrange shenanigan of connecting it and cloaking it in a rule for the \nauthorization of our intelligence agencies.\n  After Friday's Fast Track vote, one official said those who ``vote \nagainst this Trade Adjustment Assistance are adding their names to the \ndeath certificate for [it].'' Well, let's play it straight for a \nchange. TAA is not authorized now. It expired last year. Its future \ndepends, not upon this authorization, but upon an adequate level of \nfunding.\n  The Elementary and Secondary Education Act, the Juvenile Justice and \nDelinquency Prevention Act, and many more have not been authorized for \nyears, but they continue to operate perfectly well, based upon \nappropriated funds. This TAA argument is phony.\n\n                              {time}  1300\n\n  Really, it doesn't take much intelligence to see what is happening \nhere. These Fast-Trackers are desperate, and this postponement vote for \nthis extent, of this nature, is unprecedented in the history of this \nCongress. It has never happened before in American history that someone \nhas asked to postpone a vote for up to 6 weeks.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentleman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentleman an additional 30 seconds.\n\n[[Page H4393]]\n\n  Mr. DOGGETT. And understand what that means. Understand that they are \nlooking for the ideal time--morning, noon, or night--to muscle through \na broken trade policy that a majority of this House and of the American \npeople do not want.\n  This rule provides that the Speaker at any time of day can come with \nno notice, no debate, and say, we are voting to send this bill to the \nPresident's desk.\n  What really needs adjusting is not trade assistance but the no-\ncompromise, no-amendment attitude on trade that gives us broken trade \npolicies.\n  This vote wouldn't be so close if this process hadn't been so closed.\n  Reject this rule. Vote for democracy. Don't change the precedents of \nthe House. Don't let this be muscled through.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I am very pleased to yield 2 minutes to \nthe distinguished gentleman from Georgia (Mr. David Scott), my good \nfriend.\n  Mr. DAVID SCOTT of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, ladies and gentlemen, what \nis about to happen on this floor with this rule is a direct violation \nof the United States Constitution; for in the United States \nConstitution, it clearly says that the United States Congress shall \nhave the power ``to regulate commerce with foreign nations.'' And in \nthis rule is a clear violation of that.\n  We already voted it down overwhelmingly 302-126, Republicans and \nDemocrats. It was the foremost bipartisan vote in this 21st century, \nthe very thing that the American people are crying for.\n  Now, why did Alexander Hamilton and Thomas Jefferson and James \nMadison all agree? Very strong, very independent minds. Alexander \nHamilton and Thomas Jefferson could hardly bear to be in the same room \nwith each other, but they agreed on this because they knew that every \nState had Representatives in Congress to look out for jobs that could \nbe shipped overseas. This is the primary reason, ladies and gentlemen.\n  Look at every trade agreement. This country has lost over 2 million \nmanufacturing jobs to China as a result of the China deal. Over 150,000 \njobs to Mexico. Yes, it created jobs--not in the United States. And \nwhat kind of jobs? These are jobs that impacted at the lower- and \nmiddle-income levels of our economy. It is the middle class that is the \nheart and the soul of America.\n  Let this Congress stand up and reject this rule.\n  We proved our mettle with that 302 vote. Congress, I am asking you, \nthe American people are asking you: Do what Alexander Hamilton and \nThomas Jefferson and James Madison asked us to do, and let it be the \nCongress that regulates commerce with foreign nations.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I will continue to reserve the \nbalance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I yield 2 minutes to the \ndistinguished gentleman from California (Mr. Sherman).\n  Mr. SHERMAN. Mr. Speaker, intelligence is critical to our national \nsecurity. It should not be besmirched by a controversial and unrelated \nprocedural shenanigan, unprecedented in the annals of the House of \nRepresentatives.\n  In the words of the President of the United States, It is time to \nplay it straight. TAA and TPA, that package was voted on. It was \ndefeated. We are done. Play it straight.\n  Write new legislation. Put together a new package. Bring it to the \nfloor of the House. See if it has a majority. That is playing it \nstraight.\n  Instead, in an unprecedented move, a vote we took last week is being \nheld in never-never land to be revoted on as late as the end of July. \nThat is right. Early June votes tabulated in late July.\n  If you are against unprecedented shenanigans, vote ``no'' on the \nrule. If you are for playing it straight, vote ``no'' on the rule. If \nyou are against TAA, vote ``no'' on the rule. If you are against TPA, \nif you are against fast track, vote ``no'' on the rule.\n  If you vote for an unprecedented procedural shenanigan, an \nunprecedented procedural mutation today, you can be sure it will be \nused against you and your district and your beliefs tomorrow. And if \nyou are not against fast track, you should be because it gives an \nenormous gift to China, and we get nothing in return.\n  China's number one tactic for running up the largest trade surplus \nagainst us in history is currency manipulation. This deal that is put \non the fast track enshrines the view that currency manipulation is just \nfine. Go to it. A giant gift to China.\n  In addition, the rules of origin provisions say that goods that the \nmanufacturer admits are 50 or 60 percent made in China--which means \nactually 70 or 80 percent made in China--get fast-tracked into the \nUnited States.\n  Vote ``no'' on this procedural mutation.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, just for a moment, let's focus back on the rule and the \nunderlying bill and the procedural issue that has been discussed. It is \nout in the open. It was not snuck in or anything else. It has been \nthere and has been discussed.\n  But also, I want to get back to the fact of the rule, itself, which \nis stand alone. We are going to be voting on an intelligence bill. We \nare going to have a debate on an intelligence bill.\n  And, among other things, I will give us a reminder of what this \nlegislation does:\n  It sustains critical capabilities to fight terrorism and counter the \nproliferation of weapons of mass destruction. That is a separate bill. \nThis is what we are going to be discussing. It has funds to assist our \nefforts to recover unauthorized disclosures of intelligence \ncapabilities. It sustains activities in Afghanistan and Iraq to \ncontinue the fight against ISIS, al Qaeda, and the Taliban. It invests \nin the resiliency of our national security space architecture. It \nprovides policy discretion on sensitive intelligence operations. It \npromotes intelligence integration and sharing through investment in \nintelligence communitywide information technology enterprises. It \nenhances investment in military intelligence, surveillance, and \nreconnaissance aircraft. It funds initiatives to thwart cyber attacks \nand insider threats. And it requires a report every 60 days on foreign \nfighters in Syria and Iraq.\n  This is the bill, the underlying bill that we are discussing. And I \njust wanted to make a reminder of that. As we have discussions on \ndifferent parts of this rule, let's be reminded also that we are \ndealing with a stand-alone bill that we will work.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Will the gentleman yield for just a question?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. I yield to the gentleman from Florida for \njust a question.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, all of the things that the gentleman from \nGeorgia said are in the measure are true. But does he also agree that \nit is unprecedented that we have included a measure to delay an \nalready-voted-on rule? Never before has that been done.\n  Or to your knowledge, has it been?\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Well, I think it is a fact that it is a part \nof this rule. The gentleman from Florida states it in whatever \nadjectival terms he wants to give. But it is in the rule. We have not \nmade it secretive that it is part of this rule. And we can discuss \neither part.\n  I will just simply focus on the intelligence part.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am very pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the distinguished gentlewoman from Texas (Ms. Jackson Lee), \nmy good friend.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman from Florida for yielding and \nfor the astute question that he asked, which is one that I would like \nto follow up on.\n  Mr. Speaker, let me say to the gentleman from Georgia that he is \nquite right. There are very serious and important components of the \nintelligence bill covered by this rule.\n  As many of us have experienced over the last couple of days, we are \nin and out of intelligence and security briefings because that is the \nera in which we live. And in most instances, Members draw their concern \nfrom the responsibility they have for protecting the American people.\n  I am on the Homeland Security Committee and have continued on that \ncommittee since the tragedy, the heinous act of 9/11, and before, when \nthe\n\n[[Page H4394]]\n\nselect committee was in place. So I have no quarrel with some of the \nimportant elements of this legislation. But the gentleman from Georgia \nshould recognize that this is an aberration.\n  There are two or three points that I would like to make:\n  First of all, we are long overdue for getting rid of the sequester. \nThis joke was played on Members and the American people only because of \nthe supercommittee--not because of any individual Members, but there \nwas a supercommittee structure put in place, the time ran out, and they \ncould not come to a budget conclusion. So this was the ultimate end. \nMembers didn't vote on this. They voted on the supercommittee, and then \nthis was the hatchet that fell when the supercommittee did not work. So \nsequester should be something that Speaker Boehner puts on the floor \nand immediately gets rid of.\n  And the reason why I say that is because I am going to talk about the \nshenanigans dealing with the trade bill. But what I am going to say is \nthat the overseas contingency fund is being used to bolster up this \nbill, the intelligence bill. But I can't get those resources to be \nutilized for infrastructure or summer jobs or fixing the education \nsystem that we have responsibilities for or providing opportunities for \nyoung people to finish their education or criminal justice reform. So \nthis is being 43 percent pumped up when used by funds that are not in \nthe stream.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield the gentlewoman an additional 30 seconds.\n  Ms. JACKSON LEE. I thank the gentleman.\n  The funding is not in the stream of funding that other appropriators \nhave to utilize. That is wrong.\n  Then I might conclude on the shenanigans of the trade fix, if you \nwill. I am for TAA, the Trade Adjustment Assistance. I want it to be \nvoted on straight up or down, like many Members do, to provide for \nworkers and not have, unfortunately, the addition that was added coming \nfrom the other body. So now we know that, whatever shenanigans that \nwill come up, it probably won't be in the way that will help American \nworkers.\n  Mr. Speaker, this rule should be voted down because we need an \nopportunity to work on behalf of the American workers, to get rid of \nsequester, and to find a way to move this country forward.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I reserve the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should say to the membership of this body that \nif they vote against this rule, it doesn't mean that we would not have \nan intelligence authorization. It simply would mean that those of us--\nmy friend from Georgia and myself--would have to go back to the Rules \nCommittee and fashion a rule that does not include an unprecedented \nmatter that should not be in this Intelligence Authorization Act for \nFiscal Year 2016 in the first place.\n  And toward that end, among the things that were sought to be \nincluded, if we were going to include the TAA measure, then the ranking \nmember, Ms. Slaughter, proposed on behalf of the minority that we also \ninclude a vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership, TPP, for the reason, \none, TAA was overwhelmingly--3-1--defeated; TPP passed by a very thin \nmargin.\n  So if we are going to twist arms and find methodologies to employ to \ntry to change the minds of Members over a 6-week period of time, then \nperhaps it would be those of us who are opposed to the measure would \nhave an opportunity to try to persuade some of those people who caused \nthe thin margin of it to pass on TPP. We felt that was a fairness \nmeasure. At least if you were going to include it, that should have \nbeen included as well.\n  Before proceeding, Mr. Speaker, perhaps I should learn how much time \neach side has at this time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from Florida has 4\\1/2\\ \nminutes remaining. The gentleman from Georgia has 19\\1/2\\ minutes \nremaining.\n\n                              {time}  1315\n\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I am prepared to close.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, at this time, I am waiting for one \nadditional speaker, but perhaps I can engage in a colloquy with my \ncolleague from Texas.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Will the gentleman yield for a question?\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I yield to the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. You served both on the Intelligence Committee and on the \nRules Committee. There is reason to authorize intelligence, but am I \ncorrect it has nothing to do with this sneak attack to put in a \npostponement that has never been done in American history, where never \nhas anyone sought to delay for 6 weeks the consideration of this bill \nthat we are doing today; isn't that correct?\n  Mr. HASTINGS. I think you are absolutely correct, and it is \nunprecedented. At the very same time, as my friend from Georgia pointed \nout, they have done so transparently by putting it here, but that does \nnot mean it would not be used at some point in the future.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Does this rule provide any notice to Members of the \nHouse, or can this be entirely a surprise attack? Can they come out \nhere on the floor at any time, perhaps when the floor is as empty as it \nis now, and give no notice to the Members of the House that they are \nabout to move to send this bill to the President's desk, have \nabsolutely no debate on that rule, but then have a vote here, perhaps a \nday when some Members are out on important business in their district, \nbasically picking the best time because they are so desperate to force \nthrough a bill that they know a majority of this House does not support \nand that the American people don't support because it will just foist \noff on us a broken, failed trade policy that does not respect the \ninterests of the American people? Is that what is happening here?\n  Mr. HASTINGS. That is certainly allowed. Anytime before July 30, the \nmeasure could be brought to the floor, and it could be brought to the \nfloor without any notice to the membership because it is a motion to \nreconsider. It is a part of this particular rule sought by the Speaker \nof the House, I might add, and therefore it could be brought at any \ntime under the aegis of the Speaker's authority.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. Was the gentleman present in the Rules Committee when \nevery single constructive improvement to this fast-track bill was \nrejected by the Rules Committee--not with your vote, of course--but a \nmajority of the Rules Committee said ``no'' to telling the Members of \nthis Congress as much about this deal as the Vietnamese Politburo \nalready knows, saying ``no'' to at least meeting the standards on the \nenvironment that the Bush administration agreed to, saying ``no'' to \nputting the foreign corporations on the same level as our American \ncorporations and businesses so that foreign corporations wouldn't have \nan advantage to come in and attack health, safety, and environmental \nrules that might be established by the Congress or the State of Florida \nor a city like San Antonio or Austin? Because under this fast-track \nbill, we are headed toward jeopardizing those rules, those State laws, \nand those Federal laws that deal with the needs of the American family \nand letting these foreign corporations circumvent them as they did in \nCanada, recently, to demand millions of dollars of taxpayer money for a \ndecision locally to just prevent the expansion of a quarry. We can't \nhave that happen. But the Rules Committee would not allow us to address \nthose problems.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Many of those measures in a 5\\1/2\\-hour, into-the-night \nsession that the Rules Committee operated.\n  Mr. DOGGETT. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my time.\n  I would urge that Members understand that we have already voted on \nthis measure, and it was defeated, as I say, 3-1.\n  Robust funding for our intelligence infrastructure is clearly needed \nand, indeed, welcomed, but enough is enough. It is time for Republicans \nto stop squeezing important domestic programs through their arbitrary \nimplementation of sequester. We must invest in education in this \ncountry; we must invest in our decaying infrastructure; we must invest \nin a clean environment; and we must invest in a strong middle class.\n  Republicans want to make investments in our intelligence community.\n\n[[Page H4395]]\n\nGreat. So do I. We all do. But at some point, we have to start asking: \nWhat is it that that community is protecting? Without investments in \neducation, infrastructure, and our middle class, we risk undermining \nwhat makes this country so exceptional and worth protecting in the \nfirst place.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the rule, and I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Mr. COLLINS of Georgia. Mr. Speaker, I yield myself the balance of my \ntime.\n  I appreciate the discussion we have had over the last little bit. I \nappreciate the gentleman from Florida. Again, although we have some \ndifferences--those have been evident today--the rule provides for ample \ndebate on the floor and the opportunity to debate and vote on up to 16 \namendments offered by a largely bipartisan group of Members.\n  I look forward to those debates. I look forward to the debate on how \nbest to provide tools for our intelligence community and to combat the \ndangerous threats that we face while still respecting both the \nconstitutional and budgetary restraints. Those are things that \nsometimes, I think, in the midst of discussion today, got lost in that \nthis is a separate vote that we are going to be voting on our \nintelligence bill. There is a procedural issue that is part of this \nthat is, again, not snuck in. It has been posted; it has been online; \nand it is there for Members to see.\n  When we look at priorities, again, I think, for us, it goes back to, \nagain, in the overall budgetary and authorization process, the \nRepublican majority stands for protecting our national interests, \nprotecting and empowering the voters who actually send us here, not for \ngrowing and empowering an ever-encroaching Federal Government. This is \nwhat the budgets reflect. This is what the authorizations reflect. \nThese are the priorities of the American people, and these are the \npriorities of the Republican majority.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time, and I move the \nprevious question on the resolution.\n  The previous question was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the resolution.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe ayes appeared to have it.\n  Mr. HASTINGS. Mr. Speaker, on that I demand the yeas and nays.\n  The yeas and nays were ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Pursuant to clause 8 of rule XX, this 15-\nminute vote on adoption of House Resolution 315 will be followed by a \n5-minute vote on agreeing to the Speaker's approval of the Journal, if \nordered.\n

DOC. NO. 114-43)\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore laid before the House the following message\n\n[[Page H4396]]\n\nfrom the President of the United States; which was read and, together \nwith the accompanying papers, referred to the Committee on Foreign \nAffairs and ordered to be printed:\n\nTo the Congress of the United States:\n  I am pleased to transmit to the Congress, pursuant to sections 123 b. \nand 123 d. of the Atomic Energy Act of 1954, as amended (42 U.S.C. \n2153(b), (d)) (the ``Act''), the text of a proposed Agreement for \nCooperation Between the Government of the United States of America and \nthe Government of the Republic of Korea Concerning Peaceful Uses of \nNuclear Energy (the ``Agreement''). I am also pleased to transmit my \nwritten approval, authorization, and determination concerning the \nproposed Agreement, and an unclassified Nuclear Proliferation \nAssessment Statement (NPAS) concerning the proposed Agreement. (In \naccordance with section 123 of the Act, as amended by Title XII of the \nForeign Affairs Reform and Restructuring Act of 1998 (Public Law 105-\n277), two classified annexes to the NPAS, prepared by the Secretary of \nState, in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence, \nsummarizing relevant classified information, will be submitted to the \nCongress separately.) The joint memorandum submitted to me by the \nSecretaries of State and Energy and a letter from the Chairman of the \nNuclear Regulatory Commission stating the views of the Commission are \nalso enclosed. An addendum to the NPAS containing a comprehensive \nanalysis of the export control system of the Republic of Korea (ROK) \nwith respect to nuclear-related matters, including interactions with \nother countries of proliferation concern and the actual or suspected \nnuclear, dual-use, or missile-related transfers to such countries, \npursuant to section 102A(w) of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \nU.S.C. 3024(w)), is being submitted separately by the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  The proposed Agreement has been negotiated in accordance with the Act \nand other applicable law. In my judgment, it meets all applicable \nstatutory requirements and will advance the nonproliferation and other \nforeign policy interests of the United States.\n  The proposed Agreement contains all of the requirements established \nby section 123 a. of the Act. It provides a comprehensive framework for \npeaceful nuclear cooperation with the ROK based on a mutual commitment \nto nuclear nonproliferation. It would permit the transfer of material, \nequipment (including reactors), components, information, and technology \nfor nuclear research and nuclear power production. It would not permit \nthe transfer of Restricted Data, and sensitive nuclear technology or \ntechnology or information that is not in the public domain concerning \nfabrication of nuclear fuel containing plutonium could only be \ntransferred if specifically provided by an amendment to the proposed \nAgreement or a separate agreement. Any special fissionable material \ntransferred could only be in the form of low enriched uranium, with two \nexceptions: small quantities of material for use as samples; or for \nother specified applications such as use in loading and operation of \nfast reactors or the conduct of fast reactor experiments. The proposed \nAgreement would also obligate the United States to endeavor to take \nsuch actions as may be necessary and feasible to ensure a reliable \nsupply of low enriched uranium fuel to the ROK, similar to terms \ncontained in other recent civil nuclear cooperation agreements.\n  The proposed Agreement would also establish a new standing High-Level \nBilateral Commission (HLBC) to be led by the Deputy Secretary of Energy \nfor the Government of the United States of America and the Vice \nMinister of Foreign Affairs for the Government of the ROK. The purpose \nof the HLBC is to facilitate peaceful nuclear and strategic cooperation \nbetween the parties and ongoing dialogue regarding areas of mutual \ninterest in civil nuclear energy, including the civil nuclear fuel \ncycle.\n  The proposed Agreement will have an initial term of 20 years and \nwould renew for one additional period of 5 years unless either party \ngives written notice at least 2 years prior to its expiration that it \ndoes not want to renew the proposed Agreement. The proposed Agreement \nalso requires the parties to consult as soon as possible after the \nseventeenth anniversary of its entry into force to decide whether to \npursue an extension of the proposed Agreement. In the event of \ntermination of the proposed Agreement, key nonproliferation conditions \nand controls will continue in effect as long as any nuclear material, \nmoderator material, byproduct material, equipment, or component subject \nto the proposed Agreement remains in the territory of the party \nconcerned or under its jurisdiction or control anywhere, or until such \ntime as the parties agree that, in the case of nuclear material or \nmoderator material, such items are no longer usable for any nuclear \nactivity relevant from the point of view of international safeguards or \nhave become practically irrecoverable, or in the case of equipment, \ncomponents, or byproduct material, such items are no longer usable for \nnuclear purposes.\n  The ROK has a strong track record on nonproliferation and its \ngovernment has consistently reiterated its commitment to \nnonproliferation. The ROK is a party to the Treaty on the Non-\nproliferation of Nuclear Weapons, has an International Atomic Energy \nAgency safeguards agreement and Additional Protocol in force, is a \nmember of the four multilateral nonproliferation export control regimes \n(Missile Technology Control Regime, Wassenaar Arrangement, Australia \nGroup, and Nuclear Suppliers Group, for which it served as Chair in \n2003-2004 and is scheduled to do so again in 2015-2016), and is an \nactive participant in the Proliferation Security Initiative. A more \ndetailed discussion of the ROK's civil nuclear program and its nuclear \nnonproliferation policies and practices, including its nuclear export \npolicies and practices, is provided in the NPAS and in two classified \nannexes to the NPAS submitted to you separately. As noted above, the \nDirector of National Intelligence will provide an addendum to the NPAS \ncontaining a comprehensive analysis of the export control system of the \nROK with respect to nuclear-related matters.\n  I have considered the views and recommendations of the interested \ndepartments and agencies in reviewing the proposed Agreement and have \ndetermined that its performance will promote, and will not constitute \nan unreasonable risk to, the common defense and security. Accordingly, \nI have approved the proposed Agreement and authorized its execution and \nurge that the Congress give it favorable consideration.\n  This transmission shall constitute a submittal for purposes of both \nsections 123 b. and 123 d. of the Act. My Administration is prepared to \nbegin immediately the consultations with the Senate Foreign Relations \nCommittee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee as provided in \nsection 123 b. Upon completion of the 30 days of continuous session \nreview provided for in section 123 b., the 60 days of continuous \nsession review provided for in section 123 d. shall commence.\n                                                        Barack Obama.  \nThe White House, June 16, 2015.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4396-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4396-H4418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          INTELLIGENCE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2016\n\n\n                             General Leave\n\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous consent that all Members have \n5 legislative days in which to revise and extend their remarks and \ninsert extraneous material on H.R. 2596, the Intelligence Authorization \nAct for Fiscal Year 2016.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore (Mr. Holding).

Pursuant to House Resolution 315 and rule \nXVIII, the Chair declares the House in the Committee of the Whole House \non the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill, H.R. 2596.\n  The Chair appoints the gentleman from Utah (Mr. Bishop) to preside \nover the Committee of the Whole.\n\n                              {time}  1406\n\n\n                     In the Committee of the Whole\n\n  Accordingly, the House resolved itself into the Committee of the \nWhole House on the state of the Union for the consideration of the bill \n(H.R. 2596) to authorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for \nintelligence and intelligence-related activities of the United States\n\n[[Page H4397]]\n\nGovernment, the Community Management Account, and the Central \nIntelligence Agency Retirement and Disability System, and for other \npurposes, with Mr. Bishop of Utah in the chair.\n  The Clerk read the title of the bill.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to the rule, the bill is considered read the \nfirst time.\n  The gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes) and the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff) each will control 30 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California (Mr. Nunes).\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act is the annual blueprint for the \nwork of the intelligence community and America's military intelligence \nefforts. The bill sets priorities for our critical intelligence efforts \nand the legal framework of guidance and oversight for those efforts. As \nyou may recall, the House has passed intelligence authorization bills \nwith strong bipartisan support in the past several Congresses.\n  The ranking member, Mr. Schiff, and I worked in a bipartisan manner \nto draft this legislation in front of you today. Passing annual \nintelligence authorization legislation is the most effective way for \nCongress to exercise oversight over the executive branch and helps \nensure that the country's intelligence agencies have the resources and \nauthorities necessary to keep Americans safe. This legislation passed \nunanimously out of our committee.\n  As most of the intelligence budget involves highly classified \nprograms, the bulk of the committee's recommendations each year are \nfound in the classified annex of the bill, which has been available for \nMembers to review since June 4. Among other initiatives, the bill \nprovides authorization for critical national security functions, \nincluding fighting terrorism, countering the proliferation of weapons \nof mass destruction, funding efforts to recover from unauthorized \ndisclosures of intelligence capabilities, and investing in the \nresiliency of our national security space architecture.\n  At an unclassified level, I can report that the annex for fiscal year \n2016 authorizes funding that is slightly below the President's budget \nrequest level. Its funding levels are in line with the House-passed \nDefense Appropriations bill for the National Intelligence Program and \nwith the National Defense Authorization Act for the Military \nIntelligence Program. Overall, this bill sustains today's intelligence \ncapabilities and provides for future capabilities while staying within \nthe funding constraints of the Budget Control Act and the budget \nresolution.\n  Mr. Chair, we are currently facing one of the most challenging global \nenvironments in our Nation's history. Nearly 14 years after the 9/11 \nattacks, the U.S. continues to hunt al Qaeda and its affiliates. We \nhave taken the fight to the enemy and achieved tremendous success. But \ndespite various strategies employed by two administrations to prevent \nthe spread of radical Islam, that threat remains. The Arab Spring civil \nwar in Syria and the emergence of the Islamic State of Iraq and the \nLevant in places such as north Africa highlight only a few of the many \nevents in the past several years that now define U.S. policy failures \nin the Middle East. In just over a year, ISIL has exploded from a \nlargely localized force in Iraq to seriously challenge al Qaeda as the \nvanguard of global jihad.\n  Moreover, nation-states like Russia and China continue to expand \ntheir spheres of influence and diminish U.S. clout worldwide. Russia \nhas taken advantage of indecisiveness in Europe and exploited uneven \nleadership in the U.S. to pressure Ukraine and its neighbors on core \nRussian interests. China bullies its neighbors in the South and East \nChina Sea and, if left unchecked, will likely exercise de facto control \nover maritime trade in its perceived territorial waters in the next \ndecade. Meanwhile, North Korea and Iran continue to pose significant \nproliferation risks and remain strategic threats to the U.S. and its \nallies. State actors can bring a tremendous amount of resources to \ncounter U.S. policy, placing an immense burden on the intelligence \ncommunity to collect information on and to assess these activities \ncarefully and accurately.\n  Perhaps more troubling, state and nonstate actors alike are \ndeveloping new ways to project power, particularly in cyberspace. Cyber \nattacks are becoming so pervasive that network defenders are \noverwhelmed. Attackers seem to gain access to sensitive systems at \nwill. The most recent attacks on the Office of Personnel Management \nservers, possibly one of the most significant national security \nincidents in the past decade, highlight the continued threat to our \nNation's infrastructure.\n  Mr. Chair, in this year's intelligence authorization bill, the \ncommittee has taken a great deal of care in addressing the wide range \nof issues described above. This bill is an essential tool in supporting \nour Nation's efforts to tackle today's challenges while also directing \nthe intelligence community to make strategic investments in the future. \nIn particular, I believe that the bill goes a long way toward \nencouraging the intelligence community to make much-needed investments, \nsuch as recovering from unauthorized disclosures of intelligence \ncapabilities.\n  Additionally, this year's authorization bill comes on the heels of \nthe committee's recent bipartisan successes on key national security \nissues, like reauthorizing important provisions related to the Foreign \nIntelligence Surveillance Act, and overwhelmingly passing bipartisan \nlegislation on cyber threat sharing information. I applaud Ranking \nMember Schiff for his help on these issues, and I look forward to \nworking together in the future.\n  Finally, I want to thank all the Intelligence Committee staff on both \nsides of the aisle for their support drafting this bill. The committee \nstaff spent countless hours assisting Members and finalizing the \nlegislation.\n  In particular, I would like to recognize our Sandia National Labs \nfellow, Mr. Randy Smith. He has been with the committee for almost 2 \nyears and will be leaving us soon to return to Sandia. He has been a \ntremendous asset to this committee, and I would like to thank him for \nall his hard work.\n  I would also like to thank the men and women of the intelligence \ncommunity for all their efforts to continue to protect this Nation.\n  I look forward to passing this legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, the intelligence authorization act is the annual blueprint \nfor the work of the intelligence community and America's military \nintelligence efforts.

The Committee \nstaff spent countless hours assisting Members and finalizing the \nlegislation. In particular, I would like to recognize our Sandia \nNational Labs fellow, Randy Smith. He has been with the Committee for \nalmost two years and will be leaving us soon to return to Sandia. He \nhas been a tremendous asset to this Committee and I thank him for all \nhis hard work. I would also like to thank the men and women of the \nIntelligence Community for all their efforts protecting this nation. I \nlook forward to passing this legislation.\n  Mr. Chair, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  First, I want to say thank you to Chairman Nunes. This Intelligence \nAuthorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 is our third major piece of \nlegislation together, and it once again demonstrates the fruits of our \ncommitment to bipartisanship.\n  We also have our difference of opinion from time to time, and on this \nbill, we have some differences. But I know that as long as we continue \nto work together, there is no end to the good that we can accomplish.\n  Through our cyber bill and our surveillance reform bill, we have been \nguided by two core principles: first, that national security is truly \nthe security of the entire Nation and all Americans; second, that \nnational security can and must coexist with privacy and civil \nliberties. I believe the bill today largely furthers these principles \nas well.\n  The IAA funds, equips, and sets the priorities for the U.S. \nintelligence community; and it is a crucial vehicle by which Congress \nprovides oversight of the IC and ensures that U.S. intelligence \nprofessionals and intelligence programs have the funds and authorities \nthey need to keep us safe, as well as our allies and partners.\n  As the annual IAA provides hundreds of pages of detailed guidance, \nstrict authorizations, and precise limitations, it is also the single \nmost important means by which Congress conducts its oversight of the \nintelligence community.\n\n                              {time}  1415\n\n  As in past years, this year's IAA is a carefully considered bill and \nthe result of thoughtful oversight.\n  The Fiscal Year 2016 IAA funds the intelligence community at about 1 \npercent below the President's budget request and about 7 percent above \nlast year's enacted budget level.\n  The bill makes cuts to less-effective programs, adds money to \nunderfunded programs, and requires intelligence agencies to regularly \ninform Congress of their activities, ensuring funds are spent \nresponsibly and lawfully.\n  Notably, the bill today holds, or ``fences,'' significant amounts of \nmoney to make sure Congress' direction is followed to the letter and on \ntime.\n  I want to highlight just a few particular aspects of the bill. It \ncontinues the committee's longstanding emphasis on counterintelligence \nand security reforms. It also continues to support our overhead \narchitecture by funding our most critical space programs, investing in \nspace protection and resiliency, preserving investments in cutting-edge \ntechnologies, and enhancing oversight of contracting and procurement \npractices.\n  It also promotes enhancements to our foreign partner capabilities, \nwhich are critical to multiplying the reach and impact of our own \nintelligence efforts. It enhances human intelligence, or HUMINT, \ncapabilities, which are often the key to understanding and predicting \nglobal events.\n  It provides resources to safeguard vulnerable signals intelligence, \nor SIGINT, collection while enhancing oversight of these and other \nsources of intelligence. It emphasizes collection to monitor and ensure \ncompliance with treaties and potential international agreements. It \ngreatly enhances oversight of Defense special operation forces \nactivities worldwide.\n  The bill also incorporates some excellent provisions championed by \nthe Democratic members of the Intelligence Committee, as well as the \nRepublican members.\n  In particular, I want to highlight Mr. Himes' provision to enhance \nthe quality of metrics we receive to enable more thorough oversight; \nMs. Sewell's multiple provisions to enhance diversity within the \nintelligence community; Mr. Carson's provisions to better understand \nFBI resource allocation against domestic and foreign threats and the \nrole of the FBI and DNI in countering violent extremism, particularly \nin minors; Ms. Speier's provision to provide greater human rights \noversight of the IC's relationship with certain foreign partners; Mr. \nQuigley's provision regarding intelligence support to Ukraine; and Mr. \nSwalwell's provision to ensure that Department of Energy National Labs \ncan work with State and local government recipients of homeland \nsecurity grants.\n  All this said, while I believe the bill largely reflects sound \nchoices, I am concerned that it uses the overseas contingency \noperations--or OCO--funding as a way to evade the sequestration levels \nmandated by the ill-conceived Budget Control Act.\n  Again, I largely support the funding levels and the programs which \nthe IAA authorizes, but I cannot endorse how it has funded them. We \nneed to be serious and thoughtful about the budget and undo \nsequestration--not just employ accounting tricks to evade its levels \nonly for defense and national security-related items.\n  Even some domestic programs and agencies that contribute to our \nhomeland security cannot qualify for OCO dollars, while vital programs \nlike our children's education and our social services are left to \nlanguish.\n  Instead of arbitrary, across-the-board cuts, let's do what this bill \ndoes substantively: make cuts to some areas and add money to others in \na deliberate, well thought out manner. It is time to forthrightly deal \nwith sequestration for all of our national priorities, not just for \ndefense.\n  I am also opposed to provisions in this bill which would tie the \nhands of the administration and prevent the orderly transfer of \ndetainees from the detention center at Guantanamo Bay. These \nrestrictions have never been included in prior versions of the IAA, and \nthere is no reason to introduce them into the IAA process now.\n  The bill goes even further than restricting transfer of detainees to \nthe United States and includes a new provision which restricts \ntransfers to ``combat zones,'' a term that is so\n\n[[Page H4399]]\n\nbroad as to include allies and partners such as Jordan.\n  As I have long said, keeping the Guantanamo prison serves as a \nrecruitment tool for militants, undercuts our relationships with our \nallies, and undermines our international standing.\n  With that said, the bill, as a whole, is largely a strong product, \nand I appreciate the close partnership we have enjoyed with the \nchairman in working on it. But, unfortunately, I cannot support the \nbill so long as it includes these Guantanamo restrictions and employs \nthe OCO budget gimmick at the expense of our domestic spending \npriorities.\n  I look forward to a robust amendment process today, and I am \ncommitted to working with the chairman, the Senate, the administration, \nthe other committees of jurisdiction, and all Members of Congress to \nmake critical improvements to the bill as it moves forward, and to \nresolve the issues to keep alive the string of consecutive signed IAAs.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, at this time I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman \nfrom North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. I thank the chairman for his vital leadership on the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  I rise in support of this legislation providing the intelligence \ncommunity the authorization needed to protect and defend the United \nStates and support critical national security programs protecting \nAmericans from nation states and Islamic terrorists.\n  In December, NSA Director Admiral Rogers warned that China has the \ncapability of shutting down the U.S. electric grid through cyber \nattack. Homeland security Secretary Johnson has warned about the threat \nof attacks launched by sleeper cells in most of our States. ISIS \ncontinues to expand into new territory, while Americans are more at \nrisk because President Obama has no strategy for defeating ISIS, whom \nhe initially referred to as the JV team.\n  This is not the time to impede our intelligence efforts. America \nfaces grave danger from those who wish to destroy our way of life. \nPlease join me in full bipartisan support of the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act. Let us be united in confronting the perilous threats \nof our adversaries.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, at this time I am pleased to yield 2 \nminutes to the gentleman from New York (Mr. Engel), the ranking member \non the House Foreign Affairs Committee.\n  Mr. ENGEL. I thank my friend for yielding.\n  I want to say that I appreciate the bipartisan, hard work of Chairman \nNunes and Ranking Member Schiff, but I want to bring to the House's \nattention recent reports that this bill makes drastic cuts in our so-\ncalled covert support to the moderate Syrian opposition.\n  A headline in the Saturday Washington Post read: ``Secret CIA effort \nin Syria faces large funding cut.'' If these reports are true, just as \nthe moderate Syrian forces may be starting to make progress, especially \nin the south, then I am afraid we may be making a big mistake.\n\n  Unfortunately, most Members of the House don't know for certain if \nthis legislation will reduce our support for the moderate opposition. \nThose funding decisions are made behind closed doors. And that is why I \nbelieve this bill is not the right place for us to be making decisions \nthat have a major impact on our Syria strategy.\n  I have no doubt that Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff are \ndetermined to get the intelligence piece of our Syria response right, \nbut this is not merely an intelligence issue, and our overall strategy \nin Syria goes far beyond what is included in any covert program. I \nbelieve we shouldn't be dealing with this problem in a piecemeal way.\n  As we have been doing in the Foreign Affairs Committee on a \nbipartisan basis, I urge my colleagues to take a step back, look at the \nbig picture, and address our Syria policy in a way that makes sense and \ninvolves all the relevant players.\n  I am troubled if it is true that this bill makes drastic cuts in our \nso-called covert support to the moderate Syria opposition. And I \ncommend the hard work of our chairman and ranking member.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I would urge my colleague, the ranking member on the Foreign Affairs \nCommittee, that we shouldn't always believe what is in the newspaper. \nThere have been lots of different reports about lots of different \nthings.\n  I would say that Mr. Schiff and I worked in a bipartisan manner to \nlook at all programs across the spectrum of the 17 agencies. And we \nwould be glad to spend some time with the gentleman from New York down \nin the committee spaces to raise the concerns that he brought up about \na newspaper article. As I said, I think there are a lot of things that \nwe read in the newspaper.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  The Intelligence Authorization Act is the vehicle by which we ensure \nthat U.S. intelligence professionals and programs have the funds and \nthe authorities that they need. It is the single most important means \nby which Congress can conduct its oversight. We need to pass this \nlegislation, just as the committee has done over the last several \nyears.\n  It is my hope that as the legislation moves forward, we will be able \nto dispose of the Guantanamo provisions--I will have an amendment to \naddress that in a few minutes--and that we can also resolve the issues \nregarding the overseas contingency account. I look forward to working \nwith my colleague as the bill moves forward to address those issues.\n  I want to join the chairman in saluting the members of the \nintelligence community--the men and women who do such an extraordinary \njob for us each and every day. They have our sincerest gratitude and \nfull appreciation for their dedication, their patriotism, and their \nunparalleled skills. I also want to thank again our chairman for his \nleadership, his commitment to bipartisanship, and his determination to \ndo what is right. I want to thank our colleagues on the committee, who \nhave done an extraordinary job in helping to put this bill together.\n  I also want to join the chairman in thanking our wonderful staff on \nour side of the aisle. I want to thank Carly Blake, Linda Cohen, \nAllison Getty, Robert Minehart, Amanda Rogers Thorpe, Rheanne Wirkkala, \nas well as Patrick Boland and our shared technical and security staff, \nincluding Kristin Jepson, Brandon Smith, and Kevin Klein. We have an \nextraordinary team on the committee. It is a great pleasure to serve \nand work with each and every one of them.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank the ranking member for his continued cooperation to \nwork in a bipartisan fashion. As I think most Americans know, the \nthreats continue to add up every day, and it is up to the men and women \nin the intelligence community to help keep us safe. I know the ranking \nmember and I are committed to doing just that.\n  With that, I look forward to debate on the amendments and passage of \nthe final underlying bill, and I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. All time for general debate has expired.\n  Pursuant to the rule, the bill shall be considered for amendment \nunder the 5-minute rule.\n  In lieu of the amendment in the nature of a substitute recommended by \nthe Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, printed in the bill, it \nshall be in order to consider as an original bill for the purpose of \namendment under the 5-minute rule an amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute consisting of the text of Rules Committee Print 114-19.

It is now in order to consider amendment No. 1 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 12, line 10, strike ``The Director'' and insert ``(a) \n     In General.--The Director''.\n       Page 12, after line 13, insert the following:\n       (b) Annual Report.--Not later than the date that is 10 \n     months after the date of the enactment of this Act, and \n     biennially thereafter until the date that is four years after \n     the date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of \n     National Intelligence shall submit to the congressional \n     intelligence committees and the congressional defense \n     committees (as such term is defined in section 101(a)(16) of \n     title 10, United States Code) a report describing--\n       (1) trends in the use of tunnels by foreign state and \n     nonstate actors; and\n       (2) collaboration efforts between the United States and \n     partner countries to address the use of tunnels by \n     adversaries.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Israel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise to offer an amendment with my very good friend \nfrom Colorado (Mr. Lamborn) and my very good friend from Florida (Ms. \nGraham). This is a bipartisan amendment with respect to tunnels being \nused as a military tactic, technology, and strategy in asymmetric \nwarfare.\n  Mr. Chairman, almost exactly a year ago, when war broke out in the \nMiddle East and Hamas attacked Israel, I visited Israel and saw for \nmyself the sophistication of the tunnels being dug from Gaza to Israel \nthrough which terrorists traveled. They went to the other side of the \ntunnels, popped up, and tried to kill innocent civilians.\n  These tunnels are not the tunnels that many of us characterize in our \nown minds. These tunnels are sophisticated. These are expressways \nunderground. It is like the Queens-Midtown Tunnel going from Gaza to \nIsrael. They are ventilated. They are lit. They are massive. They are \ndeep. They are huge. They are impenetrable, and they are very difficult \nto detect.\n  Mr. Chairman, the FY16 Intelligence Authorization bill properly says \nthat the Director of National Intelligence will designate an official \nto manage the collection and analysis of intelligence regarding the \ntactical use of tunnels by state and nonstate actors.\n\n                              {time}  1430\n\n  This bipartisan amendment simply asks for accountability. It requires \na report from this new lead intelligence officer for tunnels describing \nthe trends in the use of tunnels by foreign state and nonstate actors \nand collaborative efforts between the United States and partner nations \nto address the use of tunnels by our adversaries.\n  Mr. Chairman, I talked about tunnels in the Middle East, but in fact, \nthese tunnels are dynamic force multipliers for our enemies and enemies \nof our allies around the world. They are used for terrorist attacks, \nbut they are also used to smuggle arms and contraband.\n  We have learned that these tunnels are being used well beyond Israel. \nKorea is another example. Tunnels have been found in North Korea. Here \nat home, more than 150 tunnels have been found since 2009.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have plenty of enemies today looking for ways to \nattack the United States and our interests around the globe. This bill \nrecognizes these threats and, very wisely, creates a lead intelligence \nofficer for tunnels.\n  This amendment simply encourages greater oversight by Congress. It \nallows Congress to make informed decisions on how and where to spend \nfuture funds in order to counter this threat and protect U.S. national \nsecurity interests.\n  Most importantly, Mr. Chairman, these reports will help shape the \nefforts of the newly created position, making it clear that Congress \nexpects accountability and transparency, and that is something that the \nAmerican people require.\n  I ask my colleagues to support this bipartisan amendment, and I \nreserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do \nnot intend to oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. \nLamborn).\n\n[[Page H4405]]\n\n  Mr. LAMBORN. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank Congressman Steve Israel \nand Congresswoman Gwen Graham for working together with me on this \nbipartisan effort in the defense bills, as well as now in the \nIntelligence Authorization Act. I would also like to thank Chairman \nNunes and his staff for working together with me on this important \nissue.\n  Mr. Chairman, as Representative Israel just described, there is a \nreal and growing tunnel threat to American bases and embassies around \nthe world, to our southern border, as well as to our ally Israel, both \nin Gaza, as well as Israel's northern border.\n  Language I offered in the base intelligence bill, combined with this \namendment, will ensure that our intelligence community stays focused on \nthis threat. There will be a dedicated person watching on this issue.\n  Going forward, partnership with Israel is the best way to address \nthis growing threat. As we have seen with Iron Dome and other missile \ndefense efforts, partnering with a vital ally like Israel enables both \ncountries to learn quickly, while sharing costs and new technologies. \nIt is a win-win situation for Israel and the U.S. and, hopefully, a \nloss situation for the bad guys.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I thank my very good friend from Colorado \nfor his bipartisan support of this bill.\n  I yield 1 minute to the gentlewoman from Florida. (Ms. Graham).\n  Ms. GRAHAM. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of Representative Steve \nIsrael's amendment to the Intelligence Authorization Act to provide \noversight for the joint U.S.-Israel antitunneling defense project.\n  The joint antitunneling project, which was added to the National \nDefense Authorization Act in an amendment sponsored by my good friend \nRepresentative Lamborn and myself, will help our closest ally in the \nMiddle East, Israel, protect its borders.\n  The terrorist group Hamas has spent years developing a complex \nnetwork of tunnels under the Gaza Strip and Israel to smuggle weapons, \nkidnap Israelis, and launch mass murder attacks.\n  This project will develop new technology to detect and destroy these \ntunnels, and it will send a clear message to our allies and enemies \nalike. The United States is committed to protecting Israel and to \nrooting out and destroying the terrorists who wish to do her harm.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff), the distinguished ranking member of the \ncommittee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding, and I thank Mr. \nIsrael, Mr. Lamborn, and Ms. Graham for this very important amendment \nand issue.\n  This will call for a report on our adversaries' use of tunnels and an \nupdate on our collaboration with international partners in ways to \ndetect and defeat tunnels.\n  All of us remember the fear that set in, in much of southern Israel \nlast summer, as Hamas militants used a complex network of tunnels to \nattack Israeli soldiers from the Gaza Strip. This was not the first use \nof tunnels by Hamas. Cross-border tunnels were used in the capture of \nIDF soldier Gilad Shalit in 2006.\n  In addition to using them against military targets, Israel has \nuncovered evidence that the tunnels are being prepared for large-scale \nattacks against Israeli civilians.\n  Tunnels are not just a problem for Israel. For decades, the North \nKorean military has also been digging tunnels under the DMZ to \nfacilitate infiltration of South Korea.\n  According to press reports, four tunnels from the north have been \nfound in all, although none since 1990. The South Korean Defense \nMinistry believes there may be 20 in all, and they could pose a mortal \nthreat to Koreans and American service personnel in the region.\n  I strongly support the amendment and urge my colleagues to do the \nsame.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, all that I can say is thank you.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Israel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 2 Offered by Mr. Israel\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 2 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 16, after line 24, insert the following new \n     subsection:\n       ``(e) Reports.--Not later than 10 months after the date of \n     the enactment of this subsection, and annually thereafter for \n     three years, the Director of the Cyber Threat Intelligence \n     Integration Center shall submit a report to Congress that \n     includes the following:\n       ``(1) With respect to the year covered by the report, a \n     detailed description of cyber threat trends, as compiled by \n     the Cyber Threat Intelligence Integration Center.\n       ``(2) With respect to the year covered by the report, a \n     detailed description of the coordination efforts by the Cyber \n     Threat Intelligence Integration Center between departments \n     and agencies of the Federal Government, including the \n     Department of Defense, the Department of Justice, and the \n     Department of Homeland Security.\n       ``(3) Recommendations for better collaboration between such \n     departments and agencies of the Federal Government.''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Israel) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I will attempt to continue my winning \nstreak on the floor this morning.\n  I rise to offer an amendment with my distinguished friend and partner \nfrom New York (Mr. Hanna).\n  This bipartisan amendment addresses an issue that has concerned many \nof us for some time, and that is the fact that, when it comes to cyber \ndefense and cyber war, many Federal agencies are doing something; it is \njust that they may not be aware of what each of them is doing. We need \ncloser coordination and collaboration among all the Federal agencies \nand entities dealing with cyber war.\n  Mr. Chairman, we recently found out that the United States Office of \nPersonnel Management suffered a cyber attack impacting millions of \nFederal workers. This attack, in my view, highlights a disconnect \nbetween agencies tasked to provide cyber defense, a foreign government \nhacking into a Federal government system, taking the records of \nmillions of government employees, spanning the jurisdiction of several \nFederal agencies.\n  It is clear that there is an obvious need for greater collaboration \nbetween these agencies to create a credible defense and, if needed, a \ndeterrent to those wishing to attack through the cyber domain.\n  That is why I was very pleased in February of this year when the \nPresident directed the DNI to establish the Cyber Threat Intelligence \nIntegration Center, CTIIC. This bill very properly authorizes that \nposition.\n  CTIIC will serve as the primary organization within the Federal \nGovernment for analyzing and integrating all intelligence possessed or \nacquired by the U.S. pertaining to cyber threats and coordinate cyber \nthreat intelligence activities.\n  This bipartisan amendment, Mr. Chairman, simply ensures congressional \noversight of CTIIC by requiring an annual report detailing three \nthings: number one, cyber attack trends identified by the CTIIC; number \ntwo, an assessment of the collaborative efforts between the CTIIC and \nvarious Federal agencies tasked to defend this country against cyber \nattacks; and number three, recommendations for better collaboration \nbetween these agencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, we have entered a new era of warfare. Our networks are \nbeing attacked daily. We need to do a much better job of coordinating, \ncollaborating, and cooperating at the Federal level. This amendment \nensures oversight and accountability.\n  I want to thank my partner on this measure, Mr. Hanna, for his \nbipartisan assistance and support.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not intend to oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n\n[[Page H4406]]\n\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, over the last several years, cyber attacks have \nbecome a pressing concern for the United States. The recent breach of \nthe Office of Personnel Management has put the personal information of \nmillions of current and former Federal employees, including many of the \nmen and women of our intelligence community, at risk.\n  Every day, cyber thieves attack private companies, stealing credit \ncard numbers, accessing medical records, leaking proprietary \ninformation, and publishing confidential emails, affecting tens of \nmillions of Americans.\n  The intelligence community has worked to improve our cyber defenses \nby improving information sharing between the private sector and the \nFederal Government through the support of H.R. 1560, the Protecting \nCyber Networks Act.\n  While the Senate has yet to act on this bill, the legislation we \nconsider today will help improve the Federal Government's ability to \ndetect and defeat cyber attacks by creating the new Cyber Threat \nIntelligence Integration Center.\n  This thoughtful amendment by Mr. Israel and Mr. Hanna will require \nthat the Center produce a report on cyber threat trends and \ncoordination on cyber threats between different government agencies.\n  I thank the gentlemen from New York for their work on this issue and \nurge my colleagues to support this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff), the ranking member of the committee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman, and I thank him for his excellent \namendment and support in the intelligence process.\n  With each passing day, we are learning more about the cyber breach at \nthe Office of Personnel Management. The volume of personal information \nlost during these events is of tremendous concern. Mr. Israel's \namendment will help us better inform Congress on the effectiveness of \nthe government's collaborative efforts to defend against future cyber \nevents.\n  I thank my colleagues for their work on it, and I urge support of Mr. \nIsrael's amendment.\n  Mr. ISRAEL. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the distinguished chairman \nfor his bipartisan leadership and the distinguished ranking member. I \nappreciate their support for this amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Israel).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 3 Offered by Mr. Crowley\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 3 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 29, after line 17, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 317. INCLUSION OF HISPANIC-SERVING INSTITUTIONS IN GRANT \n                   PROGRAM TO ENHANCE RECRUITING OF INTELLIGENCE \n                   COMMUNITY WORKFORCE.\n\n       Section 1024 of the National Security Act of 1947 (50 \n     U.S.C. ) is amended--\n       (1) in subsection (c)--\n       (A) in paragraph (1), by inserting ``, Hispanic-serving \n     institutions, and'' after ``universities''; and\n       (B) in the subsection heading for such subsection, by \n     striking ``Historically Black'' and inserting ``Certain \n     Minority-serving''; and\n       (2) in subsection (g)--\n       (A) by redesignating paragraph (5) as paragraph (6); and\n       (B) by inserting after paragraph (4) the following new \n     paragraph (5):\n       ``(5) Hispanic-serving institution.--The term `Hispanic-\n     serving institution' has the meaning given that term in \n     section 502(a)(5) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \n     U.S.C. 1101a(a)(5)).''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Crowley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself as much time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, like many of my colleagues, I am focused on growing \neducational opportunities for young Hispanic Americans, particularly in \nthe areas that will be so critical to our Nation's success in the years \nahead.\n  Last month, the House approved a bipartisan amendment to the America \nCOMPETES Reauthorization Act designed to increase opportunities for \nLatinos in the STEM fields.\n  The amendment I am offering today with my colleagues, Mr. Serrano and \nMr. Curbelo, builds upon that effort and would further expand \nopportunities for Hispanic students.\n  Our proposal would allow the Director of National Intelligence to \noffer grants to Hispanic-Serving Institutions of higher education for \nadvanced foreign language education programs that are in the immediate \ninterest of the intelligence community.\n  It would also promote study abroad and cultural immersion programs in \nthose areas, which we all know are crucial to truly understanding the \nintricacies of other languages and other cultures. This is a time when \nwe need to be encouraging more of our young people to enter careers \naimed at making our Nation safer.\n  Of the nearly 2 million Latino students enrolled in college today, \nthe majority attend Hispanic-Serving Institutions. With these targeted \ngrants, HSIs would be able to help increase the ranks of Latinos going \ninto the intelligence community, where they are underrepresented today.\n  This amendment would not only promote diversity in national security \nand intelligence communities, but it would also strengthen our youngest \nand fastest growing minority, Hispanic Americans.\n  We must ensure that these young people are prepared with the \nknowledge and skills that will contribute to our Nation's future \nstrength, security, and global leadership because, when education is \navailable to everyone, our entire Nation is a stronger nation.\n  I want to thank my colleagues who have worked with me on this issue, \nMr. Serrano and Mr. Curbelo, who have cosponsored this amendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do \nnot intend to oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I thank Mr. Crowley, Mr. Serrano, and Mr. \nCurbelo for offering this amendment to include Hispanic-Serving \nInstitutions in the grant program to improve recruitment efforts for \nthe intelligence community.\n  I yield 2 minutes to the gentleman from Florida (Mr. Curbelo).\n\n                              {time}  1445\n\n  Mr. CURBELO of Florida. I thank the chairman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise today in strong support of this amendment and \nthank my colleague from New York for allowing me to join in leading on \nthis important issue.\n  This amendment would allow the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide grants to Hispanic-Serving Institutions of higher education to \noffer advanced foreign language programs that are important to our \nintelligence community. These students, in addition to the traditional \nclassroom setting, would also be able to travel and study abroad so \nthey can gain a firsthand perspective of the culture in which they are \nimmersing themselves.\n  Mr. Chairman, the study of Farsi, Middle Eastern, and South Asian \ndialects is of the utmost importance in developing our country's \ncontinued relationships abroad. I am proud to advocate for Hispanic-\nServing Institutions, like Florida International University and Miami \nDade College in my district, and will strive to provide them the \nopportunity to train their students so that they can go on to serve our \ncountry.\n  I am proud to be working with the gentleman from New York (Mr. \nCrowley) and the gentleman from New York (Mr. Serrano) to provide more \nopportunities for these young Hispanic students who want to serve their \ncountry and to provide our intelligence community this special tool to \nrecruit those who could be useful in advancing the cause of building \nthe relationships that are so critical to our intelligence services \noperating throughout the world.\n\n[[Page H4407]]\n\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I appreciate the gentleman from Florida's \ncomments on this bill and his support.\n  At this time, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from California (Mr. \nSchiff).\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank my colleague from New York (Mr. Crowley) for \nyielding and for his work on this amendment. I am very happy to support \nit.\n  Diversity and language skills are critical to national security. \nTogether, they allow the intelligence community to reach its potential \nand expand its reach, its access, as well as its understanding.\n  This amendment would further both goals by providing better language-\nlearning opportunities to students of Hispanic-Serving Institutions. I \nam very proud to support this amendment and urge my colleagues to do \nthe same.\n  Again, I thank my friend from New York (Mr. Crowley) as well as my \nother colleagues who worked with him on this amendment. I urge passage.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I support the amendment, and I yield back \nthe balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman for his support of \nthis amendment as well as the ranking member, Mr. Schiff, for his \nsupport of this amendment, and all the Members who have worked on this \namendment.\n  I think the amendment speaks for itself. It is providing a great \nopportunity for a growing minority community within our country who \nwant to serve our country in this capacity.\n  With that, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom New York (Mr. Crowley).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 4 Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 4 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 35, after line 17, insert the following new subsection \n     (and redesignate the subsequent subsections accordingly):\n       (c) Additional Report.--Not later than 180 days after the \n     date of the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall submit to the congressional intelligence \n     committees a report that includes--\n       (1) with respect to the travel of foreign fighters to and \n     from Iraq and Syria, a description of the intelligence \n     sharing relationships between the United States and member \n     states of the European Union and member states of the North \n     Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n       (2) an analysis of the challenges impeding such \n     intelligence sharing relationships.\n       Page 35, line 19, insert ``and (c)'' after ``(a)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I offer this bipartisan amendment with the \nsupport of Homeland Security Chairman Michael McCaul and \nRepresentatives Katko and Loudermilk to help Congress identify ways to \nimprove intelligence sharing on the flow of foreign fighters around the \nworld--with particular attention to their travel to and from Iraq and \nSyria.\n  Already, this legislation that we are considering today makes \nsubstantial strides in ensuring that intelligence surrounding the flow \nof foreign fighters is shared with Congress. These continuous reports \nwill shed light on the total number of attempted and successful \nfighters since the beginning of 2011.\n  My amendment would require the Director of National Intelligence to \nreport to Congress on the intelligence community's progress in forging \ninformation-sharing agreements with foreign partners and help Congress \nidentify the challenges impeding coordinated intelligence efforts.\n  Over 20,000 foreign fighters have traveled to join rebel and \nterrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, including ISIS and al Qaeda \naffiliates like al-Nusrah. Their movements are proving increasingly \ndifficult to track in our globalized world, particularly given the \nuneven or nonexistent tracking efforts from some of our foreign \npartners.\n  As the ranking member of the Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on \nTerrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade and as a member of the Homeland \nSecurity Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence, I have \nengaged on the issue of intelligence sharing from two perspectives--\nfrom our efforts to improve the intelligence community's coordination \nwith State, local, and other Federal agencies and from our work to \nbetter improve our information-sharing practices with our overseas \nallies to prevent terrorist attacks and the flow of foreign fighters \nhere at home.\n  While the intelligence community has made improvements to the \nprocesses of sharing pertinent information with the relevant Federal, \nState, and local agencies, there still exists a blind spot in our \nintelligence-gathering efforts on foreign fighters. That blind spot \nstems from the failure of some foreign governments to take commonsense \ninformation-sharing steps, and it has made the task of tracking foreign \nfighters even more challenging.\n  The inability or unwillingness of some foreign governments to pass \nalong even the most basic information about these individuals \nrepresents a major risk to the safety of the American people.\n  An additional threat looms when some of these individuals return to \ntheir homelands from Iraq and Syria, battle-hardened and radicalized. \nOnce back home, some can travel between international borders with \nrelative ease, which makes tracking them a truly difficult feat.\n  This amendment will also provide insight into our current \nintelligence-sharing relationships and will give Congress the \nopportunity to highlight best practices while also revealing areas for \nimprovement.\n  I thank Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff for their \ncooperation.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from Texas (Mr. \nMcCaul).\n  Mr. McCAUL. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, I rise in strong support of the Keating-McCaul amendment \nin the Intelligence Authorization Act. If adopted, our amendment would \nrequire the Director of National Intelligence to report to Congress on \nthe state of intelligence information sharing with overseas partners to \nhelp us identify security gaps so that we can improve international \nmonitoring of foreign fighter travel both in and out of Syria and Iraq.\n  Islamist fanatics from more than 100 countries have traveled overseas \nto fight with groups like ISIS and al Qaeda. Thousands of the jihadists \ncarry Western passports and can exploit security gaps in places like \nEurope to return to the West, where they can plot attacks against \nAmerica and our allies.\n  Last month, I led a congressional delegation to the Middle East to \ninvestigate the flow of these foreign fighters. And while progress is \nbeing made, I am still troubled by intelligence and screening gaps, \nespecially with our foreign partners. We need to make sure our allies \nnot only share the identities of terrorists and foreign fighters with \nus but also with each other so that these extremists can be stopped \nbefore they cross our borders into the United States.\n  This amendment will provide Congress critical information needed to \nclose these security gaps and improve intelligence information sharing \nto defend our homeland.\n  I applaud the gentleman from Massachusetts (Mr. Keating) for his hard \nwork on the amendment and for his strong participation in our \ndelegation overseas, where we learned quite a bit. It is not very often \nyou can pass something you think can save American lives, and I think \nthis is one of them. I thank the gentleman again.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman of Homeland Security \nfor his leadership on this issue. We really have established a very \nstrong bipartisan effort, putting our national security first and \nrealizing what holes there are in our system, in our security for our \ncountry.\n  Mr. Chairman, I yield 15 seconds to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Schiff).\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman.\n  Mr. Chairman, I rise in strong support of the work of my colleagues \nfrom Massachusetts and from Texas. This is a superb amendment that will \nhelp us track foreign fighters, and I am proud to support it.\n\n[[Page H4408]]\n\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 5 Offered by Mr. Keating\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 5 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, I have another amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 41, line 8, strike ``paragraphs (3) and (4)'' and \n     insert ``paragraph (3) and redesignating paragraph (4) as \n     paragraph (3)''.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Keating) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. KEATING. Mr. Chairman, the recent events involving the plan of \nradicalized individuals in Massachusetts to target law enforcement \nofficials--police, in particular--underscore the truth that protecting \nAmerica will require the efforts of local, State, and Federal law \nenforcement.\n  Since the Boston Marathon bombings, the FBI has made great efforts to \nimprove their information-sharing efforts with the Joint Terrorism Task \nForce and other Federal agencies.\n  With my work and the work of my colleagues on the congressional \ninvestigation of the Boston Marathon bombings through the Homeland \nSecurity Committee, I can attest to the seriousness in which the \nFederal Bureau of Investigation has set out to improve their \ninformation-sharing practices.\n  However, the FBI's efforts to institutionalize sharing across law \nenforcement and intelligence are still a work in progress.\n  The current version of this bill eliminates the requirement for the \nFBI to report to Congress on their progress to implement information-\nsharing principles. This is a reporting requirement that has kept \nCongress aware of the FBI's information-sharing practices since 2004, \nand it has been vital to understand what works and what can be \nimproved.\n  This amendment will reinstate that requirement, with the recognition \nthat the FBI has more work to do on information sharing to better \nprotect the American public.\n  These necessary reforms include re-executing FBI current memorandums \nof understanding with local partners, improving training and \naccessibility for the eGuardian platform, and formalizing methods for \ndisseminating intelligence to relevant consumers up- and downstream.\n  Without information on the progress the FBI is making in these \nreforms, Congress is hindered in taking the critical steps needed to \nprotect the American public.\n  I would like to again thank Chairman Nunes and Ranking Member Schiff.\n  I yield such time as he may consume to the gentleman from California \n(Mr. Schiff).\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank my colleague from Massachusetts, who has been an \nactive and important voice on national security since he joined the \nCongress several years ago. In particular, he has worked to ensure that \nwe maintain a strong focus on information sharing across agencies.\n  One of the key lessons we learned from 9/11 is the need to tear down \nstovepipes and to ensure that inappropriate barriers to information \nsharing across agencies never reappear.\n  The gentleman from Massachusetts' amendment seeks to maintain our \nvigilance on this issue and would require the FBI to report to Congress \non its information-sharing progress.\n  As a fellow native Bostonian, I am very pleased to see my colleague \ndo such great work. I want to thank him for his commitment to the \nissue. And I am very happy to support the amendment.\n  Mr. KEATING. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Keating).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 6 Offered by Mr. Schiff\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 6 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Strike sections 321, 322, 323, and 331.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, my amendment would strike the sections of \nthe bill which would undermine the administration's ability to close \nthe prison at Guantanamo by transferring the remaining detainees to the \nUnited States for further disposition of their cases or to third \ncountries that agree to accept them, secure them, and monitor them.\n  I am grateful that my colleague from Washington, Adam Smith, ranking \nmember of the Armed Services Committee, has joined me in urging the \nHouse to make this important change to the bill.\n  Every day that it remains open, the prison at Guantanamo Bay damages \nthe United States. Because there are other, better options for the \nprosecution and detention of these inmates, we are not safer for \nGuantanamo's existence. In fact, it makes us more vulnerable by drawing \nnew recruits to the jihad.\n  The Congress, the administration, and the military can work together \nto find a solution that protects our people even as we maintain our \nprinciples and devotion to the rule of law.\n  Under the provisions included in this bill, the administration would \nbe barred from transferring Guantanamo detainees to a ``war zone.''\n  While I agree that it would be foolhardy to seek to send a detainee \nto Yemen while that country is immersed in civil war, the definition of \n``war zone'' used here is derived from the U.S. Tax Code and is \nextremely broad, ruling out countries like Jordan, for example, that \nhave either successfully resettled and monitored former detainees or \ndemonstrated a genuine commitment to doing so.\n  These provisions also prevent the administration from transferring \nGuantanamo detainees to the United States for further proceedings under \nthe military commissions process or for trial in an article III court.\n\n                              {time}  1500\n\n  The Department of Justice and our courts have proven themselves time \nand time again to be more than capable of handling the toughest \nterrorism cases and doing so in a way that ennobles us and sets an \nexample to the world that a great nation can both safeguard its people \nand the rule of law.\n  As a practical matter, our civilian courts have proven much more \nadept at handling these cases than the military commissions process \nhas. In fact, this past Friday, a three-judge panel of the Court of \nAppeals for the D.C. Circuit, one of the most important appellate \ncourts in the Nation, further struck down the legality of commission \ncharges, so narrowing the jurisdiction of the military commissions \nthemselves that any utility as an alternative to article III courts has \nbeen called into further question.\n  And while Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his fellow Guantanamo terrorists \nstill await their date with justice, a host of others--including \nRichard Reid, the shoe bomber; and Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the \nunderwear bomber; and Faisal Shahzad, the Times Square bomber--have \nbeen tried, convicted, and sent to ADX Florence, the toughest prison in \nAmerica. They are gone, and they are not coming back.\n  The inclusion of these provisions is the first time that restrictions \nrelated to Guantanamo have been included in the Intelligence \nAuthorization Act, and I believe that alone sets an unfortunate \nprecedent that could undermine what has been a largely bipartisan \neffort. These provisions are unnecessary and unwise, and they do not \nbelong in this bill.\n  Mr. Chairman, I urge the House to reconsider these provisions, to \ntrust in American justice, diplomacy, and the best military advice, and \nto give the administration a means to shutter a prison that both shames \nus and perpetuates the threat to the Nation.\n\n[[Page H4409]]\n\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, although I appreciate the ranking member's concerns \nabout these provisions, I do remain concerned that further releases \nfrom Guantanamo will threaten our national security.\n  Press reports now indicate that the administration intends to \ntransfer up to 10 additional detainees this month. As the committee \nlearned through its many briefings and hearings, the five detainees \nreleased to Qatar last May have participated in activities that \nthreaten the United States and its allies and are counter to U.S. \nnational security interests, not unlike their activities before they \nwere detained. No intelligence community element should enable any \nfuture transfers that endanger national security.\n  Furthermore, I would note that these provisions are substantively \nidentical to the provisions passed by the House Armed Services \nCommittee as part of the National Defense Authorization Act. Mr. \nChairman, 26 of the 27 Democrats on that committee voted to advance an \nNDAA that contained similar restrictions. The provisions in our bill \nwill complement those restrictions, as well as the restrictions put \nforward in the defense appropriations bills for several years running \nand this committee's previous intelligence authorization bills. The \nranking member may have forgotten, but in 2012, there were provisions \nsimilar to this one that were included in the legislation.\n  In sum, these provisions represent a strong and enduring consensus in \nCongress that Guantanamo should remain open and that detainees should \nnot be transferred to the U.S. for any reason. As everyone here is \naware, several detainees who have been released from Guantanamo have \ngone back to the fight and killed and wounded Americans. Putting \ndetainees in U.S. prisons, as the administration originally proposed, \nwould be disruptive and potentially disastrous. The threat is real, and \nGuantanamo is already equipped to handle the detention and military \ntrial of these individuals, as appropriate.\n  For those reasons, I would urge my colleagues to oppose this \namendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to urge support for this amendment. This is one of the few \nareas of disagreement between the chairman and myself. When we look at \nhow we are progressing or the lack of more progress in our struggle \nagainst ISIS and al Qaeda in places like Syria and Iraq, we are often \ntempted to consider those that we take off the battlefield as a metric \nof our success--we have eliminated so many combatants from the \nbattlefield. But of course that number in isolation means very little. \nAnd the challenge is that with every one we take off the battlefield, \nthere are new foreign fighters coming onto the battlefield.\n  The recruitment of those additional fighters uses a variety of images \nand issues to attract people to join the jihad. One of the issues that \nis continually used as recruiting propaganda is the presence of the \ndetention center at Guantanamo Bay. This is a recruitment vehicle for \nthe jihadis. It is a rallying cry for the jihadis.\n  The closure of this prison will not end the threat from ISIS or al \nQaeda. There will be other efforts to recruit. But why give them this \nrecruitment tool when there are other, better ways that these people \ncan be incarcerated? Why give them this recruitment vehicle when there \nare ways that we can secure the people at Guantanamo Bay, prosecute the \npeople at Guantanamo Bay, uphold our highest standards and the rule of \nlaw, and remove at least one part the jihadi social media and other \npropaganda campaign?\n  Mr. Chairman, I think it is in our national security interest to do \nso. I would urge support for the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chair, I know that the gentleman believes every word that he is \nsaying. We have had robust debate in the Intelligence Committee behind \nclosed doors, and we have had robust debate out in open session, and it \nis a debate I think that will always continue.\n  However, the concern remains from the majority Members of Congress \nthat they would prefer to keep Guantanamo open because no one wants to \nbring those terrorists to the United States, to their backyard, to try \nthem in their State or their county or their community.\n  So I respect the gentleman's concerns, and we will continue to debate \nthose, but I will continue to oppose closing Guantanamo or having our \nintelligence community participate in the removal of detainees from \nGuantanamo.\n  Mr. Chair, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Schiff).\n  The question was taken; and the Chair announced that the noes \nappeared to have it.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I demand a recorded vote.\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to clause 6 of rule XVIII, further proceedings on \nthe amendment offered by the gentleman from California will be \npostponed.\n\n\n            Amendment No. 7 Offered by Mr. Rooney of Florida\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 7 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title III, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 3__. REPORT ON HIRING OF GRADUATES OF CYBER CORPS \n                   SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM BY INTELLIGENCE COMMUNITY.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 90 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence, in coordination with the Director of the \n     National Science Foundation, shall submit to the \n     congressional intelligence committees a report on the \n     employment by the intelligence community of graduates of the \n     Cyber Corps Scholarship Program. The report shall include the \n     following:\n       (1) The number of graduates of the Cyber Corps Scholarship \n     Program hired by each element of the intelligence community.\n       (2) A description of how each element of the intelligence \n     community recruits graduates of the Cyber Corps Scholar \n     Program.\n       (3) A description of any processes available to the \n     intelligence community to expedite the hiring or processing \n     of security clearances for graduates of the Cyber Corps \n     Scholar Program.\n       (4) Recommendations by the Director to improve the hiring \n     by the intelligence community of graduates of the Cyber Corps \n     Scholarship Program, including any recommendations for \n     legislative action to carry out such improvements.\n       (b) Cyber Corps Scholarship Program Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``Cyber Corps Scholarship Program'' means \n     the Federal Cyber Scholarship-for-Service Program under \n     section 302 of the Cybersecurity Enhancement Act of 2014 (15 \n     U.S.C. 7442).\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nFlorida (Mr. Rooney) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Florida.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I \nmay consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, as we debate this bill today, hackers across the world \nare trying furiously to break into our cyber networks, as we all know. \nAnd as we have seen in recent weeks, they are occasionally successful, \nand the consequences are grave. These cracks in our cyber defense put \nour security at risk. They also threaten American businesses and the \nprivacy and credit of individuals across this country.\n  For the sake of our national security and our economy, we must work \ntogether to improve our cyber capabilities. This requires a stronger, \nmore capable cyber workforce, which our bipartisan amendment will help \nfacilitate.\n  The Federal CyberCorps Scholarship for Service program gives \nscholarships to students who study in the cybersecurity field. In \nexchange, those students commit to serving in government cybersecurity \npositions after graduation. Leaders within the intelligence community \nand DOD have told us that they need to expand their workforce and want \nto hire graduates from this program. Unfortunately, outdated personnel \nrules and insufficient direct hire authority make it extremely \ndifficult for them to do so. As a result, these\n\n[[Page H4410]]\n\nstudents aren't able to fulfill their work commitment and we are unable \nto meet our workforce needs, and our cybersecurity suffers.\n  We believe Congress should help remove those obstacles and make it \neasier to bring those graduates into the cyber workforce. Our amendment \nstarts that process by requiring a report back to us on how many \nCyberCorps graduates go to work for the intelligence community and how \nthese agencies recruit them. This information will help us determine \nhow to streamline the hiring process so we are capitalizing on the best \ncybersecurity talent available.\n  Mr. Chairman, this is a simple, bipartisan amendment, but it will pay \ndividends to improve and expand our cyber workforce and strengthen our \nnational security.\n  I would like to thank Congresswoman Sewell from Alabama for her \nassistance in this amendment.\n  With that, Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise to claim the time in opposition, \neven though I am not opposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to thank the gentleman from Florida and the gentlewoman from \nAlabama, both HPSCI colleagues, for their amendment, and I am happy to \nsupport it.\n  This amendment furthers two important goals: first, to ensure that \nacademic programs that should serve as a resource to the government--in \nthis case, the National Science Foundation's CyberCorps Scholarship for \nService--actually do result in a good number of students choosing \nemployment within the intelligence community; and second, to deepen the \nbench of our cyber defenders.\n  As a recent series of serious cyber breaches has demonstrated, it is \nan imperative for the protection of this Nation's workforce, privacy, \nand sensitive intelligence that we strengthen the IC's cyber cadre with \nour best and brightest. Mr. Chairman, this amendment is a fine addition \nto the gentleman's and the gentlewoman's other initiatives already \nrepresented in the bill, particularly those that advance diversity in \nthe intelligence community.\n  Again, Mr. Chairman, I want to thank my colleagues for their work. I \nurge support for this bipartisan amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. ROONEY of Florida. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my \ntime.\n  Ms. SEWELL of Alabama. Mr. Chair, I rise today in support of this \nbipartisan, common sense amendment that seeks to streamline and \nstrengthen our Intelligence Community's (IC) cyber workforce. I am \npleased to join my fellow colleague, Rep. Rooney, who shares my deeply \nheld desire to help meet the incredible need to raise the number of \nprofessionals in the critically important field of cybersecurity.\n  The recent breach of OPM which compromised the personal information \nof nearly 4 million federal employees further illustrates our urgent \nand immediate need to make substantial improvements to our cyber \ndatabases and overall cyber infrastructure. Cyberattacks have become \nincreasingly common, and state sponsored bad actors pose a serious \nthreat to our national security. These types of attacks are one of the \nmost urgent modern challenges to our nation. Our government must be \npoised to do more to prevent future attacks. We must position ourselves \nto curtail any threat, no matter how great or small.\n  In December 2011, the National Science and Technology Council, in \ncooperation with the National Science Foundation (NSF), advanced a \nbroad, coordinated federal strategic plan to enhance cybersecurity \nresearch and education. As part of this plan, the NSF launched the \nCyberCorps Scholarship for Service (SFS) program. In an effort to \nbolster our federal workforce's capacity and advance the nation's \neconomic prosperity and national security, this program provides \nfunding for undergraduate and graduate level scholarships to students \ninterested in cybersecurity. In return, scholarship recipients are \nrequired to work for a Federal, State, Local, or Tribal Government \norganization in a position related to cybersecurity for a period equal \nto the length of the scholarship. In essence, students receive a \nscholarship in exchange for their commitment to federal civil service. \nThis program seeks to cultivate pipelines for applicants from \nundergraduate and graduate programs into federal careers focusing on \ncombatting emerging cyber security threats.\n  Leaders within the Intelligence Community tell me, however, that \noutdated policies and onerous clearance procedures are inhibiting their \nability to fill industry vacancies with young and diverse cybersecurity \nprofessionals.\n  Our amendment simply requires the Intelligence Community to report to \nCongress on how many CyberCorps graduates actually go to work for the \nIC and how IC agencies recruit these CyberCorps graduates. This \ninformation will help Congress determine how we can best improve the \nhiring process.\n  I strongly believe that Congress should be facilitating ways to help \nthe Intelligence Community hire these critically important CyberCorps \ngraduates and create a pipeline directly into our cyber workforce.\n  I encourage my colleagues to vote yes on this amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Florida (Mr. Rooney).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 8 Offered by Mr. Moulton\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 8 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title III, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 3__. REPORT ON EFFECTS OF DATA BREACH OF OFFICE OF \n                   PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT.\n\n       (a) Report.--Not later than 120 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the President shall transmit to the \n     congressional intelligence committees a report on the data \n     breach of the Office of Personnel Management disclosed in \n     June 2015.\n       (b) Matters Included.--The report under subsection (a) \n     shall include the following:\n       (1) The effects, if any, of the data breach on the \n     operations of the intelligence community abroad, including \n     the types of operations, if any, that have been negatively \n     affected or entirely suspended or terminated as a result of \n     the data breach.\n       (2) An assessment of the effects of the data breach to each \n     element of the intelligence community.\n       (3) An assessment of how foreign persons, groups, or \n     countries may use the data collected by the data breach \n     (particularly regarding information included in background \n     investigations for security clearances), including with \n     respect to--\n       (A) recruiting intelligence assets;\n       (B) influencing decision-making processes within the \n     Federal Government, including regarding foreign policy \n     decisions; and\n       (C) compromising employees of the Federal Government and \n     friends and families of such employees for the purpose of \n     gaining access to sensitive national security and economic \n     information.\n       (4) An assessment of which departments or agencies of the \n     Federal Government use the best practices to protect \n     sensitive data, including a summary of any such best \n     practices that were not used by the Office of Personnel \n     Management.\n       (5) An assessment of the best practices used by the \n     departments or agencies identified under paragraph (4) to \n     identify and fix potential vulnerabilities in the systems of \n     the department or agency.\n       (c) Briefing.--The Director of National Intelligence shall \n     provide to the congressional intelligence committees an \n     interim briefing on the report under subsection (a), \n     including a discussion of proposals and options for \n     responding to cyber attacks.\n       (d) Form.--The report under subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nMassachusetts (Mr. Moulton) and a Member opposed each will control 5 \nminutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Massachusetts.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  Mr. Chairman, recently, the Office of Personnel Management disclosed \na massive security breach that may have exposed personal information of \nmillions of current and former Federal employees, including those who \nwork in sensitive national security positions. Simply put, this cyber \nbreach is unacceptable and breaks faith with those dedicated military \nand civilian personnel who commit their lives to keeping our country \nsafe.\n  Although responsibility has not yet been officially confirmed, many \nobservers believe that individuals in China, who may have been acting \non orders of the Chinese Government, were responsible for hacking into \nOPM databases.\n  Two things are clear, Mr. Chairman. First, we must ensure this does \nnot\n\n[[Page H4411]]\n\nhappen again; we must protect our Federal employees--our foreign \nservice officers, State Department staff, members of the intelligence \ncommunity, and many others. Second, we must make clear to the rest of \nthe world that these attacks will not be tolerated and that there will \nbe consequences.\n  Mr. Chairman, that is why my amendment takes the first of many \ncritical steps to respond to this breach. My amendment starts the \nprocess of holding OPM accountable. It makes sure we leverage the best \ndata security practices that our intelligence agencies use to protect \nsensitive personal information about our military and civilian \npersonnel who work day in and day out to keep our country safe.\n  Finally, my amendment ensures that the United States Congress can \nplay a constructive role in developing a meaningful, forceful response \nto cyber attacks--especially attacks aimed at our Nation's security. We \nmust stop these attacks and protect those who commit their lives to our \nsafety. This amendment is an important first step in doing just that.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, we are prepared to accept the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, the Intelligence Committee, I think, in a \nbipartisan manner, has the same concerns as the gentleman.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff).\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  We expect timely briefs on all major cyber attacks, but in this case, \nI agree, we need to require specific reporting and briefing on the \nimpacts of the recent OPM breach. We need to learn far more about how \nhackers accessed the systems, what they obtained, and how we can \nprevent this from happening again. In addition, this will help us \nunderstand the impact to the intelligence community.\n  Mr. Chairman, as I have said before, our public and private networks \nare not sufficiently secure, and they are a regular target for cyber \nattacks. We must do everything we can to shore them up, and we must do \nso now.\n  I want to thank my colleague for his work, and I urge support of his \namendment.\n  Mr. MOULTON. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Massachusetts (Mr. Moulton).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 Amendment No. 9 Offered by Mr. Turner\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 9 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title III, add the following:\n\n     SEC. 3__. ASSESSMENT ON FUNDING OF POLITICAL PARTIES AND \n                   NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS BY THE RUSSIAN \n                   FEDERATION.\n\n       (a) In General.--Not later than 180 days after the date of \n     the enactment of this Act, the Director of National \n     Intelligence shall submit to the appropriate congressional \n     committees an intelligence community assessment on the \n     funding of political parties and nongovernmental \n     organizations in former Soviet states and countries in Europe \n     by the Russian Federation and the security and intelligence \n     services of the Russian Federation since January 1, 2006. \n     Such assessment shall include the following:\n       (1) The country involved, the entity funded, the security \n     service involved, and the intended effect of the funding.\n       (2) An evaluation of such intended effects, including with \n     respect to--\n       (A) undermining the political cohesion of the country \n     involved;\n       (B) undermining the missile defense of the United States \n     and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization; and\n       (C) undermining energy projects that could provide an \n     alternative to Russian energy.\n       (b) Form.--The report under subsection (a) shall be \n     submitted in unclassified form, but may include a classified \n     annex.\n       (c) Appropriate Congressional Committees Defined.--In this \n     section, the term ``appropriate congressional committees'' \n     means the following:\n       (1) The congressional intelligence communities.\n       (2) The Committees on Armed Services of the House of \n     Representatives and the Senate.\n       (3) The Committee on Foreign Affairs of the House of \n     Representatives and the Committee on Foreign Relations of the \n     Senate.\n\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, my bipartisan amendment requires the \nDirector of National Intelligence to submit a report to Congress on the \nfunding of political parties and NGOs in former Soviet states by the \nRussian Federation and its associated security and intelligence \nservices.\n  As Congress well knows, a resurgent Russia, led by President Vladimir \nPutin, is once again determined to destabilize the West and various \nEuro-Atlantic institutions such as NATO.\n  While we have seen the blatant use of military force both in Georgia \nand Ukraine, Russia has employed a variety of nontraditional methods to \ndisrupt the West. These methods include the use of propaganda through \nstate-owned media outlets such as Russia Today, manipulation of \nEuropean natural gas markets, and the use of money to influence \npolitical parties and nongovernmental organizations throughout Europe.\n  In a recent New York Times article, authors Peter Baker and Steven \nErlanger highlight a series of instances in which the Russian \nFederation covertly funneled money to political organizations in Europe \nin order to influence various decisionmakers and parties.\n  While their ultimate goal remains the fragmentation of institutions \nsuch as the EU and NATO, Russia hopes to achieve incremental victories \nlike influencing the EU's upcoming decision on whether or not to renew \nsanctions against them.\n  As president of the NATO Parliamentary Assembly and chair of the \nAssembly's U.S. delegation, I have had the opportunity to meet \nfrequently with my European counterparts to discuss this issue. In all \ninstances, Assembly members continue to validate and echo the concerns \ndiscussed here today. Only through an increased understanding can we \nbegin to effectively plan and combat President Putin and a resurging \nRussia.\n  I ask all of my colleagues to rise in support of this bipartisan \namendment, and I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition, even though I am not \nopposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlemen from Ohio, \nAlabama, and New York for their amendment, which I am proud to support.\n  This amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nprovide an assessment on funding of political parties and NGOs in the \nformer Soviet states and countries in Europe by the Russian Federation \nand its security and intelligence services.\n  Over the past few years, we have witnessed a number of highly \nvisible, aggressive actions by Russia, particularly in Ukraine; but \nMoscow's efforts to destabilize its neighbors are also subtler and more \nnefarious. Russia is sponsoring and funding political parties to groom \nthe next generation of puppets which they can control from Moscow.\n  We must better understand what they are doing, even if what they are \ndoing is very deep behind the scenes; so long as sources and methods \nare properly protected, I support this effort.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues for their work, and I urge \nsupport of the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, as the chairman well remembers, with the \ncold war, there was a time when the conflict between the United States \nand Russia was very tense. This amendment will help us bring to bear \nlight on the actions of Russia so that we can make certain our policies \nreflect the new aggressiveness of the Russian Federation.\n  Mr. NUNES. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. TURNER. I yield to the gentleman from California.\n\n[[Page H4412]]\n\n  Mr. NUNES. I really appreciate the gentleman. He is one of the most \ninvolved Members of Congress with NATO, so I know that his concerns are \nvalid. I, too, share those concerns and would urge my colleagues to \nsupport the amendment.\n  Mr. TURNER. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Ohio (Mr. Turner).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                  Amendment No. 10 Offered by Mr. Farr\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 10 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       At the end of subtitle C of title III, add the following \n     new section:\n\n     SEC. 3__. REPORT ON CONTINUOUS EVALUATION OF SECURITY \n                   CLEARANCES.\n\n       Not later than 120 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit \n     to the congressional intelligence committees and the \n     congressional defense committees (as defined in section \n     101(a)(16) of title 10, United States Code) a report on the \n     continuous evaluation of security clearances of employees, \n     officers, and contractors of the intelligence community. The \n     report shall include the following:\n       (1) The status of the continuous evaluation program of the \n     intelligence community, including a timeline for the \n     implementation of such program.\n       (2) A comparison of such program to the automated \n     continuous evaluation system of the Department of Defense.\n       (3) Identification of any possible efficiencies that could \n     be achieved by the intelligence community leveraging the \n     automated continuous evaluation system of the Department of \n     Defense.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Farr) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from California.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, today, I rise to offer an amendment which \nstrengthens the process for granting security clearances to those \nworking in the intelligence community through a continuous evaluation \nprocess.\n  This amendment directs the National Intelligence Director to provide \nthe intelligence and defense committees a report on the status of its \ncurrent efforts for continuous evaluation of security clearance \nholders, including a timeline for its rollout. The report will also \nprovide a cost-benefit analysis of DNI's efforts to similar efforts \nthat are being carried on in the Department of Defense.\n  We learned, after the tragic shooting in the Navy Yard in September \n2013, the DOD should continuously evaluate these personnel, rather than \ndo it every once every 5 years.\n  Clearance starts by an initial vetting that determines a person's \nsuitability and eligibility to have access to classified material by \nexamining the person's past and making a judgment on future \nreliability. Now, once cleared, a continuous evaluation process is \ndesigned to examine a person's behavior to ensure its continued \nreliability.\n  Congress directed the DOD to create a process that would be a \ngovernmentwide solution for continuous personnel security evaluations. \nThis solution is called ACES, Automated Continuous Evaluation System.\n  Now, the Director of National Intelligence is also seeking its own \ncapability for continuous evaluation. While I support the intelligence \ncommunity's requirement, their efforts may be redundant.\n  DOD's system already has measurable successes. Their system is also \nflexible enough to be tailored to meet any specific requirements that \nthe intelligence community may need.\n  My amendment simply assures that the DNI does not work towards a \ncontinuous evaluation system in a vacuum. By working together to share \nlessons learned or build a common evaluation system, the DNI and the \nDOD can build a better program that ensures our national security and \nuses taxpayer dollars effectively.\n  As we have all seen recently, the insider threat to our national \nsecurity is real. We must continue to ensure that we remain secure by \nonly granting security clearances to those who are suitable and \nreliable.\n  I ask for an ``aye'' vote on the amendment, and I reserve the balance \nof my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \nam not opposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I am prepared to accept the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff), my colleague, the ranking member of the \nIntelligence Committee.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentleman and my good \nfriend from California for his amendment, which I am very happy to \nsupport.\n  An important role of Congress and of this bill is to ensure that our \nintelligence agencies protect sensitive information and protect \ntaxpayer dollars.\n  This amendment supports both of these goals by requiring that the \nOffice of the Director of National Intelligence report to Congress on \nits continuous evaluation process for security clearances and to \ncompare those processes to those the Department of Defense uses. This \ncomparative study will help identify places where we may be able to \nmake improvements and save money.\n  I want to thank Mr. Farr for his amendment and his diligence.\n  Mr. FARR. Mr. Chairman, I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom California (Mr. Farr).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                 amendment no. 11 offered by ms. sinema\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 11 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk, and I \noffer that amendment at this time.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 42, after line 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 336. REPORT ON STRATEGY, EFFORTS, AND RESOURCES TO \n                   DETECT, DETER, AND DEGRADE ISLAMIC STATE \n                   REVENUE MECHANISMS.\n\n       (a) Sense of Congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \n     the intelligence community should dedicate necessary \n     resources to defeating the revenue mechanisms of the Islamic \n     State.\n       (b) Report.--Not later than 90 days after the date of the \n     enactment of this Act, the Director of National Intelligence \n     shall submit to the intelligence committees a report on the \n     strategy, efforts, and resources of the intelligence \n     community that are necessary to detect, deter, and degrade \n     the revenue mechanisms of the Islamic State.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentlewoman from \nArizona (Ms. Sinema) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentlewoman from Arizona.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I want to say thank you to Mr. Fitzpatrick for cosponsoring this \namendment and for his leadership as the chairman of the Task Force to \nInvestigate Terrorism Financing. Thank you also to Chairman Nunes and \nRanking Member Schiff for supporting this important amendment.\n  The purpose of the bipartisan Sinema-Fitzpatrick amendment is to \nchoke off the Islamic State's revenue stream. Our amendment directs the \nintelligence community to detect, deter, and degrade Islamic State's \nrevenue sources and to report on the strategy and resources needed for \nsuccess.\n  The Islamic State is one of the world's most violent and dangerous \nterrorist groups. Its goals to build a caliphate in the Middle East and \nencourage attacks in Europe and the United States represent a new \nthreat to our country and to global stability.\n  ISIL is also believed to be the richest terrorist organization in \nhistory, controlling a huge territory in Iraq and Syria containing \nsignificant oil resources. In 2014, the Islamic State generated \napproximately $1 million per day through the sale of smuggled oil, \nextortion, and kidnapping for ransom.\n  U.S. strikes have reportedly diminished ISIL's oil revenues, but the \nbreadth of this terrorist organization's\n\n[[Page H4413]]\n\nfunding sources represents a serious challenge to our national \nsecurity.\n  A February report by the Financial Action Task Force estimated that \nISIL now largely finances itself through extortion in the territory it \ncontrols, and another study places this extortion revenue at $360 \nmillion per year. In Iraq, ISIL levies a 5 percent tax on all \nwithdrawals from banks, and the organization also gains tens of \nmillions of dollars from kidnapping on an annual basis.\n  To defeat ISIL and protect our country, we must cut off the Islamic \nState's diverse and substantial sources of revenue.\n  I encourage my colleagues to support this commonsense bipartisan \namendment.\n  Mr. Chairman, I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, although I \ndo not intend to oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 3 minutes to the \ngentleman from Pennsylvania (Mr. Fitzpatrick).\n  Mr. FITZPATRICK. Mr. Chairman, I thank the chairman, and I thank my \ncolleague Ms. Sinema for her work on this important amendment and for \nher work as well on the task force established to investigate terrorism \nfinancing.\n  Today, the terror threat faced by our Nation and our intelligence \ncommunity is more diverse and sophisticated than it has ever been \nbefore. Organizations like Hezbollah, ISIS, and Boko Haram can no \nlonger simply be considered terrorist groups.\n  They have grown into much more dangerous entities, ones with the \nabilities to self-finance their actions through means far beyond \ntraditional methods, from illicit oil sales and human trafficking to \nregional taxation and antiquity dealing.\n  In order to effectively combat such evolved threats, U.S. policy must \nalso evolve. As chair of the bipartisan Task Force to Investigate \nTerrorism Financing, established by the Committee on Financial \nServices, I have worked with lawmakers and policy experts to guarantee \nthe U.S. response to terror's new revenue streams are quickly and \neffectively choked out.\n  This amendment is important to ensure each level of our government, \nfrom Congress to the intelligence community, has identified the \nproblem, as well as potential weaknesses, and is ready to address the \nthreats that we face.\n  By both expressing the sense of Congress that our intelligence \nagencies must dedicate resources to eradicate terror revenue \nmechanisms, as well as report to relevant committees on their \nstrategies, this amendment strengthens the underlying bill and \nCongress' understanding of our global response to terrorism.\n  The threat to freedom and democracy posed by the Islamic State and \ngroups like it circles the globe, and the United States can ill afford \nto combat these enemies on the battlefield alone. Any strategy against \nterror groups worldwide must attack not only militarily, but at their \nfunding source. Organizations, no matter how complex, cannot \neffectively function without requisite resources.\n  Mr. Chairman, our intelligence community is second to none, and I am \ncertain that, together, we can formulate and carry out long-term \nsolutions to combat terror financing.\n  I thank the chairman for his leadership on this issue and Ms. Sinema \nfor offering this amendment.\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chairman, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia, Ranking Member Schiff, and thank him for his leadership on \nnational security issues.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlewoman from \nArizona for her amendment, as well as the gentleman from Pennsylvania. \nI am proud to support it.\n  Behind ISIL's rapid and dangerous rise are its many sources of \nillicit funding. This amendment expresses the conviction of Congress \nthat the intelligence community should dedicate resources to finding \nand eliminating those revenue sources and that the IC must report on \nits effort to do so.\n  Again, I want to thank both of my colleagues for their leadership on \nthis issue, and I urge strong support of their amendment.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chairman, at this time, I yield 1 minute to the \ngentleman from North Carolina (Mr. Pittenger).\n  Mr. PITTENGER. Mr. Chairman, I rise in support of this amendment and \ncongratulate Ms. Sinema and Mr. Fitzpatrick, the chairman of the \ncommittee. This will help our terrorism task force efforts undermine \nthe funding of ISIS.\n  Terrorism experts concur that ISIS is the most well-funded terrorist \nthreat that we have ever faced. Through the illicit sale of stolen oil \nand antiquities, kidnapping for ransom, extortion, bank robberies, and \nusurious taxation, ISIS continues to amass tens of millions of dollars.\n  Stopping this flow of money to terrorists must be a top priority if \nwe are to defeat ISIS. Unfortunately, earlier this month, the President \nadmitted he does not have a comprehensive strategy to defeat ISIS.\n  This amendment will require the Director of National Intelligence to \nsubmit to Congress the current efforts they use to undermine the \nfunding of ISIS, increasing our ability to ensure these efforts are a \npriority.\n  I urge my colleagues to support this amendment. I will look forward \nto the continued bipartisan support of the Financial Services Task \nForce to Investigate Terrorism Financing.\n\n                              {time}  1530\n\n  Ms. SINEMA. Mr. Chair, as a member of the Task Force to Investigate \nTerrorism Financing, I am working with my colleagues on both sides of \nthe aisle to keep money out of the hands of terrorists and to find \nsolutions like this amendment, which strengthens America's security.\n  Again, I would like to thank Mr. Fitzpatrick for his partnership and \nleadership on this issue. I also thank Chairman Nunes, Ranking Member \nSchiff, and Mr. Pittenger for their work on this important legislation.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, we are prepared to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the \ngentlewoman from Arizona (Ms. Sinema).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n                Amendment No. 12 Offered by Mr. Crowley\n\n  The CHAIR. It is now in order to consider amendment No. 12 printed in \nHouse Report 114-155.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I have an amendment at the desk.\n  The CHAIR. The Clerk will designate the amendment.\n  The text of the amendment is as follows:\n\n       Page 42, after line 12, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 336. REPORT ON NATIONAL SECURITY COOPERATION BETWEEN \n                   UNITED STATES, INDIA, AND ISRAEL.\n\n       Not later than 180 days after the date of the enactment of \n     this Act, the Director of National Intelligence shall submit \n     to the congressional intelligence committees a report on \n     possibilities for growing national security cooperation \n     between the United States, India, and Israel.\n\n  The CHAIR. Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from New \nYork (Mr. Crowley) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may consume.\n  I rise today to urge my colleagues to support this bipartisan \namendment.\n  I appreciate the support of my colleagues from California, Ohio, \nNorth Carolina, Arizona, and New York, who are coleaders on this \neffort. They are Mr. Bera, Mr. Engel, Mr. Nadler, Mr. Chabot, Mr. \nSchweikert, and Mr. Holding. I also thank the chairman and ranking \nmember of the Intelligence Committee for their support of this \namendment.\n  This amendment is about expanding the cooperation between the world's \noldest democracy, the world's largest democracy, and a true democracy \nwithin the Middle East. That is the United States, India, and Israel. \nIn recent years, the United States has expanded relations with Israel, \nas well as with India, in a number of areas.\n  We have also seen India and Israel work more and more together on a \nbilateral basis. Of course, that is because a lot of their interests \noverlap, but it is\n\n[[Page H4414]]\n\nalso because many of our values overlap.\n  There is so much that our three countries can be doing together in \nthe realm of scientific cooperation, research, best practices, national \nsecurity implementation, defense, and much, much more.\n  There is also a lot that we can learn from each other, whether it is \nabout drip irrigation to build food supplies, desalinization to address \nwater shortages, or refrigeration practices to prevent the kind of food \nspoilage that leads to hunger, not to mention how much potential there \nis in technological research and economic development.\n  This amendment, of course, just deals with a narrow portion of these \nareas because the underlying bill is limited to security issues, but it \nis a needed start.\n  I truly believe that the United States-India relationship has the \npotential to be the world's most important ``big country'' relationship \nin the 21st century. As our ties with India grow, it is important to \nsee the India-Israel ties increasing as well.\n  Here in the United States, as a former co-chair of the Congressional \nCaucus on India and Indian Americans, I have met with many members of \nthe Indian American community, and I have consistently heard from \nvisiting members of India's Government that there is a genuine desire \nto expand relations between India and Israel now and in the future.\n  In fact, it has already been reported that, in the coming months, \nIndia's Prime Minister will become the first-ever Indian Prime Minister \nto travel to Israel. We are going to see the leader of what will be the \nworld's most populous nation visiting and engaging with one of the \nsmallest nations.\n  The sky is really the limit on this effort going forward, and that is \nwhy the amendment asks the Director of National Intelligence to submit \nto Congress a plan on how to grow the U.S.-India-Israel national \nsecurity relationship. This is a real possibility, and I hope the DNI \ncan identify a solid number of ways to work together even more in the \nfuture.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I claim the time in opposition, although I do \nnot intend to oppose the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, Mr. Holding was just here, but unfortunately, \nhe got called away to another meeting because I know he worked closely \nwith Mr. Crowley and others as chair of the India Caucus, and he wanted \nme to express his strong support for this amendment. I also urge my \ncolleagues to support the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chair, I yield 1 minute to the gentleman from \nCalifornia (Mr. Schiff).\n  Mr. SCHIFF. I thank the gentleman for yielding.\n  Mr. Chair, working with international partners is an essential \nelement of the IC's mission to understand the global threat \nenvironment, as well as the political, social, and economic trends \naround the world.\n  For nearly 70 years, Israel has been a close friend and ally, as well \nas a vital source of intelligence about the world's most volatile \nregion. In recent years, India, the world's largest democracy, has \nupgraded its bilateral relationships with both the United States and \nIsrael. Given India's complex relationship with both Pakistan and \nChina, exploring the potential for enhanced trilateral intelligence \ncooperation is very much in our interest.\n  Mr. Crowley's amendment to direct the DNI to report to Congress on \nthe potential for intelligence sharing is timely, and I urge the House \nto support it.\n  Mr. CROWLEY. Mr. Chairman, again, let me thank Mr. Nunes, the chair \nof the committee, as well as the ranking member, Mr. Schiff, for their \nsupport of this valuable amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from South \nCarolina (Mr. Wilson) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from South Carolina.\n  Mr. WILSON of South Carolina. Mr. Chairman, I am grateful for \nChairman Nunes and the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence \nfor their leadership on this important legislation.\n  I am particularly grateful that I was here to hear the presentation \nby Congressman Joe Crowley relative to promoting a better relationship \nwith the world's largest democracy, India, by the world's oldest \ndemocracy, the United States.\n  He and I have served as the past co-chairs of the Caucus of India and \nIndian Americans, and I know of his commitment to promoting a better \nrelationship between India and the United States.\n  Last week, the Office of Personnel Management revealed they were the \ntargets of an extended cyber attack on Federal employee personnel \nrecords. These attacks stole personal data, such as Social Security \nnumbers, financial information, and security clearance documents, \nputting the personal and financial security of our citizens at risk.\n  This cyber attack was not a novelty. Recently, we have seen a growing \nnumber of cyber attacks on government Web sites, national retailers, \nand small businesses. Indeed, according to Symantec, most businesses \nreported a completed or an attempted cyber attack in the last year, and \n60 percent of those facing an attack were small- or medium-sized \nbusinesses. These cyber attacks are a sober reminder to Congress that \nall government agencies need to work together to better protect their \npublic and private networks.\n  After each of these attacks, we have had a number of questions: Who \nis behind it? Is it an agent of a foreign government or a nonstate \nactor? How many records were affected? What kind of information was \naccessed?\n  As of now, we gather this information through various government \nagencies, and each uses a different measure to assess and quantify the \ndamage of the attack, so we waste valuable time and resources when \ntrying to piece together a response.\n  We need a clear, unified system of measurement for cyber attacks that \ncan be used across all government agencies and military branches. By \nputting government agencies and branches of the military on the same\n\n[[Page H4415]]\n\npage, we can have an effective and rapid response.\n  This amendment directs the Director of National Intelligence, in \nconsultation with the Secretary of Homeland Security, the Director of \nthe FBI, and the Secretary of Defense, to conduct a study to define a \nmethod of measuring a cyber incident so we can determine an appropriate \nresponse.\n  As chairman of the House Armed Services Subcommittee on Emerging \nThreats and Capabilities, it is apparent that cyber is a new domain of \nwarfare. This amendment is a critical first step in building a more \ncomprehensive cyber defense system.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition even though I am not \nopposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I would like to thank the gentleman from \nSouth Carolina for his important amendment.\n  There is a limit to how effective a defensive cyber strategy can be \nbecause, while we have to defend everything at all times, our \nadversaries get to attack everywhere and need to be successful only \nonce, so we need to create a more effective deterrent, which this \namendment will help further.\n  It would require that the Office of the Director of National \nIntelligence report to Congress on how we measure cyber attacks so that \nwe can know how best to respond once we are attacked or to communicate \nin advance how we would respond if we were attacked. Measuring the \nscale and effects of cyber attacks is no easy task, especially as we \nmust factor in second and third order effects.\n  I want to thank Mr. Wilson for his amendment. I am proud to support \nit.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom South Carolina (Mr. Wilson).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n\n\n              Amendment No. 14 Offered by Mr. Poe of Texas\n\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  This amendment, cosponsored by the ranking member on the Terrorism, \nNonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee, Mr. Keating from \nMassachusetts, requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nproduce a report on wildlife trafficking, how terrorist organizations \nare involved, how they are making money off of wildlife trafficking, \nand the impact it has on U.S. national security.\n  During our Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade Subcommittee \nhearing on this very issue in February, we learned that rhinos and \nelephants are on the path to extinction.\n  For example, back in the seventies, there were approximately 65,000 \nrhinos in Africa. Since then, about 1,000 a year have been killed, and \nnow, there are only 5,000 left in Africa. That is a 94 percent drop in \nthose rhinos. There are only five white rhinos in the whole world.\n  Elephants are not faring much better. From 2002 to 2010, the elephant \npopulation across Africa dropped 66 percent. Back in the thirties and \nforties, Mr. Chairman, there were approximately 5 million African \nelephants. Now there are about a half a million African elephants.\n  One of the most famous was Satao in this photograph that was taken \nlast year. He was, presumably, the oldest elephant that was in \nexistence in Africa. He was killed last year for his tusks, which \nalmost touched the ground. In fact, National Geographic, a year ago \ntoday, did an article on him and how he was killed for his tusks and \nhow other elephants are being killed for their tusks. He was about 46 \nyears old when he was killed for those tusks.\n  The reason that poaching seems to be on the increase over the last \nfew years is that there is a low risk of apprehension, and it is easy \nto commit these crimes. Also, even when someone is captured, penalties \nfor wildlife trafficking are far less than for drug trafficking.\n  Who uses these tusks? Who uses these rhino horns? The number one \ncountry in the world that is the consumer of the illegal ivory trade is \nChina. Vietnam is the number one country in the world that uses the \nillegal trade of rhino horns. This is where these tusks and these rhino \nhorns go, and it brings in a lot of money.\n  For example, a kilogram of rhino horns--if I remember my math \ncorrectly, that is 2.2 pounds--sells for $60,000. So there is a lot \nmore money involved in the sale of rhino horns and of elephant tusks \nthan even of gold and platinum.\n  Overall, the illegal wildlife trade is about $10 billion to $20 \nbillion a year. It should come as no surprise that terrorist \norganizations are also involved in this criminal enterprise, like al \nQaeda's affiliate al Shabaab and like Joseph Kony's Lord's Resistance \nArmy. They are cashing in on the illegal wildlife trafficking.\n  It is getting so bad that the poachers have become very sophisticated \nin the sense that they no longer just shoot elephants, for example, \nbecause that makes a noise, that warns them. They are even being \npoisoned. An elephant is poisoned, and the elephant dies.\n  Then, when people approach the elephant, they not only see the dead \nelephant, but they see other animals that\n\n[[Page H4416]]\n\nwere feeding on the carcass of the elephant, and they are all dead, \ntoo, so that the poachers can get those tusks. They have become very \ninnovative.\n\n                              {time}  1545\n\n  Local park rangers are underresourced; they are ill-equipped; and \nsome of them are corrupt as well. So we can't fight what we don't know.\n  There is a lot about this issue--and terrorist involvement in \nwildlife trafficking--that is murky, so we need to find out, for \nexample: How much money do terrorists get from wildlife trafficking? \nWho are the key facilitators of the trade? What government officials \nare complicit? What impact does this have on the U.S. national \nsecurity?\n  This amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nreport to Congress on these and other questions. The better we \nunderstand the threat, the better we understand what is happening and \nhow terrorists are involved in the illegal killing of rhinos and \nelephants, the more effective we can be against fighting those \nterrorists. And that is just the way it is.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even though \nI am not opposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I want to thank the gentlemen from Texas \nand Massachusetts for their amendment, which I am proud to support.\n  The trafficking of wildlife by terrorist organizations is an \nimportant issue, not only because it threatens to wipe out elephants, \nrhinos, and tigers, but also because it could threaten our national \nsecurity. The World Wildlife Fund estimates that the amount of money \ngenerated by wildlife trafficking trade reaches into the hundreds of \nmillions of dollars, and much of this goes to fund terrorists, \nincluding The Lord's Resistance Army, al-Shabaab, and Boko Haram. That \nis money going into the coffers of those who every day seek to harm us \nand others.\n  We must put our intelligence professionals to the task. We must \nunderstand from beginning to end how terrorists acquire, transfer, and \nprofit from wildlife trafficking. This is the first step to putting an \nend to it.\n  Again, I want to thank my colleagues for offering this amendment. I \nurge support.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

Pursuant to House Resolution 315, the gentleman from Texas \n(Mr. Poe) and a Member opposed each will control 5 minutes.\n  The Chair recognizes the gentleman from Texas.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, terrorists' use of social media has exploded over the \npast several years. A recent study by The Brookings Institution found \nthat ISIS had over 40,000 Twitter accounts. Terrorist groups from ISIS \nto the Taliban use social media platforms to recruit, to radicalize, to \nspread propaganda, and to raise money. I have seen fan pages for the \nKhorasan Group, an online press conference held on Twitter by the al \nQaeda branch in Yemen, and we all remember al-Shabaab live tweeting the \nmurder of 72 people in Kenya. All terrorist groups.\n  The benefits of social media are clear. Social media is easy to use, \nit is free, and it reaches huge audiences across the world. We need to \nbetter understand why terrorists' use of social media is effective and \nwhat impact it is having on the world.\n  This bipartisan amendment is cosponsored by the ranking member on our \nSubcommittee on Terrorism, Nonproliferation, and Trade, Mr. Keating \nfrom Massachusetts. This amendment requires the Director of National \nIntelligence to assess four parts of the social media problem: First, \nwhat role does social media play in radicalizing people in the United \nStates and abroad?\n  The rise of the lone wolf terrorism in recent years has been fueled, \nin part, by terrorists' use of social media. Just recently, in Garland, \nTexas, two individuals claiming ISIS connections were killed while they \nwere attacking an assembly on free speech and peaceable assembly of \nreligion. Evidence shows that they had some social connection, social \nmedia connection with ISIS. The Boston bombers made two pressure cooker \nbombs. The recipes for those bombs were published before the attack in \nal Qaeda's Inspire magazine. That magazine was released and promoted on \nsocial media.\n  Second, how exactly are terrorists using social media? Social media \nis constantly evolving, just like terrorists' use of social media \nplatforms. Following online trends is an essential element in putting \nresources where they have the most impact. We need to make fast-paced \nimprovements in this area as new trends and platforms emerge.\n  Third, what is the real intelligence value of terrorists' posts? In \n2012, a number of my colleagues and I sent a letter to the FBI asking, \nWhat intelligence value is terrorists' use of social media? The FBI has \nnot come up with an answer. We need a detailed understanding from the \nwhole intelligence community on just how valuable the intelligence is \nthat we are getting from terrorists' use of social media.\n  Finally, how does online fundraising, radicalization, and recruitment \nby terrorists impact U.S. national security? We know social media is a \nvaluable tool to the terrorists just by how often they use it. \nUnfortunately, the United States is way behind on countering \nterrorists' use of social media, so we should do more. Terrorists like \nISIS are out to destroy us. We have to fight to defeat them on every \nbattlefield, and that includes in social media.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I claim the time in opposition, even though \nI am not opposed.\n  The CHAIR. Without objection, the gentleman from California is \nrecognized for 5 minutes.\n  There was no objection.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, social media, like any other form of \ncommunication, can be exploited by bad actors for nefarious purposes. \nWhile we are lucky to live in a time of remarkable innovation that \nbrings us closer to\n\n[[Page H4417]]\n\none another no matter what our geographical distance may be, our \nadversaries use the same tools to spread hateful and dangerous messages \nacross the globe.\n  I, therefore, support this amendment that calls on the intelligence \ncommunity to provide Congress with greater information about how \nterrorist organizations use social media for fundraising, \nradicalization, and recruitment. Armed with that knowledge, we are more \ncapable of stopping them.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR.

Mr. Chairman, I yield myself such time as I may \nconsume.\n  Mr. Chairman, this amendment requires a strategy to defeat ISIS and \nother like-minded groups. It is incredible that after 4 years of the \nrise of ISIS, we still have to talk about needing a strategy, but here \nwe are.\n  Four years, Mr. Chairman, what is that? Well, in 4 years the United \nStates mobilized the whole country and had to fight two wars--one in \nthe Pacific and one in Europe--during World War II, and we were \nsuccessful in protecting the United States, but here after 4 years of \nthe rise of ISIS, we are not sure even what our strategy is.\n  One thing we do know: controlling land is a top priority for ISIS. \nIts own credibility is wrapped up in the idea of establishing a \ncaliphate. Without land, ISIS has no caliphate. Without a caliphate, \nISIS loses its legitimacy among its hardcore fighters. Controlling land \nis also how ISIS makes a lot of its money. See, ISIS extorts the people \nthat it controls. It also taxes them. ISIS is still bringing in \nmillions of dollars a day by other illegal activities.\n  The only way to stop that source of money is by taking back land that \nISIS controls. Because ISIS is embedded in civilian populations, U.S. \nairstrikes are not enough to take the land back. The Iraqi Army is \nstill too unprofessional to show that they are up to the job, and we \nhave all seen ourselves how the Iraqis have dropped American weapons \nand run. We have yet to give the Kurds the weapons they need to fight \nfor themselves, and we don't expect the dictator Assad to get the job \ndone.\n  The problem of ISIS is only getting bigger. Thousands of foreign \nfighters are still streaming into Iraq and Syria from other countries. \nOutside of Iraq and Syria, ISIS still has 10 networks, not including \nIraq and Syria. There are three in Libya, two in Saudi Arabia, and one \neach in the Sinai, Nigeria, Yemen, Algeria, and one in Pakistan and \nAfghanistan.\n  Saudi Arabia is known for its strong government control, but the ISIS \naffiliate in Saudi Arabia recently pulled off two successful suicide \nattack bombings in 2 weeks. Its affiliate in Yemen has taken advantage \nof the fall of the government to take over more land. The ISIS \naffiliate in Libya is running free in a lawless area throughout the \nsame country that killed our Ambassador and three other Americans. All \nof ISIS' 10 networks are growing stronger, not weaker, by the day.\n  The President said last year that the United States would defeat and \ndismantle ISIS. Well, here we are a year later; we still do not have \nthat strategy. That is at least according to the President himself last \nweek when he was meeting with the world leaders at the G7 summit. He \nsaid: We do not yet have a complete strategy against ISIS.\n  This amendment requires the Director of National Intelligence to \nreport to Congress within 6 months a complete strategy to defeat ISIS \nand other groups like it. The same amendment did pass unanimously last \nyear with this committee's support. So I ask Members to support it once \nagain this year and make it become the law of the land. Today's \nterrorists control more land than they have at anytime since World War \nII. We need a strategy; we need a plan; and we need it soon.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, I rise in opposition to the amendment.\n  The CHAIR. The gentleman from California is recognized for 5 minutes.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, it is critical that the United States \ncontinue to refine and implement a comprehensive and aggressive \nstrategy to counter ISIL, al Qaeda, and their affiliates, but that \nresponsibility does not lie with the Director of National Intelligence. \nThe DNI's job is to ensure that our national leadership, who do \ngenerate our counterterrorism strategy, have the timeliest, most \ngermane, and detailed information to be sure our strategy will be \nsuccessful.\n  Mr. Poe's amendment misclassifies that responsibility and \nmisconstrues\n\n[[Page H4418]]\n\nthe important role of the Director of National Intelligence. Our \nintelligence community must be free to collect and assess intelligence \noutside of the scope of political decisions to be sure their analysis \nremains impartial and objective.\n  So, reluctantly, I must oppose this amendment and urge my colleagues \nto do the same.\n  I reserve the balance of my time.\n  Mr. POE of Texas. The amendment does state that the Director of \nNational Intelligence will work with other appropriate agencies.\n  Mr. Chairman, it is hard to fathom that this Nation does not have a \nplan to deal with ISIS. This amendment says Congress will move forward \nand expect and put into law that we will have a plan; we will have a \nstrategy; and if the Director of National Intelligence is not an \nindividual who is supposed to help form that plan, then I don't know \nwho would be.\n  I would ask that this amendment be adopted.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  Mr. SCHIFF. Mr. Chairman, with respect to my colleague, we have a \nstrategy with respect to defeating al Qaeda and ISIL, with respect to \nthe war in Syria and Iraq. It is a comprehensive strategy and, frankly, \nit is a difficult strategy to implement. It is a strategy that involves \ncutting off terrorism financing. It is a strategy that involves cutting \noff the flow of foreign fighters into Syria and Iraq. It is a strategy \nthat involves drying up the resources, the propaganda, the attacking of \nthe recruitment mechanism of ISIS. It is a strategy that involves \nenlisting the support of our partners in the region and within the \nIslamic world to combat the perversion of their faith that is used to \nrecruit people to this jihad. It is a strategy that is also military in \ncharacter, that employs our air assets, that seeks to train and assist \nIraqi forces. So we have a strategy. It is comprehensive, and it is \ntough.\n  While I recognize that there is frustration that many of my \ncolleagues have that our strategy has thus far not borne more success--\nand I share that frustration--I have yet to hear any of my colleagues \noffer an alternative. It is one thing to bash the administration \nbecause you don't like the strategy; it is another to ignore the fact \nthat we have a strategy or to propose improvements to it.\n  But the subject matter of this amendment is whether the top \nintelligence official in the country should be charged with the \nresponsibility of developing the policy to defeat ISIS, and I think it \nis rather his responsibility to make sure that the policymakers in \nCongress and the administration have the very best intelligence to \ninform those decisions.\n  We see, frankly, this misunderstanding of the role of the \nintelligence community many times even in our committee when committee \nmembers will ask witnesses from the intelligence community to state \npolicy positions on how they think certain policies should be \nimplemented when that is really not their responsibility.\n  Here, much as I concur with the need to perfect our strategy, improve \nour strategy, and the execution of that strategy, I don't believe that \nthis is something that we should lay at the feet of the Director of \nNational Intelligence.\n  I urge a ``no'' vote on the amendment.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                              {time}  1600\n\n  Mr. POE of Texas. I don't have anything to say, believe it or not, \nMr. Chairman, so I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The CHAIR. The question is on the amendment offered by the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Poe).\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Chair, I move that the Committee do now rise.\n  The motion was agreed to.\n  Accordingly, the Committee rose; and the Speaker pro tempore (Mr. Poe \nof Texas) having assumed the chair, Mr. Bishop of Utah, Chair of the \nCommittee of the Whole House on the state of the Union, reported that \nthat Committee, having had under consideration the bill (H.R. 2596) to \nauthorize appropriations for fiscal year 2016 for intelligence and \nintelligence-related activities of the United States Government, the \nCommunity Management Account, and the Central Intelligence Agency \nRetirement and Disability System, and for other purposes, had come to \nno resolution thereon.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4418-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4418]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                                 RECESS\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

Under the rule, the previous question is \nordered.\n  Is a separate vote demanded on any amendment to the amendment \nreported from the Committee of the Whole?\n  If not, the question is on the amendment in the nature of a \nsubstitute, as amended.\n  The amendment was agreed to.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the engrossment and third \nreading of the bill.\n  The bill was ordered to be engrossed and read a third time, and was \nread the third time.\n\n\n                           Motion to Recommit\n\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I have a motion to recommit at the desk.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is the gentlewoman opposed to the bill?\n  Mrs. DINGELL. I am opposed to it in its current form.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The Clerk will report the motion to \nrecommit.\n  The Clerk read as follows:\n\n       Mrs. Dingell moves to recommit the bill H.R. 2596 to the \n     Select Committee on Intelligence (Permanent Select) with \n     instructions to report the same back to the House forthwith, \n     with the following amendment:\n       Page 29, after line 11, insert the following:\n\n     SEC. 317. PROTECTING UNITED STATES PERSONS WHO TRAVEL.\n\n       To maximize the security of United States civilian \n     aviation, the Director of National Intelligence shall \n     identify and share with all appropriate Federal departments \n     and agencies, including the Transportation Security \n     Administration--\n       (1) all information on new and constantly changing threats \n     used by terrorists to evade airport screening operations; and\n       (2) updated terrorist watch list information for the \n     purpose of properly vetting employees at commercial airports.\n\n     SEC. 318. PROTECTING PRIVATE PERSONAL INFORMATION FROM CYBER \n                   ATTACKS BY CHINA, RUSSIA, AND OTHER STATE-\n                   SPONSORED COMPUTER HACKERS.\n\n       The Director of National Intelligence, in coordination with \n     the heads of each element of the intelligence community, \n     shall prioritize efforts and dedicate sufficient resources to \n     uncover and to foil attempts to steal the private personal \n     information of United States persons, including Social \n     Security numbers, dates of birth, employment information, and \n     health records, insofar as--\n       (1) up to 4,000,000 records of Federal employees under the \n     control of the Office of Personnel Management were stolen;\n       (2) the information of 80,000,000 Americans was compromised \n     by the attacks on Anthem Health Insurance and CareFirst \n     BlueCross BlueShield;\n       (3) the health records of more than 29,000,000 Americans \n     were compromised in data breaches between 2010 and 2013; and\n       (4) the personnel records of millions of Federal employees \n     were compromised by a series of recently discovered attacks \n     against the Office of Personnel Management, including records \n     related to the background investigations of current, former, \n     and prospective Federal employees.\n\n  Mrs. DINGELL (during the reading). Mr. Speaker, I ask unanimous \nconsent to dispense with the reading.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Is there objection to the request of the \ngentlewoman from Michigan?\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentlewoman from Michigan is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, this is the final amendment to the bill, \nwhich will not kill the bill or send it back to committee. If adopted, \nthe bill will immediately proceed to final passage, as amended.\n  Mr. Speaker, it is very timely that we are considering the \nintelligence authorization bill today, as there have been several \ntroubling incidents in the last few weeks that require an immediate \nresponse by the Congress.\n  I know that Members on both sides of the aisle care deeply about \nairport security and cybersecurity, and we agree that Congress must do \neverything possible to keep the American people safe.\n  Last week, we learned that there were 73 people employed at airports \nacross the country that should have been disqualified for employment \nbecause they are on a terrorist watch list. The American people deserve \nthe highest level of security at our airports, and, quite frankly, I \nbelieve for all of us the status quo is unacceptable.\n  While it is easy for us to blame the TSA for this lapse in security, \nit is shocking that the TSA does not have access and that the current \npolicy does not authorize them to have access to the information that \nthey need so that\n\n[[Page H4420]]\n\nthey can keep us safe, nor do other appropriate agencies.\n  As much as we agree that reforms are needed at TSA, we should all \nagree that they should have all the information they need to do their \njobs. It is critical that our intelligence and security agencies are \nsharing information with each other because they have the same \nmission--keeping the American people safe.\n  This motion to recommit simply states that the Director of National \nIntelligence must provide all information on new and changing terrorist \nthreats and the updated terrorist watch list information to TSA and to \nanybody else in the government that needs to have it.\n  In addition, to improve information sharing, I think everybody in \nthis Chamber knows that we must address cybersecurity. Cyber attacks \nare becoming a routine event in the United States today, and it demands \nan immediate response and investigation. Americans deserve the peace of \nmind in knowing that their personal information is secure and not \nvulnerable to hacking by cyber criminals, yet there is a growing list \nof recent incidents that continues to put the privacy of everyday \nAmericans, our constituents, at risk.\n  The recent breach of over 4 million records of Federal employees at \nthe Office of Personnel Management and a hack of 80 million records at \nAnthem Health Insurance and CareFirst BlueCross BlueShield are just a \nfew of the prominent examples of this growing threat. And who is paying \nthe price? Working families.\n  For each cyber attack that you read about in the newspapers, there \nare many more that are going unreported or, worse, undetected. In fact, \nsome security experts are concerned that China is now building a \nmassive database with the personal information of many, many American \ncitizens.\n  Furthermore, American companies are increasingly becoming targets of \ncyber attacks. With a recent report estimating that this is costing our \neconomy more than $445 billion, we simply cannot wait any longer to \nprotect the privacy of everyday Americans from hackers and cyber \ncriminals in Russia and China.\n  This motion to recommit simply requires the Director of National \nIntelligence to prioritize efforts to uncover and foil attempts to \nsteal the private, personal information of Americans. This is the least \nwe can do to respond to the attacks on the privacy of the American \npeople. Let's show the American people that Congress is listening.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The time of the gentlewoman has expired.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, I rise to oppose the motion.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The gentleman from California is recognized \nfor 5 minutes.\n  Mr. NUNES. Mr. Speaker, this motion to recommit is nothing more than \na poison pill designed to destroy the hard work that has gone into \ncrafting this legislation.\n  This bill already does exactly what the motion to recommit proposes. \nIt helps the Federal Government, including the patriotic men and women \nof our intelligence community, address the critical national security \nissues facing this country. As anyone who worked on it in the committee \nor took the time to come down and read the annex knows, this bill \nalready funds intelligence community personnel who protect our \nnetworks.\n  While we stand here, the intelligence community is wrestling with \nsome of the greatest national security threats in our country's \nhistory. I urge my colleagues to vote ``no'' on the motion to recommit \nand ``yes'' on final passage.\n  I yield back the balance of my time.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Without objection, the previous question is \nordered on the motion to recommit.\n  There was no objection.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. The question is on the motion to recommit.\n  The question was taken; and the Speaker pro tempore announced that \nthe noes appeared to have it.\n\n\n                             Recorded Vote\n\n  Mrs. DINGELL. Mr. Speaker, I demand a recorded vote.\n  A recorded vote was ordered.\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore.

During her 25 years in the department, she has \nbeen a pioneer and role model.\n\n[[Page H4422]]\n\n  Captain Benson served on the technical rescue team, a highly \nspecialized crew responsible for conducting swift water, extrication, \nand rope rescues. She has been a reliable leader in the department who \ninitiated numerous peer fitness programs and also served as a member of \nthe Tucson Fire Honor Guard. She has been highly involved in Camp Fury \nand the cadet program, serving as a mentor to Tucson youth and opening \ndoors to nontraditional careers, such as firefighting, for girls.\n  No doubt, Captain Benson's positive impact on the department and \nlegacy of excellence lasting over two decades will be lasting. I wish \nher all the best in her upcoming retirement.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n               OFFICE OF PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT DATA BREACH\n\n  (Mr. LANGEVIN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LANGEVIN. Madam Speaker, in the past 2 weeks, we have learned \nthat the data millions of Americans entrusted to the Office of \nPersonnel Management have been taken as a result of a cybersecurity \nbreach.\n  It did not have to happen this way. Since 2007, OPM's inspector \ngeneral has documented repeated deficiencies in information security \npractices. Yet OPM's response has been glacial, and its systems remain \nantiquated. It was only after a security breach last year that OPM \nfinally, in its 2016 budget request, asked for additional funds for the \nOffice of Chief Information Officer. Well, it is about time.\n  The question we need to ask, though, is: Why did OPM underinvest in \ncybersecurity before that breach happened? While I would hope that we \nfind a definitive answer during oversight hearings, there is one thing \nthat certainly contributed to the problem. There was no one in charge \nof cybersecurity with both policy and budgetary authorities to compel \naction.\n  Even as we rely on agencies to be primarily responsible for \nprotecting their networks, we lack a Federal cyber coordinator with \nbudgetary authority to review agency spending and security plans. My \nExecutive Cyberspace Coordination Act would remedy this by providing \nfor a Senate-confirmed independent officer with the power to compel \nagency action.\n  Let's get this done.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n              CONGRATS TO CHANHASSEN HIGH SCHOOL BASEBALL\n\n  (Mr. PAULSEN asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. PAULSEN. Madam Speaker, I rise today to congratulate the \nChanhassen High School baseball team on winning the Minnesota State \ntitle last week with a 2-0 championship game victory.\n  The Storm rode the arm of Jack Schnettler in the finals as the senior \ntossed a complete game shutout to clinch the second State athletic \ntitle in the school's short history.\n  Chanhassen's two runs came courtesy of a Ty Denzer single in the \nthird inning. In addition, fine work with the glove behind the Storm \nace helped hold their opponents from Lakeville North at bay.\n  Madam Speaker, baseball is a game of skill and mental toughness, and \nit is clear that the players from Chanhassen have both. In addition to \nthe time spent on the practice field, student athletes have to balance \ntheir work in the classroom and any family responsibilities they have \nas well. Their dedication and commitment is commendable.\n  Congratulations to the Chanhassen baseball team on their State title.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                              {time}  1800\n                       WORLD WAR II HONOR FLIGHT\n\n  (Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico asked and was given \npermission to address the House for 1 minute and to revise and extend \nher remarks.)\n  Ms. MICHELLE LUJAN GRISHAM of New Mexico.

They came to visit the \nmemorials, their memorials, that are dedicated to honor their service \nand sacrifices.\n  We have about 5,000 World War II veterans in New Mexico, and I \nappreciate the efforts of the Williamson Foundation in supporting the \nveterans by organizing this week's Honor Flight.\n  While I am sure each veteran appreciated the opportunity to visit the \nmemorials, I know many of them were just as impressed with the \ngratitude expressed by their fellow New Mexicans for their service. \nHuge crowds greeted them at the airport in Albuquerque. One veteran \nsaid he had never received a thank you before this trip.\n  New Mexicans played pivotal roles and sacrificed a lot during the war \nin Europe, north Africa, and the Pacific.\n  We must never forget what these and all veterans have done for our \ngreat Nation. I thank them for their service.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-4", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n ACKNOWLEDGING THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF 2012 DEFERRED ACTION FOR CHILDHOOD \n                            ARRIVALS PROGRAM\n\n  (Mr. VEASEY asked and was given permission to address the House for 1 \nminute.)\n  Mr. VEASEY. Madam Speaker, I rise today to acknowledge the third \nanniversary of President Obama's 2012 Deferred Action for Childhood \nArrivals program, commonly known as DACA.\n  While the Nation desperately waits for House Republicans to move \nforward on immigration reform, the DACA program has provided temporary \nrelief for hundreds of thousands of families to continue their studies \nand contribute to our economy. Since its enactment, more than 750,000 \nyoung people, including 88,000 Texans, have successfully applied for \nDACA.\n  Although I am disappointed with the recent court actions delaying \nPresident Obama's expansion of the DACA program, I remain hopeful that \nmillions more immigrant families will one day be able to fully \ncontribute to the prosperity of our country.\n  That is why, in my home district in the Dallas-Fort Worth metroplex, \nI will host a DACA-DAPA informational forum with Congressman Luis \nGutierrez on July 18 to help TX-33 residents prepare for immigration \nrelief.\n  While President Obama's efforts to expand DACA and initiate DAPA \nprograms are temporarily stalled in the courts, I am committed to \nfighting for immigrant families nationwide, so they can come out of the \nshadows and live the American Dream.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-5", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4422]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n          BETTER FUNDING AND SUPPORT FOR ALZHEIMER'S RESEARCH\n\n  (Mrs. LAWRENCE asked and was given permission to address the House \nfor 1 minute.)\n  Mrs. LAWRENCE. Madam Speaker, I stand here today to join my \ncolleagues in a bipartisan call for action for better funding and \nsupport for Alzheimer's research. The Alzheimer's Association of \nGreater Michigan, which is headquartered in my district, the 14th \nCongressional District of Michigan, supports more than 140,000 people \nand their families.\n  According to the Banner Alzheimer Institute, those numbers are going \nto increase unless treatments or cures are developed. The institute \nestimates the number of people 65 and older with Alzheimer's will \nnearly triple to 13.8 million, and the U.S. healthcare costs for \nAlzheimer's will skyrocket to $1.1 trillion per year, with more than \n$700 million coming out of Medicare and Medicaid.\n  It is time to treat Alzheimer's as the healthcare disaster that it \nhas become. It is time to take this epidemic seriously. It is time to \nguard against the threat it poses to our families, our districts, \nhealthcare system, and our Nation.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4422-6", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4422-H4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 CHICAGO BLACKHAWKS STANLEY CUP DYNASTY\n\n  (Mr. LIPINSKI asked and was given permission to address the House for \n1 minute and to revise and extend his remarks.)\n  Mr. LIPINSKI.

Madam Speaker, this afternoon, House Republican leaders \nused a trick to pass a new rule to revote the job-outsourcing, unfair, \nfast-track Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. They buried the revote \nin the intelligence authorization.\n  Well, the Republican leadership wants to buy itself another month to \nmake deals, trading favors and funding pet projects in this district or \nthat district, in exchange for a vote against the best interests of the \nAmerican people, jobs in America with good wages.\n  Imagine Congress fast-tracking a bill to repair our roads, bridges, \nand harbors all across this country. Imagine a bill to be fast-tracked \nto renew the powers of the Export-Import Bank that actually increases \nexports and jobs in this country.\n  Instead, fast track is being rammed through Congress with House \nRepublican leaders bending the rules and breaking regular order. \nIntelligence authorization bills should not be another name for secret \nfast-track life support.\n  No more delays. It is overtime for Congress to move on from fast \ntrack to a real fair trade deal that creates jobs and good wages in \nAmerica for a change.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4423-2", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4423]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                        A TALE OF TWO ECONOMIES\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from Colorado (Mr. Tipton) is recognized \nfor 60 minutes as the designee of the majority leader.\n  Mr. TIPTON. Madam Speaker, across our country, we are seeing a tale \nof two economies, to where there are pockets of prosperity, but \nunfortunately, through many of our rural communities, we continue to \nsee challenges.\n  For the first time since we have been keeping records, we are seeing \nmore small businesses shut down than there are now business startups. \nBusinesses across this country are suffering under the burden of $2 \ntrillion--$2 trillion--in regulatory costs.\n  Why is this important? It is because we are seeing now the cost of a \nloaf of bread, the clothes that we buy for our children to be able to \ngo back to school, and that gallon of milk costs more via taxation by \nregulation that is impacting our ability to create jobs.\n  When we move into my district in Colorado, composed of rural \ncommunities, 29 counties of Colorado's 64, 54,000 miles of the State of \nColorado, many of our counties are still suffering in double-digit \nunemployment when it comes down to the real number.\n  Two counties that I would like to be able to address specifically \nthis evening are being specifically challenged, Moffat County and Rio \nBlanco County, on the west slope of Colorado, one of the most beautiful \nplaces that anyone can visit.\n  Residing there and creating jobs is something called the Colowyo \nMine, a coal mine. We encourage people to be able to come and see a \ncoal mine with good technology, providing affordable electricity, \nproviding jobs, and providing also clear blue skies with that \ntechnology. Those are currently being challenged.\n  There was a court ruling recently that came out, one that was in \nresponse to a suit that was brought by an extreme environmental group \nthat challenged the 2007 issuance of the Office of Surface Mining \npermit for the Colowyo Mine to be able to operate.\n  That is challenging now 200 jobs because the court has ruled that a \nnew NEPA process, a supplemental process, must be performed within 120 \ndays, an extremely short period of time.\n  Those 200 families, 200 families that are relying on that job to be \nable to provide for their children, to be able to support that \ncommunity, are now feeling threatened by policies not only in terms of \nthe NEPA process, but now by the ruling of the Court as well in \nresponse to a suit filed by this extreme environmental group.\n  Here is the real challenge that we face. We need the Secretary of the \nInterior to respond. These families' jobs cannot wait. Being able to \nput food on the table for their children cannot wait for this process \nto be able to play out.\n  We encourage the Secretary to deploy all necessary resources to be \nable to respond to that emergency NEPA process, to be able to get it \ndone in that 120-day period of time, or to be able to also look at the \npropriety of challenging that ruling by going in and filing an appeal.\n  Are jobs and the economy important? They certainly are in my \ndistrict. Those families that are relying on good-paying coal jobs, \nfamilies that love where they live, love their environment, and support \ntheir community are now seeing their livelihoods, their future being \nchallenged.\n  We encourage the Secretary, on behalf of American families, families \nin my district that are struggling to be able to succeed or to just be \nable to provide for themselves, to be able to respond in a timely \nmanner, to be able to address this so that we can secure those jobs and \nsecure affordable electricity as well.\n  Coal is often maligned, but we see that it can be done right--Craig, \nColorado, blue skies and a coal-fired power plant. There is an \nopportunity for us to be able to create a win-win.\n  If you care about senior citizens that are on fixed incomes, if you \ncare about young families right now that are struggling to be able to \npay the bills and to be able to provide for their young children, we \nare seeing that taxation via regulation coming out of policy.\n  I think it is very important that we preserve the jobs. Let's work \nwith all of the above. That has been embraced in my district. We have \nseen the opportunity to be able to create hydroelectric power, wind, \nsolar, geothermal, also to responsibly develop oil, gas, oil shale, and \ncoal.\n  Right now, the problem for the people in the Third District, \nspecifically in Rio Blanco and Moffat Counties, is urgent. They are \nfamilies that I have talked to. I have looked in their eyes. They will \ndo it responsibly. They want to be able to do it well, not only for the \ncommunity, but for their families as well.\n  It is very important that we are also mindful that those jobs impact \nothers. These are the families that support the local grocery store, \nthe local hardware store; these are the families that provide for the \nhealth of that community.\n  Madam Speaker, we would call upon the Secretary of the Interior to \nrespond to American families whose jobs are currently being threatened, \ndeploy the necessary resources to be able to carry out that \nsupplemental NEPA, get the job done in time to protect those jobs.\n  If that isn't possible, then go ahead and explore that proprietary \nnotion of filing an appeal, to make sure that we get a stay and keep \nthose jobs moving, because the message that my folks out of Craig, out \nof Rio Blanco County want to be able to communicate is their bills \nwon't stop. Their children's needs will not be met unless we see a \nresponse out of the Department of the Interior to be able to stand up \nfor good-paying coal jobs in western Colorado.\n  Madam Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4423-3", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Pages H4423-H4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n                 ALZHEIMER'S AND BRAIN AWARENESS MONTH\n\n  The SPEAKER pro tempore. Under the Speaker's announced policy of \nJanuary 6, 2015, the gentleman from California (Mr. Garamendi) is \nrecognized for 60 minutes as the designee of the minority leader.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Madam Speaker, for the next hour, we will be talking \nabout an issue that really confronts every American family, an issue \nthat\n\n[[Page H4424]]\n\nhas brought devastation, fear, and sadness to virtually every family in \nthis Nation.\n  We are going to talk about dementia and Alzheimer's. We are going to \ntalk about the way in which it literally tears families apart as their \nloved one's mind, recollections, and ability to handle their own \naffairs seems to dissipate.\n\n                              {time}  1815\n\n  This is an issue that currently confronts around 5 million Americans \nand their families. This is an issue that will grow exponentially over \nthe next 25 to 30 years to the point where maybe 16 million American \nfamilies are going to be affected by it.\n  It is also an issue that we can deal with. It is an issue that we can \nsee the cost. Let me put up this chart here, and we will talk about the \ncost of Alzheimer's quickly.\n  It is a crisis that is growing rapidly, and it is resulting in \nextraordinary cost increases. If you look at 2015, on Medicare and \nMedicaid programs, the Federal Government will spend $153 billion on \nAlzheimer's. In 2020, it will grow to $182 billion. And then it is \nanticipated--as one of our colleagues spoke during a 1-minute speech--\nthat by 2050, it will grow to over $1 trillion. This is an issue for \nthe Federal Government. It is an issue for every family.\n  Let me put up another little chart here that really displays what an \ninvestment by the American people can do. If you take a look at the \nreasons why people die most commonly in the United States--breast \ncancer, prostate cancer, heart disease, stroke, HIV--you will notice \nthat in every one of these, we have seen a decline in the mortality \nfrom these illnesses.\n  Breast cancer declining just marginally. Prostate cancer, a \nsignificant decline of around 11 percent. Heart disease declined by 14 \npercent; stroke by 21; and HIV, while still prevalent and still common, \nthe death rate is down by more than 50 percent.\n  This one over here is Alzheimer's disease; a 71 percent increase in \nthe number of deaths due to Alzheimer's.\n  My mother-in-law is in this statistic. She spent the last 2 years of \nher life living with my wife, Patty, and I in our home. We cared for \nher at night. We, fortunately, were able to have someone come in to \nhelp us during the day. And that is really the story of most \nAlzheimer's now. You are either in a nursing home or you are cared for \nin the home.\n  So among those 5 million out there, there are families, like mine, \nthat are caring as best they can in a very difficult situation. Ours, \nfortunately, was not so difficult. But, nonetheless, after two-plus \nyears, my mother-in-law did die.\n  So what can we do about it?\n  I want to put up one more chart here, and then I want to turn to my \ncolleagues. If you will remember on that chart I just put up, death \nrates are declining for cancer. There is a reason. And the reason is \nthe annual expenditure for cancer research has been just under $5.5 \nbillion for the last few years. For HIV/AIDS, nearly $3 billion of \nresearch annually. Cardiovascular, heart disease, over $2 billion.\n  Alzheimer's, while the death rate climbs, we are spending just over \n$566 million--not billion, million. So we shouldn't be surprised when \nwe see this: declines in the cancer rates, deaths from cancer, stroke, \nheart disease, HIV. And then Alzheimer's.\n  Mr. Speaker, $1 trillion will be spent in just 25 years on dealing \nwith Alzheimer's, and some 16 million Americans will have that illness.\n  Now there is good news. The good news just happened today, and I want \nto commend my Republican colleague Tom Cole from Oklahoma, chairman of \nthe Appropriations Health and Human Services Subcommittee, who moved to \nincrease Alzheimer's research from $566 million to almost $900 million.\n  Go for it, Tom. You are the chairman of that subcommittee, and you \nare doing the right thing. You are doing the right thing by 5 million \nAmericans who suffer from Alzheimer's today, and you are doing the \nright thing for their families.\n  And I think House has the opportunity also to stand with Tom Cole and \nto do the right thing by Americans, and that is, increase this research \nfunding.\n  There are breakthroughs that are coming. If you read the articles, if \nyou read the scientific journals, we are coming to an understanding of \nthis very, very difficult disease for which there is no early \ndetection, for which there is no cure, and for which there is only one \nexit, and that is death. So we can deal with this.\n  The 535 of us, the Representatives of those 5 million Americans with \nAlzheimer's and their families, we can do something. We can increase \nthe funding for research.\n  Tonight I am joined by several of my colleagues.\n  I yield to the gentlewoman from California (Ms. Maxine Waters) who \ncarried legislation on this for years. She has been the co-chair of the \nAlzheimer's Caucus. If she will join us and share with us her work and \nwhat is happening from her perspective.\n  Ms. MAXINE WATERS of California. Thank you so very much.\n  Madam Speaker, I would like to thank my friend and colleague from \nCalifornia, Congressman John Garamendi, for yielding, and I commend him \nfor organizing this Special Order on Alzheimer's disease in honor of \nthe month of June, which is Alzheimer's and Brain Awareness Month.\n  As the co-chair of the Congressional Task Force on Alzheimer's \nDisease, I know how devastating this disease can be for our patients, \nfamilies, and caregivers. I am proud to lead the task force along with \nmy co-chairs, Congressman Chris Smith, Congressman Michael Burgess, and \nCongressman Chaka Fattah.\n  Alzheimer's is a tragic disease which has no effective treatment, no \nmeans of prevention, and no method for slowing progression of the \ndisease. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 5 \nmillion Americans were living with Alzheimer's disease in 2013. This \nnumber is expected to almost triple to 14 million by the year 2050.\n  The bipartisan supported National Plan to Address Alzheimer's Disease \ncalls for a cure or an effective treatment for Alzheimer's by the year \n2025. Reaching this goal will require a significant increase in Federal \nfunding for Alzheimer's research.\n  I, therefore, introduced H.R. 237, a bipartisan resolution which \ncalls for a significant increase in Alzheimer's research funding and \ndeclares that achieving the primary goal of the national plan--to \nprevent and effectively treat Alzheimer's by 2025--is an urgent \nnational priority. A similar resolution was introduced in the Senate by \nSenator Susan Collins of Maine.\n\n  I also circulated a letter to the House Appropriations Labor, Health \nand Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies Subcommittee \nrequesting robust funding for Alzheimer's research at the National \nInstitutes of Health in the coming fiscal year. The letter was signed \nby a bipartisan group of 63 Members of Congress. I was pleased to learn \nthat the subcommittee recently proposed a $300 million increase for \nAlzheimer's research.\n  As we pursue the goals of a cure for Alzheimer's, we must also do \neverything we can to assist the patients, families, and caregivers who \nare living with Alzheimer's every day. That is why I am introducing \nAlzheimer's Action Now, a set of bills that together will help \nAlzheimer's patients and their families; promote public awareness; and \nencourage voluntary contributions to research efforts. The various \nbills in the Alzheimer's Action Now address different challenges \npresented by Alzheimer's disease.\n  The Alzheimer's Caregiver Support Act authorizes grants to public and \nnonprofit organizations to expand training and support services for \nfamilies and caregivers of Alzheimer's patients. With the majority of \nAlzheimer's patients living at home, under the care of family and \nfriends, it is important that we ensure these caregivers have access to \nthe training and resources they need to provide effective, \ncompassionate care.\n  The Missing Alzheimer's Disease Patient Alert Program Reauthorization \nAct reauthorizes a Department of Justice program. It helps local \ncommunities and law enforcement officials quickly identify persons with \nAlzheimer's disease who wander away from their homes and reunite them \nwith their families. This program saves law enforcement officials \nvaluable time and allows them to focus on other security concerns. It \nalso reduces injuries and deaths among Alzheimer's patients, and it \nbrings peace of mind to their families.\n\n[[Page H4425]]\n\n  Finally, the Alzheimer's Disease Semipostal Stamp Act requires the \nU.S. Postal Service to issue and sell a semipostal stamp, with the \nproceeds helping to fund Alzheimer's research at NIH. This bill will \nraise public awareness and encourage concerned individuals to get \ninvolved and to make voluntary contributions to Alzheimer's research \nefforts. The bill is modeled on the popular and successful Breast \nCancer Research semipostal stamp.\n  Our Nation is at a crucial and critical crossroads. The situation \nrequires decisive action to search for a cure and protect the millions \nof Americans currently living with Alzheimer's disease. Together, we \nmust take every possible action to improve treatments for Alzheimer's \npatients, support caregivers, raise public awareness, and invest in \nresearch to find a cure for this dreadful disease.\n  Once again, I can't say enough to thank John Garamendi, my colleague \nfrom California, with whom I have worked for many, many years, for, \nagain, organizing yet another night's Special Order to bring attention \nto Alzheimer's disease.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I thank the gentlewoman from California who has been a \nleader in this disease and dealing with the problems of it for many, \nmany years. And your work Ms. Waters is paying off. The work that you \nhave done organizing us, Members of Congress, to petition the \nsubcommittee paid off--a 50 percent increase, a 50 percent increase, \nand I think it has got a good chance of staying in. This is really \nreally good news and the rest of the legislation piece by piece we are \ngoing to get at this.\n  I would like now to turn the time over to our colleague from New York \nBrian Higgins. We have spoken on this issue before. Mr. Higgins, thank \nyou so very much. If you will share your thoughts with us on this \ndisease and what we might do to deal with it.\n  Mr. HIGGINS. I thank the gentleman from California and thank you for \nyour leadership on this and so many issues that are of critical \nimportance to our Nation and our future.\n  June is Alzheimer's Brain and Awareness month. It is the sixth-\nleading cause of death in this country. Over 5.3 million Americans are \nafflicted with Alzheimer's. By 2050, this number is expected to \nincrease to 16 million. In my western New York community alone, 55,000 \npeople have Alzheimer's or related dementia, and 165,000 people in our \ncommunity are impacted directly or indirectly. Alzheimer's will cost \nthe Nation $226 billion this year. By the year 2050, these costs will \nrise to as high as $1.1 trillion. Last year, Congress passed a law, the \nAlzheimer's Accountability Act, which created a bypass budget for \nAlzheimer's research. This will allow the National Institutes of Health \nto prepare a budget that will reach the estimated goal of funding \neffective prevention and treatment for Alzheimer's by 2025.\n  This year, I introduced with my colleagues Rosa DeLauro and Peter \nKing the Accelerating Biomedical Research Act. Over the next 6 years, \nour legislation would provide an additional $50 billion in funding to \nthe National Institutes of Health above what is currently budgeted. We \nalso established the House NIH Caucus to rally Members to develop a \nplan to increase the purchasing power of NIH.\n\n                              {time}  1830\n\n  Mr. Speaker, Congress should also pass the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, \nthe Advancing Research for Neurological Diseases Act.\n  Mr. Garamendi, again, thank you for your leadership. We obviously, as \na Congress, have a long way to go. The origins of Alzheimer's disease \nare unknown, but its ends are absolutely certain, and it ends in losing \nyour cognitive ability, your dignity, and then it takes your life. It \nis time that Congress, in a bipartisan effort, provide robust funding \nto Alzheimer's research to end this terrible, terrible disease for \nfuture generations.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Higgins, thank you so very much. Your points are \nabsolutely on target.\n  This little chart here points out much of what you and Ms. Waters \nwere talking about, and that is the extraordinary expense. This is \n2015. And we expect to spend $153 billion of Federal tax money, \nMedicare and Medicaid, on treating Alzheimer's. Way over, that little \ntiny purple spot, is the $566 million of research. It would be a little \nbigger if we were able to get that 300, but it is still going to pale \nin comparison to this. This is 261 times more money spent on treatment, \nwhich ultimately just enables the passage of time and leads to death \nbecause there is no effective treatment today. That is what we are \nspending on caring for people.\n  That number down there, and the efforts and the bills that have been \nintroduced and the Alzheimer's Foundation and others that are working \non this have an opportunity to change this entire dynamic around \nbecause we can find the solution to this.\n  I would like now to turn to my colleague, as part of what we often do \nhere, we call it the ``East-West Show,'' my colleague from the great \nState of New York, Paul Tonko.\n  Mr. TONKO. Thank you, Representative Garamendi, for bringing us \ntogether in this very Special Order as we discuss the impact of \nAlzheimer's upon the quality of life not only of the individual living \nwith the disease, but on family members and loved ones that surround \nthat individual. So much of the work that we do in this House, so much \nof the work done on the Hill here in Washington, needs to be guided by \nthe moral compass.\n  Our budget priorities should reflect who we are as a people and the \ncompassion that is required as we see these numbers continually grow--\nballoon--in terms of an impact on the budget. And that should challenge \nus to do all that we can to be not only compassionate, but to be \neffective when it comes to the fiscal impact of what is happening to \nfar too many families across this country.\n  It is a known fact now that Alzheimer's is the most expensive disease \nin America. That should strike home. That should call upon our hearts \nand our minds to respond with dignity and with effectiveness to the \ngiven issue at hand. Our efforts for Alzheimer's need to be enhanced. \nThere is no mistaking it. This is the most expensive disease in \nAmerica. It is impacting the budget here in Washington. Our national \nnumbers are a challenge, and we need to address the budget not only in \nsound strategy for the present moment, but with preventative elements \nbrought to bear.\n  So when we look at the most recent data--and those data are very \ntelling--for 2014, the calendar year of 2014, the numbers are there, \nand it will remind us that $214 billion was the need, the drawdown, for \nspeaking to Alzheimer's, responding to the Alzheimer's situation. That \nis a large number that is only projected to grow exponentially. As more \nand more baby boomers ascend the age ladder, climb that ladder, we \nshould only anticipate that doing what we are doing is not going to be \nenough, that research needs to take hold here.\n  We have the intellectual capacity as a nation. We have resources at \nour fingertips, and the priority here for providing the preventative \nelements of research are important. The President has offered an \ninitiative with the study of the mind, the brain, that can provide \nseveral opportunities. It can release the information, the \ndocumentation, that is required to move forward to find a cure for this \never-growing disease.\n  Look at the stats. Representative Garamendi, when we look at the \nresearch moneys, for every $100 invested in those individuals and \nfamilies that are impacted by Alzheimer's, 25 cents is spent on \nresearch--for every $100, 25 cents. That is a very minute amount of \ninvestment, investment that has an anticipated lucrative return, paying \ndividends for all of us to address a cure, a hope for individuals. This \ncountry requires our government to respond in full fashion so that \npublic-private partnerships in research institutes like the NIH, the \nNational Institutes of Health, are funded appropriately. Accordingly, \nwith the data that have been assembled, knowing what needs to be done, \nwe should go forward with those efforts.\n  Now, I am reminded, Representative Garamendi, routinely by families--\nand many women will draw that perspective for me, that of those who are \nliving with Alzheimer's in this country, two-thirds--two-thirds--of the \nindividuals living with Alzheimer's, or 3.2 million people, are women. \nThis disease is\n\n[[Page H4426]]\n\nimpacting women in a disproportionate measure.\n  It is extracting from us all sorts of voluntary efforts that are \nrequired. Volunteers are responding as unpaid caregivers. We know the \nstats. The data are compelling: 15.5 million volunteers, caregivers, \nproviding unpaid services, unpaid care, equaling 17.7 billion hours. \nThese are staggering numbers, 15.5 million providing 17.7 billion. That \namasses to $220.2 billion in terms of services provided, unpaid \nservices provided.\n  So it is not only costing the Federal Government money, projected to \nballoon heavily, but it is also extracting $220 billion worth of unpaid \nservices that are provided to individuals by loved ones, by those \nconcerned in their community, for the struggles that these individuals \nand their family members are facing. So this behooves us to do much \nbetter than we are doing.\n  We are a compassionate society. We are unique. We have opportunities \ngalore. I know what can happen. I have talked to our team in my \ndistrict. Beth and the team from Alzheimer's Association of Northeast \nNew York, they have done a tremendous job. I see what they do for \nrespite care and what they are doing for services with the Alzheimer's \nCafe, where people gather and cluster. They are given music therapy. \nThere is an enhanced quality of life. It is with dignity that we \nrespond. But more needs to be done, and there has to be that element \nthat is provided out there that is speaking to prevention, that is \nspeaking to a cure.\n\n  So, Representative Garamendi, there is much to be done.\n  I was lead Democrat on the Alzheimer's Accountability Act, which \nresponded to the planning requirements that were earlier set up \nstatutorily in this country. That act, the Alzheimer's Accountability \nAct, that passed successfully in both Houses and was signed into law by \nthe President, requires that a professional judgment budget be put \ntogether. As was stated earlier on the floor, until 2025, there needs \nto be this commitment made for research for Alzheimer's and related \ndiseases.\n  But we furthered the quality of that legislation, of that statute, by \nrequiring professionals to project the numbers that are needed. That is \na very important element. Clinicians and professionals in the medical \ncommunity will tell us, they will advise what that number ought to be. \nThat is speaking with integrity, with the veracity that is required, \nwith the dignity, and with the compassion that is so much required for \nthe Alzheimer's community.\n  So again, I thank you, Representative Garamendi, for having that \nheart, for leading us in this Special Order so as to comprehend what we \nneed to do here, to move that moral compass, to be there for those \nindividuals, to be there for those unpaid caregivers, and to be there \nfor the research community, but most importantly, to be there for the \nsoul that is struggling with Alzheimer's or dementia-related diseases. \nWe are at our best when we connect emotionally so that we can put \ntogether the programmatic response and the intellectual response that \nenable us to provide that light at the end of the tunnel which is so \nimportant and so meaningful to the families that endure.\n  I thank you, Representative Garamendi.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, for more than 4 years now, you and I have \nstood on the floor on Special Order hour to talk about Make It In \nAmerica, about the manufacturing system and about the jobs that we need \nto build, transportation infrastructure, and your passion for those \nsubjects was so obvious. Your passion and your determination to deal \nwith Alzheimer's and to find a cure, to find an understanding of what \nit is and how it affects the brain, and then also to reach out to the \nfamilies that are caring for their loved ones really exceeds and \nmirrors the passion that you have for the working men and women of this \nNation. I thank you.\n  Mr. Speaker, I also want to thank the Alzheimer's Association. They \norganized a lobbying group through here very recently. They were \nwearing their purple ribbons, and they brought to us the stories, the \nindividual stories that were of their families. I know that as I talked \nto my colleagues here on the floor and over in the Senate, I get the \nsame thing from them: Yes, my mother, my aunt, my sister, my brother, \nthey too have suffered from Alzheimer's, and they recently died, or \nthey are in very serious condition.\n  So we find this illness touching every family. I have yet to find a \nfamily that I have talked to about Alzheimer's that didn't nod their \nhead in understanding: Yes, we know what it is.\n  What Americans don't know is the information that you and my \ncolleagues, Maxine Waters and Brian Higgins, brought to the floor \ntoday, and that is the facts, not only the impact that Alzheimer's has \non the Federal budget--Medicare and Medicaid--the impact that it has on \nfamily budgets, on insurance, private insurance, but the impact that it \nhas on families. You have made that clear.\n  I think that the work that has been done by Alzheimer's Association \nand related organizations--Medicare, Social Security, and support \ngroups all across this Nation--is having an impact. When a budget for \nany specific program is increased by 50 percent in this era of \nsequestration, something has had an impact. Mr. Cole, as chairman of \nthat, and Ms. Waters, as the chairperson or the vice chair, co-chair of \nthe Working Group on Alzheimer's, are having an impact.\n  We can find a solution here. We can understand. We can do the early \ndiagnosis. It is pretty clear there are some breakthroughs that are \noccurring.\n\n                              {time}  1845\n\n  There are certain drugs out there that seem to work if you can \nintervene early in the process. What a change that would be. What a \nchange that would be for all families.\n  This is not just an issue of Alzheimer's, this is an issue of the \nbrain. We have got the U.S. military, the Department of Defense, doing \nsignificant research on brain injuries, brain trauma, and illnesses \nresulting from the wars--from traumatic brain syndrome and related.\n  So if we pool together and we actually put into the Defense \nAuthorization Act a paragraph that said: Research done by the \nDepartment of Defense on the brain, brain injuries, a way in which the \nbrain works or doesn't work, they need to take that research and couple \nit with research that is taking place on dementia, on other kinds of \nneurological diseases, including Alzheimer's, and if we can pool all of \nthese various research programs together and get them to share the \ninformation to fertilize each other's research, I think we are going to \nsucceed.\n  That 2025 goal I think is too far out there. I see we are on the cusp \nof a breakthrough. And if we can push all of the research and focus it \nand, like a dart, hit the center of the target, I think we are going to \nbe successful.\n  Mr. Tonko, would you like to join in here?\n  Mr. TONKO. Absolutely.\n  Representative Garamendi, it only takes one visit, but there have \nbeen many visits that I have made to the centers, the day care center \noperations that are conducted for individuals and families who are \nliving with Alzheimer's, and to witness and hear the hurt, the \nconfusion, the pain that surrounds the individual. It is enough \nchallenge to try and get this done in as quick a fashion as possible.\n  But if that doesn't move us, the economics on this. You know, we \nearlier talked about the $214 billion impact in 1 year--some of our \nmost recent data. Well, that is 1 in every 5 Medicare dollars. How much \nare we willing to have that take over the Medicare expenditures before \nwe come to our senses to say, let's do more in research, let's do a \npreventive response? Does it need to grow that much more? Does the \ndrain on Medicare, does the reflection of Alzheimer's-related Medicare \nexpenditures need to be that much greater to bring us to a response? \nThe challenges are there, the data are there. We need to move \naccordingly.\n  Now, earlier, I had expressed that two-thirds of the people living \nwith Alzheimer's, the 3.2 million people, happen to be women. Well, 60 \npercent of the unpaid caregivers happen to be women. So there needs to \nbe a response here to enable people to be addressed with a sense of \ncompassion, with dignity brought into the equation. It is absolutely \nessential.\n  And when we talk about those caregivers and the $220.2 billion that \nis the calculation for the volunteerism they offer as caregivers, of \nthat community of caregivers, they have been worn\n\n[[Page H4427]]\n\ndown physically. So the price tag for them is an additional $9.3 \nbillion in terms of response to their physical health care needs. This \nis a drain on families, on loved ones. It is an undignified outcome for \nfar too many Alzheimer's patients who require our support, who have \nearned the respect of this body and Congress moving to provide for \nresearch opportunities.\n  Now, one other effort that I am making now in the aftermath of the \nAlzheimer's Accountability Act, that victory being behind us now, I \nhave now served as the lead Democrat on the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act, \nwhich would authorize Medicare investment in sound planning upon \ndiagnosis of Alzheimer's so that individuals and their families who are \nso diagnosed can sit down and plan accordingly for their care, for \ntheir treatment, for their needs.\n  That is an important bit of quality that can be introduced for the \nindividual and her or his family so that their life, already severely \nimpacted by this outcome, can be as manageable as possible. And we are \nhopeful with some 183 cosponsors of a bipartisan nature who have come \nforward to say, Sign me up for the HOPE for Alzheimer's Act.\n  So isn't that what we are supposed to be? Aren't we those agents of \nhope? Do we walk away from this dilemma? Do we walk away from this \nneed? Do we walk away from the struggle, the pain, the hurt, the \nconfusion that people live with every waking hour of every day? Or do \nwe respond in that all-American fashion and say, yeah, we have the \nintellectual capacity as a Nation; yes, we have the resources.\n  It is an order of prioritization. And that priority here needs to be \na response, a full-fledged response, a compassionate response, a loving \nresponse coming from us as individuals and collectively as Congress to \nsay, yes, we support these efforts that are required, that are \npossible. Do not deny the possibilities. Let us go forward and be those \nsound decisionmakers who understand that this issue, when addressed \naccordingly, with human compassion offered, with the humanization of \nthis process, we are then offering a cost-effective outcome. A study of \nthe brain initiative that the President has advanced should be \nsupported.\n  These resources that are required for planning, for research, for \nservices, for respite need to be funded accordingly. It is within our \ngrasp, and it makes sense to do so.\n  So, Representative Garamendi, I thank you for leading us in this \nSpecial Order, which is absolutely key to public information exchange.\n  For those who may be viewing, I would suggest that you contact those \nof us who serve you in Washington and let us know that you want this to \nbe a priority. Tell us you believe in the research capacity of this \ncountry. Tell us you want to humanize that response, more deeply \nrespond to the individuals and families that are so impacted.\n  When we hit so many people, when we see the millions who are living \nwith this disease, we can't escape that impact falling upon us. \nNeighbors, family members, friends who we know are living with this \ndisease require our attention, require our responsiveness.\n  So I thank you for leading us in what is a very valuable discussion.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, thank you for your leadership. Thank you \nfor rounding up 180-plus Members of this House. On any issue that is \ntough, but then having them sign on to a piece of legislation that \nwould advance the care that individuals receive and the support that \nfamilies need.\n  The cure for Alzheimer's, all of those pieces of legislation, which \nMs. Waters talked about, those are all pieces of the puzzle. And they \ndeal with--I am going to end with just two charts, so it is really \nwhere I started. This is a different version of one of the charts that \ndeals with the costs that we are talking about. These are the total \ncost in the system. If you take a look at it, 2015, you are talking \nabout a quarter of a billion dollars, just under $226 billion, of which \nthe great majority is Medicare and Medicaid, and then out-of-pocket and \nother payers, or the other insurance companies. It will rise each year \nuntil we get to 2050, which is not that far away. Thirty-five years out \nwe will be well over $1 trillion, of which we will bust the bank, the \nMedicare.\n\n  There is a lot of discussion around here about the deficit. The real \nfactors in the deficit are this health care issue. That is where we are \ngoing to find the budget deficit.\n  But we have already seen through the Affordable Care Act that the \nprojected increases for Medicare have substantially reduced over the \nlast 4 years as the Affordable Care Act is providing early diagnosis of \nheart disease, diabetes, other kinds of long-term illnesses that are \nreally where most of the expense in Medicare and Medicaid occur. And if \nwe can get a grip on Alzheimer's, if we can find a way of delaying the \nonset of it, we are going to save tens and, indeed, hundreds of \nbillions of dollars over the passage of time.\n  And the next step is the cure. So they think, the researchers, think \nthey can find a way of delaying the onset. As they do that, they will \nalso find a way of dealing with the disease itself. Then this awesome \nand horrific expense will be reduced.\n  There is one other chart.\n  Mr. TONKO. Will the gentleman yield?\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. I yield to the gentleman from New York.\n  Mr. TONKO. That chart is very powerful. The trillions--with a T--will \nreally balloon our budget, and really it is undoable. It gets to a \nlevel where it will exhaust, it will overwhelm other areas of \ninvestment that are required.\n  But translate that from dollars into human suffering, pain, \nconfusion, reduced quality of life. That is a calculus that needs to be \nmade. If it is going to save us money and at the same time respond with \nthat moral compass, why are we not doing that, why are we not \nresponding?\n  So, to me, that is where we are at. When you see the unleashing of \ntechnology, of research, of the potential for progress to be made, it \nis there. It is documented from so many perspectives in work that is \ndone by the National Institutes of Health and others. For many, they \nwill say, well, leave it to the private sector. No, there is a track \nrecord up there for this country to have stepped up to the plate and \nmade a difference, for vaccines and other sought-for outcomes that \naffected people in a positive way. They gave them hope.\n  Our government has a track record of having stepped up and invested \nin research where perhaps the private sector wouldn't go or where we \nhave shaved some of the risk off of that demand for research in a \npublic-private partnership. So it is there within our potential. We \nshould not deny our loved ones, our constituents, our country the \nopportunity to advance the cause of research and to respond again with \na sense of hope for those who are living with this within this \ndarkness. We can and we must do better.\n  I am happy to work with individuals like Representative Garamendi to \npush to make a difference and to be there in a responsive manner, and I \nthank you.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, you continually come back to the compassion \nand caregiving that I think each human being has somewhere in them. For \nus here in Congress, it is to express that in a meaningful way. That \nmeaningful way is to make sure there is support for those families and \nindividuals who have Alzheimer's, those who are caring for them, to \nmake sure that the medical treatment, such as it is for this illness, \nis available, and to pursue vigorously the research that could and, I \nbelieve, will lead to a complete understanding of the illness. That is \nour task.\n  Mr. Tonko.\n  Mr. TONKO. And as we are concluding here, I was just bringing to mind \none of the Alzheimer's town halls that we are required to conduct, and \nit told me a few things: that this disease is percolating lower and \nlower into the age demographics.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Yes, it is.\n\n                              {time}  1900\n\n  Mr. TONKO. So it may be--I am just guessing here--that it is more \nthan just genetics. It may be environmental in its impact or cause. \nWhatever it is, let's go for that cause.\n  At one of these townhalls, a contemporary of mine whom I have known \nfor a long time, as I have known her husband for a long time, said: \n``My husband knows my voice, but he doesn't know my name.''\n  How do we not say ``yes'' to research? How do we not say we want to \ndo all that we can to make a difference?\n\n[[Page H4428]]\n\n  When we do so, we are going to save our budget. We are going to save \nour budget a great number of consequences by being that powerful force \nthat will do things academically, soundly, wisely, effectively, \nefficiently.\n  That is what this business is about, a thoughtful response, a \nheartfelt response that, by the way, is the budgetwise thing to do.\n  Let us respond as a government, as a nation.\n  Mr. GARAMENDI. Mr. Tonko, thank you so very much.\n  Mr. Speaker, I think we will end there and simply say that this is \nnot the last time that we will be speaking on this issue on the floor.\n  I would hope the next time that we speak on this issue that the House \nof Representatives will have increased the research budget by 50 \npercent, from $566 million to close to $900 million. That is a big \nleap. It is not sufficient. It is not what is necessary to really get \nat this disease, but this is one we can tackle. This is one we have to \ntackle for the strength of the American Government budget. It is one we \nhave to tackle.\n  This is where you have been with this entire discussion, Mr. Tonko. \nThis is about families. It is about individuals. It is about the \nsuffering, the angst, and the fear that exists out there with this \ndevastating disease. We can do this. We really can.\n  My message to the American people is one that you put out a few \nmoments ago, Mr. Tonko. That is, for anybody who is watching out there, \nfor anybody who is interested in the Federal deficit, for anybody who \nis interested in the quality of life of their families as they age and \neven before they age, talk to us.\n  Tell us that you want us to spend your tax money on solving this \nproblem, on the research that will lead to the solution for what is now \nan unsolvable mystery.\n  Mr. Speaker, I yield back the balance of my time.\n\n                          ____________________\n\n\n\n    ", "day": "16"}, {"url": "http://www.congress.gov/congressional-record/2015/06/16/house-section/article/H4428-1", "month": "06", "year": "2015", "originaltext": "\n        \n\n[Page H4428]\nFrom the Congressional Record Online through the Government Publishing Office [www.gpo.gov]\n\n\n\n\n REPORT ON RESOLUTION PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. 160, PROTECT \nMEDICAL INNOVATION ACT OF 2015, AND PROVIDING FOR CONSIDERATION OF H.R. \n        1190, PROTECTING SENIORS' ACCESS TO MEDICARE ACT OF 2015\n\n  Mr. BURGESS (during the Special Order of Mr. Garamendi) from the \nCommittee on Rules, submitted a privileged report (Rept.

Under the Speaker's \nannounced policy of January 6, 2015, the Chair recognizes the gentleman \nfrom Texas (Mr. Gohmert) for 30 minutes.\n  Mr. GOHMERT. Mr. Speaker, this week, there will be important \ndecisions made here on the House of Representatives' floor.\n  We are told, this month, the Supreme Court may well play God and \noverrule what has been considered to be the house of God, as given by \nMoses, for the dramatic amount of history, including up through the \nPresident's own statement that he believed marriage was just between a \nman and a woman.\n  When he was running for office, apparently, according to his campaign \nmanager or whatever he is--whatever he was--he felt he wouldn't get \nelected if he said what he really believed.\n  Nonetheless, in 6\\1/2\\ years, we are told things have changed to the \npoint we are now in a position to overrule what Moses said, which is \nthat a man will leave his father and mother and a woman leave her home \nand the two will come together. That would be marriage--Moses, who is \nthe only full-faced profile above us in the gallery, with the side \nprofiles of all of the great lawgivers, the greatest lawgivers as they \nwere thought to be years ago.\n  I will also note that, as I sat and listened to the Supreme Court's \nentertaining arguments on whether or not Texas could keep our monument \ndedicated to the Ten Commandments on our State campgrounds--and it was \njoined with a case from Kentucky on whether they could keep their Ten \nCommandments that were posted inside the door--and as they were arguing \nabout whether or not the Ten Commandments could be attributed in that \nmanner, I looked up on the marble wall to my right in the Supreme \nCourt's chambers, and there was Moses, looking down with both tablets \nof the Ten Commandments, looking down--interesting, very interesting. \nIt is the kind of mental gymnastics that have been played in the \nSupreme Court throughout its history.\n  We know Dred Scott was a dreadful decision, and there have been \nothers that were poor. Sometimes, in being human, they get them right, \nand sometimes, they get them wrong; but there is one thing that is \nvery, very, very clear, and it is in the United States Code. It is \nUnited States law.\n  It is volume 28 of the United States Code, section 455, and section \n(a) is very clear: ``Any justice, judge, or magistrate judge of the \nUnited States shall''--no room for question--``disqualify himself''--\nthat is generic, meaning mankind; it could be male or female--``in any \nproceeding in which his impartiality might reasonably be questioned.''\n  That is the law, and the only way that we can remain a nation that \nbelieves in the rule of law is if the courts that decide whether a law \ncan stand or must fall abide by the laws that apply to them. If the \nhighest court in the United States blatantly violates the law and \nespecially blatantly violates the law in deciding a case, then is it \nreally law that they have made if they have violated the law to create \nit?\n  In knowing that the law is very clear, a United States Supreme Court \nJustice ``shall disqualify him or herself in any proceeding in which \nhis impartiality might reasonably be questioned.'' Then we must look \nnext to see if there are any indications of partiality on the part of \nany of the Supreme Court Justices.\n  Here is an article that was published by foxnews.com back on \nSeptember 1, 2013, and it reads the following: ``Two months after the \nSupreme Court's landmark ruling to expand Federal recognition of same-\nsex marriages, striking down part of an anti-gay marriage law, Justice \nRuth Bader Ginsburg officiated at a same-sex wedding.\n  ``The officiating is believed to be a first for a member of the \nNation's highest court.\n  ``Ginsburg officiated Saturday at the marriage of Kennedy Center \nPresident Michael Kaiser and John Roberts, a government economist.''\n  I was just out at the Kennedy Center this weekend--it may be the only \nweekend; I am here in Washington all year--and was delighted to be \nthere. Apparently, if Michael Kaiser is still the president, he is \ndoing what appears to be an excellent job there.\n  Further down in the article, it is quoting Justice Ginsburg, and it \nreads: `` `I think it will be one more statement that people who love \neach other and want to live together should be able to enjoy the \nblessings and the strife in the marriage relationship,' Ginsburg told \nThe Washington Post in an interview.\n  `` `It won't be long before there will be another' performed by a \nJustice. She has another ceremony planned for September.''\n  The last line--it is not the last of the article--but it reads: \n``Justices generally avoid taking stands on political issues.''\n  The rest of the article goes on: ``While hearing arguments in the \ncase in March, Ginsburg argued for treating marriages equally. The \nrights associated with marriage are pervasive, she said.''\n  Anyway, it reads further down: ``Before the Court heard arguments on \nthe Defense of Marriage Act, Ginsburg told The New Yorker magazine in \nMarch that she had not performed a same-sex marriage and had not been \nasked. Justices do officiate at other weddings, though.\n  `` `I don't think anybody's asking us, because of these cases,' she \ntold the magazine. `No one in the gay rights movement wants to risk \nhaving any member of the Court be criticized or asked to recuse. So I \nthink that's the reason no one has asked me.'\n  ``Asked whether she would perform such a wedding in the future, she \nsaid, `Why not?' ''\n\n[[Page H4429]]\n\n  Apparently, the Associated Press also contributed to that report.\n  It doesn't sound as if it could be any more clear that Justice \nGinsburg has a very solid opinion that gay marriage, same-sex marriage, \nsame-sex weddings are constitutional, despite its being something that \nis reserved to the States and to the people under the 10th Amendment \nfor decisions.\n  On September 22 of 2014, in The Hill, written by Peter Sullivan, an \narticle reads: ``Supreme Court Justice Elena Kagan officiated a same-\nsex wedding on Sunday, a court spokeswoman told the Associated Press.\n  ``The ceremony in Maryland for a former law clerk is the first same-\nsex wedding that Kagan has performed. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and \nretired Justice Sandra Day O'Connor have both performed same-sex \nweddings in the past.\n  ``Gay marriage has been a divisive topic at the Supreme Court as it \nhas been elsewhere in the country.''\n  Further down, the article reads: ``The Court could decide as early as \nthis month whether to take up the issue again in the coming session, \nthis time to consider a more sweeping ruling declaring a right to same-\nsex marriage across the country.\n  ``Ginsburg said last week that, unless an appeals court allows a gay \nmarriage ban to stand, `there is no need for us to rush' on a Supreme \nCourt ruling.''\n  Clearly, Justice Kagan has made her feelings clear on same-sex \nmarriage. There could not be a more clear, unequivocal statement that \nany just judge or Justice could ever make on the issue of same-sex \nmarriage than to actually perform, officiate, in a same-sex wedding.\n  Here is a Newsmax article from May 18, 2015, by Greg Richter: \n``Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg sparked speculation on \nSunday when she mentioned the Constitution while officiating a same-sex \nwedding.''\n  Further down is a quote from Maureen Dowd, a columnist for The New \nYork Times: ``With a sly look and special emphasis on the word \n`Constitution,' Justice Ginsburg said that she was pronouncing the two \nmen married by the powers vested in her by the Constitution of the \nUnited States, Dowd wrote.''\n\n                              {time}  1915\n\n  Then it also says in the article, ``Nevertheless, guests applauded \nloudly, Dowd said, and Ginsburg `seemed delighted.' ''\n  For Justice Ginsburg to state publicly that the Constitution of the \nUnited States gives her the power to officiate and unite a same-sex \ncouple in marriage is an unequivocal, clear statement as to what she \nbelieves the Supreme Court should do in their decision. If there was \never any doubt--and there wasn't. Once she performed a same-sex \nwedding, there was no question about her feelings on the matter.\n  An article from National Review by Edward Whelan, February 19 of this \nyear, the article, just a small part of it here: ``At her Supreme Court \nconfirmation hearing in 1993, Ruth Bader Ginsburg repeatedly explained \nthat the judicial obligation of impartiality required that she give `no \nhints, no forecasts, no previews' about how she might `vote on \nquestions the Supreme Court may be called upon to decide.' ''\n  As she declared in her opening statement: ``A judge sworn to decide \nimpartially can offer no forecasts, no hints, for that would show not \nonly disregard for the specifics of the particular case, it would \ndisplay disdain for the entire judicial process.'' That was Ruth Bader \nGinsburg in 1993. Apparently, she sees things a great deal differently \nnow.\n  Further down in the article, Edward Whelan writes: ``Human nature \nbeing what it is, it's not easy for a Justice to recuse in a closely \ndivided case that she obviously cares passionately about. This is \nexactly the situation Justice Scalia faced a dozen years ago in the \nwake of his public comments criticizing a Ninth Circuit ruling against \nthe Pledge of Allegiance. As Slate's Dahlia Lithwick wrote at the time, \nScalia was `intellectually honest enough to know that he slipped,' and \nhe thus, `recused himself from what would have been one of the most \nimportant church-state cases of his career.' His recusal meant that \n`the Court may well split 4-4 on the case, in which case the Ninth \nCircuit's decision will stand for all the States in its jurisdiction.' \n''\n  We also have a quote from Justice Sonia Sotomayor: ``I suspect even \nwith us giving gay rights to marry, that there's some gay people who \nwill choose not to, just as there's some heterosexual couples who \nchoose not to marry. So we are not taking anybody's liberty away.''\n  Justice Sotomayor has obviously stated her position very clearly on \nthe issue of same-sex marriage.\n  This is an article from May 27, 2009, Lisa Keen from the Keen News \nService. She says in an article: ``Long-time gay legal activist Paula \nEttelbrick said she met Sotomayor in about 1991 when they both served \non then-New York Governor Mario Cuomo's Advisory Committee on Fighting \nBias. `Nobody wanted to talk to . . .' '' and uses a slur for a \nhomosexual `` `person at that time,' said Ettelbrick, who represented \nLambda Legal Defense and Education Fund. `She was the only one on the \nadvisory committee who made a point to come over and introduce herself. \nShe was totally interested in gay civil rights issues and supportive.' \n''\n  Evan Wolfson, head of the national Freedom to Marry organization \nsaid: ``From everything I know, Judge Sotomayor is an outstanding \nchoice, fair and aware, open, and judicious. I believe she has \ndemonstrated the commitment to principles of equal protection and \ninclusion that defines a good nominee to the Supreme Court.'' Wolfson \nsaid the President ``has made a strong and appealing nomination that \nshould and will receive the support of those committed to equality for \nlesbians and gay men.'' The National LGBT Bar Association issued a \nstatement saying it was pleased with the choice, noting that it \nrepresents ``more diversity on the bench.''\n  In view, actually, of her quote, it seems that she has clearly stated \nher position with regard to same-sex marriage. Anyway, the article \nfurther down said Kevin Cathcart, executive director of Lambda Legal \nDefense and Education Fund, said the organization was pleased that the \nnominee is a woman of color. ``While women, people of color, and self-\nidentified gay people continue to be woefully underrepresented in the \nFederal judiciary, Judge Sotomayor's nomination represents a step in \nthe right direction,'' Cathcart said.\n  So, anyway, if those quotes are accurate, then certainly they would \nbe supporting evidence of her quote that ``I suspect even with us \ngiving gay rights to marry . . .'' she is already stating in this quote \nthat she, not the Creator, not God, not almighty God, not the \nConstitution--``us giving,'' obviously the Supreme Court.\n  So, as Jefferson pointed out, you know, he trembles for the country \nwhen he realizes that God is just and his justice will not sleep \nforever. It is not the Supreme Court that gives rights. We get our \nrights, according to the Declaration of Independence, from our Creator, \nand they are embodied or supposed to have been embodied in the \nConstitution. And yes, it took a Civil War to ensure that the \nConstitution meant what it said, and it took an ordained Christian \nminister named King to push peacefully until such time as the \nConstitution was more thoroughly forced to mean what it said.\n  We are talking about marriage here. For anyone who is a Christian, \nthat means they believe in Jesus Christ, they believe His teachings, \nthey believe He is Savior, and they would have to believe when He \nquoted Moses, who said he was giving the law from God, and Jesus said: \nA man shall leave his father and mother, and a woman leave her home, \nand the two will become one flesh, and what God joined together, let no \none put asunder. He put His stamp: this is marriage. It approved what \nMoses said was marriage, and in this Nation, throughout the Nation, \nuntil some said we have become smarter than we have ever been, once \nagain defying Solomon's statement: There is nothing new under the Sun. \nThis is not new. We are not more enlightened than other civilizations \nhave been.\n  But if the Supreme Court in a majority decision destroys the \nconstitutions of numerous States across this Nation, and the majority \nopinion has Justices who are violating Federal statute regarding what a \njudge shall do, then it would appear that their law would be no more \nvalid than if someone here cast the deciding vote on legislation that \nbecomes law, and it is determined\n\n[[Page H4430]]\n\nthat the deciding vote was cast by someone who was not legally a Member \nof Congress. There would be reason to say that is not a valid law. It \ndid not pass the House of Representatives. And especially, if it turned \nout that, say, 20, 30, 40 percent of those casting the majority votes \non a bill were disqualified at the time of the vote from casting a \nvote, that would not be a legitimate law.\n  I hope, and since I believe in prayer, I pray that those Justices who \nhave made clear by their statements and their actions that they are \ndisqualified, will do the lawful thing and recuse themselves. If they \ndo not do that, they will be casting a ballot, casting a vote, and if \nthat vote is the majority decision, and if that decision overturns \nmassive law on marriage across the country, and by its statement says: \nWe know more than Moses, we know more than Jesus, we are the U.S. \nSupreme Court, it certainly sounds like they will have produced an \nunlawful decision of the Supreme Court.
